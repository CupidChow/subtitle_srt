1
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,040
Run!

2
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,420
Don't lose to that cloud!

3
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,340
Let's stop here.

4
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,380
There's no way ahead.

5
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,840
Yingtao, no more white geese.

6
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,340
Let's go back and play games.

7
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,680
I can fly over.

8
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,360
The book says

9
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,640
if you jump hard enough,

10
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,020
and far enough,

11
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,480
wings will grow on your back,

12
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,260
and then…

13
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,860
What are you two doing?

14
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,380
Lin Yingtao, go back now

15
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,280
or I won't let you copy my homework again.

16
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,660
My dad told me

17
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,080
that a real top student's

18
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,720
moving to our construction site soon.

19
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,900
Their family's getting

20
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,180
a unit right next to mine.

21
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,160
So if you cut me off,

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,240
I have other options.

23
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,240
Son, we'll arrive at Qunshan soon.

24
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,020
Stop drawing now.

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,440
Earlier you weren't feeling well
after eating on the way.

26
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,440
Get some rest.

27
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,080
There's an entrance exam when we arrive.

28
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,060
What's with the dirty coat?

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,040
If it's your favorite,

30
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,240
I can get you a new one.

31
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,100
Yingtao, slow down!

32
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,260
Stick. Find a stick.

33
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,280
A startled snake will bite.

34
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,380
That snake jumped

35
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,140
higher than me.

36
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,780
Exactly!

37
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,920
Lin Yingtao,
you really need to grow taller.

38
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,240
Even snakes can jump higher than you.

39
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,760
This is it.

40
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,140
I'm finished!

41
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,020
Yingtao!

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,320
I need to use my time wisely

43
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,440
and do something meaningful.

44
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,380
What meaning is there

45
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,080
in helping Cai Fangyuan steal the book?

46
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,340
Of course, it's meaningful.

47
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,020
That novel is mine.

48
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,260
Did you reach it yet?

49
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,520
I'm almost out of strength.

50
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,340
Hello.

51
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,380
Yingtao, where is my book?

52
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,880
- Run.
- Run.

53
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,440
- Mom.
- Hey.

54
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,120
What's wrong, Yingtao?

55
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,520
Mom.

56
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,400
What if…

57
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,800
What if someone

58
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,220
tries to take me away

59
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,220
to a place without you?

60
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,060
Who's trying to take you?

61
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,820
Tell me who you met.

62
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,400
I mean if.

63
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,720
Just like Rapunzel was taken

64
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,300
to another world by a witch.

65
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,500
You're safe.

66
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,340
No one can take you from us.

67
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,500
Juan!

68
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,000
Prepare two more dishes tonight.

69
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,700
- Manager Jiang's here.
- It smells so good.

70
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,480
- Sorry to barge in, Shengjuan.
- Look who's here.

71
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,960
- Manager Jiang.
- Little Yingtao.

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,960
Have you gain some weight?

73
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,660
Yingtao.

74
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,540
Say hello.

75
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,560
Manager Jiang.

76
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,960
Come on.

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,020
Drink.

78
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,900
Drink!
No.

79
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,040
- Fine.
- Drink slower.

80
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,200
It's okay.

81
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,500
Qiaoxi, you're eating.

82
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,060
Why're you wearing the backpack?

83
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,020
Take it off.

84
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,620
Qiaoxi,

85
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,100
could you take off your backpack?

86
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,060
What's wrong?

87
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,800
Inside his backpack

88
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,020
is a jacket his cousin

89
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,060
from Hong Kong bought him.

90
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,080
It got dirty on the trip here,

91
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,140
so I told him

92
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,280
to toss it,

93
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,380
but he wouldn't.

94
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,140
So he just stuffed it in his bag

95
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,020
and took it here.

96
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,340
It's alright, Qiaoxi.

97
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,060
How about Auntie washes it for you?

98
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,940
By tomorrow when it's dry,
you can wear it again.

99
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,380
Yingtao.

100
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,360
We're out of laundry detergent.

101
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,860
Can you help Mom

102
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,000
buy a pack

103
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,560
from Uncle Qin's shop?

104
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,320
- Uncle Qin, a pack of laundry detergent.
- Hey, Stella.

105
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,240
DAILY GOODS, GROCERIES & CIGARETTES,
CHILDREN'S TOYS, ICE CREAM & SODAS

106
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,840
My dad's out getting supplies.

107
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,300
Lin Yingtao,

108
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,640
I heard you cried over a snake today.

109
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,880
Fell on the ground face down a few times.

110
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,780
Laundry detergent.

111
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,160
Lin Yingtao, I stepped on your shadow.

112
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,240
I won!

113
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,220
I'm too lazy to bother with you.

114
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,980
Is that a surrender?

115
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,380
I met foes that make you look weak.

116
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,220
Can you handle him? How?

117
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,800
I can't.

118
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,720
You're just a bully who picks on the weak.

119
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,700
You don't understand.

120
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,340
He's on another level.

121
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,160
Who cares?

122
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,720
"Enemies aren't for fearing.

123
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,120
They're for fighting."

124
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,540
Your words.

125
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,280
Qin Yeyun. Look over there.

126
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,920
I stepped on your shadow too.

127
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,200
No way I'm losing to you.

128
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,320
Lin Yingtao!

129
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,120
Have a seat.

130
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,680
Want some candies?

131
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,840
Or do you want to
listen to some cassettes?

132
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,180
Give me one cup of Oblivion's brew.

133
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,040
Mickey Mouse. Care to read it?

134
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,420
Everyone loves to read Mickey Mouse.

135
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,580
Chunlu.

136
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,480
For now, just stay
in this little nest of yours.

137
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,159
No wandering off.

138
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,400
Mom's to keep you safe.

139
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,980
Chunlu!

140
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,080
Chunlu.

141
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,360
Let me show you.

142
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,480
Hold it like this first,

143
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,440
then…

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,920
pet it…

145
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,420
this way.

146
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,020
Have you found that Qiaoxi

147
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,200
is different from

148
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,460
other children?

149
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,420
Of course.

150
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,440
He is a boy genius on math.

151
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,340
Sure he is different.

152
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,960
I think

153
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,420
he never really moved on
from what happened to his family

154
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,040
decades ago.

155
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,020
Listen, Juan,

156
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,820
let's not bring up

157
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,860
what others avoid discussing.

158
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,800
Manager Jiang has enough on his plate.

159
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,720
We should show this child more compassion.

160
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,600
Okay.

161
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,740
Come on, enough already!

162
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,940
A kid

163
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,060
ate something bad and threw up.

164
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,420
That's normal, right?

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,180
He's fine now.

166
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,580
We ate dinner over

167
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,360
at Electrician Lin's,

168
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,280
even played for a bit afterwards.

169
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,620
Alright. Spare me the drama.

170
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,920
Yingtao.

171
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,520
Is that new student next door really

172
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,740
as hardcore as they say?

173
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,100
My dad said that he went to your home,

174
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,040
still grinding homework past midnight.

175
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,120
There's something

176
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,480
I need to come clean about.

177
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,040
What?

178
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,640
That new student,

179
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,420
you must treat him well.

180
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,000
Make sure he feels how friendly

181
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,380
we are at Qunshan Elementary,

182
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,720
and how kind Qunshan people can be.

183
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,600
QUNSHAN POWER PLANT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

184
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,880
Lin Yingtao, are you serious?

185
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,180
It's his first day,

186
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,140
not a royal visit.

187
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,620
You don't understand.

188
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,500
if he leaves, I leave too.

189
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,380
Where?

190
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,620
Son, the principal

191
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,080
has finally agreed to let you

192
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,480
enroll first and take the test later.

193
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,500
You have to take it seriously,

194
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,580
no more acting out

195
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,660
when the time comes.

196
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,200
Two tiger moms,

197
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,700
two tiger moms,

198
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,780
Fighting hard,

199
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,920
fighting hard!

200
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,940
One lost her ears,

201
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,960
one lost her tail,

202
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,820
- How bizarre!
- Are you idiot?

203
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,700
You beat me first!

204
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,740
What's this?

205
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,060
Who's causing chaos?

206
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,820
Lin Qile, stop messing around!

207
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,960
Class has begun! Back to your seat!

208
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,940
They even renamed you as "Qile",

209
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,380
why can't you bring some joy?

210
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,900
First day of school…

211
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,540
This whole area is staff housing,

212
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,680
ours included.

213
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,540
Du Shang lives here too, in the

214
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,400
single-occupancy dorm with his mom.

215
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,380
His dad got transferred

216
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,180
to the Pucheng construction site.

217
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,320
Every time Uncle Du comes back,

218
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,500
Du Shang gets moody for days.

219
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,520
Probably upset Uncle Du
never brings gifts.

220
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,160
That's Qin Yeyun's place.

221
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,940
She's the person I hate most
in the whole world.

222
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,180
She's got that clap-strike palm,
hits like a truck.

223
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,800
But she's so pretty.

224
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,660
Yu Qiao says we're
"two sides of the same coin".

225
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,060
She's the bad side.

226
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,060
I'm the shiny one.

227
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,920
She lives with her dad.

228
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,440
Ever seen him?

229
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,220
Uncle Qin, who runs the kiosk.

230
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,060
He got work injuries years ago,

231
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,740
leaving him inconvenience of only one leg.

232
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,580
Cai Fangyuan's dad let him

233
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,720
take over the worksite concession stand.

234
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,520
Uncle Qin is amazing.

235
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,400
He does qigong every day to heal his leg.

236
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,100
This is Yu Qiao's place,

237
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,180
your deskmate.

238
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,420
Sick dunk! That was legit!

239
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,180
He lives with his dad,

240
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,900
mom, grandma,

241
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,000
and his little cousin Yu Jin.

242
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,480
Yu Jin's mother fell ill,

243
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,840
so she sent him to stay with them.

244
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,940
Truth is, the Yu family's place
is already packed,

245
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,520
no room to spare.

246
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,560
But Uncle Yu is a Model Worker,

247
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,280
the site's most respected veteran.

248
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,680
He'd never say no to anyone.

249
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,080
Next door to Yu Qiao's place
lives Cai Fangyuan,

250
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,100
with his mom and dad.

251
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,220
He's all about good food,

252
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,680
fun games, and cool stuff.

253
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,640
Auntie Kang's a killer cook,

254
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,680
while Uncle Cai's a stock market whiz.

255
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,240
They hope he can study hard,

256
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,680
crack a top-tier university.

257
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,700
BRUTE MOTO

258
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,940
There's a bird's nest
up that big locust tree.

259
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,300
Two years ago, a baby bird fell from it.

260
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,200
I took it home,

261
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,360
and my dad actually

262
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,700
nursed it back to life.

263
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,040
Well,

264
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,440
the tree blooms with sweet white flowers
in spring.

265
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,480
Mom used to make the best
steamed rice with them.

266
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,180
The field in the west
still grows so many dandelions,

267
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,300
but I've never liked them.

268
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,500
They scatter easily.

269
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
They say

270
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,500
when someone goes to the other side,

271
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,120
they forget everything from this life.

272
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,200
I don't want to forget them,

273
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,460
forget anything about Qunshan.

274
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,480
Will you remember it all for me?

275
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,160
If I forget,

276
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,360
then you tell me.

277
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,680
Doesn't remembering

278
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,560
hurt even more?

279
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,880
I'm not scared of pain.

280
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,820
I don't even cry getting an injection.

281
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,940
I just…

282
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,620
I don't know if Mom and Dad

283
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,040
will still love me after I die.

284
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,100
Yes.

285
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,200
They'll remember you always.

286
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,840
And keep loving only you.

287
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,240
How do you konw?

288
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,560
The dead

289
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,600
will always be loved.

290
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,420
You changed your mind?

291
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,040
You don't take me away?

292
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,260
I'm not who you think I am.

293
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,160
I can't take you with me.

294
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,960
What about you?

295
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,340
Are you leaving?

296
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,880
I'll leave one day.

297
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,900
I love my friends so much.

298
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,400
Lately, even Qin Yeyun is kinda cute.

299
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,000
If it's possible,

300
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,220
maybe one day,

301
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,560
we could've been close.

302
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,960
I really hope

303
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,960
I could stay at
Power Plant Elementary forever.

304
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,000
Unfortunately,

305
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,440
I'm going to die soon.

306
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,300
Yingtao.

307
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,520
Give them all away?

308
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,920
Even your favorites, just let them go?

309
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,800
But this? No, this stays.

310
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,119
My god.

311
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,000
Qiaoxi,

312
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,839
do you know what's happened?

313
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,660
She left it all behind.

314
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,940
QUNSHAN POWER PLANT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

315
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,920
Lin Yingtao!

316
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,400
Miss Zhang.

317
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,620
Yingtao's mom.

318
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,540
Look at what Yingtao wrote.
What does this mean?

319
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,100
- Where is she?
- In the house.

320
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,140
Miss Zhang.

321
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,160
- Lin Qile.
- Miss Zhang.

322
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,220
Are you okay?

323
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,820
- What's wrong?
- Yingtao.

324
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,260
What's wrong with you?

325
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,100
Why would you write
that you're going to die soon?

326
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,600
I'm really dying.

327
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,340
What happened?

328
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,280
Don't cry, just talk to me.

329
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,280
Take your time.

330
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,180
Everyone says

331
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,920
if you meet a snake

332
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,980
that stands up to compare heights,

333
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,420
you must run.

334
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,800
Because

335
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,820
if you lose,

336
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,500
you'll die.

337
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,080
And I lost.

338
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,140
That snake reared so high,

339
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,300
it towered over me.

340
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,640
You little girl, you scared me to death.

341
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,340
Miss Zhang, I'm telling the truth.

342
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,020
If you don't believe me,
ask Cai Fangyuan and the others.

343
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,340
They saw it too.

344
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,440
So Cai Fangyuan was the one

345
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,620
who told you about the "death game"?

346
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,700
No.

347
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,140
Cai Fangyuan's way too dumb.

348
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,400
It was Brother Chen Minghao who told me.

349
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,980
That Chen Minghao used to

350
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,380
live next door,
where Qiaoxi's family is now.

351
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,960
But after he got into a middle school
in the provincial capital,

352
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
they moved away.

353
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,880
Look at you,

354
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
you silly little thing.

355
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
Yingtao.

356
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,440
Do you trust Teacher?

357
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,320
Our dear Lin Qile is
absolutely not going to die.

358
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,300
This whole "measuring heights" thing is

359
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,500
total nonsense. I promise.

360
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,900
All right.

361
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,480
It's okay.

362
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,840
The teacher said

363
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,840
we need to resubmit
the transfer application.

364
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,840
Wasn't this already signed before?

365
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,060
September 30th is not my birthday.

366
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,500
I'll rewrite it.

367
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,840
TRANSFER APPLICATION

368
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,980
Hello.

369
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,840
I'm sending Qiaoxi to school.

370
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,880
TRANSFER APPLICATION
DATE OF BIRTH JANUARY 26TH

371
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,420
Okay, then I know.

372
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,300
Your mom called.

373
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,240
She said she's coming over this afternoon

374
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,400
to have dinner with you.

375
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,420
I'll pick you up after school.

376
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,380
Son, good luck

377
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,260
on your entrance exam!

378
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,140
- Go on now.
- Bye.

379
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,200
Lin Yingtao.

380
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,320
now that you know you're not gonna die,

381
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,740
why are you still
helping Cai Fangyuan steal the book?

382
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,640
This hardly counts as self-sacrifice.

383
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,560
Yingtao's helping me steal the book

384
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,360
out of pure loyalty to friends.

385
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,580
Death has nothing to do with it.

386
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,480
Charge forth, Yingtao,

387
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,720
my heroine.

388
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,360
Charge forth, heroine.

389
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,820
So you gave the new one a grand tour
of the Qunshan worksite yesterday?

390
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,140
Thought you were all
about "being nice to him"?

391
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,760
Thought you'd follow him anywhere?

392
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,320
How's that warm welcome
working out for you?

393
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,720
Yu Qiao, you're being so rude.

394
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,380
He's actually really nice.

395
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,520
It hurts. Be gentle.

396
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,080
- Don't move. If it hurts, tough it out.
- Qing Yeyun.

397
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,300
Are you getting revenge right now?

398
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,700
I paid you ten comic books for this.

399
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,640
If Mom weren't on duty today,

400
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,080
I'd never let you touch my hair.

401
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,340
This is highway robbery.

402
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:58,460
UNITY, CIVILITY, DILIGENCE, INNOVATION

403
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,220
This essay topic's easy.

404
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,980
My original name was Lin Yingtao

405
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,160
because Mom craved cherries
when she was pregnant with me.

406
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,900
But when I started school,

407
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,320
they said names should be meaningful,

408
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,580
not just simple,

409
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,400
so now I'm Lin Qile.

410
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,600
Thank goodness what your mom craved

411
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,380
was not garlic or sweet potatoes.

412
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,680
Or you'd be Lin Sweetpotato or Lin Garlic.

413
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,320
Lin Yingtao's crazy again.

414
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,940
The Qiao in my name means Woodsman.

415
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,920
Dad named me after characters
from Jin Yong's novels.

416
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,240
My "Fangyuan",

417
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Square Fang, Dollar Yuan.

418
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,040
I'm gonna print money with this name.

419
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,460
There's an artist called Duchamp.

420
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,320
Mom figured since
we share the surname "Du",

421
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,700
why not name me "Du Shang" too?

422
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,400
Jiang Qiaoxi.

423
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,320
What's your name supposed to mean?

424
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,660
Nothing special.

425
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,080
Your name is this cool,

426
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,160
and it doesn't mean anything?

427
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,960
It really doesn't mean anything.

428
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,920
- Here.
- Clear a spot.

429
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,260
Shengjuan, stop busying yourself.

430
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,180
There are already enough dishes.

431
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,560
It's okay. Here.

432
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,840
Alright then. You know,

433
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,400
I was originally going
to entrust Qiaoxi to your family,

434
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,500
but now I'm entrusting

435
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,100
myself to your family as well.

436
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,840
Manager Jiang, help yourself.

437
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,220
Just some simple dishes.

438
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,940
"Just some simple dishes"?
This is a feast.

439
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,480
But Juan's cooking is good.

440
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,700
- Absolutely delicious!
- Delicious.

441
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,080
This beats restaurant food.

442
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,100
Uncle Jiang,

443
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,300
what does "Qiaoxi"
in Jiang Qiaoxi's name mean?

444
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,400
You've really stumped me.

445
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,320
I actually don't know

446
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,020
what does "Qiaoxi" mean.

447
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,400
When Hongfei and I had him,

448
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,520
we weren't mentally prepared.

449
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,140
Then came

450
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,180
the birth certificate.

451
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,700
- We had to pick a name.
- Right.

452
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,080
I was sweating bullets

453
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,260
until I spotted

454
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,240
a line of poetry

455
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,220
in the newspaper

456
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,320
"Gates and homes glow
at the west of Jiangqiao's crest."

457
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,740
So "Jiang Qiaoxi" it was.

458
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,540
Just one of those coincidences.

459
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,420
You were right.

460
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,460
It doesn't mean anything special.

461
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,780
Now this essay's gonna be a pain to write.

462
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,860
- Just some simple home cooking.
- Sure.

463
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,760
Thanks.

464
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,580
Want a Coke?

465
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,940
Or maybe a Jianlibao?

466
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,780
How about peanut milk?

467
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,280
That's my favorite. So good.

468
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,560
Don't you need to study?

469
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,760
Do you want to hug Chunlu?

470
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,380
I heard that

471
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,840
the child of Manager Jiang
who passed away was named Jiang Mengchu.

472
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,020
When he was named,

473
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,800
they spent two or three months
thinking about it.

474
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,640
He got into the GATE Program
from Chinese Academy of Sciences at 13.

475
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,580
Everyone called him a prodigy.

476
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,340
But aren't all children
flesh of your flesh?

477
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,300
How could they favor one so blatantly?

478
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,680
After they lost their first child

479
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,080
and nearly divorced,

480
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,100
the higher-ups said they should

481
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,700
try for another.

482
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,240
The idea was that

483
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,280
a new baby

484
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,300
might bring hope,

485
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,360
maybe even patch up their marriage.

486
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,220
Seemed like a good plan.

487
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,220
The kid's nine now,

488
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,660
turning out so well.

489
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,100
How can both of them just not care?

490
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,120
Too busy, obviously.

491
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,680
How many times have we seen his mom?

492
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,680
GRAND CHINESE DICTIONARY

493
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,640
QIAO

494
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,600
Bunny dear, be good

495
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,400
and open the door. I'd like to go in.

496
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,740
You silly thing!

497
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,480
Why'd you listen so literally?

498
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,740
What if I'm a bad guy?

499
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,940
I have to do my homework.

500
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,460
Who needs homework anyway?

501
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,860
I'm taking you somewhere.

502
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,320
Sorry, it's raining. My bad.

503
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,960
I should check beforehand.

504
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,280
Lin Yingtao.

505
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,000
What's in your mind?

506
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,880
Qiáo,

507
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,780
in Grand Chinese Dictionary

508
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,900
page 795,

509
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,180
the 20th character in list.

510
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,080
Radical mountain
with nine strokes in total.

511
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,280
A polyphonic character. When read as Jiào,

512
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,860
it means "mountain path".

513
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,580
As Qiáo, "a peak, high and sharp".

514
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,040
Qiaoxi. Here, west of the highest,

515
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,240
sharpest summit in the Qunshan range.

516
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,560
I once saw the most
breathtaking sunset clouds here.

517
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,600
Crimson, blazing, glorious.

518
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,740
I think that's what your name was meant.

519
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,900
But now…

520
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,640
Now it rains.

521
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,320
And nothing can be seen.

522
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,440
Then tell me the most beautiful sunset

523
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,040
you have ever seen here.

524
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,920
Then I'll tell you.

525
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,140
That sunset burned like wildfire.

526
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,980
Its shapes and hues morphing so wildly.

527
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,480
I could never guess what it would

528
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,020
look like in the next minute.

529
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,620
Did it ever look like a rabbit?

530
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,060
Yes.

531
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,580
There was a rabbit
right beside the sun, running,

532
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,240
with amber clutched in its paws.

533
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,160
Did you see it too?

534
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,660
You are right.

535
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,960
There is indeed a rabbit running.

536
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,840
I didn't lie to you, did I?

537
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,840
I told you "Jiang Qiaoxi" is perfect,

538
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,880
meaningful and lovely to say.

539
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,620
Jiang Qiaoxi!

540
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,260
You see, every time
I call out Jiang Qiaoxi,

541
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,700
I will laugh.

542
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:15,260
Jiang Qiaoxi!

543
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,100
Jiang Qiaoxi!

544
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,820
Bro, Sis-in-law, let me show you this.

545
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,300
See these test reports?

546
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,540
The key point is:

547
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,560
it's completely non-toxic.

548
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,380
With our little Yingtao being so young,

549
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,380
eating all those

550
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,060
veggies and fruits,

551
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,420
pesticides would be disastrous.

552
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,800
Absolutely disastrous.

553
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,840
I kinda forgot the rest,

554
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,080
but they swear this stuff is drinkable.

555
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,020
I'll chug half the bottle myself.
It's safe.

556
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,280
I have confidence.

557
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,940
- No need.
- It's okay.

558
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,980
- It's okay.
- Don't spill it.

559
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,420
Wang Yu, don't drink it.

560
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,760
It's not only non-toxic and harmless,

561
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,720
- but also has a good cleaning…
- Uncle Wang.

562
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,780
- Yingtao, you're back.
- Yingtao's back.

563
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,020
Uncle Wang, where have you been?

564
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,340
When you're gone, no one plays
"The Cow on the High Mountain" with me.

565
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,700
Then let's play. Come on.

566
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,180
On the high mountain stands a cow,

567
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,820
Two curved horns upon its brow,

568
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,340
Four hooves split eight ways neat,

569
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,920
Tail out back, what a feat!

570
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,080
Out back!

571
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,180
Out back!

572
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,100
Yingtao.

573
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,160
Stop pestering your uncle.

574
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
Go wash your hands and eat.

575
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,880
Go, Yingtao.

576
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,380
Uncle,

577
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,440
are you having dinner here today?

578
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,080
I'll eat faster than you this time.

579
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,580
Of course.

580
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,480
Your uncle will have dinner with us.

581
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,620
Food's ready.

582
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,300
Brother, Sis-in-law, I won't eat here.

583
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,200
I have a lot of things to do.
I'm very busy.

584
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,820
Wang Yu.

585
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,400
- Wang Yu, we'll grab three bottles.
- Shall we eat?

586
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,520
- I think it's good.
- Come.

587
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,660
We'll give it a try.

588
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,740
Well…

589
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,760
Well…

590
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,920
Stay for lunch.

591
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,100
Let's eat together.

592
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,500
This can be engraved with patterns.

593
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,160
Where is Du Shang?

594
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,820
We literally agreed

595
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,400
to go up the mountain together,
early birthday for Qiaoxi,

596
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,480
gifts ready.

597
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,020
Is Du Shang's surprise
just not showing up?

598
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,880
Cao Shuangyan,
what the hell is your problem?

599
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,840
How could you do this?

600
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,920
I've been breaking my back out there,

601
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,340
finally come home.

602
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,740
- The pork trotters won't even soften!
- Stop!

603
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,120
You just don't want me back.

604
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,840
- Right?
- Don't do this!

605
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,940
It's because the gas tank is empty.

606
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,840
Why does this always happen
when you come back?

607
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,700
The gas tank's empty.

608
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,280
Her brain is empty too?
Why not replace it?

609
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,200
- Can you calm down?
- Dad.

610
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,160
Dad, please stop hitting Mom.

611
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,440
She's bleeding.

612
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,540
You're still taking her side?

613
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,080
Do you know who puts food on this table?

614
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,040
You father, me!

615
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,160
Get out of my face!

616
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,360
What are you doing?

617
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,480
Du Yongchun!

618
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,200
- What are you doing?
- Did you teach him to say that?

619
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,120
What are you doing?

620
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,420
- I will beat you…
- Stop!

621
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,340
- Hey stop!
- Stop!

622
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,200
- Get off!
- Mom!

623
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,360
Your medical expenses

624
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,240
will be deducted from his bonus.

625
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,300
Don't worry.

626
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,600
Du Yongchun,
you'd better explain yourself.

627
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,700
Why did you hit your wife?

628
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,360
How did she deserve that?

629
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,120
Manager Jiang, I drank too much.

630
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,620
QUNSHAN NO.2 HOSPITAL

631
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,500
Here's what we'll do.

632
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,940
Divide Du Yongchun's wages
in three portions.

633
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,400
Two portions sent home to his family,

634
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,400
one kept for himself.

635
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,460
And notify the worksite foreman,

636
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,920
tell him I authorized this.

637
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,900
Good, settled.

638
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,240
Qiaoxi.

639
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:04,980
Come here.

640
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,720
Your birthday's coming up.

641
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,620
Daddy got you a present.

642
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,220
Do you like it?

643
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,780
Black again.

644
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,860
Mom chose it,

645
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,840
or you?

646
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,480
Your mom and I decided together.

647
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,760
Black suits you.

648
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,640
It's a classic look

649
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,240
for a young man.

650
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,280
Qiaoxi.

651
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,300
Dad's swamped with work lately,

652
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,520
so I can't take you there.

653
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,800
The day after tomorrow,
Mom will pick you up.

654
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,320
Happy birthday to you

655
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,179
Happy birthday to you

656
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,760
Happy birthday to you

657
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,120
Happy birthday to you

658
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,520
Jiang Qiaoxi.

659
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,520
Happy birthday to you.

660
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:32,699
I started collecting these flowers
before winter came.

661
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,460
Mom helped me dry them,

662
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,880
preserved forever,

663
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,880
never to wilt.

664
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,639
But since you love black,

665
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,080
and I've never seen
black flowers in Qunshan.

666
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,239
I dyed them with ink.

667
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,940
Do you think

668
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,100
black looks good?

669
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:50,380
We don't really like so much black.

670
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,020
But you wear black every day.

671
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,699
Your pencil case, pen, water bottle,

672
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,780
even your eraser all black.

673
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,600
We've never seen

674
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,700
so much black

675
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,140
on one person before.

676
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,740
But Lin Yingtao said,

677
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,380
if you like someone,

678
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,600
you should accept them

679
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,240
just as they are.

680
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,560
I don't mean that kind of likes.

681
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,960
Which kind of likes?

682
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,460
You…

683
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,200
I like it.

684
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,960
Then you can make a statement.

685
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,340
Thank you all.

686
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,860
SMILE, GOOD

687
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,580
Jiang Qiaoxi, make a wish.

688
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,500
Jiang Qiaoxi.

689
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,220
Happy birthday to you.

690
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,740
Du Shang, you're just in time.

691
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,040
We're at the wishing part.

692
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,060
Hurry up.

693
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,140
We've been waiting for you.

694
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,620
It wouldn't be the same without you.

695
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,960
Jiang Qiaoxi.

696
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,880
Happy birthday to you.

697
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,620
Du Shang.

698
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,560
I want to give you

699
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,260
this wish.

700
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,980
Please make a wish.

701
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,600
Quickly.

702
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,040
Jiang Qiaoxi,

703
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,620
never forget

704
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,640
this is your home.

705
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,980
You must come back to us soon.

706
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,220
Yingtao.

707
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,700
Thanks.

708
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,760
Don't thank me.
You're pretty great.

709
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,600
You even gave your birthday wish
to Du Shang.

710
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,220
Who does that?

711
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,840
Anyway, my wish

712
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,920
never came true.

713
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,460
What's your wish?
I'll help you realize it.

714
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,340
Actually…

715
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,400
I don't like black,

716
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,300
but I like the gifts you gave me.

717
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,920
Today,

718
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,280
I like black for the first time.

719
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,240
You don't like black,

720
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,740
then why are all

721
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,140
your clothes, your things black?

722
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,420
The one who likes black

723
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,400
is my brother.

724
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,980
These are the things they bought for me.

725
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,160
They controls and makes me like the color.

726
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,040
I can only like black.

727
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,040
They won't love me for who I am.

728
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,900
So what color do you like?

729
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,960
I didn't think about it,

730
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,320
but

731
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,920
I start to like black.

732
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,800
What else? You can think of something else

733
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,080
and then you will like it.

734
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,600
Red.

735
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,900
I like red.

736
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,040
Jiang Qiaoxi.

737
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,720
When it comes to my birthday,

738
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,600
I'll make a wish for you.

739
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,640
I wish your parents
will love you just the way you are,

740
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,720
okay?

741
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,480
What about you?

742
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,960
What is your wish?

743
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,040
My wish is

744
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,740
that we all stay together

745
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,540
and never leave.

746
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,320
Then keep your wish.

747
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,680
That is more important

748
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,340
to me.

749
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,020
GO TO WORK HAPPILY, RETURN HOME SAFELY.

750
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,740
Qiaoxi, could you get the door?

751
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,340
Yingtao, you're here.

752
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,020
Uncle Jiang,

753
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,060
I bought some fresh shrimp baozi,
would you like some?

754
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,160
Yes.

755
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,000
No.

756
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,680
You can take it back and eat it yourself.

757
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,820
Thank you.

758
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,080
Yingtao, bring it in. Come in.

759
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,400
Bring it in for you to eat?

760
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,720
Who knows what kind of meat
they put in street baozi?

761
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,120
Thank you,

762
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,260
little girl,

763
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,140
but we don't eat street food.

764
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,780
Qiaoxi, close the door.

765
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,620
You're letting the cold air in.

766
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,740
Don't let Yingtao know about this.

767
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,820
Tell her after school starts.

768
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,600
Maybe after not seeing each other
all winter break,

769
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,880
hearing the news will hurt a little less.

770
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,560
It may not be better

771
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,260
after the winter break.

772
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,240
What do you suggest we do then?

773
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,240
This kid

774
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,440
was transferred here and there, on a whim.

775
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,560
Dad, Mom,

776
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,860
who are you saying is transferring away?

777
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,020
It's not Jiang Qiaoxi, right?

778
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,840
He promised he'd come back
after winter break.

779
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,660
He's not a liar.

780
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,240
I'm going to ask him myself.

781
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,320
He promised he'd return after break.

782
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,240
Why would he lie to me?

783
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,620
Yingtao, Aunt Liang has settled

784
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,100
her work matters now.

785
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,100
She just wants to focus on raising Qiaoxi

786
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,040
properly in the provincial capital.

787
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,440
Well…

788
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,000
Then next time…

789
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,760
- Take care.
- Sure.

790
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,880
Next time.

791
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,140
Uncle Wang!

792
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:31,940
Yingtao.

793
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,380
Study hard.

794
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,600
I mean

795
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,080
grow up to be anything but me.

796
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,480
- Jiang Qiaoxi!
- Jiang Qiaoxi!

797
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,840
Jiang Qiaoxi!

798
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,140
Jiang Qiaoxi!

799
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,880
Jiang Qiaoxi!

800
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,480
Jiang Qiaoxi, write to me.

801
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,020
You must write to me.

802
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,560
Yingtao!

803
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,720
I'll be back after winter break!

804
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,140
Yingtao!

805
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,040
I'll be back after winter break!

806
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,540
I know.

807
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,440
No matter how brave I am,

808
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,480
I'll never grow wings.

809
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,900
Dad says

810
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,420
living is like

811
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,000
being a silkworm,

812
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,380
a snake, or a crab.

813
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,020
When the time comes,

814
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,060
you must step out of the old shell.

815
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,500
Only by forgetting certain things

816
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,480
and moving on,

817
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,760
you can travel light

818
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,620
and live better.

819
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,320
