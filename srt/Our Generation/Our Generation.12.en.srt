EPISODE 12

3
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,200
JIALIN EXPERIMENTAL HIGH SCHOOL

4
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,600
<i>Thanks, Ms. Bye.</i>

5
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,540
Congrats, Lin Yingtao.

6
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,500
You used to be the last one
out of detention.

7
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,500
Today, you are second to last.

8
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,720
That's real progress.

9
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,460
You're improving so fast,
I'm getting nervous.

10
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,560
If next time you beat me out the door,

11
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,800
does that mean I'm slipping?

12
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,780
Use those big eyes of yours, will you?

13
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,460
Didn't you see it
when I handed in my paper?

14
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,020
I didn't hand it in late.

15
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,820
I was asking the teacher questions.

16
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,900
What's with the face?

17
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,180
What,

18
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,420
physics finally make sense now?

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,300
Jiang Qiaoxi taught me a trick.

20
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,500
He said,

21
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,400
if you don't know the answer,

22
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,700
ask yourself why the question
was asked that way.

23
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,260
So I tried that, and suddenly,

24
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,780
every physics question
felt like a universal one.

25
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,640
Lin Yingtao,

26
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,980
sounds like you just unlocked
your inner genius.

27
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,460
Even I'm a little shocked.

28
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,800
Not to mention Cai Fangyuan,
you might outgrow me soon.

29
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,000
Are you joining the Physics Olympiad?

30
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,960
Into the prodigy club?

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,120
Let's not go that far.

32
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,460
She's already 17. Missed the cutoff years
for being a prodigy.

33
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,460
Don't let it get to you, Yingtao.

34
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,660
Enough from you two.

35
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,840
You never say anything nice.

36
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,300
Come on,

37
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,740
today is a big day for Qunshan Squard.

38
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,360
Wonder if Qin Yeyun and Du Shang

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,500
got the fireworks.

40
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,700
<i>Careful.</i>

41
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,840
- I got this, Dad.
<i>- Yun,</i>

42
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,900
careful behind you.

43
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,620
Shuangyan,

44
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,360
this is serious now.

45
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,480
They're serious about it.

46
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,660
Listen to me. I've thought about it.

47
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,720
You being here

48
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,600
really helps me out.

49
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,560
- Qin…
- Yun and Du Shang

50
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,020
already talked.

51
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,100
Du Shang thinks

52
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,120
it's a good idea.

53
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,080
Du Shang is a good kid.

54
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,900
He doesn't want his mom
outside in the cold,

55
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,400
getting chased off by the city patrol.

56
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,660
You can stay here.

57
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,920
Set up stall and do your thing.

58
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,080
Qin, how about this?

59
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,300
I'll give you twenty percent

60
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,120
of what I make on skewers as stall rent.

61
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,280
- It that okay?
- No.

62
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,120
A proper storefront goes for way more.

63
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,960
Twenty percent is very low.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,140
I'm already getting a bargain.

65
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,440
Tell you what,

66
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,060
let's treat this

67
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,280
like a probation period.

68
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,040
Set up your stall here, try it out.

69
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,040
See how it goes after a month.

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,060
We'll talk after that.

71
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,600
Alright.

72
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,860
Yun, Du Shang,

73
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,440
should we treat ourselves

74
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,540
and go out to eat tonight?

75
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,560
Celebrate our grand collaboration.

76
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,680
Why go out and spend money?

77
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,899
We can eat at home. I'll cook.

78
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,880
Mom, we are heading to the beach later.
Rain check?

79
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,560
Looks like we'll be getting

80
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,100
more of Auntie Shuangyan's cooking.

81
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,940
That sour-and-spicy fern noodles dish

82
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,480
you made last time? So good.

83
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,660
Can we have that tomorrow?

84
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,820
You got it.

85
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,000
Qin Yeyun,

86
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,320
from now on,

87
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,660
you get top pick on the menu.

88
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,300
Let go.

89
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,880
Pack of Chunghwa, Qin.

90
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,880
And a Want Want gift snack box too.

91
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,500
Don't just stand there.

92
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,100
Make it a soft pack.

93
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,980
Keep the change.

94
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,940
Shuangyan.

95
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,640
Son.

96
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,900
- Cao Shuangyan, what is this?
- Stop!

97
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,040
How could you do this?

98
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,240
I work my butt off out there,
barely get to come home.

99
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,760
- You couldn't cook some trotters?
- Enough.

100
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,140
You don't want me here, do you?

101
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,940
You just don't want me back.

102
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,640
Mom!

103
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,240
Hey, Yingtao?

104
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,200
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>

105
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,980
<i>We'll have to cancel</i>

106
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,860
<i>tonight's plan.</i>

107
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,500
Anything?

108
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,860
- Nothing.
- No sound.

109
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,840
Du Shang!

110
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,900
- Du Shang!
- Open the door!

111
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,420
Come on, Du Shang! Hurry up!

112
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,700
- Du Shang!
- Who is it?

113
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,520
These kids…

114
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,420
What's up, Yingtao?

115
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,900
We're looking for Du Shang.

116
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,980
- Coming!
- He…

117
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,520
Yingtao. You made it, guys.

118
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,400
Is everything okay?

119
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,580
Yeah.

120
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,060
I was just cooking with my dad.

121
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,520
Son.

122
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,440
Yingtao. Perfect timing.

123
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,380
You're all here. Auntie Cao and I,

124
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,720
we made a whole spread.

125
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,440
You haven't eaten yet? Come on in.

126
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,740
We're good, really.

127
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,900
- Actually,
- We're good.

128
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,120
we already ate.

129
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,720
Don't be shy, kids.

130
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,340
Fine.

131
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,500
Uncle Du looks different now.

132
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,180
His temper seems changed.

133
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,220
Looks like it.

134
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,280
Then maybe

135
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,160
Du Shang won't get beaten up anymore.

136
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,060
Wait a second.

137
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,400
- Are you okay? You sure?
- I'm fine.

138
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,080
The fireworks are ready.
You can head to the beach.

139
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,940
It's fine.

140
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,420
Let's do it another time.

141
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,520
Have dinner with your parents tonight.

142
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,440
You're going to that winter camp, right?

143
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,320
It'll be even colder after that.
Not a good time.

144
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,300
This is not the only winter
we will ever get.

145
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,400
Besides,

146
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,820
I got more than just fireworks.

147
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,420
Go. Go on.

148
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,800
- Alright. I'm off.
- We will rearrange.

149
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,820
You little rat.

150
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,320
- Bye.
- Bye.

151
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,820
Alright, stop worrying.

152
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,220
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

153
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,600
INBOX, JIANG QIAOXI, VIEW MESSAGE

154
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,480
HOP ON YOUR BIKES.
MEET AT THE GATE. LET'S RIDE TO SCHOOL.

155
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,860
- Morning!
- Morning.

156
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,040
- Morning.
- Where is Jiang Qiaoxi?

157
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,920
Not here yet.

158
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,680
Morning! I'm here!

159
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,720
- Morning.
- Hey, Jiang Qiaoxi.

160
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,960
Slow down.

161
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,580
Sorry to keep you waiting.

162
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,120
Weren't you heading to the Olympiad?

163
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,760
Why are you ride to school with us?

164
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,940
You even reminded us

165
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,920
to bring our bikes.

166
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,280
Before I go,

167
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,540
what I want to do most is to

168
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,740
ride to school with all of you.

169
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,580
What's that you are holding?

170
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,100
Yingtao said,

171
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,220
if I want to officially rejoin

172
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,120
the Qunshan Squard,

173
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,380
I need to "melt your icy hearts".

174
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,780
So you went with the easiest way,

175
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,180
- giving out gifts?
- Exactly.

176
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,380
I brought them.

177
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,120
Just not sure
if you are brave enough to accept.

178
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,080
With a setup like that,

179
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,200
how could we not take them?

180
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,180
One scarf for each of you.

181
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,320
Hand-knit by Qiaoxi.

182
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,920
You knit these yourself?

183
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,800
- Of course.
- You knit scarves? Since when?

184
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,060
It's not that hard.

185
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,780
It's basically just applying formulas.

186
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,920
This one is for you.

187
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,620
It took more time for a colored pattern.

188
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,500
I see.

189
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,660
<i>- Jiang Qiaoxi,</i>
- Let me see.

190
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,800
<i>your world is made of math.</i>

191
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,160
Thinking about Jiang Qiaoxi sit there

192
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,920
and knitting. It feels peculiar.

193
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
Stop, I am picturing it, too.

194
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,280
<i>Honestly,</i>

195
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,960
<i>when I couldn't hang out with you guys,</i>

196
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,620
<i>I got so bored</i>

197
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,400
<i>I had to find something to do.</i>

198
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,600
If scarves are not enough,

199
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
I can knit sweaters next.

200
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,600
Jiang Qiaoxi,

201
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,180
let's not get ahead of ourselves.

202
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,600
These scarves are already a lot.

203
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,860
Why red, by the way?

204
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,860
I like red.

205
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,560
We all thought you were into black.

206
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,380
Black was never a choice.

207
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,220
But red is.

208
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,980
But this red is blinding.

209
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,060
It's like a traffic light.

210
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,980
I've never worn anything this red.

211
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,840
Stop nitpicking.

212
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,980
Red is great.

213
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,100
It's like the sun,

214
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,560
bright, warm and hopeful.

215
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,820
I like it.

216
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,520
I'm keeping mine.

217
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,700
Thanks, Jiang Qiaoxi.

218
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,700
You like it, take it.

219
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,820
This is definitely not for me.

220
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,300
Jiang Qiaoxi, for someone with such flair,

221
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,720
this scarf is weirdly old-fashioned.

222
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,720
You're the old-fashioned one.

223
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,600
Put it on.

224
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,080
Du Shang, come on!

225
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,420
Yingtao, I'm beating you today!

226
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,020
Catch me!

227
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,020
<i>Is that Jiang Qiaoxi?</i>

228
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,440
<i>What's he doing here?</i>

229
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,700
<i>I have no idea.</i>

230
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,880
Ms. He.

231
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,220
All the other Olympiad students

232
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,440
are leaving today.

233
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,640
Why are you still here?

234
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,320
I just wanted to sit in
a few more classes.

235
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,060
I already cleared it with Ms. Peng.

236
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,360
I'll take the exam tomorrow.

237
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,960
Why are all of you wearing red scarves?

238
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,240
Ms. He,

239
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,660
we are wearing them

240
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,580
to bring Jiang Qiaoxi good luck.

241
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,460
- Yeah, Ms. He.
- Yeah.

242
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,760
Alright then, hurry to class.

243
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,940
Okay, we are going.

244
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,120
Bye, Ms. He.

245
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,000
Bye, Ms. He.

246
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,980
Jiang Qiaoxi should be getting ready
for the competition.

247
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,800
What's he doing goofing off with them?

248
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,500
Being that childish?

249
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,760
That's not him.

250
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,440
What do you mean it's not?

251
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,620
He's tall. Who else would it be?

252
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,900
I said it's not him.

253
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,180
He's never smiled like that.

254
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,600
How can he look that happy?

255
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,660
This drumstick is unreal today.

256
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,580
<i>So good.</i>

257
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,060
Yingtao. Yingtao.

258
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,260
- <i>The flavor is different.</i>
- Hm?

259
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,360
I want some stuffed lotus root.

260
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Could you spare me some?

261
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,340
You want more food now?

262
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,220
<i>Delicious chicken leg.</i>

263
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,200
Not for now.

264
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
- I'm saving it for the road.
<i>- Different from yesterday,</i>

265
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,480
<i>this drumstick is really amazing.</i>

266
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,380
Fine.

267
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,720
I'll have my mom fry some tonight.

268
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,660
I want pig trotters.

269
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,420
I want jujube buns.

270
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,400
Nope.

271
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,800
- Why not, Yingtao?
- It's not fair.

272
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,860
- Come on, it's been forever!
- Yeah.

273
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,540
Those are handmade one by one.

274
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,240
She'd be cooking all night and exhausted.

275
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,560
Exactly, that's a lot for Auntie.

276
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,520
Form a line.

277
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,740
Jiang Qiaoxi.

278
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,380
I call dibs on stuffed lotus root.

279
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,580
I'm the second.

280
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,040
- Then I'm the third.
- Fourth, obviously.

281
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi!</i>

282
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,720
Qiaoxi's mom.

283
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,040
Hongfei.

284
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,040
Calm down.

285
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,600
Jiang Qiaoxi!

286
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,240
<i>So he took leave on his own?</i>

287
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,480
<i>Skipped the Olympiad opening ceremony?</i>

288
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,020
<i>He did tell me.</i>

289
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,900
<i>Who gave him the right</i>
<i>to make that decision?</i>

290
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,420
<i>Kids these day…</i>

291
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,360
<i>I thought he was already on his way.</i>

292
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,420
<i>I only found out</i>

293
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,760
<i>he was here because Ms. He told me.</i>

294
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,820
Don't worry.

295
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,440
It's almost over.

296
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,020
I already booked tickets for tonight.

297
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,500
He has to attend

298
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,520
the opening.

299
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,860
Principal, we'll be going.

300
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,740
Alright.

301
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,980
<i>Now remember,</i>

302
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,880
<i>first,</i>

303
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,760
<i>don't panic.</i>

304
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,480
<i>Clear your mind.</i>

305
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,980
<i>Focus on the questions.</i>

306
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,740
<i>Start with</i>

307
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,960
<i>the high-score ones first.</i>

308
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,760
Math king Jiang.

309
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,700
How are you feeling about the exam?

310
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,280
You are?

311
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,560
I knew it. You don't know me.

312
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,680
My name's Qi Le.

313
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,140
I'm in Year 10 at our school.

314
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,940
I guessed the method on the last question

315
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,680
during prelims, got lucky,

316
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,180
and made it into nationals.

317
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,280
I'm mostly here for the experience,

318
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,160
not to win.

319
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,380
Hi. I'm Jiang Qiaoxi.

320
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,940
You don't need to introduce yourself.

321
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,180
We all know who you are.

322
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:22,740
My dad

323
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,720
is the provincial

324
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,440
team coach for China Math Olympiad.

325
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,640
There, Mr. Qi.

326
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,060
At home, he never shuts up about you.

327
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,220
Says your math intuition is insane.

328
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,260
One in a million. Sometimes I think
he wishes you were his son.

329
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,120
You're never focused in practices.

330
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,760
Now you are distracting other people?

331
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,100
You see? I told you.

332
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,160
He wants you as his son.

333
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,400
Keep talking nonsense.

334
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,880
See what happens when we get home.

335
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,820
What's wrong? You don't look good.

336
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,840
It's nothing.

337
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,800
Just a slight fever.

338
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,860
Falling sick now of all times?

339
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,060
Did you take any medicine?

340
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,920
Don't.

341
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,480
They'll make you drowsy,

342
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,860
You'll blank on everything.

343
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,400
No meds, got it?

344
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,180
Hey math king,

345
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,220
did someone borrow your eraser
before the exam?

346
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,380
- Eraser?
- There's this myth at China Math Olympiad.

347
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,180
If someone borrows half your eraser

348
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,340
before the exam,

349
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,260
they steal half your luck.

350
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,380
Math king,

351
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,180
someone's trying to sabotage you.

352
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,600
That's ridiculous.

353
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,940
You study math

354
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,080
and still go with that superstition?
Embarrassing.

355
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,360
Come on, Dad.

356
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,980
Math is kinda mystical.

357
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,000
Think about it,

358
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,960
if someone like me

359
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,220
made it to nationals,

360
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,240
it's dumb luck, right?

361
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,580
This is not the time

362
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,160
to mess around.

363
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,400
Dad,

364
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,260
look at Wang Shuran.
She's doing her own ritual.

365
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,120
Rituals?

366
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,500
Why did she write those words

367
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,640
on her hands?

368
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,580
Qi Le said

369
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,240
there's a trick to it.

370
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
Write the character for <i>win</i>

371
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,260
16 times on your left hand,

372
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,780
and <i>rise</i> 16 times

373
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,920
on your right hand.

374
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,180
Supposedly it boosts your luck.

375
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,860
Really? New to me.

376
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,940
Did you write it?

377
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,620
Why would I?

378
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,900
I don't need luck.

379
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,780
Fair point.

380
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,000
Hey, Jiang Qiaoxi.

381
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,720
You sound

382
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,100
a little bit off to me.

383
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,720
Are you sick?

384
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,920
I'm fine. Much better.

385
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,700
Got a bit fever.

386
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,160
No big deal now.

387
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,780
You had a fever?

388
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,520
Are you alright over there alone?

389
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,420
Getting sick before the exam?

390
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,400
Worst of luck.

391
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,880
Heavens, help him.

392
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,260
At least it is the last day.

393
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,600
Hope it won't affect you.

394
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,600
I don't need the heavens to watch over me.

395
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,220
I just need

396
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,940
Yingtao to watch over me.

397
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,400
Me? Watch over you?

398
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,080
You're still joking at a time like this?

399
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,180
Relax.

400
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,040
None of it gonna throw me off.

401
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,180
It won't get in my way.

402
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,540
Yingtao, I…

403
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,780
I just want this to be over.

404
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,660
I need this to be over.

405
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,400
Nothing's gonna stop me.

406
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,240
Why do you keep saying it recently?

407
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,660
You want it to be over.

408
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,200
What exactly will be over?

409
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,140
Just wait.

410
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,740
You'll know soon enough.

411
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,680
Alright.

412
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,760
<i>Bye.</i>

413
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,480
Hey, you okay?

414
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,120
Hey, you okay?

415
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,680
Yeah.

416
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,920
Just needed a second

417
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,820
to reset.

418
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,160
You sure you are okay?

419
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,020
Yeah.

420
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:54,600
<i>Okay, so Sn equals An. We need to find An.</i>

421
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,740
<i>How do solve this?</i>

422
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,360
<i>What's the formula again?</i>

423
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,420
Quit laughing.

424
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,720
Lin Qile,

425
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,860
what did I just say?

426
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,680
If Sn and An are known,

427
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,020
how do we find An?

428
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,460
- I say 50.
- 50?

429
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,740
- 50!
- 52 for me.

430
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,920
Write my name down. 50 and a breakfast.

431
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,800
A whole breakfast?

432
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,420
- Yep.
- 50 plus one meal.

433
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,360
Someone's all in.

434
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,440
<i>- 50.</i>
<i>- 70.</i>

435
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,720
- What's going on?
- <i>I'm counting.</i>

436
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,000
- Pick one.
- 30.

437
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,260
Pick what?

438
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,860
Who's gonna win the Olympiad.

439
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,100
It's about to start.
Are you backing Jiang Qiaoxi?

440
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,240
I'm not betting.

441
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,840
Really?

442
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
<i>Let me see.</i>

443
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,040
That's not like you, Yingtao.

444
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,460
Even Yu Qiao put money down

445
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,600
to cheer him on.

446
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,720
I'm not cheering him on.

447
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,180
Just figured

448
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,760
I'd squeeze a little out of the guy.

449
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,660
<i>Come on.</i>

450
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,840
<i>Class is starting.</i>

451
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,540
<i>Did you bet?</i>

452
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,780
<i>I put down 20.</i>

453
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,600
<i>They're all guessing</i>

454
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,480
<i>who'll make the national team.</i>

455
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,300
<i>Did you join in?</i>

456
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,600
<i>Of course not.</i>

457
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,840
You're sick.

458
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,820
I'm not about to mess around right now.

459
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,800
So if I wasn't sick,

460
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,240
you would?

461
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,500
<i>You think I'll make the team?</i>

462
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Yeah, I do.

463
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,260
But

464
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,200
I still wouldn't join their little circus.

465
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,700
I can tell

466
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,680
they are just doing it for kicks.

467
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,760
But

468
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,260
I'm not using your competition for fun.

469
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,920
You even know

470
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,180
my risk-to-reward ratio?

471
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,220
Risk-to-reward ratio?

472
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,080
What's that?

473
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,140
Risk-to-reward ratio?

474
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,060
Math king, that's a term
in finance, right?

475
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,020
How did that come up?

476
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,620
Guess I should've made it clearer.

477
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,900
Sorry if I confused you, Yingtao.

478
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,380
<i>Anyway, not like it matters.</i>

479
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,840
<i>My ratio's probably terrible.</i>

480
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,840
<i>If you are not in, no harm done.</i>

481
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,100
And I'll be back soon anyway.

482
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,640
It'll all be over soon.

483
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,540
What do you mean, Jiang Qiaoxi?

484
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,300
I've been thinking about it all day.
Still don't get it.

485
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,480
You talking about the Olympiad?

486
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,020
<i>Everything.</i>

487
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,660
<i>All of it is going to be over.</i>

488
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,820
Well…

489
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,040
I hope you

490
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,100
crush it.

491
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,220
Crush it?

492
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,680
I like that.

493
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,420
I need that right now.

494
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,660
Thanks, Yingtao.

495
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,840
<i>Why are you being all polite?</i>

496
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,220
So when exactly are you coming back?

497
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,440
Starting from today,

498
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,600
on the fourth day, I will be back.

499
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,780
Got it.

500
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,300
Math king,

501
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,740
- <i>Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>
- you coming in or not?

502
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,100
- Jiang Qiaoxi?
- <i>Yingtao,</i>

503
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,500
on the day I come back,

504
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,940
<i>will you come and pick me up?</i>

505
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,660
‪Okay?

506
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,540
Sure.

507
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,280
<i>I'll be there.</i>

508
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,780
<i>Congrats to all our winners today.</i>

509
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,340
<i>You brought home gold</i>

510
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,920
<i>from the Olympiad!</i>

511
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,040
Math king,

512
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,280
if you hadn't gotten sick,

513
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,680
you would've blown them all away.

514
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,840
But honestly, with your capability,

515
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,180
you'd be top of the city

516
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,320
through the regular college entrance exam.

517
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,780
No, top of the province.

518
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,960
Thanks.

519
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,400
But

520
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,960
I don't think I'll need it.

521
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,940
<i>One contestant has truly outdone himself.</i>

522
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,680
<i>Not only did he showcase</i>

523
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,920
<i>exceptional skill,</i>

524
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,540
he achieved full marks

525
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,820
at the China Math Olympiad!

526
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,620
<i>Let's give a round of applause</i>

527
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,900
to Jiang Qiaoxi
from Jialin Experimental High School!

528
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,800
Math king, you really
kept that under wraps.

529
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,020
Amazing.

530
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,940
I knew it.

531
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,980
He's a legend for a reason.

532
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,080
OUTSTANDING STUDENT: JIANG QIAOXI

533
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,240
Not only did Jiang Qiaoxi

534
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,500
get a perfect score,

535
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,160
he's also been selected

536
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,480
for the national training camp

537
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,320
and earned a guaranteed spot

538
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,320
at Qingbei University.

539
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,680
FLOURISHING BEYOND

540
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,360
WITH LOVE, WE GROW TOGETHER

541
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,860
DESTINATION JIALIN

542
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,560
<i>Look, that's Yingtao.</i>

543
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,440
ROOTED IN JIALIN, FLOURISHING BEYOND

544
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,520
<i>That's what she looks like.</i>

545
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,520
- Jiang Qiaoxi!
- <i>He was only gone for four days.</i>

546
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,600
<i>He called her everyday.</i>

547
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,560
<i>Each call was</i>

548
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,520
<i>at least half an hour.</i>

549
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,420
<i>All that rumors about</i>

550
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,900
<i>he's cool and mysterious?</i>

551
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,120
<i>Guy's a full-blown chatterbox.</i>

552
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,720
<i>Still scored full marks</i>

553
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,920
<i>and made the national team.</i>

554
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,380
<i>He can talk as much as he wants.</i>

555
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,200
Alright, everyone,

556
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,840
over here!

557
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,200
Let's gather up!

558
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,720
Feeling better?

559
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,740
Much better. Barely feel it now.

560
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,420
Have you eaten?

561
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,700
- Not yet.
- How are you gonna

562
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,680
get your strength back without food?

563
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,960
Rushed out too fast.

564
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,660
Let's get you something to eat.

565
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,260
Sure. Sounds good.

566
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,680
We were about to grab breakfast too.

567
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,580
Let's go together.

568
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,020
Extra chili for me.

569
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,220
NUTRITIOUS MEALS

570
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,380
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

571
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,080
- And for you.
- Thanks.

572
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,720
Senior, I'm Qi Le.

573
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,300
You're Qi Le?

574
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,640
I'm Lin Qile.

575
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,760
Then wait,

576
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,760
is your nickname Rongrong?

577
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,860
Rongrong?

578
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,100
For <i>Qile Rongrong</i>, happily ever after?

579
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,660
Exactly!

580
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,100
Is that <i>Wukong</i>?

581
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,360
<i>Journey to the West</i> was

582
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,640
Jiang Qiaoxi's favorite.

583
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,640
Senior Lin,

584
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,940
you and Jiang really
knew each other as kids?

585
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,800
Yeah, we did.

586
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
I read that book

587
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,200
in middle school too.

588
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,500
Really? I love it so much.

589
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,080
"If the sky won't let me see clearly,
I'll tear it apart.

590
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,980
If the earth won't hold my heart,
I'll shatter it.

591
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,040
Let me understand by all living creatures.

592
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,080
Let all the gods disappear into smoke."

593
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,880
Let me see it.

594
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,840
CAMPER ID

595
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,220
Good thing you used that photo.

596
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,400
Covers up the scar on your forehead.

597
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,320
It's fine. Look, it's almost healed.

598
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,260
You can still see it.

599
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,000
Looks the same to me either way.

600
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,640
I think I'd read it, too.

601
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,720
BEEF NOODLES, ROUJIAMO, COFFEE, BUBBLE TEA

602
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,860
Do you guys still have more exams?

603
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,540
Nope,

604
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,840
not anymore.

605
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,240
I'm done too.

606
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,980
I'm done because I didn't make it.

607
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,140
I have to wait until next year
to try again.

608
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,760
But our math king doesn't need to.

609
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,280
He aced it with full marks.

610
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,320
That's basically

611
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,680
a passport to the math world.

612
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,680
What does that mean?

613
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,620
It means Jiang Qiaoxi

614
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,940
got straight into the national

615
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,920
training team.

616
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,740
Next up is the international competition.

617
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,040
International?

618
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,540
Like, going abroad for competitions?

619
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,880
I'll go get the bill.

620
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,400
So Senior Jiang can skip all the classes

621
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,780
and never come back to school?

622
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,720
He's guaranteed admission

623
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,980
to Qingbei University

624
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,460
NUTRITIOUS MEALS

625
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,800
- Let's go.
- Thanks, math king.

626
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,100
- No problem.
- Thanks, senior.

627
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,200
OLYMPIAD CAMPER ID

628
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,080
Jiang Qiaoxi.

629
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,240
You're not

630
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,520
coming to school on Monday?

631
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,360
I am.

632
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,980
This whole thing…

633
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,320
is over.

634
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,840
Senior Jiang, you are not
joining the national team?

635
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,560
I'm done with math competitions.
I'm going back to school.

636
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,500
Done with math?

637
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,840
<i>No idea what's going on</i>

638
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,060
<i>with Mr.Jiang's kid.</i>

639
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,880
<i>He's got a guaranteed spot at Qingbei.</i>

640
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,760
<i>He rejected it.</i>

641
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,980
<i>What's that about?</i>

642
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,340
<i>- That's wild. Who would say no to that?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

643
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,800
APMO CERTIFICATE

644
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,980
Mom, here.

645
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,860
All my Olympiad notes and study materials,

646
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,000
from when I was a kid until now.

647
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,940
They're all categorized.

648
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,120
If you want,

649
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,360
you can tear them up in order.

650
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,220
What is that supposed to mean?

651
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,200
I knew it.

652
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,820
I figured you forgot.

653
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,580
Back in first grade,

654
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,880
we just got back from Hong Kong,

655
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,960
I didn't finish

656
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,720
your math homework
because I was playing around.

657
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,280
So you ripped up my Olympiad textbook.

658
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,300
And you told me

659
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,580
math was the only path I had.

660
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,460
Nothing else.

661
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,520
You told me to figure it out.

662
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,780
Well, I did.

663
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,780
And I'm saying it now.
I don't want that path.

664
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,200
Is this some acting?

665
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,900
A decade long revenge?

666
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,900
No.

667
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,340
I spent the decade to

668
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,140
answer your question.

669
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,980
Your path for math prodigy,

670
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,980
I don't want it.

671
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,020
I'm done.

672
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,460
I really did give birth
to someone too smart.

673
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,000
You knew exactly how to stab me
where it hurts most.

674
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,380
You waited until now, when everything

675
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,540
is in your hands,

676
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,100
you are going to burn it all down?

677
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,260
You really want me to believe

678
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,900
I wasted all these years

679
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,340
for nothing?

680
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,980
Mom, I waited until now

681
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,340
because only now

682
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,800
will you actually listen.

683
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,620
Only now will you finally see what I want

684
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,880
I'm not Jiang Mengchu.

685
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,820
I'm not anyone's shadow.

686
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,900
I'm Jiang Qiaoxi.

687
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,780
I have my own name, Mom.

688
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,180
His name is the one
you should never bring up.

689
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,400
He wasn't like you.

690
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,340
He knew how hard I worked.

691
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,960
At four years old, Mengchu told me

692
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,580
he wanted to go to Qingbei University.

693
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,080
He wanted to be the best mathematician
in the world.

694
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,940
If he were still alive,

695
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,860
he'd be so jealous of you.

696
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,400
I'm sorry, Mom.

697
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,480
But I'm the one who's still alive.

698
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,380
That so-called genius life
he never got to live

699
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,679
has nothing to do with me.

700
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,820
Liang Hongfei, how could you…

701
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,699
He's his own man now.
How can you get violent?

702
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,500
You okay?

703
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,300
I'm fine.

704
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,140
Sit down.

705
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,020
JIANG QIAOXI GOT HIT BY HIS MOM.

706
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,380
HE NEVER WANTED TO JOIN THAT CAMP.

707
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,300
<i>Qiaoxi's such a good kid.</i>

708
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,260
<i>Polite, smart, respectful.</i>

709
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,200
<i>And Liang just keeps pushing him.</i>

710
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,340
<i>That's not right.</i>

711
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,020
<i>I've never really understood</i>

712
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,460
<i>how Mrs. Liang treats Qiaoxi.</i>

713
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,820
<i>The kid's always been well-behaved.</i>

714
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,540
<i>Remember when he used to</i>

715
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,760
do homework at our place?

716
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,680
He'd sit for hours,
breezing through stack of papers,

717
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,380
like he was glued to the chair.

718
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,060
<i>And our Yingtao?</i>

719
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,780
<i>Three minutes in,</i>
<i>she'd be off to the bathroom.</i>

720
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,180
<i>Five minutes later, asking for a drink.</i>

721
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,260
<i>She couldn't stay long.</i>

722
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,160
<i>Like there were nails on the chair.</i>

723
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,960
<i>Hello?</i>

724
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,400
<i>Manager Cai.</i>

725
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
‪What?

726
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,400
Alright,

727
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,940
we are on our way.

728
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,820
- What?
- Okay.

729
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,860
<i>Let's go.</i>

730
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,660
<i>I'll tell you on the way.</i>

731
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,080
Qiaoxi,

732
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,060
I know you are tired.

733
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,500
Totally drained, body and mind.

734
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,020
How about this?

735
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,180
Let's take a trip.

736
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,640
Take a proper break and relax for once.

737
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,140
You've always wanted to see Tibet, right?

738
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,680
Huangshan. Taishan.

739
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,140
Any famous spot, you name it.

740
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,800
Don't want to go with me?

741
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,360
Bring your friends. Make it a group thing.

742
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,960
We'll cover the cost.

743
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,680
You can go wherever you want.

744
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,720
- Even travel abroad…
- Dad.

745
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,160
I am not making a scene here.

746
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,700
I am not begging for a holiday.

747
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,360
I just wanted to tell you,

748
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,740
starting today, I don't want any of these.

749
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,680
From this moment on, I have a name.

750
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,820
I'm Jiang Qiaoxi!

751
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,460
Qiaoxi, I was wrong.

752
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,640
Please.

753
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
I'm sorry I tore up your books.

754
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,660
Please don't give up.

755
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,940
You can't throw all this away.

756
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,260
You've worked so hard.

757
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,260
You were going to be
a world champion, you know?

758
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,940
Don't you get it, Mom?

759
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,020
Don't you know what I want?

760
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,440
What do you want?

761
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,320
That girl from Qunshan?

762
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,900
It's because of her, isn't it?

763
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,060
Is it?

764
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,180
Of course.

765
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,560
In you head,

766
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,920
there's only one possible reason

767
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,120
for all of this. Right?

768
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,960
You used to be so obedient
when you were little.

769
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,380
You were such a sweetheart.

770
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,280
Everything changed

771
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,740
after you went to Qunshan.

772
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,640
After you met those people.

773
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,360
Your dad and I

774
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,260
sacrificed so much for you.

775
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,240
What gives you the right
to just walk away?

776
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,280
Mom, think about it.

777
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,340
Was everything you did for me

778
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,340
really for me?

779
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,560
You and Dad were so strict

780
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,920
because you were scared.

781
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,900
I remember when you were drunk one night.

782
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,380
You looked at me and said,

783
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,600
"Jiang Mengchu,

784
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
it was my fault.

785
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,280
I should've picked you up.

786
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,720
I shouldn't have let your dad do it.

787
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,700
He's always late."

788
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,220
That's when I figured it out.

789
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,820
Jiang Mengchu skipped
Olympiad class that day.

790
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,640
You didn't pick him up.

791
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,140
- So he…
- Jiang Qiaoxi, stop.

792
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,400
The older I get, the clearer it becomes.

793
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,020
You wanted him to be a math genius.

794
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,360
But all he wanted

795
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,200
was to get far, far away from you.

796
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,440
13 years old.

797
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,840
He disappeared on a tiny hill
right near home.

798
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,760
- Do you really believe that was just…
- Don't talk about him like that!

799
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,640
Jiang Qiaoxi, how could you do this

800
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,040
to your brother? To your dead brother?

801
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,020
What did I do?

802
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,720
Who really failed him?

803
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,960
<i>What are you saying?</i>

804
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,920
<i>Mengchu had your eyes.</i>

805
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,340
<i>He shared your blood.</i>

806
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,180
- He wouldn't think like this.
- Exactly.

807
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,360
He had my blood.

808
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,240
My eyes.

809
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,280
Everything I am,
my skin, my bones, my blood,

810
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,460
that's given to me by you!

811
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,340
These awards. These math medals.

812
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,960
They're all yours.

813
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,960
Isn't this what you want?

814
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,960
Then fine. I'll return it all.

815
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,420
I'm only going to be me!

816
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,800
Jiang Qiaoxi.

817
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Jiang Qiaoxi.

818
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,020
We're having hot pot

819
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,260
tonight.

820
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,720
You coming?

821
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,860
You know me.

822
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,700
I'm not great at hot pot.

823
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,560
But if you are there,

824
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,480
fighting me over food,

825
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,460
I'll probably eat a ton.

826
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:08,900
Come on,

827
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,140
Jiang Qiaoxi.

828
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,480
Come with me.

829
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,520
Sit here.

830
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,220
Hold on.

831
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,080
We have to disinfect your wound.

832
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,280
Let me grab the iodine.

833
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,840
Once that's done,

834
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,400
we can eat.

835
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,160
My mom made crispy pork, too.

836
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,120
You have to eat some more

837
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,320
so that I can have more too.

838
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,540
How about this?

839
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,740
You

840
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,800
count to ten.

841
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,080
I'll be back

842
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,080
before you finish.

843
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,180
I'M FINE. DIDN'T THINK ABOUT HIM LATELY.
DOES HE STILL REMEMBER THE TASTE OF HONEY?

844
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,540
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi left.</i>

845
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,420
<i>He doesn't write.</i>

846
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,540
<i>Doesn't call.</i>

847
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,120
<i>I'm done thinking about him.</i>

848
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,980
<i>I'm done getting hurt over him.</i>

849
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:35,900
NO MORE HURTING FOR HIM!
SEP 16TH, 2006
