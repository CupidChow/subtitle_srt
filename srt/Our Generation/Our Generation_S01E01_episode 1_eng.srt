00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,290
   

3
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,290
   

4
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,319
Run! Don't lose to that cloud!

5
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,319
Let's stop here. There is no road ahead.

6
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:51,559
Cherry, the big white goose, is gone. 
 Let's return and play games instead.

7
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:53,099
I can fly over there.

8
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:55,480
I read in a book that if you try hard,

9
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,099
and jump far enough, 
 you'll grow wings on your back.

10
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:01,299
And then…

11
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,559
What are you two doing?

12
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:10,120
Lin Cherry, go back now, 
 or I won't let you copy my homework anymore!

13
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,700
My dad said, a student with excellent grades 
 will be coming soon.

14
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,040
His family's dorm is right next to my house.

15
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,080
If you don't let me copy, 
 I can just ask to copy from him.

16
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,030
 Son, we'll reach Qunshan soon. 

17
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,500
 Stop drawing. 

18
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,340
 Did you feel unwell 
 after eating during the break? 

19
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,030
 Rest for a while. 

20
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,079
 You'll have to take a placement test 
 once we arrive. 

21
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,860
 What are you doing with that dirty coat? 

22
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,139
 If you like it, I will buy you a new one. 

23
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,000
Cherry, slow down!

24
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,070
A stick, find a stick!

25
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,279
If the snake gets scared, it will bite people.

26
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,400
The snake jumped higher than me.

27
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,599
Is that right? 
 Lin Cherry, you must grow taller.

28
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,539
Even the snake can jump higher than you.

29
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:21,059
Oh, no! I'm doomed!

30
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:23,059
Cherry!

31
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,439
 I must use my time 
 to do something meaningful. 

32
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,039
How is stealing a book for Cai Fang Yuan 
 considered meaningful?

33
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,150
How is it not meaningful?

34
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,470
That novel was originally mine.

35
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,319
Did you reach it yet? 
 I'm almost out of strength.

36
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,080
Hello.

37
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,839
Cherry, where is my book?

38
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,340
Hurry and run!

39
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,840
Run!

40
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,779
Mom.

41
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:10,279
What's wrong, Cherry?

42
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:15,170
Mom, if… someone wants to take me away,

43
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,440
to a place none of you are, 
 what should I do?

44
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,760
Who wants to take you away? 
 Who did you meet?

45
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,340
I mean, if…

46
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,319
Just like how the witch took Rapunzel away 
 to another world.

47
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:30,300
Don't worry, no one will take you away.

48
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,399
 Juan'er! 

49
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,640
Prepare two more dishes tonight. 
 Manager Jiang is here.

50
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,676
I could smell the aroma.

51
00:05:35,676 --> 00:05:37,508
- Sheng Juan, I'm sorry for the intrusion. 
 - Look who's here!

52
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:40,600
- Manager Jiang. 
 - Are you Cherry? Let me see if you've gained weight.

53
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,610
Cherry, greet the guests.

54
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,120
Manager Jiang, come on.

55
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,839
- Drink some more liquor. 
 - I can't drink anymore.

56
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,040
- It's all right. 
 - Drink slowly.

57
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,660
- It's all right. 
 - Qiao Xi, you're having a meal.

58
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,560
Why are you still carrying your backpack? 
 Take it off.

59
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,980
Qiao Xi, take off the backpack.

60
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,519
What's wrong?

61
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:06,300
His cousin from Hong Kong 
 bought him the coat inside his backpack.

62
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,200
It got dirty on the way here.

63
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,180
I told him to throw it away, 
 but he didn't want to.

64
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,920
Instead, he put it in his backpack 
 and took it with him.

65
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,019
It's fine, Qiao Xi. Shall I wash it for you?

66
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:20,879
By tomorrow, it will be dry, 
 and you can wear it again.

67
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,239
Cherry, we're out of laundry detergent.

68
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:31,200
Can you help me buy a pack of detergent 
 from Uncle Qin?

69
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,020
- Uncle Qin, one pack of laundry detergent, please. 
 - Go die!

70
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,180
   
   

71
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,240
My dad hasn't returned. 
 He was restocking inventory.

72
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,860
Lin Cherry, I heard that today 
 you got scared, cried,

73
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,770
and kept falling down, because of a snake.

74
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,579
Laundry detergent.

75
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,740
Lin Cherry, I stepped on your shadow. 
 You lost to me.

76
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,980
Whatever.

77
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,240
Do you admit defeat?

78
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,160
I encountered an enemy 
 much stronger than you.

79
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,879
Have you found a way to deal with him?

80
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,959
I can't deal with him.

81
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,419
You're a bully to the weak 
 and a coward to the strong.

82
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:19,720
You don't understand. 
 You don't know how formidable he is.

83
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,100
Who cares how formidable he is.

84
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,079
Enemies aren't meant to be feared. 
 They are meant to be dealt with.

85
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,519
You said that.

86
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,180
Qin Ye Yun, look over there.

87
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,920
I also stepped on your shadow. 
 I won't lose to you.

88
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,179
Lin Cherry!

89
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,120
Sit here.

90
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,580
Do you eat candy?

91
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,239
Do you want to listen to tapes?

92
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:02,000
♪ Give me a cup of a love potion to forget ♪ 
  (*Andy Lau's "A Love Potion to Forget") 

93
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,240
Do you want to read Mickey Mouse?

94
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,130
Everyone likes reading Mickey Mouse.

95
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:39,100
Chun Lu, for now, stay in this little nest 
 and don't run around.

96
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,499
I am protecting you.

97
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,719
Chun Lu!

98
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,579
Chun Lu.

99
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:17,100
Let me teach you. 
 You should hold it like this,

100
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,340
then pet it like this.

101
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,399
 Don't you think Qiao Xi 
 is a little different from other kids? 

102
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:07,740
 He is, in fact, a math genius. 
 Of course, he is different. 

103
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,540
 Do you think what happened to his family 
 over ten years ago still affects him? 

104
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:19,899
 Juan'er, they don't mention it, 
 so we shouldn't mention it either. 

105
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,659
 Manager Jiang is quite busy with work. 
 We should care more for the child. 

106
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,459
 All right. 

107
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,059
 That's enough. 

108
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,899
 The child ate something bad and threw up. 
 Isn't that normal? 

109
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,120
 He is fine now. 

110
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,299
 He had dinner at Mr. Lin's house 

111
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:44,440
 and then played for a while. 

112
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,240
 I'm not convinced, all right? 

113
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,240
Cherry, is the new student next door 
 really that amazing?

114
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,039
My dad came to your house late at night 
 and he was still doing homework.

115
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:45,259
I have something to tell you.

116
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:46,440
What is it?

117
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,360
You must be nice to that new student,

118
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,920
and make him feel

120
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,820
Lin Cherry, don't overreact.

121
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,260
He just arrived, 
 and you're already so excited!

122
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,500
You don't understand. 
 If he leaves, then I have to go, too.

123
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,300
Where to?

124
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:14,819
Son, the principal reluctantly agreed 
 to enroll you before taking the test.

125

00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:52,440
Lin Qi Le, stop playing around!

135
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,100
It's time for class. Go back to your seat!

136
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,379
Your name is now Qi Le. 
 Why don't you try to please me instead?

137
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:02,600
This is the first day of school.

138
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:14,259
These are all staff dorms. Ours as well.

139
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:19,580
Du Shang's family lives here in the single dorms. 
 He lives with his mom.

140
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,660
 Du Shang's dad was transferred 
 to the construction site in Pu City. 

141
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,539
 Every time Uncle Du returns, 
 Du Shang is upset for a long time. 

142
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:31,299
 Maybe it's because Uncle Du 
 never brought him a present. 

143
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:33,200
That's Qin Ye Yun's house.

144
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,779
She is the person I dislike most in the world.

145
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:38,879
She has very strong hands. 
 When she hits people, it hurts,

146
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,279
but she is pretty.

147
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,600
 Yu Qiao says we are equally matched, 

148
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,159
 but I think I am prettier. 

149
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,860
 She lives with her dad. 

150
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,759
 Have you seen her dad? 
 Uncle Qin runs a convenience store. 

151
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:59,139
 Qin Ye Yun's dad can't walk. 
 One of his legs was injured at work, 

152
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,659
 so Cai Fang Yuan's dad let him stay at the worksite 
 and run a convenience store. 

153
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:04,540
 Uncle Qin is really impressive. 

154
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,180
 Every day he practices Qigong 
 to heal his leg. 

155
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,360
This is Yu Qiao's home. 
 He's also your desk mate.

156
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,580
Beautiful! That dunk is great.

157
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,899
 He lives with his dad, mom, grandma, 

158
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,960
 and his little cousin Yu Jin. 

159
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,679
 Yu Jin's mom got sick, 
 so she sent him to their home. 

160
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,880
 Actually, Yu Qiao's house 
 is already very crowded, 

161
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,770
 so there is no room for more people. 

162
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:32,320
 Uncle Yu is a model worker, 
 and a respected senior at the construction site, 

163
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,759
 so he always agrees to everything. 

164
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:37,320
Next to Yu Qiao's house 
 is Cai Fang Yuan's house.

165
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,039
 Cai Fang Yuan lives with his parents. 

166
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:44,360
 Cai Fang Yuan likes 
 everything delicious, fun, and pretty. 

167
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,900
 Auntie Kang is a good cook, 
 and Uncle Cai is a good stock trader. 

168
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,579
 They hope Cai Fang Yuan will study well 
 and get into a top university. 

169
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,720
That big locust tree has a bird's nest on it.

170
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,100
Two years ago, I found a baby bird that had fallen off, 
 and I took it home.

171
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,119
Dad was amazing. He saved the little bird.

172
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:05,379
That big locust tree also blooms in spring.

173
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:07,980
Mom's locust flower steamed rice 
 is the best.

174
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,580
A lot of dandelions also grow in the field 
 next to the west gate,

175
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,039
but I don't like dandelions. 
 They scatter when you blow on them.

176
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:15,456
♫  The setting sun dispels all our worries  ♫

177
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,852
♫  With its red glow  ♫

178
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:23,960
I heard that 
when a person goes to another world,

179
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,630
people forget things 
 from when they were alive.

180
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,639
I don't want to forget them 
 or everything about Qunshan.

181
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,820
Can you help me remember?

182
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,500
If I forget, 
 you just remind me of them again.

183
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:40,760
Isn't remembering more painful?

184
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,620
I'm not afraid of pain, 
 I don't cry even when I get shots.

185
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:51,739
I just don't know if my parents 
 will still love me after I die.

186
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,610
They will.

187
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,320
They'll always remember and love you.

188
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,420
How do you know?

189
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,700
Those who pass away are forever loved.

190
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:13,539
Did you change your mind? 
 Won't you take me away with you?

191
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:17,659
I'm not the person you said, 
 so I can't take you away.

192
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:22,279
How about you? Will you leave?

193
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,640
One day, I'll leave.

194
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:42,980
 I really like my friends. 

195
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,340
 Even Qin Ye Yun has become cute recently. 

196
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:51,500
 If possible, I also hope 
 to be good friends with her one day. 

197
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,299
 I wish I could always be a student 
 at Power Plant Elementary School. 

198
00:16:56,299 --> 00:17:00,460
 Unfortunately, I will die soon. 

199
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,330
Cherry, don't you want them anymore?

200
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,000
 Are you giving them all away? 

201
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,280
 Don't you want to keep your favorites? 

202
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,340
Don't you… Wait! 
 You should at least keep this.

203
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,059
Oh, my!

204
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:24,379
Qiao Xi, do you know what happened?

205
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:28,141
She doesn't want them anymore.

206
00:17:28,141 --> 00:17:32,530
   

207
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:38,480
 Lin Cherry! Lin Cherry! 

208
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,440
Miss Zhang.

209
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,380
Cherry's mom, look at what she wrote.

210
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,080
 - Where is she? 
 - She is in her room. 

211
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,520
 Miss Zhang. 

212
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,000
- Lin Qi Le, are you all right? 
 - Miss Zhang, it's you. What's wrong?

213
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,200
Cherry, what's wrong with you?

214
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,759
Why did you write you're about to die?

215
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm really going to die!

216
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,800
 What's wrong? 

217
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,680
 Tell us. It's all right, don't cry. 

218
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,819
 Don't worry, just tell us. 

219
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:15,799
They say that if you encounter a snake 
 that compares its height to yours,

220
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,920
 you should run away quickly, 

221
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,440
because if you're shorter, 
 you will die.

222
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,019
 I lost. 

223
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,720
 That snake stood much taller than me. 

224
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,780
Girl, I was so worried about you!

225
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,279
Miss Zhang, everything I said is true!

226
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,960
If you don't believe me, 
 you can ask Cai Fang Yuan and the others.

227
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,339
They all saw it.

228
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:39,500
So did Cai Fang Yuan tell you

229
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,770
that if you lose a height comparison, 
 you'll die?

230
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:44,110
No, Cai Fang Yuan is dumb.

231
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,280
It was Brother Chen Ming Hao.

232
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,319
Chen Ming Hao used to live next door, 
 which is now Qiao Xi's house.

233
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:56,020
They moved away after that child was admitted 
 to junior high school in the provincial city.

234
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,119
You're so silly, you little rascal.

235
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,459
Cherry, don't you believe what I say?

236
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,259
 Lin Qi Le, you definitely won't die. 

237
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:10,960
 This snake height comparison 
 is false, all right? 

238
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,619
 All right. 

239
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,419
Everything's fine now.

240
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,819
The teacher said the transfer application 
 must be signed again.

241
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,179
Wasn't it signed before?

242
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:29,120
My birthday is not on September 30th.

243
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
I'll write another one.

244
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:41,950
   
   

245
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,440
Hello?

246
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,250
I'm taking Qiao Xi to school.

247
00:19:55,098 --> 00:19:57,819
   

248
00:19:57,819 --> 00:19:59,919
All right, I know.

249
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:12,240
Your mom called.

250
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,559
She said she'll come over 
 and have a meal with you.

251
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:18,619
I'll come pick you up after school.

252
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:24,030
Son, do your best on the test!

253
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,259
Go on.

254
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:27,059
Goodbye.

255
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:32,259
Lin Cherry, you already know 
 you won't die.

256
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:34,710
Why did you help Cai Fang Yuan 
 steal the book?

257
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,500
This isn't an act of sacrifice for justice.

258
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,299
She helped me steal the book 
 out of loyalty to her friends.

259
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:43,140
It has nothing to do with death.

260
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,660
Take action, Cherry. You're my Heroine.

261
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,660
Take action, Heroine.

262
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,220
 Did you take the new student 
 on a tour of Qunshan yesterday? 

263
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,079
 Didn't you say we must treat him well? 

264
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:56,420
 Didn't you say that if he leaves, 
 you would go, too? 

265
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,560
 "Aren't you overly enthusiastic 
 with someone who is not friendly? 

266
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,090
 Yu Qiao, what you said was rude. 

267
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,110
 He's quite nice. 

268
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,460
It hurts. Be gentle.

269
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,240
Don't move. If it hurts, just endure it.

270
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,240
 Qin Ye Yun, are you seizing this chance 
 to take revenge on me? 

271
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,640
 I gave you ten comic books. 

272
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,979
 If my mom wasn't on duty today, 
 I wouldn't have asked you to do my hair. 

273
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:08,079
 I suffered a big loss. 

274
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,400
This essay is really easy to write. 
    

275
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,380
I used to be called Lin Cherry,

276
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,559
because my mom craved cherries 
 when she was pregnant with me.

277
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,459
When I started school, they said a name 
 should be meaningful, not simple,

278
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:30,940
so it was changed to Lin Qi Le.

279
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,319
Luckily, your mom didn't like garlic 
 or sweet potatoes at that time.

280
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,020
Otherwise, you would have been called 
 Lin Sweet Potato or Lin Garlic.

281
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,760
Lin Cherry has gone crazy again!

282
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,859
My name Yu Qiao means 
 to live a balanced rural life.

283
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:52,059
My dad named me 
 after reading Jin Yong's novels.

284
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:57,440
My name, Fang Yuan, means 
 I'll earn a lot of money in the future.

285
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,400
There is an artist named Marcel Duchamp.

286
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,079
My mom thought since my last name is Du, 
 I should have a similar first name.

287
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:06,880
Jiang Qiao Xi, what does your name mean?

288
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,759
It doesn't mean anything special.

289
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:11,420
Your name is so cool, 
 yet it doesn't mean anything special?

290
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,619
It just doesn't mean anything special.

291
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,900
Make room!

292
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,119
Sheng Juan, stop bringing more out. 
 There are enough dishes.

293
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:33,039
It's fine. Here.

294
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,779
All right! Look!

295
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:37,640
We considered 
 to entrust Qiao Xi to your family,

296
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,319
but now I've also entrusted myself.

297
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:44,200
Manager Jiang, don't be polite. 
 They are just some casual dishes.

298
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,920
How is this "casual"? It's a feast!

299
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,420
Juan's cooking skills are quite good, 
 aren't they?

300
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,859
- It's so delicious, better than restaurants. 
 - It's so yummy!

301
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:56,380
Uncle Jiang, 
 what does Jiang Qiao Xi's name mean?

302
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,339
You've really caught me off guard.

303
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:01,519
I actually don't know what his name means.

304
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,180
When Hong Fei and I had him, 
 we weren't yet mentally prepared.

305
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,640
Later on, the birth certificate 
 required a name.

306
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,299
I was so anxious, I was sweating,

307
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:13,180
when, I saw a line of poetry 
 in the newspaper.

308
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,259
It read, 
 "Thousands of doors lay west of Jiangqiao",

309
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:18,780
so I named him Jiang Qiao Xi.

310
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,500
It's quite a coincidence.

311
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,400
You're right. 
 It really doesn't mean anything special.

312
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,000
It'll be hard for you to write the essay.

313
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,799
- It's just a casual meal. 
 - Here.

314
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,599
All right, thank you.

315
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,960
Do you want a Cola?

316
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,639
Sports drink? Peanut milk?

317
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:42,320
It's my favorite, really delicious.

318
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:45,140
Don't you have to study?

319
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,859
Then, do you want to hold Chun Lu?

320
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:06,619
 I heard the child Manager Jiang lost 
 was named Jiang Meng Chu. 

321
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:10,539
 It took them several months 
 to decide on his name. 

322
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:13,539
 At the age of 13, he joined the youth class 
 of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 

323
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,940
 and everyone called him a child prodigy. 

324
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,660
 Both children are their sons. 

325
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,240
 How can they favor one over the other? 

326
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,700
 After they lost their first child, 
 they wanted to divorce. 

327
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,099
 Later, the leader suggested 
 they have another child, 

328
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:32,240
 hoping one more child 

329
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,160
 would ease the conflicts between them. 
 It would be a good thing. 

330
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,079
 Qiao Xi is already nine and so promising. 

331
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,039
 Why don't they care about him? 

332
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:46,220
 They're busy. We rarely see his mom. 

333
00:26:56,595 --> 00:27:00,820
   

334
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,539
♪ Be good, Little Bunny ♪

335
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:12,740
♪ Please open the door, I want to come in ♪

336
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:17,420
Why are you so stupid? 
 I told you to open the door, and you did.

337
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,440
What if I'm a bad guy?

338
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,240
I'm going to do my homework.

339
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:24,770
Homework is no fun.

340
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,650
I'll take you somewhere.

341
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,440
I'm sorry, it's raining.

342
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,160
It's all my fault. 
 I didn't check the weather forecast.

343
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,859
Lin Cherry, what exactly 
 do you want to tell me?

344
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:51,959
Qiao is the 20th word on page 795 
 of the Grand Chinese Dictionary.

345
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,259
Its radical is "Shan" (mountain), 
 and it has a total of nine strokes.

346
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:59,999
It has another pronunciation, "Jiao", 
 which means "mountain path."

347
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:03,039
"Qiao" means "high and sharp mountain."

348
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,180
Qiao Xi, this is the west side 
 of the highest and sharpest mountain in Qunshan,

349
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,839
where I have seen 
 the most beautiful sunset.

350
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,399
It's bright red and dazzling!

351
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,659
I think that's Jiang Qiao Xi. 
 The meaning of the name Jiang Qiao Xi.

352
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:22,160
But… But it's raining now, 
 and we can't see anything.

353
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,539
Then tell me about the most beautiful sunset 
 you've ever seen here.

354
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:30,539
Sure. The sunset was as red as fire.

355
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:33,639
Its shape and color 
 were constantly changing.

356
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:37,799
I could never tell 
 what would happen the next minute.

357
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,659
Is there a cloud that looks like a rabbit?

358
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:43,719
Yes. That rabbit is running 
 alongside the sun,

359
00:28:43,719 --> 00:28:48,099
and it's wearing amber. Can you see it?

360
00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:57,400
You're right. 
 There really is a rabbit running there.

361
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,500
I'm telling you the truth, aren't I?

362
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,040
The name Jiang Qiao Xi is meaningful 
 and sounds very pleasant.

363
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,020
Jiang Qiao Xi!

364
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:11,219
Look! Every time 
 I call out Jiang Qiao Xi, I smile.

365
00:29:11,219 --> 00:29:18,059
Jiang Qiao Xi! Jiang Qiao Xi!

366
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,759
 Senior, Sister-in-Law, 
 let me present it to you. 

367
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:42,400
See, there's also a test report.

368
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,500
The most important thing is 
 that it's non-toxic and harmless.

369
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,180
Cherry is still very young.

370
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,319
She should eat 
 plenty of leafy greens and fruits.

371
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:56,579
If there are pesticides, that's a huge problem. 
 A huge problem.

372
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,759
I don't remember the next part,

373
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,019
but they said this is drinkable.

374
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:06,919
I can drink half a bottle 
 to prove it's non-toxic. I have faith in it.

375
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:10,180
- That's… There's no need. 
 - It's all right.

376
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,359
- Don't. Don't. 
 - Wang Yu, there's no need.

377
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:14,799
 This is not only non-toxic and harmless, 

378
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,179
- but it's cleaning properties are really— 
 - Uncle Wang.

379
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:18,959
Cherry, you're back!

380
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:20,960
Uncle Wang, where did you go?

381
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,100
When you're not here, 
 no one plays the cow game with me.

382
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
Then let's play one round. Come on.

383
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,119
♪  On the high mountain, there is a cow  ♪

384
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,700
♪  Two horns and one head  ♪

385
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,300
♪  Four hooves split in eight parts  ♪

386
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,659
♪  The tail grows behind the rump  ♪

387
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:42,200
♪  Behind the rump! Behind the rump!  ♪

388
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,300
Cherry, don't pester Uncle Wang. 
 Go wash your hands and eat.

389
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,200
That's right, Cherry.

390
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,400
Uncle, will you eat with us today?

391
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,600
This time, I'm definitely going 
 to eat faster than you.

392
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,800
Of course. Uncle Wang 
 will be eating with us today.

393
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,659
Let's eat.

394
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:01,200
Well, I… I won't eat here.

395
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,300
I have things to do. I'm very busy.

396
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,370
 Wang Yu. 

397
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,639
 - Wang Yu, we'll buy three bottles.  
 - Aren't you eating?

398
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,599
 - I think it'll be helpful. We'll try it.  
 - Eat first.

399
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:20,579
 Well… 

400
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,980
Just stay and eat with us. Come on.

401
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,140
This can carve patterns.

402
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,100
Why isn't Du Shang here yet?

403
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,700
Didn't we agree to go up the mountain

404
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,880
to celebrate Jiang Qiao Xi's birthday 
 and give him gifts?

405
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,160
Du Shang's surprise is 
 that he is not coming.

406
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,779
- Cao Shuang Yan, what do you mean? 
 - How can you do this?

407
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:47,200
I've been exhausted from work 
 and finally came back,

408
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,800
- yet you can't even stew the trotters tenderly. 
 - All right.

409
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,060
Are you purposely making it hard for me?

410
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,019
The gas cylinder is empty.

411
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:55,000
Why do you always do this 
 every time you come back?

412
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,319
The gas cylinder is empty. Can't she breathe? 
 Does she know to change it?

413
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,840
Can't we talk things over calmly?

414
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,600
Dad, stop hitting mom! 
 She's bleeding already!

415
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,099
Are you still on her side? Do you know 
 who earns money to support you?

416
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:07,099
It's me. Get out of the way.

417
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:11,200
- What are you doing? Du Yong Chun? 
 - Stop fighting!

418
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,300
What do you want to do?

419
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,380
Mom!

420
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,070
 Your medical expenses 
 will be deducted from his bonus. 

421
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,990
 Don't worry. 

422
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,100
 Du Yong Chun, tell me. 
 Why did you hit your wife? 

423
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,200
 What did she do wrong? 

424
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,500
 Manager Jiang, I… I drank too much. 

425
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:50,800
This is what you should do. 
 Divide Du Yong Chun's salary into three parts.

426
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,000
Send two parts to his family, 
 and give one part to him.

427
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,600
Notify the construction site 
 and tell them that I said so.

428
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,460
All right, that's all.

429
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,460
Qiao Xi, come here.

430
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,639
Your birthday is coming up, 
 so I've prepared a birthday gift for you.

431
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,400
Do you like it?

432
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,490
It's black again.

433
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:19,690
Did my mom choose it, or did you?

434
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,380
Your mom and I chose it together.

435
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:29,179
Black suits you better. 
 Black is more suitable for boys.

436
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,810
Qiao Xi,

437
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,900
I've been busy with work, 
 so I can't see you off.

438
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,800
The day after tomorrow, 
 Mom will take you back to the provincial city.

439
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,500
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

440
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,600
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

441
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,700
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

442
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,500
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

443
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:25,039
- Jiang Qiao Xi. 
  - Happy birthday! 

444
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,860
These flowers were picked before winter.

445
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,820
Mom helped me air-dry them 
 and turn them into preserved flowers,

446
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,300
the kind that never withers.

447
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,620
You like black, though.

448
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,600
I've never seen black flowers in Qunshan,

449
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,600
so I used ink to dye them black.

450
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,200
Do you think black is a nice color?

451
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,780
We don't like black that much,

452
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,239
but you wear black every day.

453
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:57,000
Your pencil case, pens, water bottle, 
 and even the eraser are all black.

454
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,700
We've never seen so much black 
 all on one person at the same time.

455
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,139
Even so, Lin Cherry said,

456
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:08,500
if you like someone, 
 you have to accept them for who they are.

457
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
That's not the kind of "liking" I meant.

458
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,700
- What kind of "liking"? 
 - You!

459
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,300
I… I like it a lot.

460
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,100
Then say something.

461
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:28,039
Thank you all.

462
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,300
Jiang Qiao Xi, make a wish.

463
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,200
Jiang Qiao Xi, happy birthday.

464
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,639
Du Shang, you didn't miss anything.

465
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:42,860
We're on to the wishing part. 
 Come on!

466
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,300
We've been waiting for you. 
 How can we do it without you?

467
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:51,539
Jiang Qiao Xi, happy birthday.

468
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:57,600
Du Shang, I want to give you this wish.

469
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,670
You should make a wish!

470
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,299
Hurry!

471
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:19,747
♫  Love is in your eyes  ♫

472
00:36:19,747 --> 00:36:24,662
♫  You will see flowers blooming  ♫

473
00:36:24,662 --> 00:36:27,160
♫  Every minute and every second  ♫

474
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,820
♫  I will always be with you  ♫

475
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,560
Jiang Qiao Xi, remember

476
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,199
this is your home. 
 You must come back early.

477
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,659
Cherry, thank you.

478
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,200
For what? You are great, too.

479
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,980
You even gave your birthday wish 
 to Du Shang.

480
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,790
Who would give up their birthday wish?

481
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,100
Anyway, none of the wishes I've made 
 have ever come true.

482
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:00,880
Then what wish do you have? 
 I'll help you fulfill it.

483
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,940
Actually,

484
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,900
I don't like black,

485
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,799
but I like the gifts you all gave me.

486
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:12,400
Today, I like black for the first time.

487
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,700
Don't you like black?

488
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,900
Then why is everything you wear black?

489
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,140
My older brother was the one 
 who liked black.

490
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:28,800
They bought these for me, 
 and they said I must like black,

491
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,800
so I can only like black.

492
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,900
They don't love me for who I am.

493
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,560
Then what color do you like?

494
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,240
I never thought about it,

495
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,200
but I'm beginning to like black.

496
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,850
What about other colors? 
 Think of another color.

497
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,900
You'll like it later.

498
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,939
Red. I like red.

499
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:06,300
Jiang Qiao Xi, on my birthday, 
 I will make a wish for you.

500
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:11,000
I'll wish your parents love you 
 just the way you are, all right?

501
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,170
What about your wish, then?

502
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,910
What is your wish?

503
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,370
My wish is

504
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:26,510
that we all stay together  
 and never become separated.

505
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:31,000
Then keep your wish.

506
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,070
It means more to me.

507
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,400
Qiao Xi, get the door.

508
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:17,579
 Cherry, it's you. 

509
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:21,000
Uncle Jiang, I bought shrimp buns. 
 Do you want some?

510
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,800
Yes.

511
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,600
There is no need. 
 Keep it and eat it yourself. Thank you.

512
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,400
Cherry, bring them in. Come in.

513
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,600
Will you eat them?

514
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,080
Do you know what kind of meat 
 these buns are made of?

515
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,000
Little girl, thank you. 
 We don't eat store-bought buns.

516
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,279
Qiao Xi, close the door, 
 or the cold air will come in.

517
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,700
 Don't tell Cherry about this. 

518
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,219
 Wait until school starts. 
 Then you can tell her. 

519
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:11,499
Maybe since they won't see each other 
 over winter break,

520
00:40:11,499 --> 00:40:14,300
she'll react better to the news.

521
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,659
I don't think so.

522
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:21,700
Then what do you suggest? 
 That child, seriously…

523
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,200
He comes and leaves just like that.

524
00:40:35,779 --> 00:40:41,819
Dad, Mom, who is leaving?

525
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:43,700
It's not Jiang Qiao Xi, is it?

526
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,300
He said he would come back 
 after the winter break.

527
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,600
He is not a liar.

528
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:56,410
I'm going to ask Jiang Qiao Xi.

529
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:59,260
He said he would come back 
 after the winter break!

530
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:02,219
Why would he lie to me?

531
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:06,039
Cherry, Auntie Liang has settled her work,

532
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:10,679
so she wants Qiao Xi 
 back to the provincial city.

533
00:41:21,139 --> 00:41:25,400
Well… I… Th-Then next time.

534
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,600
- Take care. 
 - All right, next time.

535
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,900
Uncle Wang!

536
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,920
Cherry, study hard!

537
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,230
I mean…

538
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,610
don't turn out like me in the future.

539
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:17,420
- Jiang Qiao Xi! 
 - Jiang Qiao Xi!

540
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,019
 Jiang Qiao Xi! 

541
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:22,359
Jiang Qiao Xi!

542
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,820
 Jiang Qiao Xi! 

543
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:32,099
Jiang Qiao Xi, you must write to me!

544
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:35,720
Cherry, I'll be back after the winter break!

545
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:40,240
Cherry, I'll be back after the winter break!

546
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,130
I know that no matter how brave I am,

547
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:54,460
I can't grow wings.

 Dad said,

00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:20,539
 people are like silkworms, snakes, and crabs. 

552
00:44:20,539 --> 00:44:24,439
 When the time comes, 
 we should break out of our cocoon. 

553
00:44:24,439 --> 00:44:28,100
 Only by letting go 
 and forgetting certain things, 

554
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:34,100
 can we move forward with ease 
 and live better lives.
