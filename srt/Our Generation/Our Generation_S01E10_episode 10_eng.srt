Title

3
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,116
 

4
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,519
Incoming call.

5
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,348
Qin Ye Yun.

6
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,412
Is this okay?

7
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,820
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

8
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,700
Qin Ye Yun contacted me
to help Cherry and Jiang Qiao Xi.

9
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:03,120
This won't be easy.

10
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,680
Let's go together.

11
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,779
If you can't handle it, we'll help you.

12
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:11,999
Aren't you going to ask what it's about?

13
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:16,428
Jiang Qiao Xi and Cherry's situation
must relate to his mother's issues.

14
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,400
What else could it be?

15
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,888
Good guess.

16
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:22,740
But you really can't help with this.

17
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,300
Whether helpful or not, the more people the better.

18
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,499
Come on, let's go.

19
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:29,379
Yu Qiao, are you really going?

20
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:31,319
Why not?

21
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,339
We've grown up with Cherry since childhood.

22
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:36,179
Of course we're going, let's go.

23
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,108
Jiang Qiao Xi.

24
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:57,960
 

25
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,900
Hello, Ms. Liang.

26
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,700
Ms. He said she needs
to discuss something with Jiang Qiao Xi.

27
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,179
Did she mention what it's about?

28
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:08,900
She said there's study material to give him.

29
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,512
What material?

30
00:03:10,512 --> 00:03:12,179
What material?

31
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:17,040
Probably exam-related materials.

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,579
Let me call Ms. He.

33
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:25,692
Hello?

34
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,352
How could this be?

35
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,179
I'm coming now.

36
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,200
Zhang, accompany him to get the materials.

37
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,320
- Then take him to the training camp.
- Okay.

38
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,999
Do as I said.

39
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:40,080
Ms. Liang, you're not taking this car?

40
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,127
About the ratio I mentioned earlier.

41
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:44,224
 

42
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:52,928
 

43
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:07,100
The good news is Jiang Qiao Xi's mother left.

44
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,540
The bad news is the driver
came with him for the materials.

45
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,256
Well...

46
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,920
We need another plan.

47
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,239
Don't worry, I'll distract the driver.

48
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:33,600
You quickly pass the items to Jiang Qiao Xi.

49
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,500
Jiang Qiao Xi, didn't you leave with your mother?

50
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,820
Ms. He, I think I forgot some materials.

51
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,099
Cen Xiao Man already organized
all the materials for you.

52
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:56,139
She did a thorough job. There's nothing more.

53
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:58,839
Ms. He, you shouldn't be so definitive.

54
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,519
There must be something missing.

55
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,000
Why are you making a fuss?

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,180
That material was prepared
by me and Cen Xiao Man together.

57
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,000
Qiao Xi, don't you have class this afternoon?

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,659
- Didn't your mom ask me to get you there on time?
- Yes.

59
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:17,279
Cai Fang Yuan, what's with all the eye-rolling
and facial expressions?

60
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,560
Ms. He, he's just worried
I might forget something.

61
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,700
Since there's nothing forgotten,
I'll take my leave now.

62
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,200
Okay.

63
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,440
Jiang Qiao Xi, good luck with the competition!

64
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,792
Thank you, Ms. He.

65
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:48,360
Come on.

66
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:57,380
Didn't Jiang Qiao Xi already leave with Ms. Liang?

67
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,592
Who's that person with him?

68
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,020
Qun Shan and those people
usually eat in the cafeteria, right?

69
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,936
What are they doing here?

70
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:15,000
 

71
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,679
Qiao Xi, I'm going to eat noodles over there.

72
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,520
You can wait in the car or outside. Your choice.

73
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,419
But I'll just take half an hour.

74
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,159
Keep an eye on the time.

75
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,296
Thank you, Uncle.

76
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,580
Do you like it?

77
00:07:08,992 --> 00:07:11,020
Have some too.

78
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,824
It's all yours.

79
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,279
I want to eat with you.

80
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:20,180
Then I'll have a bite too.

81
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,020
Jiang Qiao Xi, when you're alone...

82
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,880
Do you often feel lonely?

83
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,219
No. My loneliness doesn't come from being alone.

84
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,020
Then where does it come from?

85
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,520
From meeting you.

86
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:58,860
Meeting me?

87
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,599
Before I turned ten, I was always alone.

88
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,979
But solving math problems
kept the loneliness away.

89
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,960
After meeting you, even math doesn't help anymore.

90
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,719
I can't overcome the loneliness now.

91
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,380
That means your math problems
aren't challenging enough.

92
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:29,120
Right. I need to find a problem
harder than you are.

93
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:32,488
What do you mean by that?

94
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,139
How have you been at school lately?

95
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,100
I can handle everything else.

96
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,019
But physics is just too difficult.

97
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:59,699
How are you so good at solving problems?

98
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:01,039
That's nothing special.

99
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,140
Just applying formulas mechanically.

100
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,700
You're the amazing one,
solving tough problems without formulas.

101
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,279
If I'm so impressive...

102
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:16,219
Why didn't you dare look at me
in the office earlier then?

103
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,620
You didn't look at me either.

104
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,500
That's because I...

105
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,039
Because what?

106
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,739
You first! Why didn't you?

107
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,919
Just because...

108
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:45,520
You look like such a grown-up today.

109
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,570
Want some water?

110
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,230
No need.

111
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:12,039
After exerting so much effort
and spending all these years,

112
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:15,360
I finally get this chance
to have a meal with Lin Cherry.

113
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,280
I need to eat more.

114
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:23,159
We'll definitely have more chances
to eat together in the future.

115
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:31,140
You, me, Qin Ye Yun, Yu Qiao, Du Shang, and Cai Fang Yuan.

116
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,320
We'll share many more meals together.

117
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,320
We'll eat our way through the provincial city,
then across the entire country.

118
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,779
But I don't want to eat across the country.

119
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:46,319
I just want to eat meals made by Ms. Juan.

120
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:48,619
Just like when we were kids.

121
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,639
Then you'll have to pay for meals
like you did back then.

122
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,960
Fine. I'll wait until
I've earned enough for meals.

123
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,539
What kind of spell has Lin Qi Le
cast on Jiang Qiao Xi?

124
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:13,140
He actually followed her into that alley!

125
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,620
Hanging out with that kind of person
will ruin his future.

126
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,299
What's the big deal?

127
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:19,920
They just used to play together as children.

128
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,240
They're just holding onto
old habits as they grow up.

129
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,159
It's nothing. I don't care at all.

130
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:28,299
Are you telling me this, or convincing yourself?

131
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:30,360
Xiao Man, stop deceiving yourself.

132
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,020
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

133
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,579
You know better than anyone.

134
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:37,759
Jiang Qiao Xi treats Lin Qi Le differently
from everyone else.

135
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,420
So what? It's just temporary.

136
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,279
Jiang Qiao Xi is the best and most outstanding.

137
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,059
As long as I remain the most outstanding,
he'll see clearly.

138
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,779
Do you really think this has anything
to do with being outstanding?

139
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,539
You're the best. He's the best.

140
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:55,080
So naturally, you two should be together.

141
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,500
Even if that's irrelevant,
we knew Jiang Qiao Xi first.

142
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,900
I met Jiang Qiao Xi first!

143
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,659
Xiao Man, calm down. How about this?

144
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:06,579
Let's tell Ms. Liang about this.

145
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:07,840
Wasn't that Ms. Liang's own idea?

146
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,400
She told us to keep an eye on Jiang Qiao Xi.

147
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,379
We need to guide him back to the right path.

148
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:16,240
This is my personal matter. I'll handle it myself.

149
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,480
I don't need to involve Ms. Liang.

150
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,979
- Finish it and hand it to me.
- Okay.

151
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,319
Hello, Ms. He.

152
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:31,400
Xiao Man, come here.

153
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,220
You did an excellent job
leading the basketball cheer squad today.

154
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,360
Today's performance was truly wonderful.

155
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,539
Thank you, Ms. He. I still have much to improve.

156
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:42,539
No need for modesty.
You have great organizational skills.

157
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:45,079
Lin Qi Le has no dance background,
yet she performed so well.

158
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:47,020
Your coach wouldn't stop praising you.

159
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,019
Both of you have brought honor to our class.

160
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,960
Ms. He, it's not just
about being basketball cheer squads.

161
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,880
I'll also strive academically
to bring glory to our class.

162
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,939
Good girl.

163
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:05,412
You and Lin Qi Le's relationship has grown even closer through this cheerleading experience.

164
00:13:05,412 --> 00:13:07,400
Help her more with studies from now on.

165
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,140
She's not slow-witted and works diligently.

166
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,020
She's just new and can't keep up
with our pace yet.

167
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,260
Guide her more.

168
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,320
Such a good student shouldn't actually
get transferred out of Class 18, right?

169
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,980
Don't worry, Ms. He.

170
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,299
I'll help Lin Qi Le.

171
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,759
- Goodbye, Ms. He.
- Okay.

172
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:57,600
You're right. We should help Jiang Qiao Xi.

173
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,659
Bring him back to the right path.

174
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:02,200
I'll call Ms. Liang right now.

175
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,872
No.

176
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:11,579
Ms. Liang shouldn't be the only one
knowing about this.

177
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Yu Qiao, what's wrong?

178
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,212
Nothing.

179
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:21,039
Then why stay silent?

180
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,079
Lin Cherry and Jiang Qiao Xi are going too far.

181
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,299
They insist on hiding together
eating snacks alone.

182
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:30,260
It's not like you've never had date buns.

183
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,620
Martial arts made you
muscle-brained and simple-minded.

184
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,220
You think they're really
just eating date buns right now?

185
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,159
Of course not!

186
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,920
Aren't they also having stuffed lotus root?

187
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,379
Reading all those teen novels
didn't improve your comprehension.

188
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,919
Yu Qiao, didn't Feng Le Tian promise
to lend you 'Zhu Xian' first?

189
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,640
But Huang Zhan Jie snatched it first.

190
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,320
Huang Zhan Jie said you wouldn't mind.

191
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,840
I wouldn't mind? How does he know I don't mind?

192
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,260
I see. But getting it back now would be tough.

193
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,439
He's currently reading Zhang Xiao Fan's
'Seven Meridians Tournament arc'.

194
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:11,560
That part's super exciting. He won't return it.

195
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:15,779
Then why should I put up with it?

196
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,379
Doesn't he understand first come, first served?

197
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:23,860
Since when did 'first come' matter so much?

198
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,860
What's meant for you will cut queues to reach you.

199
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,779
If it's not yours,
you can't complain even if others cut in.

200
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:35,059
Qin Ye Yun, say that again.

201
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,600
I'll jot this down and tell Feng Le Tian to put it in his novel.

202
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,020
Move!

203
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,759
Jia Si Si and Hu Yan.

204
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,299
What are these two gossips doing here?

205
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:54,420
Their mouths leak like sieves,
it spills everything.

206
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,999
If they find out...

207
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,279
What are you two doing here?

208
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,579
Then what are you doing here?

209
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,000
What else would we do at the basketball court?

210
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,880
What about you? Are you
going to collect some new gossip again?

211
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,459
We're just wandering around aimlessly.

212
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:18,779
Wandering aimlessly.

213
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,079
Not random wandering.

214
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,360
Yu Qiao, let me tell you something.

215
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,259
We've both heard Jiang Qiao Xi and Lin Qi Len are there alone together.

216
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:30,299
Really? Who said that?

217
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:32,360
Never mind that. Just keep playing basketball.

218
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,140
Really? Who told you? Reliable?

219
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,020
Source confidential. The info's legit.

220
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,579
If you all refuse to believe it, then come see with us.

221
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:44,700
Yu Qiao, you'd better not go.

222
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,000
As classmates, we don't want you to feel hurt.

223
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,792
Go.

224
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:55,999
Including the time from here to the car,
there's about one minute left.

225
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,860
What can you do in one minute?

226
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,880
We're so silly. Why obsess over one minute?

227
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,820
Actually, we've been very lucky today.

228
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,939
I accomplished something amazing.

229
00:17:29,939 --> 00:17:33,480
We even had a meal together.

230
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,979
We should feel satisfied.

231
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:37,080
But I'm not satisfied.

232
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,280
Cherry, you shouldn't feel satisfied either.

233
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,440
We shouldn't be like this.

234
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,588
Hello.

235
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,536
What's wrong?

236
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,759
Come here.

237
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,400
Where are you going?

238
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,479
What's the matter?

239
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:09,459
Jia Si Si, Hu Yan.

240
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:12,979
Do you two know why people love gossiping?

241
00:18:12,979 --> 00:18:15,380
What do you mean?

242
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:20,720
Because no one listens
when they talk about themselves.

243
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,500
Yu Qiao, you actually said something reasonable. You're so impressive.

244
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,000
Feng Le Tian's absence is such a loss.

245
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,979
He missed out on collecting
so many golden quotes for his material.

246
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:30,060
Yu Qiao, what do you mean by that?

247
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,519
Can you stop being so sarcastic when you speak?

248
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:35,479
Don't take your anger out on us
if you're mad at others.

249
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:39,140
Why so defensive? I didn't say it was you.

250
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,820
Jia Si Si and Hu Yan are coming.

251
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
Jia Si Si?

252
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,500
Then why are you climbing the wall?

253
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,580
Just listen to me.

254
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,779
I'll do it!

255
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:50,560
Let's go.

256
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,680
Jia Si Si, when will you update
that comic you're drawing?

257
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,540
What comic?

258
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,519
The one similar to 'Meteor Garden',

259
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,420
where several boys chase one girl.

260
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,320
Si Si, you actually draw that kind of comic?

261
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,360
Why didn't you tell me about this?

262
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,720
How do you know about it? You went through my stuff without asking.

263
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,360
I'm not that free.

264
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,119
Your junior high friend Wu Shuang
is in the same cheer squad as me.

265
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,980
After you showed her, she let me take a glance.

266
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,680
We all think you draw well
and the story's interesting.

267
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:22,719
Really? I just draw for fun casually.

268
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:24,080
Hurry up and climb here too.

269
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,000
Be careful, you go up first.

270
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,760
Stay still, I'll come help you.

271
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:32,759
It's so high.

272
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:35,459
- I'll go down first. Don't move!
- Okay.

273
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,420
Even casual drawings reflect your own story.

274
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,219
Instead of caring about others' stories,
focus on your own.

275
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:46,720
Your own story is fascinating too.

276
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,990
Alright.

277
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,620
Wait a second, Qin Ye Yun.

278
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,019
You used to look down on everyone.

279
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:55,159
Why are you being so nice today?

280
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,740
I get it now.

281
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,500
Si Si, don't listen to their nonsense.

282
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,279
They're all from Qun Shan. They're friends of Lin Qi Le.

283
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,880
They're shouting so loudly must be buying time for those two,

284
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,420
let's go.

285
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,880
Move.

286
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,530
Let me help you up.

287
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,288
I can do it.

288
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,688
I'm okay.

289
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,240
There's a dog!

290
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,059
Don't run, Jiang Qiao Xi!

291
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:23,400
Don't run. Put me down!

292
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,344
Let me go!

293
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,920
Stop running!

294
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,600
text

295
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,244
Nothing.

296
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,344
No one's here.

297
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:55,719
Stop chasing us, please!

298
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,579
Are you okay?

299
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:08,580
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

300
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,400
- Let me help you up. 
 - I'm okay, really.

301
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,320
- Did you get hurt?
- Are you okay?

302
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,540
No, you cushioned me.

303
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:18,432
Didn't get hurt.

304
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,640
What's wrong?

305
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,820
You're bleeding!

306
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,440
You're bleeding!

307
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,976
Cherry.

308
00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:37,896
Let me take you to the hospital.

309
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,044
 

310
00:21:54,044 --> 00:21:57,280
 

311
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:20,196
 

312
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,559
Cherry, haven't gone back to school yet?

313
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,679
Uncle, I'm really sorry.

314
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,439
I caused you so much trouble.

315
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:33,599
I'm so sorry.

316
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,800
You've been apologizing all this time.

317
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,820
We're still waiting for the examination.

318
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,140
Let's wait for the test results first.

319
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,690
Zhang.

320
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,790
Mr. Jiang.

321
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,040
- How's Qiao Xi? 
 - Still being examined.

322
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,699
- He's in the scanning room.
- Scanning room?

323
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:51,680
- I'll go check.
- Alright.

324
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:56,559
Cherry, why are you here?

325
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,040
Mr. Jiang, I...

326
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,219
Jiang Qiao Xi, he...

327
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:06,040
He was hit by an electric bike

328
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,679
to protect me.

329
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,939
It's okay, stop crying.

330
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:16,896
I'm sorry.

331
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,300
I'll go check on him. Don't worry.

332
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,999
Let's ignite the passion within us.

333
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:03,559
Let this power propel us forward.

334
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,760
Cherry!

335
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,580
How is he?

336
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,280
How's Jiang Qiao Xi? Is he okay?

337
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,459
He's fine. Just lost
a lot of blood and needs stitches.

338
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:28,900
Jia Si Si told us it's Cen Xiao Man and Fei Lin Ge
who ratted you out.

339
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,192
I knew it.

340
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,020
I'll go back to class first.

341
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,610
Cherry.

342
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,840
Cen Xiao Man is crying in the classroom.

343
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,939
Jiang Qiao Xi's injury
has made her feel so wronged.

344
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:48,300
She thinks it's all because of you.

345
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:53,360
When you go back,
if she and those girls confront you...

346
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:01,664
I'm not afraid anymore.

347
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,919
Not afraid of this, nor of them.

348
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,159
They should fear me. Fear me confronting them.

349
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,039
What are you standing around for? Let's go!

350
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:35,339
Your mom already got
the electric bike driver's number from Zhang.

351
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,140
About how did your accident happen,

352
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,140
and under what circumstances did it happen.

353
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,340
She's found out everything now.

354
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,150
Qiao Xi,

355
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,400
the most important thing right now

356
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,100
should be your studies.

357
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,859
Dad, how can you still
say such things at a time like this?

358
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,032
Please help me.

359
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,030
Or rather,

360
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,610
help our family this time.

361
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,090
My mom told me

362
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,850
that if I keep in touch with Lin Cherry again,

363
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:17,519
she'll transfer Mr. Lin
to the Fujian construction site.

364
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:18,940
Dad,

365
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,620
moving a whole family to an unfamiliar place

366
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,840
is something you understand better than anyone.

367
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,000
If she really harms Mr. Lin,

368
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,900
I'll fight back.

369
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,672
Fight back?

370
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,019
How exactly will you do so?

371
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,920
I'll report her

372
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,310
for abusing power.

373
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,240
You're mother and son. Why has it come to this?

374
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,680
Why did it come to this?

375
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,919
Dad, the reason Mom and I have reached this point,

376
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,960
isn't there any responsibility on you as a father?

377
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,120
All these years,
whenever I had conflicts with her,

378
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,860
you acted like an invisible man.

379
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,799
Completely ignoring her feelings,
and completely ignoring mine.

380
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:20,259
Only after she completely suppressed me
and claimed victory,

381
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:24,319
would you step out to comment
on her actions and offer consolation.

382
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,340
Are you completely detached from this family?

383
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:32,759
All these years, you've never
positioned yourself in the storm.

384
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:39,860
Son, I've been in the storm all these years.

385
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,100
I've never escaped it.

386
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,420
Yes, your so-called 'storm'

387
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,860
was just arguing with her about
who was wrong in that incident.

388
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,799
What about now? I'm your child too.

389
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,880
You're not an outsider between her and me.

390
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,039
Do you think what she's doing to me is right?

391
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,260
If it's wrong,

392
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:09,770
can't you stand up and say something?

393
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,744
Just this once?

394
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,060
Cen Xiao Man just finished
calling Jiang Qiao Xi's mother.

395
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,499
How could this be fake?

396
00:28:17,499 --> 00:28:19,360
Jiang Qiao Xi's mother said it herself.

397
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,030
Jiang Qiao Xi needed stitches.

398
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,990
She's furious!

399
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:26,140
Is Jiang Qiao Xi trying to destroy himself?

400
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,199
Lin Qi Le, what exactly
did you do to Jiang Qiao Xi?

401
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,320
Qiao Xi,

402
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,740
son.

403
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,580
Tell me what you want.

404
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,359
Why should I tell you what I did to Jiang Qiao Xi?

405
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,670
But I can tell you

406
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,220
what I'm about to do to Jiang Qiao Xi.

407
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:40,040
I'll become good friends with Jiang Qiao Xi.

408
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,210
I want to be friends with Lin Cherry

409
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,470
openly and honestly.

410
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,519
At school,

411
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,519
I'll eat with him and friends I choose myself.

412
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,999
We'll go to school together.

413
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,319
And leave school together.

414
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,839
We'll take the bus.

415
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,792
Or ride bicycles.

416
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,079
If we have time on weekends...

417
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:02,912
We'll go hiking together.

418
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:05,839
- Just like when we were kids.
- Just like when we were kids.

419
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:08,384
 ♫ Summer cherries are a bit cool ♫ 

420
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,716
 ♫ I gaze from afar ♫ 

421
00:30:10,716 --> 00:30:13,028
 ♫ The unspoken wishes of that year ♫ 

422
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:16,228
 ♫ Familiar shadows lengthen ♫ 

423
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:18,008
 ♫ Beyond sight ♫

 ♫ Your silhouette is so gentle ♫ 

425
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:26,176
 ♫ The world is spinning ♫ 

426
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:30,040
Judging from Lin Qi Le's tone,

427
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,760
Jiang Qiao Xi really
has a close relationship with her.

428
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,240
Even though Jiang Qiao Xi got hurt,
he did it willingly.

429
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,668
 ♫ Clear as yesterday ♫ 

430
00:30:40,668 --> 00:30:43,620
 ♫ Reality is in front of me ♫ 

431
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,640
Lin Qi Le, do you know
Jiang Qiao Xi's mother hates you?

432
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,360
I know. But Jiang Qiao Xi doesn't hate me.

433
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,479
And I don't need to be friends
with his mother either.

434
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:57,299
But you two aren't even from the same world!

435
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,340
Say whatever you want.

436
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,900
But what I want to tell you

437
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:07,359
is that your gossip can't affect us anymore.

438
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:14,300
 ♫ You're the key to all I dream ♫ 

439
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:19,420
 ♫ Accompany you to become yourself ♫ 

440
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,464
 ♫ The story sprouts ♫ 

441
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:25,120
 ♫ My stubbornness grows wildly ♫ 

442
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,328
 ♫ I can't stop running ♫ 

443
00:31:27,328 --> 00:31:30,844
 ♫ The silent call of the dream ♫ 

444
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:39,099
I think she might actually grow wings.

445
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:41,600
 I read that if you jump hard enough, 

446
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,120
 and jump far enough, wings will grow on your back. 

447
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,300
 And then... 

448
00:31:47,904 --> 00:31:53,176
 ♫ I've always been here ♫ 

449
00:31:53,176 --> 00:31:56,520
 ♫ Rotating light in my palm ♫ 

450
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,396
 ♫ Illuminating your cheeks ♫ 

451

 ♫ A smile that ran too fast ♫ 

452
00:32:03,132 --> 00:32:09,748
 ♫ Unexpectedly preserved ♫ 

453
00:32:12,004 --> 00:32:13,880
Let me see.

454
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,648
The scan results are in. No intracranial bleeding.

455
00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:19,500
It's superficial. Nothing serious.

456
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,940
Does it hurt?

457
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,520
No.

458
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,239
You lost so much blood and needed stitches.

459
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:42,304
How could it not hurt?

460
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,699
You kids forget the pain once it's gone,

461
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:48,879
but mothers carry that pain forever.

462
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,484
Do you understand?

463
00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:58,144
Take your medicine.

464
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,419
Medication precautions:

465
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:12,359
Avoid broad beans, fish,
and cold acidic foods for 24 hours.

466
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:15,499
I know. The doctor already told me.

467
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:21,360
But do you know these restrictions are meant to protect you?

468
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,779
Otherwise you'll end up in real trouble,
bleeding like today!

469
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,919
They're just minor injuries. I'm not in pain.

470
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,500
I'm going back to my room.

471
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:38,159
You think it doesn't hurt?

472
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:43,799
Then pay the bills you owe.

473
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:47,160
I've told you before. You know this.

474
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,460
Mom, do you think I can't handle it?

475
00:33:56,539 --> 00:33:59,019
I'm afraid you won't be able to handle it.

476
00:33:59,019 --> 00:34:00,820
Let me tell you, Mom.

477
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,820
If you dare to...

478
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,599
Liang Hong Fei, I'm warning you.

479
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:11,219
If you do anything to the Lin family,
I'll report your abuse of power!

480
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,400
Jiang Zheng, you're becoming
more successful as a leader,

481
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,400
and even better at being a father.

482
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,460
You failed to protect my Meng Chu back then.

483
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,960
Now you're letting Jiang Qiao Xi
throw himself away?

484
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:32,200
I don't want to revisit the past.

485
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:37,380
Right now, Qiao Xi just wants normal friendships.

486
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,748
How does that become
'throwing himself away' in your mouth?

487
00:34:39,748 --> 00:34:41,700
What kind of friend?

488
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,699
When he was little, your son
jumped off from here because of her.

489
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:47,119
He limped all the way back to Qun Shan.

490
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,200
Now again because of her,
he fell and got covered in blood.

491
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,619
If this is happening now,
do you dare imagine the future?

492
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:55,960
What kind of friend is this? She's a disaster!

493
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,240
Liang Hong Fei, he became like this
because you pushed him too hard!

494
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,320
If we're talking about disasters,
we're both the real disasters.

495
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,379
You don't deserve to be the father
of my two children!

496
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,939
Since neither of you fathers and sons
want the Lins to leave,

497
00:35:32,939 --> 00:35:37,200
then we'll transfer to an international school,
the farther the better.

498
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,600
I'll accompany you. Let's move away.

499
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,399
I know transferring schools is easy for you.

500
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:57,079
But the Olympiad Winter Camp is about to start.

501
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:01,480
I'm worried transferring schools
might affect my performance.

502
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,100
Do you have any idea what you're saying?

503
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,060
You're saying such things for someone like her?

504
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,619
You were chosen for mathematics.

505
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:21,519
No matter what happens,
you should choose math, not her.

506
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:24,399
This has nothing to do with choosing someone.

507
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:30,700
If we're really talking about choices,
I chose myself.

508
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,179
I chose my own life.

509
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,959
Why do you get to choose
your life however you want?

510
00:36:57,959 --> 00:37:02,620
What about me? What about my life?

511
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:11,208
Mom.

512
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:19,680
Why are you demanding your life from me?

513
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:29,024
I'm sorry, Mom.

514
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:35,699
I want to win back the trophy for Jiang Meng Chu.

515
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,899
Can I start working on problems now?

516
00:37:42,979 --> 00:37:46,180
You're using your brother
to pressure me, aren't you?

517
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,100
No.

518
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,759
It's you who's been using
Jiang Meng Chu to pressure me.

519
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:26,519
Ms. Liang, please have some water first.

520
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:28,540
No need.

521
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,280
I came over uninvited today and disturbed you.

522
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,139
But as fellow mothers, I hope you can understand.

523
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:41,240
Did something happen, Ms. Liang?

524
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,760
During my meeting this afternoon,
the driver called me.

525
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,860
Jiang Qiao Xi was hit by an electric bike.

526
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,700
He fell and split his head open,
and needed several stitches.

527
00:38:56,019 --> 00:38:58,600
Is Qiao Xi okay now?

528
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:06,759
Cherry, I heard he was with you
when he got injured.

529
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,660
As his mother, my son suffered such serious injuries.

530
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,480
I need to know why this happened.

531
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,800
Cherry, tell me and Ms. Liang
exactly what happened.

532
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,259
What exactly happened?

533
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,360
I'm sorry, Ms. Liang.

534
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,136
Jiang Qiao Xi got hurt protecting me.

535
00:39:35,136 --> 00:39:36,850
Cherry.

536
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,860
Ms. Liang, I'm truly sorry.

537
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,119
We'll cover Qiao Xi's medical expenses.

538
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:45,120
If there's anything else we should do, I...

539
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,220
Never mind the medical expenses.

540
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,520
I just want to understand what really happened.

541
00:39:54,340 --> 00:40:00,500
Cherry, my driver was supposed to take
Qiao Xi to the Olympiad Camp this afternoon.

542
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,110
Why was he with you?

543
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,440
Why did he get injured saving you?

544
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:09,840
Speak up.

545
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:15,160
This afternoon, we were in the alley
where I brought him some food.

546
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,439
When classmates approached, we hid to avoid them.

547
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:20,800
Then the accident happened.

548
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,519
Why were you hiding from classmates?

549
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:25,160
We were worried classmates
would misunderstand if they saw us.

550
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,028
Misunderstand what?

551
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,599
Ms. Liang, Jiang Qiao Xi and I
truly didn't do anything wrong.

552
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,119
We're just good friends.

553
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,850
Cherry,

554
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,380
there's no need to be nervous.

555
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,139
I'm not blaming you.

556
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:44,219
You're young and inexperienced.

557
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,270
Sheng Juan,

558
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,090
last incident already caused embarrassment.

559
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:57,860
Now this accident happens again.

560
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:01,759
Ms. Liang, we've caused you trouble.

561
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:09,639
I'm not worried about our Qiao Xi.

562
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,459
Since he's a boy.

563
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:15,559
And he's popular with female classmates at school.

564
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:20,380
I completely understand
Cherry wanting to spend time with him.

565
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,900
But Cherry is a girl after all.

566
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:28,539
I don't want Qiao Xi
to give Cherry any reason for gossip.

567
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:31,840
Ms. Liang, this has nothing to do with gender.

568
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,599
My friendship with Jiang Qiao Xi
isn't about his popularity either.

569
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,304
Cherry.

570
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,400
This child speaks too bluntly.

571
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:47,559
She's just a child. It's fine.

572
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,032
Then I won't disturb you.

573
00:41:54,059 --> 00:41:56,779
Our apologies for the trouble, Ms. Liang.

574
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,630
Sheng Juan,

575
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,430
children don't know boundaries well.

576
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:16,339
But we parents
must set proper boundaries for them.

577
00:42:17,499 --> 00:42:20,519
Otherwise, those rumors outside

578
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:25,760
will target both our children and us.

579
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,579
If they call it indulgence later,
that's the kinder version.

580
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,130
If they accuse us of instigation,

581
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,010
it'll be worse.

582
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,079
Ms. Liang, please take care.

583
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,939
How could she say that about you and Dad?

584
00:42:44,939 --> 00:42:48,459
It's okay. Qiao Xi had an accident.

585
00:42:48,459 --> 00:42:52,460
Your Ms. Liang spoke out of fear and anxiety.

586
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:02,300
