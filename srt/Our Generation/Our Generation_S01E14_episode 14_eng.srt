1
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:39,008
 

2
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:50,159
Lin Cherry, why are you leaving alone? Talk to me.

3
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,819
I don't want to be around him.

4
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:52,980
Who?

5
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,980
Nobody. It doesn't matter anymore.

6
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,340
Then why are you so upset?
Who are you talking about?

7
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,080
Fine, I'll call Jiang Qiao Xi to come comfort you.

8
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,980
Why would you call him?
What does it have to do with him?

9
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,820
Alright, how did Jiang Qiao Xi upset you?

10
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:24,020
She's not picking up my calls, either.

11
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,539
Jiang Qiao Xi, what did you do?

12
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:30,340
Nothing. Did she mention where she was going?

13
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,340
Jiang Qiao Xi.

14
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,520
No.

15
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,280
Jiang Qiao Xi, I'm Sorry.

16
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,039
I didn't know you hadn't told Lin Qi Le
that you'd study abroad.

17
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,979
You're going abroad? How come we didn't know?

18
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:45,780
Does Cherry know? You didn't tell her either?

19
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,900
How does Feng Le Tian know?

20
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,219
Cherry had to learn about it from Feng Le Tian?

21
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:54,939
I overheard it in the teacher's office.

22
00:02:54,939 --> 00:03:00,140
Jiang Qiao Xi, do you know what Cherry fears most?

23
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,899
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:29,159
His plan has nothing to do with me.
He doesn't have to tell me.

25
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:35,060
I'm used to it anyway.
It's been like this since forever.

26
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:40,480
He's just a friend who's been
coming over for dinner lately.

27
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,119
We're classmates and neighbors. Nothing else.

28
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,260
Really?

29
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,928
Maybe. Maybe that's what Jiang Qiao Xi thinks.

30
00:03:56,928 --> 00:03:59,380
But that's not what you think.

31
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,539
That's exactly what I think. I see it clearly.

32
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:08,159
I'm a friend of his, just like you guys.

33
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,599
If that's what you think, why are you so upset?

34
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,820
He didn't tell me anything. Do I look bothered?

35
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:25,739
Where are you going?

36
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:46,079
Hello? Yeah, he's with us.

37
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:53,739
Okay. I see.

38
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,079
Qin Ye Yun says Lin Cherry's coming over in rage.

39
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,720
She wants us on standby to intervene.

40
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,120
I'm staying out of this. He's on his own.

41
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,079
Don't worry. I should be able to stop Cherry.

42
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:19,939
Jiang Qiao Xi.

43
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,220
Didn't you say we'd get something to eat
after school? I'm hungry.

44
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,999
Me too.

45
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:07,300
Are you guys hungry? Tell Qin Ye Yun to come.

46
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,540
Let's go.

47
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:25,939
See? I told you Cherry is not petty.
She wasn't angry at all.

48
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,679
Du Shang, you're still too naive.

49
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,779
Here you go, lady.

50
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,160
- Thanks.
- No problem.

51
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,339
 
Here, chicken wings.

52
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:46,059
- Beef.
- Thanks. Here.

53
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,720
Want some?

54
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,520
Have it. I'll take the chicken feet.

55
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,559
I'll take it.

56
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,480
Do you think that beef tastes
better abroad than at home?

57
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,520
It's not bad.

58
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,100
Have some smashed cucumber salad.

59
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:21,059
You won't easily find these cold dishes abroad.

60
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,399
Cherry, I know you're mad at me.

61
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,199
No, I'm not.

62
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,500
I'd be mad if I were you. But I didn't mean to--

63
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,139
Then why did you do that?

64
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,496
He didn't tell us either, did he?

65
00:07:50,496 --> 00:07:51,620
- I had no idea.
- Did you know?

66
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,519
- No, I didn't.
- I had no idea.

67
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,319
He didn't tell anyone.

68
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:13,019
Yeah, you act like nothing's on your mind,

69
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:18,720
but you've planned everything without telling us.

70
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Listen.

71
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,959
Just like you never told us when you gave up

72
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,699
the Olympiad and everything else.

73
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:26,199
It's okay. I understand that.

74
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,139
But we had to learn about your plans from others.

75
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,279
Do you know what it looks like?

76
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,840
It looks like we don't matter to you.

77
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,759
You have your plans,

78
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:41,179
ideas, and schedules.

79
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:46,740
But I thought you needed my... our support.

80
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,679
But in fact, you're who you are without us.

81
00:08:56,299 --> 00:09:00,580
And I'm who I am without you.

82
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,839
It's the same with Du Shang, right?

83
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,179
Dig in.

84
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,479
Dig in.

85
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,639
Sir, how much is it?

86
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,439
It's 121.

87
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,640
Cherry.

88
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,600
Cherry.

89
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,400
Cherry.

90
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:10,939
Hear me out.

91
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,880
Fine, go ahead.

92
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,240
I've always wanted to study abroad.

93
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,820
I made this decision back when I was in Qun Shan.

94
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,139
And I won't change my mind.

95
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,419
You decided it back in Qun Shan?

96
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:46,899
Jiang Qiao Xi, you kept it
a secret for eight years.

97
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:50,259
You had so many chances to tell me
in those eight years.

98
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:52,340
You had so many meals at my house.

99
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,639
You had so many lotus root sandwiches
and date buns, but you said nothing.

100
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:58,539
Do you know how worried my parents have been?

101
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:02,240
My dad, who never speaks much,
tried so hard to reason with you.

102
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,580
But you kept him in the dark.

103
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,460
He's never even shared those words with me.

104
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,980
Are we nothing but a joke to you?

105
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,140
You're coming with me.

106
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:20,919
In three years or two, I'll get you abroad.

107
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:26,420
In two years? Such a distant future.

108
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,479
It's like a dream, Jiang Qiao Xi.

109
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:35,620
You're serious.

110
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,420
Yes, I am.

111
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,719
So you weren't hiding it from me.

112
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:02,900
You didn't mean to tell me last?

113
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,819
You want me to go with you?

114
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,540
Do you want me to stay?

115
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,640
You should go.

116
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,199
Will you come with me?

117
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,240
I haven't thought about it.

118
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,160
But it doesn't look like

119
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:35,300
my future will unfold there,
no matter how I see it.

120
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,559
But Jiang Qiao Xi, you should go.

121
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,979
You'll fly high and far.

122
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,319
Wherever I go, you must come find me.

123
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,359
I'll come and get you.

124
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:16,099
We'll only be apart for a little while.

125
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,559
Aren't you tempted?

126
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,360
Of course, I want to be with him.

127
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:34,559
But he has his plan, and I have mine.

128
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:42,279
Plus, I know he's quite scared, too.

129
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:45,679
But what will you do after he goes abroad?

130
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,519
Anyway, he told me his thoughts.

131
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,479
And I told him mine.

132
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,939
We'll see how it goes.

133
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,580
I'm impressed. Focus on
the college entrance exam, then.

134
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,580
You don't have as many options as him.

135
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,500
I don't think he has many options.

136
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,064
Cherry.

137

 ♫ Gently ♫ 

146
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:50,979
I peeled this for you.

English vocabulary?

159
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:31,500
 ♫ Aye aye oh ♫ 

160
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,879

00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,033

165
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,480
It's asking what value "ab" should reach

166
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,279
for its force to equal "mg".

167
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,600
So we just need the formula for "mg" and "f".

168
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,559
Substitute it for "i". Focus.

169
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,960
The formula given here...

170
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,791
 ♫ Many years of time ♫ 

171
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,099
 ♫ Blurred ♫ 

172
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:11,087
 ♫ The way it used to be ♫ 

173
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:11,667
 ♫ Holding a pen ♫ 

174
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,939
 ♫ Sketching on paper ♫ 

175
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:17,056
 ♫ A little wooden house ♫ 

176
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:18,503
 ♫ Humming a tune ♫ 

177
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,071
 ♫ On the hillside ♫ 

178
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:22,967
 ♫ Singing joyfully with you ♫ 

179
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:24,243
 ♫ One careless moment ♫ 

180
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:28,979
 ♫ Tears welled up in our eyes ♫ 

181
00:17:28,979 --> 00:17:31,027
 ♫ At the back slope of the small town ♫ 

182
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:32,423
 ♫ You held my hand ♫ 

183
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:35,646
 ♫ Running towards the mountain top ♫ 

184
00:17:35,646 --> 00:17:37,801
 ♫ The sunset dissipates ♫ 

185
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:40,909
 ♫ All the worries ♫ 

186
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:42,933
 ♫ You are in my eyes ♫ 

187
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:44,477
 ♫ I look at you ♫ 

188
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:46,010
 ♫ Without noticing ♫ 

189
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,948
 ♫ It's all you ♫ 

190
00:17:47,948 --> 00:17:48,979
 

191
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:50,803
 ♫ I finally understand ♫ 

192
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:55,976
 ♫ Stability and freedom ♫ 

193
00:17:55,976 --> 00:17:58,950
 ♫ Is the story coming to an end ♫ 

194
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,624
 ♫ We'll meet again, right ♫ 

195
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,599
I saw a post on Qzone the other day.

196
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:12,180
It said youth is like toilet paper.

197
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:17,779
It may look plentiful, but it runs out fast.

198
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:22,839
So seize the chance to enjoy life
while you're still young.

199
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:26,280
Once senior year begins, there'll be no chances.

200
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,260
Whatever.

201
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,180
This isn't like you, Lin Cherry.
What's wrong? Feeling down?

202
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,059
Did Jiang Qiao Xi upset you again?

203
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,760
No.

204
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:59,039
He's going to Hong Kong, China for the TOEFL
and probably won't come back.

205
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,720
Who says he won't come back?

206
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,160
That's for sure. The exams are over.

207
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,420
He should've left long ago.

208
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,779
He wouldn't be renting a place
if he weren't returning.

209
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:13,000
Renting a place?

210
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,419
Don't you know? He's looking for a rental.

211
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,099
He came to check the rental listings
by our door the other day

212
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:24,960
and asked my dad and Ms. Cao
to keep an eye out for him.

213
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,079
Why would he rent? Is he moving out?

214
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,359
I think his mom started making trouble again.

215
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:39,639
I don't think he can stay at home anymore.
But he wants to spend more time with you.

216
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,819
I should've realized what he'd face.

217
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:59,099
Here. The rice noodle pot should be warm.
Did you turn on the burner?

218
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:02,039
- I'll drink this.
- Alright, it's burning.

219
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:07,339
Try this. It's good and still warm.

220
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:11,399
Guys, you know why I called you here today?

221
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:14,539
I have something to discuss with you.

222
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:18,760
Why don't we go back to Qun Shan together?

223
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,000
Back to Qun Shan?

224
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,119
The construction sites are gone.
We might not even find our way home.

225
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,599
Our school's still there.

226
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:30,879
Qun Shan Elementary hasn't been demolished,
though there are no students.

227
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,079
Alright. I've always wanted to go back once.

228
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,079
Alright.

229
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,319
There's a train now.
We can get there in two hours.

230
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,180
We can return by night if we leave early tomorrow.

231
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,920
Back to Qun Shan. Cai Fang Yuan?

232
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
Back to Qun Shan.

233
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,119
Back to Qun Shan.

234
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,339
- Back to Qun Shan.
- Alright.

235
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:50,000
- Back to Qun Shan.
- Back to Qun Shan.

236
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Back to Qun Shan.

237
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,099
Back to Qun Shan.

238
00:20:58,464 --> 00:21:01,568
 

239
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,359
We're home.

240
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,779
- We're home.
- Let's go.

241
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:09,579
Let's go.

242
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:16,240
Does it look familiar?
I bet you remember this place, Cai Fang Yuan.

243
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,420
 
Your dad chased you with a slipper in hand.

244
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,339
Lin Cherry, how dare you mention that?

245
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:26,859
I know you ratted me out to my dad.

246
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:30,279
That's because you dragged Jiang Qiao Xi here.

247
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:33,200
You were the bad influence.

248
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,420
Lin Cherry, don't be mistaken.
He knew the games very well.

249
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,180
You have no idea how much fun
he had. Back me up here.

250
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,119
You guys didn't know
how to play King of Fighters '97.

251
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,119
I even let you pick Iori Yagami.
You still couldn't beat me.

252
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,579
Nonsense.

253
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:52,460
My Iori combos flowed. No way I lost.

254
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,160
You must have remembered wrong.

255
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,400
I remember that.

256
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,559
Jiang Qiao Xi always starts defensively.

257
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:00,519
Then he launches attacks and pushes us hard.

258
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,519
How are we supposed to play?

259
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,960
No wonder. Your sneaky tactics are underhanded.

260
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,180
Geng Xiao Qing.

261
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,799
Why are you here? When did you come back?

262
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,180
Who's this pretty girl?

263
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,940
This is Geng Xiao Qing,
my deskmate at Qun Shan Middle School.

264
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,160
Hi, I'm Geng Xiao Qing. Nice to meet you.

265
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,339
I wasn't sure it was you, so I kept glancing.

266
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:28,799
How come you've changed so much?

267
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,960
Have I changed? I'm still the same.

268
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,460
Besides, I only left Qun Shan a few years ago.

269
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,339
I'm not talking about looks,
but your entire demeanor.

270
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:39,859
You were laughing and talking nonstop.

271
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,579
I doubted it was you. You've changed.

272
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:45,660
You might actually have the wrong person.

273
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,240
The "Lin Qi Le" we know
is always happy and talkative.

274
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,000
You impostor. Show your true self.

275
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,819
What are you doing, Cai Fang Yuan? Get lost.

276
00:22:55,819 --> 00:23:00,020
Shut up already. Guys, hurry up!

00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:22,559
I used to find this hill too tall to climb.

326
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,099
Now I realize it's just ordinary.

327
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,700
Everything's changed.
It turns out we've come a long way.

328
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,599
It makes me a bit sentimental.

329
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:39,119
Don't be silly. Why the melodrama?
It's only sad when people change.

330
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,640
Look at us. None of us has changed.

331
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,619
Our tight bond is worth celebrating. Get it?

332
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:13,760
Jiang Qiao Xi, look how handsome you are.

333
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,800
You look good, too.

334
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:34,639
Are you going to keep staring at me?
Why don't you enjoy the sunset?

335
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,839
Keep staring at the sunset clouds,
and you'll realize

336
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:47,639
that they are gone in a second.

337
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:55,319
No, they're not leaving.
They're on their way back.

338
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:01,819
The next thing we'll see is the sunrise.

339
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:11,119
Cherry, I know why you asked to come here.

340
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,540
I could stay a bit longer.

341
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:30,520
You... You're so attached to home.

342
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:49,799
Cherry, aren't you afraid?

343
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:55,599
You told me your childhood wish
was for all of us to stay together.

344
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:04,480
But this time, I have to leave again.

345
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:15,700
This time, I won't see it as a parting.

346
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,599
The moment you leave,
I'll consider you on your way back.

347
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:29,599
So Jiang Qiao Xi, can you promise me and Chun Lu

348
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,059
to hurry back home?

349
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,220
Come home?

350
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,020
Come home.

351
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:51,839
Okay, I promise you

352
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:57,240
and Chun Lu that I'll come home soon.

353
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:16,640
Lin Cherry, sometimes I find you quite silly.

354
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,579
How dare you call me silly?
I ranked 18th in the class this time.

355
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,059
It's not about your IQ.

356
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:30,059
Then what is it about?

357
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:35,299
Your feelings. Jiang Qiao Xi is leaving.

358
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:39,780
Shouldn't you be breaking his arms
instead of sending him off?

359
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:47,759
He's also sad about leaving.

360
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:50,420
So I can't make him feel worse.

361
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,359
What about you?

362
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,299
Jiang Qiao Xi leaves tomorrow.
Aren't you going to cry?

363
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:00,099
What are you doing?

364
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,859
Instead of dwelling on him leaving tomorrow,

365
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:12,799
I'd rather focus on the fact that he's here today.

366
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,759
Every extra day he stays is another happy day.

367
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:17,680
So I won't cry in front of him.

368
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,480
And you're not silly?

369
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:32,859
Hello?

370
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:38,139
Hello, Cherry, I'm at your door. Can you come out?

371
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:41,159
Who is it?

372
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:48,319
Go ahead. I'll be back soon.

373
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:53,559
Jiang Qiao Xi.

374
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,639
What's wrong?

375
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,420
This is for you.

376
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:10,019
For me? What is it?

377
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:11,819
Check it out.

378
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:15,859
Why did you get me a gift?

379
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:18,900
My cousin's wife bought these in Hong Kong, China.

380
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,660
I paid with my Olympiad prize money.

381
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,480
I can buy whatever I want.

382
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,280
Here.

383
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,260
High heels?

384
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,000
Are they the right size?

385
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,059
Yeah. How did you know my shoe size?

386
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:47,899
I checked your shoe cabinet the other day
and guessed the size.

387
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:04,159
Well? Do they fit?

388
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,839
They're perfect.

389
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,740
Careful.

390
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,460
Be careful.

391
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,740
I can walk in heels now.

392
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:43,900
Jiang Qiao Xi. Look, we're the same height now.

393
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:47,619
So pretty.

394
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,559
This is for you.

395
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,759
Lipstick?

396
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:55,780
Want to try it on?

397
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,280
Why are you giving me lipstick and heels?

398
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,720
My cousin's wife told me

399
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:14,579
that she first felt like an adult

400
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:18,720
when she wore heels and lipstick.

401
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,939
Cherry, I might miss your eighteenth birthday.

402
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,200
But I don't want to miss
your coming-of-age moment.

403
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:49,840
What about guys? When do they feel grown up?

404
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,100
And you, Jiang Qiao Xi?
When did you become an adult?

405
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,900
Well...

406
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:13,120
Whenever I felt compelled to do something.

407
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,839
Jiang Qiao Xi, don't be like this.

408
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:32,360
Under these circumstances,
we should try to be happy.

409
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,480
It's not like we'll never
see each other again, right?

410
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:41,339
So let's stay positive. Be happy.

411
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:52,420
Cherry, I didn't buy you high heels and lipstick
just because of what my cousin's wife said.

412
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:59,519
I've always thought
you'd look stunning in heels and lipstick.

413
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,700
I want to be the first to see it.

414
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:11,919
Can you apply it for me? I can't see properly.

415
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:23,419
Let me try then.

416
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,464
 ♫ You lock up your heart ♫

 ♫ Little us ♫ 

421
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:47,339
Does it look nice?

422
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:49,800
Yeah.

423
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,620
Did it smudge?

424
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,792
No.

425
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:55,980
 ♫ For you ♫ 

426
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,992

432
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,980
It's nice to get heels and lipstick as gifts.

433
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,140
But Lin Cherry, aren't you scared?

434
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,980
About what?

435
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,739
He's leaving after saying those things to you.

436
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,960
There's so much uncertainty.

437
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,560
Doesn't it scare you
to give your heart away like this?

438
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:33,859
It does scare me, but it's worth it.

439
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,699
Sometimes, I wish
I could be silly and brave like you.

440
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:49,399
I told you, I'm not silly.

441
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:56,680
Then why did you hit me? I hit really hard.

442
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:02,300
Hit me back. Newton's law
says force is mutual anyway.

443
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,580
Give me that.

444
00:38:18,019 --> 00:38:20,819
How did you know I'd put them here?

445
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:29,919
Alright.

446
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,059
You're still reading at this hour?

447
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:42,219
I want to finish it.

448
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,019
How does it end?

449
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,959
It must be a happy ending.

450
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,659
Yu Qiao says we won't
see Jiang Qiao Xi off tomorrow. You'll go alone.

451
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:56,980
We'll leave Jiang Qiao Xi's
final moments entirely to you.

452
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,339
What do you mean by "final moments"?

453
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,820
We'll see each other a lot.

454
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,860
He'll be back soon.

455
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:10,300
He'll take care of himself. So will I.

456
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,559
How do you know?

457
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:13,359
I just do.

458
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,699
Sure, you two will see each other a lot.

459
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:22,800
We're too bored to see him off, okay?

460
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,200
Thank you.

461
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,719
 I've finished the finale of Harry Potter. 

462
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:59,979
 Should I tell you what happened like before? 

463
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,780
 Is it a happy ending? 

464
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,460
 In the end, Harry defeated Voldemort. 

465
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,519
 Justice triumphed over evil,
light expelled darkness, 

466
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:13,219
 and love overcame hatred.

 Then Harry became an Auror,
working with Ron and Hermione. 

475
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,159
 He married Ginny and formed a happy family. 

476
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:46,200
 They had three children

 ♫ The silent call of the dream ♫ 

487
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:28,715
 ♫ You're the key to all I dream ♫ 

488
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:33,139
 All is well. That's the ending. 

489
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:37,139
 ♫ The story sprouts ♫ 

490
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:38,440
I'm back.

491
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,320
Cherry.

492
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,719
Hello, Uncle.

493
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:47,920
"Hello, Uncle"? Don't you remember me?

494
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,800
Mr. Wang, I brought all the gifts upstairs.

495
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,159
Okay, thanks, Zhang. Wait for me downstairs.

496
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:54,659
Yes, Mr. Wang.

497
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:58,519
Mr. Wang?

498
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:00,480
Now you remember.

499
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,039
Mr. Wang happened to be visiting
and came specifically to see you.

500
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,639
Little Cherry, you didn't
recognize me. I'm heartbroken.

501
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:14,039
Come on... Look how tall I've grown.

502
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:18,560
You probably wouldn't recognize me
if we passed on the street, right?

503
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:32,959
Cherry, Qiao Xi's cousin
will pick him up at the airport, right?

504
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,680
Yeah.

505
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:40,179
Don't worry. He knows that city well.

506
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:43,559
Everything's ready. It's going to be fine.

507
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:46,919
It's you I'm worried about. Are you okay?

508
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,080
I'm doing fine.

509
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:58,560
Jiang Qiao Xi is going to
achieve something. I'm happy for him.

510
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,899
Senior, you must visit me
more often. And you, Cherry.

511
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:14,119
We'll both visit you.

512
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:20,399
Cherry, I wish you peace and happiness.

513
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,559
Best wishes for you, too.

514
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:27,359
Mr. Wang.

515
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:41,180
High on the mountain,
there's a cow with two horns.

516
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:19,179
Cherry, study well in college.
Tell me if you need anything.

517
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:24,859
I consider you both a good friend
and my goddaughter.

518
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:31,940
Senior, we should meet often and talk more.

519
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:39,940
There are only a few
real brothers left I can open up to.

520
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,559
Keep in touch.

521
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:47,080
I'm your brother, too, Mr. Wang.

522
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,840
Count me in.

523
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,880
Brothers.

524
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,680
Brothers.

525
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:09,162
 ♫ Once again in the night ♫ 

526
00:45:09,162 --> 00:45:12,842
 ♫ I am like dust ♫ 

527
00:45:12,842 --> 00:45:15,242
 ♫ Blown away by the wind ♫ 

528
00:45:15,242 --> 00:45:18,026
 ♫ Unable to find a place to land ♫ 

529
00:45:19,598 --> 00:45:22,954
 ♫ Once again in my dream ♫ 

530
00:45:22,954 --> 00:45:26,570
 ♫ I gaze at the sea ♫ 

531
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:28,650
 ♫ But hear the sound ♫ 

532
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:31,658
 ♫ Of the surging dreams ♫ 

533
00:45:32,782 --> 00:45:35,850
 ♫ Breaking through the darkness ♫ 

534
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:39,790
 ♫ Extraordinary power ♫ 

535

 ♫ My dream ♫ 

536
00:45:42,986 --> 00:45:46,638

 ♫ I want ♫ 

538

 ♫ I want you to see ♫ 

539

 ♫ I want to sing for you ♫ 

542

 ♫ My loneliness and confusion ♫ 

543
00:46:00,298 --> 00:46:01,386
 ♫ I want to forget ♫ 

544
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:03,690
 ♫ I want to forget the past ♫ 

545
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:07,210
 ♫ Those ordinary years of growth ♫ 

546
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:08,970
 ♫ Brewing ♫ 

547
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:10,282
 ♫ Gazing out ♫ 

548
00:46:10,282 --> 00:46:14,154
 ♫ Towards the horizon ♫ 

549
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:24,554
 ♫ Once again in my dream ♫ 

550
00:46:24,554 --> 00:46:27,562
 ♫ I smell fragrance ♫ 

551
00:46:28,298 --> 00:46:31,306
 ♫ Like white wildflowers on morning paths ♫ 

552
00:46:31,306 --> 00:46:33,386
 ♫ Fragrance ♫ 

553
00:46:34,538 --> 00:46:37,482
 ♫ Breaking through the darkness ♫
