1
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,040
Don't go.

2
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,060
If you leave, I won't even know
where to look for you.

3
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,080
Come here.

4
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,000
Lie down.

5
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,540
Lie down.

6
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,980
Yesterday, when you were gone…

7
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,360
I was too scared to sleep.

8
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,640
But now…

9
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,140
you brought me home.

10
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,000
This isn't a home.

11
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,160
Just a rented space.

12
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,980
Then, in your mind,

13
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,980
what counts as home?

14
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,180
Anyway, this place isn't it.

15
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,660
Jiang Qiaoxi.

16
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,160
Wherever makes you feel safe

17
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,480
is home.

18
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,460
I'm going to sleep now.

19
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,460
Don't leave.

20
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,260
When I wake up, the first thing I see,

21
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,280
it's going to be you.

22
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,360
Got it?

23
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,620
No leaving.

24
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,920
Jiang Qiaoxi.

25
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,840
Did it hurt…

26
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,140
when these calluses grew?

27
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,760
Yes.

28
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,440
I'm so tired.

29
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,460
Don't do this.

30
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,700
I don't want to wake up so soon.

31
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,620
This is not a dream.

32
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,280
This is not a dream.

33
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,660
Why are you so nervous?

34
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,660
I'm not nervous.

35
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,880
I just had a nightmare.

36
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,140
That wasn't a nightmare.

37
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,340
Did you dream of me

38
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,780
like I always dream of you?

39
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,020
When we're apart,

40
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,320
did you always dream of me?

41
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,020
No.

42
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,540
You love to lie now.

43
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,380
I didn't lie.

44
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,460
Jiang Qiaoxi,

45
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,100
two years ago,

46
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,260
you asked me not to forget you.

47
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,000
I kept my promise.

48
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,440
So now,

49
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,800
you have no reason to reject me.

50
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,020
Jiang Qiaoxi.

51
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm going to…

52
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,480
visit your cousin and sis-in-law tomorrow.

53
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,360
Go back and get some proper rest.

54
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,100
Tomorrow, you should leave.

55
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,580
There's no need to go see them.

56
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,460
Of course it's necessary!

57
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,600
The lipstick and heels you gave me

58
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,000
were all picked by sis-in-law.

59
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,920
Now that I'm in Hong Kong, I have to visit

60
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,780
and thank her in person.

61
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,060
I have no contact with them anymore.

62
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,780
Jiang Qiaoxi, what are you so afraid of?

63
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,360
Why can't you just tell me the truth?

64
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,320
Not the time yet.

65
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,820
I am not qualified
to tell you what I'm afraid of.

66
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,680
Then when?

67
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,420
What's the qualification you need?

68
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,680
Why obsess over the concept
of doing it at the right time?

69
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,780
Even as a kid,

70
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,280
you waited,

71
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,780
endured, held up,

72
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,060
until you had leverage
to negotiate with your mom.

73
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,560
You need to survive the Olympiad
to have the right to rebel.

74
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,660
You need to study abroad to claim freedom.

75
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,260
Now you're pushing me away again

76
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,780
because you think everything
must be perfectly prepared

77
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,160
before moving forward, right?

78
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,880
But the world isn't a math problem.

79
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,460
You can't wait for all the answers

80
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,180
to be ready before starting the exam.

81
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,020
Well, I don't work like that.

82
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,620
My family never did either.

83
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,260
Then tell me.

84
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,680
How does the Lin family do it?

85
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,720
In my family,

86
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,520
we are in this together.

87
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,360
Jiang Qiaoxi,

88
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,380
no one needs to be perfect

89
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,360
because it's impossible.

90
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,560
Humans can't always
be at peak performance,

91
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,560
can't always win,

92
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,960
can't always excel.

93
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,820
I don't need to be perfect.

94
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,180
I know that.

95
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,860
I'll never be perfect in this lifetime.

96
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,960
But Lin Yingtao, can't you see?

97
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,300
I don't want you suffering with me.

98
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,720
And I know you.

99
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,540
If I were living easily,

100
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,140
you might not stay.

101
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,380
But if I'm in the gutter,

102
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,300
you'd crawl in beside me
without a second thought.

103
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,560
Then aren't you…

104
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,480
afraid that I'll really forget you?

105
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,900
What's worth remembering…

106
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,400
about me like this?

107
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,420
The Jiang Qiaoxi you should remember
isn't the one standing here now.

108
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,680
You're circling back again.

109
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,100
You still want me
to remember the outstanding you,

110
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,980
the high-achieving you.

111
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,700
Lin Yingtao, I'm not like you.

112
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,880
I'm empty.

113
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,300
If I am not outstanding anymore,

114
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,200
what's left in me for you to love?

115
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,460
Jiang Qiaoxi.

116
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,180
Do you really think you won

117
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,840
that battle with your mom as a kid?

118
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,520
It was a fake victory.

119
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,140
Your whole life, you've begged us

120
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,820
to love you as you are.

121
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,680
But do you even know…

122
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,660
who that is?

123
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,580
Do you accept him?

124
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,440
Love him?

125
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,240
You're just trying
to slap a halo on your true self

126
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,540
so you'll feel…

127
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,839
you are worthy of love.

128
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,819
That's the toxic root of your life.

129
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,200
It's killing you.

130
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,720
And it's killing us.

131
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,500
Can someone as good as you…

132
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,140
truly accept me when I'm nothing?

133
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,780
To you, I'm not that great.

134
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
You underestimate me, Jiang Qiaoxi.

135
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,980
You think my love is something

136
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,620
you have to earn with achievements.

137
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,760
But here's the truth.

138
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,340
Once I made up my mind to love you,

139
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,900
I'll love you till the end.

140
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,520
Your excellence

141
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,760
won't make me love you more.

142
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,320
Your ordinariness

143
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,460
won't make it less.

144
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,980
Wait for me a little longer.

145
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,360
I will come for you.

146
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,580
Jiang Qiaoxi, I want to date.

147
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,860
I want someone to be there.

148
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,280
I'm tired of calling numbers
that never pick up,

149
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,760
texting into the void.

150
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,160
Whatever.

151
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,280
It's not like
you're the only one I've ever liked.

152
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,660
I can move on too.

153
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,480
Back in school, no early dating.

154
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,440
Now you claim you've got nothing.

155
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,800
What's next?

156
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,660
What excuse comes after?

157
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,420
Even if I wait, when will it end?

158
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,620
Every time it rains in Hongyang,

159
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,560
I wonder,

160
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,340
where are you? Did you bring an umbrella?

161
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,660
When the wind howls, I panic

162
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,260
and think if you are safe.

163
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,540
If I see a car crash, my brain screams.

164
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,880
What if that was you? How would you cope?

165
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,600
But I don't know. I really don't.

166
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,100
And I can't keep doing this.

167
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,220
Here I am, alone, missing you,

168
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,260
without even your number to call.

169
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,440
I can't do this anymore.

170
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,420
You told me

171
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,900
to remember you forever.

172
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,580
Well, I did. And what's the point?

173
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,020
At ten, I could wait and survive

174
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,140
by thinking about you.

175
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,580
But I'm 20 now.

176
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,180
I can't stay a child.

177
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,680
I can't keep doing stupid things.

178
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,060
How long should I wait for you?

179
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,840
Until I start dating someone else?

180
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,060
Until I get married?

181
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,040
Or until I have my own family?

182
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,960
By then, shall I still remember you,

183
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,520
the outstanding Jiang Qiaoxi?

184
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,900
Would it even mean anything anymore?

185
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,140
Jiang Qiaoxi.

186
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,780
I've decided to stop loving you.

187
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,740
You don't need to earn

188
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,960
my love with your achievements
and glory anymore.

189
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,300
If you truly crave the attention,

190
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,420
then go fight for it
wholeheartedly, for yourself.

191
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,900
I'm leaving now.

192
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,620
No more

193
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,360
unanswered calls.

194
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,660
No more texts left on read.

195
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,220
No more worrying about you.

196
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:47,740
FOOT HEALTH
PLEASE PROCEED UPSTAIRS FROM HERE

197
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,460
Wait a second, sir.

198
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,520
Drive on.

199
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,140
Yingtao!

200
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,820
Yingtao!

201
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:56,440
Jiang Qiaoxi!

202
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,920
I saw you chasing after me,

203
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,800
but I told the driver to take a detour
before coming back.

204
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,360
I wanted you to know

205
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,500
how it feels to be a seeker.

206
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,240
Two years ago,
you told me not to forget you,

207
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,180
then you ran away.

208
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,340
Just now, when I left,

209
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,360
you chased after me again.

210
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,920
What exactly do you want from me?

211
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,260
Yingtao,

212
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,240
please don't stop loving me.

213
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,060
I can't bear to lose you.

214
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,800
What do you mean?

215
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,920
I want the exact answer.

216
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,060
I won't give you
another chance to be vague.

217
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,380
I hate ambiguity.

218
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,920
I…

219
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,860
I…

220
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,340
I can't live without you.

221
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,380
Could you please not leave?

222
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,500
I don't want to see you
dating someone else.

223
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,320
I don't want…

224
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,540
you marrying someone else.

225
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,680
I can't accept that everything between us

226
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,960
meant nothing.

227
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,180
Lin Yingtao.

228
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,440
Thank you for remembering me.

229
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,060
I love you.

230
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,480
I, Jiang Qiaoxi,
want to be your boyfriend.

231
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,200
Say it exactly like this, word for word.

232
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,660
Lin Yingtao.

233
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,800
Thank you for remembering me.

234
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,880
I love you.

235
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,740
From this moment on,

236
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,760
I, Jiang Qiaoxi,

237
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,620
am officially your boyfriend.

238
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,320
- I…
- Let me think about this.

239
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,220
We can't have it as you wish, can we?

240
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,720
Yingtao.

241
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,200
Could you be my girlfriend?

242
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,320
I'll think about it.

243
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,040
Have you made a decision?

244
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,320
Truth is, I hold grudges.

245
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,740
I've imagined so many times

246
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,300
about you showing up one day,

247
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,820
saying these words to me.

248
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,320
I will resent you for a long,

249
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,840
long time before I ever forgive you.

250
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,200
I know you're angry with me,

251
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,300
and I know

252
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,000
it'll take you long to forgive me.

253
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,680
Because even I can hardly forgive myself.

254
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,000
Are you stupid?

255
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,320
Why are you just agreeing with me?

256
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,320
Shouldn't you be pulling me

257
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,260
into your arms right now?
Then I'd push you away,

258
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,140
hit you a couple of times,

259
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,260
and you'd hold me tighter
and never let go.

260
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,020
That's how I'd finally
become your girlfriend.

261
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,820
Stop hugging me.

262
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,060
Don't go.

263
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,120
Don't leave me.

264
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,260
Fine.

265
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,760
I'm only forgiving you

266
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,900
because you seem truly sorry.

267
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,700
So…

268
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,860
I guess this means

269
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,840
I'm your girlfriend now.

270
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,740
‪Okay.

271
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,100
Go back for now.

272
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,620
It's late. Time to sleep.

273
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,560
I don't want to sleep.

274
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,220
The weather's so nice.

275
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,920
Let's do something else.

276
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,380
No way.
You just recovered from being sick.

277
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,580
You need proper rest.

278
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,040
I took my meds,
and I napped all afternoon.

279
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,520
I'm full of energy now.

280
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,580
But you were working all day without rest.

281
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,920
Can't keep up?

282
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,840
Damn right I can keep up.

283
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,740
It's settled then. Tonight is…

284
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,800
officially our first date.

285
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,860
You'd better show me
around Hong Kong properly.

286
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,760
Make up for breaking my heart.

287
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,800
Deal. Date night starts now.

288
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,380
- Suitcase.
- I forgot it.

289
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,840
KEEP LEFT

290
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,980
CHEUNG PO TSAI

291
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,180
What are you smiling about?

292
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
I smiled because you were smiling.

293
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,460
What's making you grin this time?

294
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,940
Just suddenly remembered,

295
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,240
at 17,

296
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,820
we had to hide in alleyways

297
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,060
to eat jujube buns at school,

298
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,860
scared of getting caught.

299
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,300
Here we are, having snacks on street,

300
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,140
open and aboveboard,

301
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,460
acting like…

302
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,780
some cheesy drama couple.

303
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,100
From now on,

304
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,260
no one will stand in our way.

305
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,780
No distance

306
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,040
we can't cross.

307
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,840
Damn right.

308
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,640
Nothing can stop us now.

309
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,240
Growing up is so nice.

310
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,340
Not because of growing up.

311
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,700
It was your courage

312
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,260
that vanquished every barrier.

313
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,060
Damn right I am.

314
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,440
Impressed yet?

315
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,340
Matchless valor!

316
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,600
Jiang Qiaoxi.

317
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,480
I…

318
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,260
I'm full now,

319
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,200
feeling healthier.

320
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,300
My mood…

321
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,360
has improved.

322
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,780
So, tell me everything

323
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,340
I've missed these years.

324
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,660
Remember

325
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,760
when you first heard
I was studying abroad?

326
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,980
You told me,

327
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,080
"A roc spreads its wings,

328
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,920
boundless horizons await.

329
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,780
You'll achieve great things."

330
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,940
But…

331
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,400
I couldn't even accomplish

332
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,600
the smallest things.

333
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,860
<i>Not long after I arrived here…</i>

334
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,480
<i>…the subprime mortgage crisis hit.</i>

335
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,940
<i>My parents lost a fortune over stocks.</i>

336
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,820
<i>They were getting divorced</i>
<i>and had no time for me.</i>

337
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,860
<i>My cousin, in the finance industry,</i>

338
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,000
<i>of course, got hit hard too.</i>

339
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,600
<i>But at first,</i>

340
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,239
<i>he still tried to cover</i>
<i>all my living expenses abroad.</i>

341
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,320
Cousin,

342
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,940
must you be so stubborn?

343
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,960
I've lived through enough financial storms
here in Hong Kong.

344
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,440
I am confident

345
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,040
that we'll survive this.

346
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,820
So what if they cut my pay?

347
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,000
Been there, done that.

348
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,480
I've got savings. I'm fine.

349
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,760
You're just a kid.

350
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,080
Stop worrying about

351
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,720
grown-up problems.

352
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,720
Focus on your studies, live your life.

353
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,000
Stop pretending, cousin.

354
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,400
You can't just cancel your insurance

355
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,840
for Uncle and Aunt's retirement funds.

356
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,300
What if someday you…

357
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,660
Your sis-in-law and I
are strong and healthy.

358
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,200
Healthier than you, mind you.

359
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,480
Even if we need
to renew the insurance later,

360
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,220
that's always an option.

361
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,700
Anyway, don't think about dropping out.

362
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,420
We can't let it happen.

363
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,200
With your grades,

364
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,960
landing a full scholarship
won't be a problem at all.

365
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,320
That scholarship?

366
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,860
Definitely something for you
in the future.

367
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,500
If you graduate early and start working,

368
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,500
when I get fired, I'll be counting

369
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,660
on you to support me.

370
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,300
I am not joking. It's true.

371
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,880
Just focus on your studies.
After graduation,

372
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,880
our family will have double safeguards.

373
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,140
Think about it.

374
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,560
Alright.

375
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,260
Cousin,

376
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,100
I'll work harder,

377
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,380
graduate early

378
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,340
to help you out.

379
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,440
That's good, kid.

380
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,380
Took me long to make sense to you.

381
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,420
Come on.

382
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,660
Talked until my mouth went dry.

383
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,840
Jiang Ruocheng.

384
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,040
Security wouldn't let me upstairs.

385
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,120
Said I'm not with the company anymore.

386
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,900
Just answer me one thing. Why fire me?

387
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,900
Don't talk here.

388
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,620
Don't act rashly.

389
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,980
I'll go talk to him.

390
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,800
I'll be right back.
Keep eating. It's fine.

391
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,080
<i>My cousin is 16 years old than me.</i>

392
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,280
<i>He carried me to kindergarten,</i>

393
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,060
<i>taught me to write.</i>

394
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,720
<i>Even when drowning himself,</i>

395
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,380
<i>he scraped together to fund my education.</i>

396
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,020
<i>Because he knew that</i>

397
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,860
<i>I couldn't survive home with my parents.</i>

398
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,340
<i>But…</i>

399
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,300
- <i>he was pushed off the building.</i>
- Cousin!

400
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,700
Cousin!

401
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,440
<i>Cousin is in the ICU.</i>

402
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,880
<i>We paid countless medical bills.</i>

403
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,720
<i>The compensation payout can't cover them.</i>

404
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,840
<i>If only we hadn't canceled</i>
<i>his health insurance.</i>

405
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,940
<i>Sis-in-law</i>

406
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,740
<i>had to sell their flat.</i>

407
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,560
<i>Bad timing. The market crashed,</i>

408
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,180
<i>so it went for peanuts.</i>

409
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,340
<i>But what choice did we have?</i>

410
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,560
<i>If we kept it,</i>

411
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,980
<i>we couldn't pay the hospital.</i>

412
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,680
<i>Tears streaming down her face,</i>
<i>she whispered,</i>

413
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,840
<i>"I'm sorry.</i>

414
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,720
<i>We have to use your education fund."</i>

415
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,220
<i>I told her</i>

416
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,640
<i>I'd cancel my studies.</i>

417
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,900
<i>She refused.</i>

418
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,820
<i>So, I planted myself in Hong Kong.</i>

419
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,540
<i>Let every offer letter</i>

420
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,140
<i>expire in my hands.</i>

421
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,440
<i>I wasn't leaving.</i>

422
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,720
DUE TO FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES
I AM UNABLE TO ATTEND SCHOOL

423
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,660
<i>Without money,</i>

424
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,800
<i>they can't stay in that</i>

425
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,220
<i>top-tier nursing home.</i>

426
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,460
<i>Uncle deteriorated rapidly</i>

427
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,580
<i>these past months.</i>

428
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,720
<i>He barely remembers</i>

429
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,640
<i>anyone or anything.</i>

430
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,900
<i>At the end,</i>

431
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,560
<i>she tried and asked cousin's senior,</i>

432
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,340
<i>his best friend Xu Wenzhou,</i>

433
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,400
<i>a HKU grad too.</i>

434
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,880
Qiaoxi.

435
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,760
<i>Senior Xu took me to see the president,</i>

436
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,860
<i>with my academic records in one hand,</i>

437
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,420
<i>cousin's medical bills in the other.</i>

438
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,260
<i>We pleaded with him</i>

439
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,800
<i>that</i>

440
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,460
<i>I can defer my admission to HKU</i>

441
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,940
<i>for one year,</i>

442
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,820
<i>so I can earn enough</i>
<i>to keep the family going.</i>

443
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,100
Take your time.

444
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,300
Take your time. Stay safe.

445
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,880
<i>In lucid moments,</i>

446
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,140
<i>my past</i>

447
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,620
<i>feels like</i>

448
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,200
<i>some vast dream.</i>

449
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,400
<i>But in the haze between sleep and sober,</i>

450
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,560
<i>I often lose all sense of place.</i>

451
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,740
Take an apple back with you.

452
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,740
Go on. Take it.

453
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,400
And eat it yourself, you hear?

454
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,040
<i>Back then,</i>

455
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,680
<i>I stopped replying.</i>

456
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,980
<i>Because</i>

457
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,320
<i>I couldn't even muster the courage</i>

458
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,300
<i>to read your messages.</i>

459
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,600
When I hit rock bottom,

460
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,540
I finally knew

461
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,880
under what circumstances a person

462
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,500
could write down such brutal poems.

463
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,820
"The drunken path lies smooth.
Visit often, my friend.

464
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:29,800
All other roads lead to ruin in the end."

465
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,080
How can you describe it

466
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,520
as you haven't achieved
even the smallest things?

467
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,800
What you've done

468
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,380
outshines any vast odyssey.

469
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,480
These were things I should have done.

470
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,040
And still,

471
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,060
I bungled them all.

472
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,660
That same day,

473
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,440
my landlord threw me out.

474
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,920
An apartment like a coffin.

475
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,600
Walls so close,

476
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,180
I could touch both sides at once.

477
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,640
I rented it cheap

478
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,640
because I was in haste.

479
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,240
Only realizing it was a shell game
when the landlord came.

480
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,560
I was scammed

481
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,540
by the middleman from day one.

482
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,260
Isn't it ironic?

483
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,060
I always thought I was so clever.

484
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,660
But when it comes to reality,

485
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,400
I was at a total loss mostly.

486
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,080
And after that day,

487
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,220
what did you do?

488
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,040
After that…

489
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,360
I just shouldered my bag…

490
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,520
and walked here.

491
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,020
Stood here,

492
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,240
under this sky of burning sunset.

493
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,500
For the first time, I prayed in my heart.

494
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,820
Let the day in Hongyang

495
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,800
be a cloudy day without sunset glows.

496
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,700
Yingtao must not see the sunset glow.

497
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,020
So she won't think of me.

498
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,860
Let her be happy…

499
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,560
even just a little.

500
