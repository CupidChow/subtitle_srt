00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,160
OUR GENERATION

00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,160
EPISODE 5

3
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,860
Ling Qile.

4
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,080
Feel better?

5
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,780
Uh-huh.

6
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,180
I'm feeling better. Thank you.

7
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,080
Jiang Qiaoxi bought you this.

8
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,880
What do you mean?

9
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,020
I know what went on between you two.

10
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,220
You two used to be such close friends,

11
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,940
childhood companions
since you were little.

12
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,340
You already know?

13
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,720
Did Jiang Qiaoxi tell you?

14
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,420
You and Jiang Qiaoxi…

15
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,480
You two…

16
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,260
I…

17
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,560
He…

18
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,000
We, for high school,

19
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,200
will just be friends who study together
and cheer for each other.

20
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,280
As for anything beyond that,

21
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,180
we can talk about it after we

22
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,820
get to university.

23
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,340
Your affairs are none of my business.

24
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,840
But Jiang Qiaoxi
truly values your friendship.

25
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,300
His business is mine.

26
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
His friends are my friends.

27
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,080
When you fainted, I was just as worried.

28
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,600
Thank you.

29
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,980
But,

30
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,520
I’ve got enough friends already.

31
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,920
Don't bother.

32
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,060
Shall we stop here for today?

33
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,240
You had heatstroke earlier.
Let's not push it.

34
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,920
Are you in a bad mood, Lin Yingtao?

35
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,160
No, I'm in great spirits.

36
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,800
I just want to learn it quickly.

37
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,740
Get stronger.

38
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,900
I want to ride to school with you all.

39
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,960
I never want a repeat of today.

40
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,280
Did Jiang Qiaoxi upset you?

41
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,880
He is not capable to upset me.

42
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,500
You…

43
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,660
You didn't tell the truth.

44
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,780
<i>Yun!</i>

45
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,100
<i>Yun!</i>

46
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,680
<i>Help me check these accounts.</i>

47
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,240
Be careful.

48
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,840
Don’t get yourself injured for him.

49
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,460
Go away!

50
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,760
<i>We, for high school,</i>

51
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,940
<i>will just be friends who study together</i>
<i>and cheer for each other.</i>

52
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,480
<i>As for anything beyond that,</i>

53
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,520
<i>we can talk about it</i>
<i>after we get to university.</i>

54
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,000
I can ride it.

55
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,040
Look ahead.

56
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,620
Don't be afraid.

57
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,980
Don't hold it.

58
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,780
Let me steady you or you'll wipe out.

59
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,680
Don't…

60
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,840
- It's okay.
- Leave me alone.

61
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Be careful!

62
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,860
Are you okay?

63
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,240
Oh,

64
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,120
your hand…

65
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,360
Jiang Qiaoxi, what are you after?

66
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,220
I saw you biking up there

67
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,140
all alone. I was worried
you might fall, so I…

68
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,260
That's not what I asked!

69
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,200
We had a deal that

70
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,780
we act like strangers.

71
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,700
We're not friends anymore.

72
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,100
How can you just show up in front of me

73
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,740
like nothing ever happened?

74
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,280
I…

75
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,920
I want to start over with you.

76
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,400
Let's be friends again,

77
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,500
Ling Qile.

78
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,260
I'm Lin Qile.

79
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,440
But am I not Lin Yingtao?

80
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,640
That's not what I meant.

81
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,180
Enough. I get it.

82
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,260
Then let me say this clearly.

83
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,320
If I'm Lin Qile,

84
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,280
I don't want to know you.

85
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,240
And if I'm Lin Yingtao,

86
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,460
I wish I never had to know you.

87
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,800
You are injured.

88
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,300
- I'll take you…
- Stay away. Don’t come near me anymore.

89
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,120
Every time you do, I get hurt,

90
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,700
actually hurt.

91
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,360
You’re doing fine now.

92
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,620
I’m doing fine too.

93
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,220
There’s no reason to start over.

94
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,360
Yingtao, I…

95
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,140
- I really didn't mean it.
- Stop.

96
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,640
From now on,

97
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,760
let’s just be classmates.

98
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,260
I won't bother you.

99
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,200
You don't interfere with me.

100
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,620
Okay?

101
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,620
Sorry.

102
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,240
I really didn't expect

103
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,419
to cause you such trouble.

104
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,780
If you feel sorry,

105
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,340
then just say yes.

106
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,400
Let go!

107
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,280
SMART YINGTAO

108
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,720
FATHER GAVE MOTHER A ROSE

109
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,120
THEY ALSO CELEBRATE VALENTINE'S DAY

110
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,280
I DON'T WANT TO THINK
ABOUT JIANG QIAOXI ANYMORE.

111
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,040
<i>February 9th, 2001.</i>

112
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,420
<i>We got a computer at home today.</i>

113
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,060
<i>Uncle Cai said,</i>

114
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,900
<i>"The whole world is online now.</i>

115
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,360
<i>If you don’t get online,</i>
<i>you’ll be left behind."</i>

116
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,360
<i>I bet</i>

117
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,660
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi’s family has a computer too.</i>

118
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,460
<i>They say you can chat with people online.</i>

119
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,040
<i>I want to talk to Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>

120
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,760
<i>But why he never calls?</i>

121
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,800
<i>October 26th, 2001.</i>

122
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,140
<i>Dad gave me three</i>
<i>Harry Potter books today,</i>

123
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,720
<i>including Harry Potter</i>
<i>and the Prisoner of Azkaban.</i>

124
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,420
<i>I'm holding off on reading them.</i>

125
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,540
<i>I want to read these with Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>

126
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,820
<i>May 26th, 2003.</i>

127
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,380
<i>The news says there’s SARS</i>
<i>in the provincial capital.</i>

128
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,740
<i>One of our classmates' parents</i>
<i>just came back from there.</i>

129
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,620
<i>Today, he was taken home from school.</i>

130
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,140
<i>- August 27th, 2004.</i>
<i>- Wonderful!</i>

131
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,840
<i>- Liu Xiang broke the Olympic record,</i>
<i>- It is great!</i>

132
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,920
<i>a real miracle.</i>

133
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,420
<i>Watching the race on TV,</i>

134
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,740
<i>I was so happy.</i>

135
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,600
<i>For once,</i>

136
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,560
<i>I didn’t think about Jiang Qiaoxi at all.</i>

137
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,340
<i>February 9th, 2005.</i>

138
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,660
<i>Today, I didn’t think about Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>

139
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,420
<i>Yingtao.</i>

140
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,000
<i>I never forgot our time in Qunshan,</i>
<i>for a single day.</i>

141
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,940
<i>These letters,</i>

142
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,940
<i>I’ll deliver them to you myself one day.</i>

143
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,880
Mom.

144
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,020
Mom, don't tear it.

145
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,820
- Don't…
- Get off!

146
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,680
<i>September 16th, 2006.</i>

147
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,780
<i>I won’t let him hurt me anymore.</i>

148
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,940
- Told you.
- Right.

149
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,180
You know, Jiang Qiaoxi seems to
give up on that Lin Qile lately.

150
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,580
- Right.
- I think so too.

151
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,540
Finally came to his senses.

152
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,720
Exactly!

153
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
How could Lin Qile
ever compare to Cen Xiaoman?

154
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
In my heart,

155
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,200
Jiang Qiaoxi and Cen Xiaoman
are the perfect pair.

156
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,280
Who is that Lin Qile?

157
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,820
Who is that Jiang Qiaoxi?

158
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,800
Don't drag me in when gossiping him.

159
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,700
You three go ahead and eat
when you're done.

160
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,080
Don't worry about me.

161
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,860
Today, in my great mercy,

162
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,060
I can't see people suffering.

163
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,460
I've decided to help you clean.

164
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,920
Yingtao, I'll help you too.

165
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,480
I think having you two around is enough.

166
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,380
I’ll go grab some food.

167
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,000
If you're truly merciful,

168
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,540
how about getting me some food?

169
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,980
Let a hardworking soul at least

170
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,700
have a decent meal after all this labor.

171
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,540
Are you going to be okay here

172
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,980
alone?

173
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,700
That’s a weird thing to say.

174
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,260
What’s wrong with me being alone?

175
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,340
Go on. I’ll be fine.

176
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,800
- Go eat. Go.
- I am fine.

177
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,380
- It's okay.
- Fangyuan, go.

178
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,940
Go, go, go!

179
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,180
Go to eat!

180
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,000
I can do it.

181
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,080
Go, go!

182
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,100
Alright.

183
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,020
We're off to "beg alms" for you.

184
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,120
Meow.

185
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,300
Meow.

186
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,180
Little kitty.

187
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,660
How did you end up here?

188
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,840
Which angel built you this cozy nest?

189
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,720
You can scratch its chin.

190
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,060
Kittens love that.

191
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,100
Go on, try it.

192
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,440
I’ll be away for a few days
for Olympiad training,

193
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,740
so I might not be at school.

194
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,960
Could you take care of it for me?

195
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,720
This is your cat?

196
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,880
I found it here last semester

197
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,980
before you transferred.

198
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,900
It was so tiny,

199
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,580
more like a little rabbit than a kitten.

200
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,600
Just like Chunlu.

201
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,980
Don't mention Chunlu.

202
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,680
Yingtao.

203
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,960
I missed it.

204
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,720
But you already have a cat.

205
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,640
Jiang Qiaoxi.

206
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,980
You can like it

207
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,040
because it plays with you,

208
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,420
or makes that meow sound, or catches mice.

209
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,560
But don’t like it
because it reminds you of Chunlu.

210
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,140
Is Chunlu that replaceable?

211
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,640
And honestly, cats are cats,
rabbits are rabbits. What’s even similar?

212
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,560
It's not Chunlu's replacement.

213
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,020
It’s just when I’m upset,

214
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,380
this cat stays with me

215
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,780
and makes things easier.

216
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,420
Missing Chunlu is a different matter.

217
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,320
Who are you here to miss Chunlu?

218
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,619
I won't allow it.

219
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,720
Why I am not allowed to miss Chunlu?

220
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,680
I’ve kept my distance from you.

221
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,099
I am trying.

222
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,380
I even avoided you on purpose.

223
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,960
Why are you even taking away my right
to miss Chunlu?

224
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,119
Lin Qile, this is tyranny.

225
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,460
And you are shameless.

226
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,280
Why am I shameless?

227
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,640
Chunlu belonged to me too.

228
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,119
I have my own precious memories with it.

229
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,859
You do whatever you want,

230
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,060
but don’t push it.

231
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,200
But you already have a cat.

232
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,780
So what for the cat?

233
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,540
I truly adore it.

234
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,660
but I also adore Chunlu.

235
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,640
How can you talk like that?

236
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,420
- Hey.
- Stop!

237
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,360
- Put it down!
- I…

238
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,820
What are you doing?

239
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,940
Back!

240
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,860
Step back!

241
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,320
Why are you all here?

242
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,040
Are you going to fight?

243
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,260
Jiang Qiaoxi, what's going on?

244
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,960
She threw stones at me.

245
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,900
Principal,

246
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,460
if this happens in school,

247
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,020
it's considered bullying.

248
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,880
Principal, we all saw it.

249
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,820
It was Jiang Qiaoxi
who started the quarrel with Lin Qile.

250
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,920
Lin Qile hit him

251
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,340
when the quarrel got heated.

252
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,460
Just a few words of argument.

253
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,060
Then throw stones at me?

254
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,820
Arguing about what?

255
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,080
She's stopping me from

256
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,640
doing what I want to do.

257
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,540
- Jiang Qiaoxi.
- Don't interrupt him.

258
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,560
Go on.

259
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,580
She disturbed me.

260
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,640
How did you disturb him?

261
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,540
what are you doing here?

262
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,360
I…

263
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,040
I…

264
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,140
was cleaning

265
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,900
and then he came over.

266
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,780
Was her cleaning disturbing you?

267
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,960
Why did she throw stones at you?

268
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,780
She hit me

269
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,640
because I said something that annoyed her.

270
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,020
What did you say to her?

271
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,440
You scolded her?

272
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,440
So she can hit me?

273
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,420
You,

274
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,580
as a student, you need to
follow school regulations.

275
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,900
No matter who he is or how good

276
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,340
he is at studying,

277
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,540
he can't change you
for doing what you should.

278
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
Any incidents like this,

279
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,820
should be reported to my office.

280
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,160
No violence.

281
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,500
Okay?

282
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,080
And you,

283
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,620
a tall and strong boy,

284
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,960
were just watching.

285
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,100
The three of you should remember that

286
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,920
in this situation, lend the helping hand.

287
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,140
‪-Sure.
‪-Noted.

288
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,760
Jiang Qiaoxi,

289
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,820
no matter how good your grades are,

290
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,280
you can't be too self-centered.

291
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,960
You have won a lot of honors
for the school,

292
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,860
but our Jialin Experimental

293
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,960
is not a place where only grades matters.

294
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,560
You said she was
disturbing you by cleaning.

295
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,900
Okay.

296
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,420
I won't let her do it.

297
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,080
You finish all the cleaning

298
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,980
by yourself.

299
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,000
When you are done, come to my office.

300
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,500
No need, Principal.

301
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,080
I can finish them by myself.

302
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,240
I can do my own things
without any help from others.

303
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,180
I…

304
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,080
I made some noise on purpose

305
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,340
and disturbed Jiang Qiaoxi,

306
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,360
making him angry.

307
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,420
It's none of his business.

308
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,200
- On purpose?
- Yes.

309
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,160
No, Principle.

310
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,320
She didn't mean it.

311
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,420
They were just normal sounds.
I was annoying her.

312
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,520
Not normal at all.

313
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,160
I did it on purpose.

314
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,500
I just can't stand him,

315
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,380
can't stand the fact
that he studies well and hard.

316
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,020
- That's not the case.
- That's the case.

317
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,200
What's going on

318
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,900
with you two?

319
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,820
It takes two to tango. We were both wrong.

320
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,160
I admit my mistakes.

321
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,240
I’m sorry, Jiang Qiaoxi.

322
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,700
I'm sorry, Lin Qile.

323
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,420
I shouldn't have annoyed you.

324
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,340
Good!

325
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,080
This is the kind of students we have here,

326
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,740
Glad to see you two admitting mistakes.

327
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,440
Solidarity matters.

328
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,820
- Goodbye, Principal.
- Goodbye, Principal.

329
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,100
Goodbye, Principal.

330
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,220
Don’t you think Lin Yingtao

331
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,220
is harder to understand ever since

332
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,040
she started being more like a girl?

333
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,920
Hard to understand?

334
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,820
She's just making a tactical retreat

335
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,340
to cut ties with Jiang Qiaoxi.

336
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,500
When did you know girls so well?

337
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,420
You guys

338
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,320
should really read some romance novels.

339
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,660
Try to understand the thoughts of
the other half of the world's population.

340
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,600
Let me see.

341
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,600
<i>Temptation of the Man.</i>

342
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,340
A romance novel is called that?

343
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,460
The title is a bit strange,

344
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,600
but it is very famous now.

345
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,220
Many girls in our class read it.

346
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,660
YOUR COMPATIBILITY INDEX

347
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,560
WITH LIN QILE IS 80%.

348
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,500
YOU ARE HIGHLY IN TUNE

349
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,380
WITH EACH OTHER.

350
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,100
HIDE

351
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,460
Is this a pirated version?

352
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,560
The main characters are named differently.

353
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,440
Look.

354
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,580
I knew it.

355
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,160
How could the heroine of a romance novel

356
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,360
written by a foreign author
be named as Zhao Cuifang?

357
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,260
Impossible.

358
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,980
This is her writing style.

359
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,520
Something wrong with your computer?

360
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,780
Poor one,

361
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,420
even a romantic novel can be pirated.

362
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,260
I'll download any book you want to read.

363
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,540
- Really?
- Really.

364
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,140
I'll download with Yu Qiao's computer.

365
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,340
Dude,

366
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,340
quit downloading that adult stuff
on my family computer.

367
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,860
Yu Jin is only nine years old.

368
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,800
Don't corrupt him.

369
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,040
To corrupt him, I'm not qualified.

370
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,240
- Take it.
- Leave it to me.

371
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,720
The rice Auntie Zhang bought.

372
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,560
The game is about to start.

373
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,540
Lin Yingtao'll come over.

374
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,480
Watch for a while?

375
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,460
Qin Yeyun, we are talking about you.

376
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,400
- What's that?
- Shut it.

377
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,540
Sister Yeyun!

378
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,900
I want to give you a treasure.

379
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,240
- What treasure?
- I pulled a hero card.

380
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,280
It took me six packs
of crispy noodles to get this.

381
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,740
Don’t underestimate it.

382
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,420
This is super important to me.

383
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,520
Yu Jin, thank you.

384
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,940
Let's go to your room.

385
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,800
In exchange, I'll tell you a secret, okay?

386
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
Go.

387
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,640
The game is about to start.
Don't you watch it?

388
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
Qin Yeyun?

389
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,160
Are you okay?

390
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,100
What did she say to you?

391
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,720
What happened?

392
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,880
I just saw Qin Yeyun in the corridor,

393
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,860
and she left angrily.

394
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,940
I won't talk to her anymore.

395
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,480
What's wrong?

396
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,060
- Yu Jin ate six packs of crispy noodles
- I won't talk to her anymore.

397
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,280
just to get that collectible card
for Qin Yeyun.

398
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,920
Qin Yeyun found out just now and
they talked in his room. Not long after,

399
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,360
they came out like this.

400
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,920
Then Yu Jin started crying.

401
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,860
Come on, stop crying.

402
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,040
- Louder?
- Okay?

403
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,920
- Sure.
- Okay.

404
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,580
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, you are now watching</i>

405
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,720
<i>the 2016 FIVB Volleyball</i>
<i>Women's World Championship,</i>

406
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,680
<i>the final round of the second phase</i>
<i>between Team China and the Netherlands.</i>

407
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,780
<i>Currently…</i>

408
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,360
<i>China leads 2-0, but…</i>

409
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,540
<i>…with the two wins…</i>

410
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,460
Leave it here.

411
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,640
I'll do it myself.

412
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,700
Ling Yingtao.

413
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,980
What exactly were you saying
to Jiang Qiaoxi yesterday?

414
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,060
You two were about to come to blows.

415
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,820
So why did you end up helping him anyway?

416
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,300
<i>Nice!</i>

417
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,660
I know why Qin Yeyun was angry.

418
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,340
Over it. Move.

419
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,860
Eh?

420
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,720
This is not over yet, Lin Yingtao.

421
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,440
So, what exactly did
Qin Yeyun say to Yu Jin?

422
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,400
I don't know. Go to ask Qin Yeyun.

423
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,820
How could I know what
those girls are thinking about?

424
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,960
Why the big reaction?

425
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,380
Giving a speech?

426
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,240
Yingtao, Yun's here to see you.

427
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,240
She seems a bit upset.

428
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,960
Go inside and talk with her.

429
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,740
Leave it to me.

430
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,320
What is Jiang Qiaoxi
if not completely dense?

431
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,160
Even I understood what you meant,
and he still doesn't get it.

432
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,480
What do I mean?

433
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,160
I don't mean anything at all.

434
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,300
What you actually want to say is

435
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,580
that the rabbit is you
and the cat is Cen Xiaoman.

436
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,520
- Stop!
- No!

437
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,720
The rabbit is you
and the cat is Cen Xiaoman.

438
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,300
- Stop!
- That's it!

439
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,960
Stop, Qin Yeyun!

440
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,200
The rabbit is you,

441
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,200
and the cat is Cen Xiaoman.

442
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,220
- You are the rabbit! You are the cat!
- Oi!

443
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,820
- I don't…
- Just give up!

444
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,160
Stop pretending?

445
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,400
I'm not playing with you.

446
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,480
Don't mention Jiang Qiaoxi
in front of me anymore.

447
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,760
You said you hated him
but still wishes him well in your heart.

448
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,660
I don't wish him well.

449
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,520
No at all.

450
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,260
<i>What am I singing about?</i>

451
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,260
<i>Everything reminds me of you</i>

452
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,840
Oh, you're my greatest hit,
my anthem through and through

453
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,720
What are you saying about?

454
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,400
Even heard just once, I'll never forget.

455
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,840
What's up?

456
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,000
How did you make Yu Jin cry?

457
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,480
I just tricked him.

458
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,160
I told him

459
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,340
that if you like someone,
you have to exchange secrets.

460
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,580
So he told me his secret,

461
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,080
and then I kinda threatened him.

462
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,860
I said if he dares to like me,

463
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,600
I'd spill his secret to everyone.

464
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,120
Was that necessary?

465
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,640
He's just a kid!

466
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,920
Because of what you said today,

467
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,940
he couldn't even eat his dinner at home.

468
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,720
And even,

469
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,440
despite his being a kid,

470
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,820
He just likes you.

471
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,980
Is that a crime?

472
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,940
Yes, that's a crime.

473
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,080
He can't like me.

474
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,780
<i>Whose jacket is it?</i>

475
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,820
<i>Yingtao, is it yours?</i>

476
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,380
<i>There's even a hat too.</i>

477
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,300
Throw it away.

478
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,020
It'll just take up space anyway.
Get rid of it.

479
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,900
Toss it.

480
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,260
<i>You can like it</i>

481
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,760
because it plays with you,

482
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,620
or makes that meow sound, or catches mice.

483
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,700
But don’t like it just
because it reminds you of Chunlu.

484
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,680
Is Chunlu that replaceable?

485
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,660
It's not Chunlu's replacement.

486
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,080
It’s just when I’m upset,

487
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,420
this cat stays with me

488
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,720
and makes things easier.

489
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,140
<i>His being upset</i>

490
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,140
<i>has nothing to do with me.</i>

491
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,840
What should I do?

492
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,000
Lin Qile hasn't said much all day.

493
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,880
I asked her to
clean the blackboard earlier,

494
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,100
but she didn't say anything.

495
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,880
Is she angry with me?

496
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,480
Why don’t you ask her?

497
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,680
It’s not like we’re mind readers.

498
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,680
If she gets mad,

499
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,140
you're absolutely doomed,

500
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,020
Relax.

501
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,100
Her state now

502
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,000
is already terrifying.

503
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,220
I don't even know what to say to her.

504
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,440
- What's up?
- Ling Qile.

505
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,180
- He's writing a novel.
- Cai Fangyuan!

506
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,600
Why did you say it out?

507
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,920
It's called <i>Three Purities</i>
<i>and the Martial Immortal.</i>

508
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,100
Just search it.

509
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,760
There's a topic. You're welcome.

510
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,900
Go.

511
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,740
Cai Fangyuan's online alias is "Guanlan".

512
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,620
He also runs his own website as the admin,

513
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,100
hosted on his home computer.

514
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,720
He claims he's way better than sites like
Qingyun Academy or Back Garden,

515
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,820
even surpasses Qidian.

516
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,560
Wow, sounds amazing.

517
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,860
Really?

518
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,680
Better than Qidian?

519
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,520
What's with those looks?

520
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,200
The new generation
always surpasses the old.

521
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,140
What's so great
about those websites anyway?

522
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,240
I'm definitely better.

523
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,260
- Of course.
- Great!

524
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,700
So that's why
you've been skipping games lately.

525
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,060
Sneakily brewing up some big moves?

526
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,340
Go for it!

527
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,120
Feng Letian, I helped you.

528
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,680
You sold me out? Get out!

529
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,320
Hello, web admin.

530
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,060
Hello, Guanlan.

531
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,340
Guanlan, why the silence?

532
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,160
- Why the silence?
- No one laughs at you.

533
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,900
<i>How about your novel?</i>

534
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,540
<i>Martial arts and immortals.</i>

535
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,540
Let me read it.

536
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,600
Monitor,

537
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,340
- why don't you help…
<i>- Jiang Qiaoxi</i>

538
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,200
<i>is attending math Olympiad lectures</i>
<i>these days.</i>

539
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,900
Who can help to collect
papers of each subject for him?

540
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,560
Let me do it.

541
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,540
What's wrong?

542
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,700
Nothing.

543
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,900
Meow.

544
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,780
You're here.

545
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,400
Are you waiting for me?

546
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,400
I bring you some food.

547
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,600
Good kitten!

548
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,139
How was your day today?

549
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,219
Are you happy when you are alone?

550
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,000
Take good care of yourself
when you are alone.

551
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,500
Eat well

552
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,320
and keep warm.

553
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,860
You are very important to me,

554
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,060
so you must be

555
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,320
healthy

556
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,080
and happy,

557
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,600
okay?

558
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,040
You must be happy,

559
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,700
healthy and safe.

560
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,660
Okay?

561
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,100
Because

562
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,620
you are very important

563
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,560
to me.

564
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,120
SAFETY ON THE ROAD, HAPPILY TO BE HOME

565
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,000
- Quick.
- Come on!

566
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,500
<i>I'm completely soaked!</i>

567
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,780
<i>- Completely soaked?</i>
<i>- Totally.</i>

568
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,740
<i>Totally drenched.</i>

569
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,180
Ugh, this damn rain

570
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,920
might keep going all night.

571
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,440
How nice! A small rain to sleep to,

572
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,460
right, Yingtao?

573
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,600
You two can sleep well then,

574
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,960
but I can't fall asleep when it rains.

575
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,640
You're so carefree.

576
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,880
Can't sleep over this small rain?

577
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,280
It's not the rain keeping me up.

578
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,360
Every time it rains, the stray cats
in our complex start yowling.

579
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,920
They keep it up till past midnight.

580
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,600
Is there really a kitten?

581
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,600
I haven't heard of it.

582
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,540
- Get in the car.
- Get in.

583
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,720
- Get in.
- Cut the crap. Go!

584
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,700
- Get in.
- Hurry.

585
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,080
Get in, Yingtao.

586
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,140
ROUTE 25, TO DONGSHI ROAD

587
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,060
You guys go first.

588
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,120
I… left something at school.

589
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,880
<i>- I'll go with you.</i>
- No need.

590
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:27,980
Meow!

591
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,240
Meow!

592
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,760
Meow!

593
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,260
Meow!

594
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,600
Meow!

595
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,200
Meow.

596
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,860
Meow.

597
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,680
Meow.

598
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,800
Hang on, little kitty! Don’t be scared.

599
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,220
I’m coming to save you.

600
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,420
Hold on, I’m almost there.

601
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,760
Little kitty.

602
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,120
Don’t be scared.

603
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,840
Come on, let’s go up.

604
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,260
Don’t be scared.

605
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,720
it’s okay. You’re safe now.

606
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,280
It’s okay.

607
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,980
Let's go.

608
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,320
Let's go.

609
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,500
I'll get you out of here.

610
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,560
Go.

611
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,120
Go up.

612
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,000
Go.

613
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,000
Off you go.

614
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,640
I will go up too…

615
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,900
Lin Yingtao!

616
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,940
Why are you here?

617
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,880
Why are you here?

618
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,000
Shouldn’t I be the one asking you?

619
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,180
Stop asking. Save me first.

620
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,740
Quickly.

621
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,600
Didn’t you say

622
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,920
we’re just regular classmates?

623
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,480
Since when do regular classmates

624
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,400
throw themselves into danger
for their cat like this?

625
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,100
Is this really the time for questions?

626
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,400
Could you get me out of here first?

627
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,400
I should be the one to save my own cat.

628
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,680
Why didi you get involved?

629
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,680
So you’re the only one with a kind heart?

630
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,980
Stop lying to yourself.

631
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,740
You and I, we were never
regular classmates.

632
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,980
Everything you’ve done for me
crossed that line long ago.

633
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,140
Admit it?

634
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,620
No.

635
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,240
The harder you deny it,

636
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,020
the more you prove it’s true.

637
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,240
You're so superficial.

638
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,260
Superficial?

639
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,580
Yes, I'm superficial. Bye.

640
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,920
Don't!

641
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,660
Jiang Qiaoxi, don't go!

642
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,720
Come back.

643
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,100
Fine.

644
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,220
Jiang Qiaoxi,

645
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,600
you're the top student in our grade,

646
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,880
the math Olympiad genius of Jialin.

647
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,760
You…

648
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,980
You're handsome,

649
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,040
and your voice is perfect.

650
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,720
That's all?

651
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,060
I'm tall.

652
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Right.

653
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,560
You're tall.

654
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,900
Okay?

655
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,020
So what if I treat you differently?

656
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,220
Most people do.

657
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,120
Nothing special about it.
Why do you even care?

658
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,600
The fact you are treating me differently

659
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,860
makes me pleased.

660
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,000
Are you done with your gloating?

661
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,560
Do you mind getting me up?

662
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,820
Come on.

663
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,800
Give me your hands.

664
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,740
I can't get up like this.

665
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,300
You come down

666
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,280
and I'll step on you.

667
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,520
Me? Come down?

668
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,620
Uh-huh.

669
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,300
Sure.

670
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,280
It's so high. How did you even get down?

671
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,740
Let's go.

672
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,560
- Come here.
- Squat down.

673
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,800
Be careful!

674
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,640
- Come on.
- How can I get here?

675
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,880
- I'll lift you.
- Then I'll step on your leg.

676
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,640
Be careful of your legs.

677
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,240
Okay.

678
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,480
Pull me up.

679
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,960
Aren't you tall? Come up by yourself.

680
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,380
And you were right.

681
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,460
it’s your cat, your responsibility.

682
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,480
No need for my help.

683
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,340
I’m not lying to myself.

684
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,420
Ling Yingtao.

685
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,600
Mimi,

686
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,160
come here.

687
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,160
Are you okay?

688
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,940
Be good.

689
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,880
Stay here.

690
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,920
You can’t be like her, bad girl.

691
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,480
Don’t run off.

692
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,140
