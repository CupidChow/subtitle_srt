1
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,940
I've had so many dreams.

2
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,840
Like I was living
in different parallel universes.

3
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,960
Each universe had its version of you.

4
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,180
Every version of you ended up
with a different fate.

5
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,040
In any of those universes…

6
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,540
you probably never imagined

7
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,240
I'd end up like this.

8
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,840
Do you know

9
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,660
what I see

10
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,660
when I look at you now?

11
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,620
You are safe.

12
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,260
A little tanner, but honestly?
You look healthier.

13
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,060
You've got a roof over your head.

14
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,580
You've got someone to talk to.

15
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,840
And you've been thinking about me.

16
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,380
That's already the best ending
out of all my dreams.

17
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,000
Do you know what kind of dreams I had?

18
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,140
I dreamed you got shot.

19
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,900
You were robbed.

20
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,180
Jiang Qiaoxi,

21
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,400
if you were me,

22
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,280
after our talk that night,

23
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,220
I just disappeared.

24
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,580
No calls. No messages.

25
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,540
what would you have thought?

26
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,740
I'd probably think

27
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,000
Yingtao must be doing great.

28
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,180
At the very least,

29
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,160
she wouldn't be stuck

30
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,840
the way I am now.

31
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,340
Liar.

32
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,940
I'm not leaving.

33
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,600
I meant it. I'm staying, Jiang Qiaoxi.

34
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,840
Hey,

35
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,660
do me a favor.

36
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,040
When she wakes up tomorrow,

37
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,440
grab her some breakfast from that

38
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,960
shrimp dumpling place around the corner.

39
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,400
Pretty sure she'd like it.

40
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,780
Why don't you do it?

41
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,720
Come on, I'm asking you.

42
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Okay.

43
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,920
Hey.

44
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,100
Jiang Qiaoxi.

45
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,300
She came all this way. What are you doing?

46
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,840
Where are you going?

47
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,900
Gotta hit the site for one more shift.

48
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,660
Are you insane?

49
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,760
Got the energy to work but not to stay?

50
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,360
Your girlfriend's literally right there…

51
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,040
Hey!

52
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,280
Not coming back tonight?

53
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,980
This guy…

54
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,060
You two doing <i>Reunion at the Nunnery</i> now?

55
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,860
Same as Princess Changping,
who hid and became a nun for years.

56
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,780
Her Consort Zhou shows up and finds her,
but the Princess runs away.

57
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,640
Hey, Du Shang.

58
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,280
Yingtao.

59
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,940
Did I wake you?

60
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,340
No, not at all.

61
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,200
Hey…

62
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,700
I'm, um,

63
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,820
in Hong Kong.

64
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,740
I found Jiang Qiaoxi.

65
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,140
That's great.

66
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,380
I called because I thought
you should know.

67
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,200
<i>Earlier,</i>

68
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,420
<i>Cai Fangyuan saw a photo</i>
<i>of Jiang QIaoxi online</i>

69
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,200
<i>on his MSN Space.</i>

70
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,340
<i>He was tutoring there in Hong Kong.</i>

71
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,960
Only a few of us saw it.

72
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,280
But Qin Yeyun said…

73
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,100
So I didn't…

74
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,680
<i>I kept thinking about it for days.</i>

75
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,200
<i>Eventually, I talked to Cai Fangyuan,</i>

76
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,100
<i>and we agreed you should know.</i>

77
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,640
It's okay.

78
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,440
I get where Qin Yeyun was coming from.

79
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,860
She meant well.

80
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,740
<i>Where is Jiang Qiaoxi?</i>

81
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,780
<i>How is he?</i>

82
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,820
He…

83
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,920
Not great.

84
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,700
But now that you're there,

85
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,020
I'm sure he'll be okay.

86
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,440
You're his heroine, you know.

87
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,180
You're right.

88
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,940
Alright, I'll let you go.

89
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,540
Call me if anything comes up.

90
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,460
I will. Bye.

91
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,080
Where are you?

92
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,280
Thank you.

93
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,560
Had breakfast yet?

94
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,480
Jiang Qiaoxi asked me
to bring this for you.

95
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,760
He'll pay me later.

96
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,080
- Thanks.
- No problem at all.

97
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,160
Thank you.

98
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,760
Well…

99
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,560
Have you booked a hotel yet?

100
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,200
I can take you over after breakfast.

101
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,680
If not, I can help you find one.

102
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,940
I get discounts.

103
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,860
I know you're here for Vincent.

104
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,580
Don't worry.

105
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,920
Just give me your number.

106
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,060
I'll call you as soon as he's back.

107
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,200
Hello?

108
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,840
I'm not leaving.

109
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,400
Jaing Qiaoxi didn't come home last night.

110
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,200
Even if he really plans to leave for good,

111
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,900
he'll have to come back
for his ID and his luggage.

112
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,000
So I'm staying.
Don't try to talk me out of it.

113
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,760
Leave? That's not gonna happen.

114
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,860
He's not leaving.

115
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,940
If he could've, he would've already.

116
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,100
You go on ahead and check in.

117
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,400
I'm not leaving.
Don't talk me into anything on his behalf.

118
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,560
Thanks.

119
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,540
Alright, how about this.

120
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,120
You finish breakfast,

121
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,440
I'll tell you which nunnery
Princess Changping's hiding in.

122
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,060
Then we'll go catch your runaway princess.

123
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,220
You know where he is?

124
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,100
I'll take you there.

125
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,240
Just give me a second.

126
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,000
Honestly,

127
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,620
you don't have to worry.

128
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,980
He slept in the site shack last night.

129
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,100
Site shack?

130
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,240
What do you call these site guys?

131
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,360
You know, the builders.

132
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,160
You mean Jiang Qiaoxi
is working at construction sites?

133
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,100
Yep.

134
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,740
Pays well by the hour, flexible schedule.

135
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,400
He's broke, no degree, no time.

136
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,420
Plus, the work permit is easy to get.
Perfect fit for him.

137
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,200
But didn't he go to university?

138
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,340
Didn't he take TOEFL or something?

139
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,220
No no, he's a student at HKU.

140
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,360
Top of his class.

141
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,080
Okay, he's at HKU.

142
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,760
Even builders have to be HKU students?

143
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,760
Not exactly.

144
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,780
But

145
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,580
they don't stop students

146
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,720
from doing that stuff.

147
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,480
If you're willing to do overtime,
you can make fifty, sixty thousand

148
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,500
a month.

149
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,740
That much?

150
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,780
What kind of money is he trying to make?

151
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,400
Honestly, even construction isn't enough.

152
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,840
He's tutoring on top of it.

153
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,580
Best job he's ever had, actually.

154
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,640
But to do it,

155
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,100
he has to cross the border to Shenzhen.

156
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,720
Shenzhen?

157
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,580
That's a lot of hassle.

158
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,680
Yeah, it's a hassle, but sometimes

159
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,920
something good comes out of it.

160
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,680
Like what?

161
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,180
Me, obviously.

162
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,160
He's good at math,
so he manages my finances.

163
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,440
Made me a good bit of money,

164
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,720
so I gave him a break on rent.

165
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,060
Even let him live in the biggest unit

166
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,060
in the building.

167
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,460
Otherwise, how could he save anything?

168
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,020
Hong Kong rent'll bleed you dry.

169
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,100
He lives in

170
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,400
the biggest room?

171
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,880
Yeah.

172
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,060
How'd things get so hard for him.

173
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,020
You know,

174
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,320
I always thought

175
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,600
that photo of you in his room was made up.

176
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,080
Figured he imagined you or something.

177
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,400
I mean,

178
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,160
he never seemed quite right.

179
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,180
Then I saw you for real and thought, whoa.

180
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,360
Almost had a heart attack.

181
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,940
You do exist.

182
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,480
Yin.

183
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,460
He's been tutoring,

184
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,220
working construction,

185
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,400
and you even cut his rent.

186
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,960
Do you actually know
what he's saving up for?

187
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,920
Sometimes people would rather
spill everything to strangers

188
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,300
than say a single word
to someone they care about.

189
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,079
You'll have to ask him.

190
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,480
I can't talk about it.

191
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,220
That's where he's working now.

192
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,540
POLICE STATION

193
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,940
Jiang Qiaoxi!

194
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,340
Jiang Qiaoxi…

195
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,440
Hey, wait.

196
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,240
What's going on, miss?

197
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,620
Anything we can do?

198
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,480
Don't walk away, Jiang Qiaoxi. I saw you!

199
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,660
Jiang Qiaoxi.

200
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,700
Jiang Qiaoxi!

201
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,720
Jiang Qiaoxi!

202
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,980
Stop running!

203
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,340
Stop running!

204
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,600
Please. Stop running.

205
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,720
Jiang Qiaoxi…

206
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,320
- Yingtao!
<i>- Stop him!</i>

207
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,720
<i>Don't let him run away.</i>

208
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,480
- Yingtao…
- Don't move.

209
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,100
- Miss.
- Let go!

210
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,940
Don't move. Miss, are you alright?

211
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,360
- Let go!
- Don't move.

212
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
- Please.
- He stole something from you?

213
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,840
- No…
- Guys,

214
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,080
- We are good. Let go.
- don't hurt him.

215
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,240
Don't move!

216
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,720
What happened?

217
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,720
No.

218
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,380
- Did he steal anything?
- He's my friend.

219
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,340
Hey!

220
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,440
Please don't hurt him.

221
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,120
- Sorry, he's a friend.
- You alright?

222
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,880
Get a room, lovebirds.

223
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,540
Man, you really spoil her.

224
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,520
- It's okay.
- Stop running.

225
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,060
- What's wrong?
- Stop running, Jiang Qiaoxi.

226
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,940
Please, I can't keep up.

227
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,820
Jiang Qiaoxi.

228
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,880
I can't…

229
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,440
Come on, I'll take you to the hospital.

230
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,000
Just don't…

231
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,860
run again.

232
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,480
Jiang Qiaoxi…

233
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,860
Yingtao. Yingtao?

234
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,820
Stop running.

235
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,940
I'm right here. I'm not running.

236
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,080
Careful.

237
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,800
Don't run.

238
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,280
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi, look at those jellyfish</i>
<i>on TV. They're so pretty.</i>

239
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,100
<i>Makes me want to eat take a bite.</i>

240
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,640
<i>Probably taste amazing.</i>

241
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,340
<i>You can't eat jellyfish.</i>
<i>Most of them are poisonous.</i>

242
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,020
<i>No way. They're so pretty.</i>

243
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,140
<i>Looks pretty, stings worse.</i>

244
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,280
<i>Huh?</i>

245
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,340
<i>Are you poisonous too, Jiang Qiaoxi?</i>

246
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,060
<i>What are you doing?</i>

247
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,820
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi,</i>

248
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,420
<i>I think I've been poisoned by you.</i>

249
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,820
<i>Help.</i>

250
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,700
<i>Somebody help…</i>

251
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,820
<i>Yingtao,</i>

252
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,040
<i>do you like jellyfish?</i>

253
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,560
<i>Let's go see them together someday.</i>

254
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,840
<i>But there's no aquarium in Qunshan.</i>

255
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,740
<i>There is in the city.</i>

256
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,680
<i>But I don't like the city.</i>

257
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,420
Then we won't go.

258
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,580
<i>If you're there, I'll like it.</i>

259
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,040
Then we're definitely going.

260
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,560
<i>Yingtao,</i>

261
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,100
<i>why aren't you doing your homework?</i>

262
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,200
<i>Yours not done.</i>

263
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,760
<i>Mine's not done either.</i>

264
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,140
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi…</i>

265
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,380
How come your homework's still not done?

266
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,360
Jiang Qiaoxi…

267
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,760
Yingtao.

268
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,040
Jiang Qiaoxi.

269
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,180
You've grown so much.

270
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,580
You were so small in my dream.

271
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,880
Just this tiny little thing.

272
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,140
Yingtao…

273
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,980
We've both grown up.

274
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,220
No serious issues.

275
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,000
Just heat exhaustion, her body's worn out.

276
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,320
You know how intense
the AC is in Hong Kong.

277
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,180
It's not like back in Hongyang.

278
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,460
Your girlfriend showed up dressed light,

279
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,640
no jacket.

280
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,140
She got overheated walking outside,

281
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,680
then chilled to the bone
in the metro and indoors.

282
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,520
That hot-and-cold swing took her out.

283
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,920
And she mentioned

284
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,420
she hasn't slept in a couple days.

285
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,020
That added to it.

286
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,540
Anyway, what matters now is rest.

287
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,280
Thanks, doctor.

288
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,220
Why'd you come out here?

289
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,200
- Get back in.
- I came to find you.

290
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,940
Go back in. You need to rest.

291
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,900
I'm scared I'll wake up

292
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
and you'll be gone.

293
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,380
I won't leave.

294
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,120
I'll be right here.

295
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,820
Back to bed.

296
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,660
You need to rest
if you want to get better.

297
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,520
Yingtao.

298
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,980
Yingtao.

299
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,600
Take me home.

300
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,800
I don't like how hospitals smell.

301
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,340
Please take me back.

302
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,340
My AC's still broken.

303
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,040
It was the heat and cold
that made you sick.

304
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,160
Going home will only make it worse.

305
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,660
I'll use a blanket.

306
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,260
I just don't want to stay here.

307
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,060
Okay. Sit tight.

308
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,580
Come on.

309
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,740
I'll get a room.

310
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,420
Sir,

311
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,560
can I help you?

312
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,360
One single room, please.

313
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,120
Wake her up and have her check in herself.

314
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,300
She's sick.

315
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,000
Can I register first?

316
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,380
Once she wakes up,

317
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,100
I'll bring her down.

318
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,920
Isn't she your girlfriend?

319
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,580
She is…my girlfriend.

320
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,380
Then please wake her up.

321
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,760
She needs to sign in herself.

322
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,320
I had a dream

323
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,420
back there.

324
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,520
In that dream,

325
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,380
someone says I am his girlfriend.

326
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,960
Who was that?

327
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,620
Was that you, Jiang Qiaoxi?

328
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,500
Dreams are the opposite of real life.

329
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,720
The opposite?

330
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,820
So does that mean

331
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,500
I'm actually your boyfriend?

332
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,300
If you've got energy, get down and walk.

333
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,100
I'm dizzy.

334
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,820
Jiang Qiaoxi, you know something?

335
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,220
A senior in my dorm at university

336
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,920
taught me how to do makeup.

337
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,580
Now I can blend eyeshadow,

338
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,260
add blush,

339
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,900
even do mascara.

340
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,660
But

341
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,800
I've never used

342
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,980
the lipstick

343
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,480
and those heels you gave me.

344
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,820
Because I kept thinking
about what you said.

345
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,080
That you didn't want to miss

346
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,680
my first time in lipstick and heels.

347
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,820
Yingtao.

348
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,440
That's enough.

349
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,560
No, it's not. I need to say it.

350
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,160
I need to say it.

351
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,280
Jiang Qiaoxi, you drive me crazy.

352
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,480
You're selfish.

353
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,580
You lied to me.

354
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,240
You pushed me away.

355
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,320
You didn't believe in me.

356
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,140
And still… I don't hate you.

357
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,780
Because I know deep down,
you wanted come to me and be there for me.

358
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,000
Just like when you were a kid,

359
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,680
trying to find your way back to Qunshan.

360
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,500
Yingtao…

361
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,500
I can barely keep my life together.

362
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,140
How could I be there for you?

363
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,340
That's why I came.

364
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,120
Jiang Qiaoxi.

365
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,400
Don't be scared.

366
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,160
I found you.

367
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,720
Watch out.

368
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,780
Where are you going?

369
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,880
Just getting some water.

370
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,800
KEUNG KEE STORE

371
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,900
Take your meds now.

372
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,860
Then again at eleven tonight.

373
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,540
I want to shower.

374
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,440
I'm all sweaty. It's gross.

375
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
Okay.

376
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:51,060
Where are you going now?

377
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,120
Hang tight. I'll be right back.

378
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,180
Shower's ready.

379
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,780
Um…

380
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,760
Hot water on the left, cold on the right.

381
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,280
You can put your clothes there.

382
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,660
I'll, um, wait outside.

383
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,540
The door lock's broken.

384
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,340
I'll call someone to fix it.

385
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,740
How long will that take?

386
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,320
Could be a while.

387
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,420
Then can you just stay out there
and keep watch?

388
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,680
I won't take long.

389
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,780
Sure.

390
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,240
Take your time.

391
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,500
I'll be right here.

392
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,100
Jiang Qiaoxi.

393
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,140
Yeah?

394
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,560
Nothing.

395
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,000
Just checking you're still there.

396
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,660
I'm not going anywhere.

397
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,580
Jiang Qiaoxi.

398
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,440
Hmm?

399
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,940
Never mind.

400
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,960
You done?

401
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,300
Your body wash smells nice.

402
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,700
Just something I grabbed.

403
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,940
It's the same smell I noticed

404
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,160
when you were carrying me earlier.

405
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,020
I'm done.

406
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,480
You go shower now.

407
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,680
Me?

408
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,800
You're not gonna shower
after running around all day?

409
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,220
You finished freshening up?

410
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,880
You look like…

411
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,000
the you back in high school.

412
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,640
I wasn't this tan back then.

413
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,100
But when I look into your eyes…

414
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,620
I still see that same you.

415
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,840
That was…

416
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,440
a long time ago.

417
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,980
It's been what, two years?

418
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,740
That's not long at all.

419
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,460
Tell me…

420
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,620
what really happened…

421
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,620
these past two years?

422
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,280
Yingtao,

423
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,960
get some rest.

424
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,780
I'm right in front of you.

425
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,620
And you're still not gonna tell me?

426
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,580
You're not feeling well.

427
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,540
You need to rest up.

428
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,320
Don't go.

429
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,620
