1
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,900
- I've cut them.
- Okay.

2
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,860
<i>‪Okay, I got it.</i>

3
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,840
<i>I'll get it for you.</i>

4
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,540
You are back!

5
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,140
She looks upset. Shall we check?

6
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,580
- I will go check on her.
- Sure.

7
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,260
Yingtao.

8
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,780
What happened?

9
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,600
Is this the outfit?

10
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,000
- Hm.
<i>- Let me see.</i>

11
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,900
It's actually really nice.

12
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,980
Why are there two sets?

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,780
One set belongs to Qin Yeyun.

14
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,080
Please help me deliver it to her.

15
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,900
She's too lazy to take it by herself.

16
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,840
Qin Family Mart didn't open today.

17
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,520
Maybe your Uncle Qin
took Yun to visit relatives.

18
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,300
Visit relatives? How old is she?

19
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,800
Yun's family situation
is different from ours.

20
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,840
When her dad takes her to visit relatives,

21
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,580
it's because he wants her

22
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,060
to have their support later on.

23
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,500
She has our support. That's not enough?

24
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,540
What else does she want?

25
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,940
What's wrong?

26
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,820
Did you two bicker?

27
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,480
I didn't do anything.

28
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,680
Nothing I'd known.

29
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,040
She treated me like that.

30
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,240
What else does she want from me?

31
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,880
When you give her the clothes,
tell her this:

32
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,020
If she doesn't want me

33
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,180
as friends, then fine.

34
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,120
We shall part ways.

35
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,440
We're done. Forever.

36
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,840
Cai.

37
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,220
What's wrong?

38
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,300
<i>I'm cooking.</i>

39
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,560
You still talk exactly

40
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,060
like you did as a kid.

41
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,660
Back then,

42
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,240
every time you lost a fight to Yun,

43
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,940
you'd come home with these angry talks.

44
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,980
They are not angry talks!

45
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,340
Fine.

46
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,300
- What's wrong?
- Come here.

47
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,760
What happened?

48
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,540
Manager Cai just called.

49
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,800
Qin had trouble.

50
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,780
He's in hospital now.

51
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,840
<i>Is it bad?</i>

52
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,120
<i>I don't know.</i>

53
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,700
<i>We'd better visit him.</i>

54
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,420
Hospital?

55
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,180
Qin Yeyun.

56
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,440
I don't need to be hospitalized at all,

57
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,000
really!

58
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,940
You…

59
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,240
Can you guys help me talk to Yun?

60
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,740
Tell her not to listen to

61
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,959
the doctor's nonsense.

62
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,260
There's no way I need to stay here.

63
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,140
Just let me go.

64
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,480
Brother Qin.

65
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,100
You really need to listen.

66
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,260
If you truly care about Yun,

67
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,700
you've got to get proper treatment.

68
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,780
We just ran into Yunyun outside.

69
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,000
The kid said

70
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,480
she'll only be okay if you get better.

71
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,760
You are making life harder for her.

72
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,860
Right.

73
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,540
You have such a wonderful daughter.

74
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,400
How can you refuse proper treatment?

75
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,260
Do you know your stubbornness

76
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,620
is putting a lot pressure on Yun?

77
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,620
Just now, someone said

78
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,720
I'm lucky

79
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,040
to have such a good daughter,

80
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,980
only 17

81
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,140
but taking responsibilities like an adult.

82
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,400
But I hate hearing that.

83
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,360
Ever since she was little,

84
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,980
she's never had a real childhood.

85
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,620
After her mom passed away,

86
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,620
she's been carrying this family,

87
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,760
all by herself.

88
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,260
And me?

89
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,960
I can't do a damn thing for her.

90
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,680
- Cai,
- I am here.

91
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,480
I just want to save up some money

92
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,040
to make her future easier.

93
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,680
I can't waste it all on the hospital.

94
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,580
Besides, this leg of mine
is never gonna get better anyway.

95
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,580
Brother Qin.

96
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,120
Don't you worry about the costs.

97
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,480
It's a work-related injury.

98
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,300
All your hospital expenses
will be covered by the factory.

99
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,560
- Don't sit up!
- Lie down!

100
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,560
What are you going to do?

101
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,100
Cai.

102
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,620
But I already received

103
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,900
a one-time compensation
for this injury back then.

104
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,080
It can still be covered?

105
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,400
Of course.

106
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,000
New policy you don't know about yet.

107
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,480
If you don't believe me, ask Lin or Yu.
There is a new…new policy.

108
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,180
- Right. There is one.
- Yes, new policy.

109
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,820
This is an old injury,

110
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,640
from over a decade ago.

111
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,720
A relapse of an old injury…

112
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,820
Absolutely no problem.

113
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,320
Listen, I'm telling you straight up.

114
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,760
Let's get proper treatment, alright?

115
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,040
Exactly!

116
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,180
- Take good care.
- Right.

117
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,280
<i>- Get well.</i>
<i>- Don't worry.</i>

118
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,040
<i>- Have some fruit.</i>
<i>- Eat.</i>

119
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,900
<i>- Let him rest early.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

120
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,280
Give me.

121
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,260
You don't know how to pack.

122
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,640
Then you…Ouch!

123
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,500
Don't pick up with hands!

124
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,580
You'll get hurt!

125
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,920
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

126
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,180
Let me clean it up.

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,500
I didn't go today.

128
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,800
You're not mad at me, right?

129
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,200
How could I be mad at you?

130
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,480
I knew you must've had something going on.

131
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,680
That's why you didn't make it.

132
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,880
Surely you won't

133
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,060
stay mad at me over this.

134
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,940
In fact,

135
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,940
not only am I not upset with you,

136
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,620
I'm planning to personally deliver

137
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,020
your clothes to you myself.

138
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,800
Ling Yingtao.

139
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,440
Honestly, you don't need
to do this for me.

140
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,280
You didn't do anything wrong.

141
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,620
These past few days,
I'm the one who made you unhappy.

142
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,980
I really should be apologizing to you.

143
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,260
But right now,

144
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,760
what I want to say most is thank you.

145
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,600
Thank me for what?

146
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,840
Honestly…

147
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,640
I was…

148
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,940
a little upset today,

149
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,820
but just a tiny bit.

150
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,780
Like, barely even there.

151
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,220
Then I should thank you too.

152
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,440
Thank you for what?

153
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,539
For bringing you clothes,

154
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,960
or for coming back with you to pack up?

155
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,600
Yingtao,

156
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,780
promise me one thing.

157
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,700
Go ahead. I will definitely promise you.

158
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,720
Don't go to school alone tomorrow.

159
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,700
Go with the others.

160
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,260
I…

161
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,500
Yu Qiao likes you

162
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,020
is just a misunderstanding.

163
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,260
That compatibility test
between you and him

164
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,240
was sent by Yu Jin.

165
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,740
He wants you to be his sister-in-law.

166
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,740
Yu Jin sent it?

167
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,440
I told you it was just a joke.

168
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,660
How could it possibly be real?

169
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,900
Now that you know
Yu Jin was the one who sent it,

170
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,100
you're still mad at me? That's cold.

171
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,900
I only found out last night too.

172
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,060
Yu Jin came to the shop
to buy bubble rolls

173
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,200
and told me himself.

174
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,380
Yu Jin, that little rascal!

175
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,340
Playing matchmaking at his age?

176
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,440
And Yu Qiao's no better,

177
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,280
can't even keep track of his own phone.

178
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,200
I'll talk to him once I get back.

179
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,320
Here's the plan.

180
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,080
Just pretend you don't know it for now.

181
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,920
Alright, got it.

182
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,360
I'll play dumb for now.

183
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,820
But seriously,
what a mess they two have made!

184
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,020
I went through all that for nothing.

185
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,880
Right, it's their fault.

186
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,060
- I'll get a bag.
- Okay.

187
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,140
Yun.

188
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,580
Listen.

189
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,720
We've already covered
all your dad's hospital expenses.

190
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,880
I checked with the doctor,

191
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,400
and he said it should last
until his discharge.

192
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,360
Once the reimbursement comes through,

193
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,740
you can pay us back then. No rush.

194
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,180
Uncle Cai.

195
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,640
It has been over ten years.
The factory still reimburse it?

196
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,100
Uncle Cai is the manager.

197
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,280
Would a manager lie to you?

198
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,660
From now on, don't worry about money.

199
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,880
It's all taken care of.

200
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,160
Uncle Cai, how much did you pay?

201
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,700
I'll withdraw the money for you.

202
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,000
Don't! Come on.

203
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,140
We all know how your dad is.

204
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,880
That money he saved
must be a fixed deposit.

205
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,220
Wouldn't it be a total waste

206
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,420
- to withdraw it now?
- Yes.

207
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,020
All that interest is gone.

208
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,380
Thank you, uncles and aunties.

209
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,420
You're welcome.

210
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,960
Yun, you're still in school,

211
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,820
and 11th grade is tough enough as it is.

212
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,880
I am only doing some chores, sell skewers.

213
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,260
Now that it's getting cold,

214
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,840
fried food doesn't sell well.

215
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,800
Tell you what.

216
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,700
I'll take care of your dad during the day

217
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,100
so you can focus on studying.

218
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,380
Then after school,

219
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,780
we'll switch shifts.

220
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,840
No, Aunt Shuangyan.

221
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,000
This is way too much trouble for you.

222
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
No, listen.

223
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,280
Your Uncle Cai and the others

224
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,060
are actually paying me for this,

225
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,020
with a rate higher than
regular hospital caretaker.

226
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,780
Plus, all these expenses

227
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,960
are reimbursable.

228
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,880
Yun, it is some good arrangment.

229
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,740
You see.

230
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,620
In this way,

231
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,280
your dad gets proper care.
You can focus on school without worries.

232
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,280
Your Aunt Shuangyan

233
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,600
will get paid.

234
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,880
A triple win.

235
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
Exactly.

236
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,460
Don't tell me

237
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,140
you'd deny Aunt a chance
to earn this money?

238
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,180
Of course not, Aunt.

239
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,420
Then thank you so much, Aunt Shuangyan.

240
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,520
Thank you for helping me get paid for

241
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,020
being a caretaker.

242
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,200
Our cheerleading uniforms are nice.

243
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,160
I'll swing by your class

244
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,340
to give it to you tomorrow.

245
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,680
I doubt your definition of good-looking.

246
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,280
Really nice.

247
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,240
The whole squad voted on them.

248
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,900
Look at you two, glued together again.

249
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,060
Like eels in a hot wok,

250
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,160
the more you sizzle, the closer you get.

251
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,340
Yingtao.

252
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,020
Now that you've made up with Qin Yeyun,

253
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,080
does this mean
you'll still hang out with us?

254
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,140
Right. Keep your fights
between yourselves.

255
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,480
We are innocent but got impacted.

256
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,700
We're not picking sides.

257
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,880
You've been bickering since childhood,

258
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,200
and have we ever meddled?

259
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,820
No matter how bad it gets now,

260
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,020
don't freeze us out.

261
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,840
Who even wants to play with you guys?

262
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,300
This is because…

263
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,180
Because what?

264
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,640
Because you're ugly.

265
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,540
Just because I'm ugly,
you stop hanging out with us?

266
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,740
Such a major issue,
you didn't even bother to tell us?

267
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,920
Qin Yeyun, that's unforgivable.

268
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,120
I'm not happy about this either.

269
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,320
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

270
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,540
You guys are really pushing your luck now.

271
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,640
Go home and sleep it off.

272
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,740
Don't walk us any further. Head back now.

273
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,020
We'll wait until you're inside.

274
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,460
Speak up if anything comes up.

275
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,800
From now on,

276
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,060
we've gotta be more perceptive.

277
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,000
Why?

278
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,100
Don't you know
that's just how Qin Yeyun is?

279
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,240
The tougher things get,
the more she bottles it up.

280
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,680
If she won't tell us,

281
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,060
we'll have to notice it ourselves.

282
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,820
DEVOTED TO LEARNING, PURSUING TRUTH;
CULTIVATING VIRTUE, ACHIEVING SINCERITY.

283
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,760
<i>- Nice.</i>
<i>- Careful.</i>

284
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,500
Listen up, team!

285
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,540
The Sports Day starts tomorrow,

286
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,940
and I have full confidence
in your performance.

287
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,060
For now,

288
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,420
the only thing you need to do
is go home, rest well,

289
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,200
and save your energy.

290
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,520
I'm looking forward to
your amazing show tomorrow!

291
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,560
Dismissed!

292
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,820
- Okay!
- Okay!

293
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,380
<i>Yu Qiao.</i>

294
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,420
<i>Yu Qiao!</i>

295
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,380
- I have to go.
- Yingtao.

296
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,260
‪Yes?

297
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,260
<i>Hey, watch it!</i>

298
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,100
‪What?

299
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,080
I have a big news

300
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,600
for you.

301
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,580
Good news.

302
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,360
What is the good news?

303
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,880
WARM WELCOME FOR THE VISIT
FROM QINGBEI UNIVERSITY

304
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,000
Teachers from Qingbei University are here
to meet students in the math competition.

305
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,320
So Jiang Qiaoxi will definitely

306
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,660
be at school tomorrow.

307
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,920
Jiang Qiaoxi sure knows
how to pick his moment.

308
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,840
Yingtao, he'll get to see
your amazing performance.

309
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,360
‪Well.

310
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,720
Thank you, Ms. Juan.

311
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,160
After a long day at work, you still make
me stuffed lotus roots and jujube buns.

312
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,380
I truly appreciate it.

313
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,540
Enough.

314
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,220
Your classmates are truly something.

315
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,080
They only fancy stuffed lotus roots
and jujube buns?

316
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,160
Yes. It is my top recommendation.

317
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,120
You can try other things after this.

318
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,560
Add some sugar.

319
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,200
Enough. Too much.

320
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,120
- Not enough.
- No. Too sweet.

321
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,400
Jiang Qiaoxi doesn't like…

322
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,500
I knew it!

323
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,960
You could've just told me upfront

324
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,340
it was for Qiaoxi.

325
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,760
Worry that I'd disagree?

326
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,080
‪Well.

327
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,260
‪I mean…

328
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,780
You…

329
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,020
Is someone blushing?

330
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,040
Yun.

331
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,740
- Uncle Jiang.
- I was just about to go see your dad.

332
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,800
Thank you.

333
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,460
Just got back
from a business trip a few days ago.

334
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,140
I heard that
your dad was in hospital again.

335
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,320
So I came here to check on him.

336
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,680
Thank you, uncle. Sorry for the trouble.

337
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,860
Don't worry about it.

338
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,760
How's your dad now?

339
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,480
If there's any difficulty,

340
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,860
you must tell Uncle.

341
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,240
No need to hold back, understand?

342
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,080
Recently, he's been…

343
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,760
okay.

344
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,640
Yun.

345
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,000
Take it.

346
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,320
Really, Uncle, I can't.

347
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,860
- Come on. Take it.
- I can't accept it.

348
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,760
Take it!

349
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,320
Uncle Jiang.

350
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,360
My dad's medical expenses this time.

351
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,140
Can it be covered by the factory?

352
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,600
Yun.

353
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,380
Your dad's injury
happened over a decade ago.

354
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,940
The situation is a bit complicated.

355
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,240
It depends on his condition now.

356
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,940
So it won't be reimbursed.

357
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,619
Don't worry too much.

358
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,599
We will figure something out.

359
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,800
We'll help your family

360
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,900
get through this.

361
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,119
Girl!

362
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:22,839
Girl.

363
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,900
What's wrong, uncle?

364
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,839
your dad…

365
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,920
he's been in the bathroom

366
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,079
for too long.

367
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,780
I don't know what's wrong.

368
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,960
No matter how hard I knock,

369
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,040
he won't answer.

370
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,780
Dad!

371
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,000
Dad! Open the door! Dad!

372
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,440
What are you doing here?

373
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,180
Go back.

374
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,860
I…

375
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,060
I'll be out in a moment.

376
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,860
I'll be out soon.

377
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,080
I'll find someone to open the door.

378
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,920
Girl, don't go.

379
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,800
Just stay here

380
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,860
while I go find someone.

381
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,800
Dad, open the door.

382
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,820
Yun, I…

383
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,960
Uncle, you should go back today.

384
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,100
I don't think my dad
want to see you today.

385
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,520
Nurse!

386
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,060
MEDICAL CENTER

387
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,700

<i>Yun mentioned today</i>

<i>that the mart could stock up on</i>

<i>For her tenth birthday wish,</i>

404
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,840
<i>Yun wants to have a pomegranate tree</i>
<i>of her very own.</i>

405
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,180
Here we are.

406
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,960
Yun.

407
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,900
Come here.

408
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,220
Share more with your friends.

409
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,820
Uncle's got plenty here.

410
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,860
Thanks.

411
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,360
I'll grab two more for you.

412
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,400
- Is it good?
- Yes.

413
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,520
It's sweet.

414
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,140
<i>For her thirteenth birthday wish,</i>

415
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,820
<i>Yun dreams of performing onstage</i>
<i>with her favorite actress.</i>

416
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,420
<i>So I've asked the lady from the community</i>

417
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,920
<i>to organize a special event,</i>

418
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,180
<i>for her to dance and shine.</i>

419
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,100
Yun.

420
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,160
<i>That lady was all in smiles</i>

421
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,820
<i>but never approved the venue.</i>

422
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,080
<i>Got Yun a celebrity album instead.</i>

423
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,560
<i>Hope she likes it.</i>

424
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,940
- Try it.
- Let's do makeup.

425
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,000
Qin Yeyun.

426
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,780
Why did you sleep here?

427
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,940
Get up!

428
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,720
We need to change and do makeup.

429
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,320
Did you stay up all night
taking care of Uncle?

430
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,560
I didn't sleep much last night.

431
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,220
I'm fine.

432
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,620
Enough. It's okay.

433
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,860
Can you do it?

434
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,420
Yes.

435
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,040
After meeting the teachers
from Qingbei today, I'll take you

436
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,500
straight back to training camp.

437
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,780
No lingering on campus.

438
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,920
Winter camp is about to start,

439
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,120
and we can't afford delays.

440
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,060
Understood?

441
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,880
Yes.

442
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,300
When we get to the school,

443
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,820
I'll go in with you.

444
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,720
Let me handle this alone.

445
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,140
The meeting doesn't require

446
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,180
parents to come.

447
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,680
Can't I even
have a quick word with Ms. He?

448
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,120
It is Sports Day today.

449
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,020
Your classmates are probably
having way too much fun.

450
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,840
I'm worried

451
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,700
you'll get just as carried away.

452
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,660
<i>- Quickly!</i>
<i>- Quickly!</i>

453
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,820
- What's the hurry?
- Gonna sneak some unflattering shots.

454
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,540
Qin Yeyun used to be a cheerleader too.

455
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,180
The uniforms are practically the same.
Would that makes any difference?

456
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,140
Ling Yingtao.

457
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,300
Damn it!

458
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,620
Damn it!

459
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,300
It just hit me today

460
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,660
Yingtao and I are of different genders.

461
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,140
<i>Yu Qiao. Cai Fangyuan.</i>

462
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,340
What are you doing here?

463
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,400
Called to assemble.

464
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,200
Lin Qile?

465
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,640
Bet you didn't see that coming.

466
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,060
it was Lin Qile!

467
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,480
Of course I could've guessed.

468
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,660
Lin Qile has

469
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,800
always been this radiant in my eyes.

470
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,180
Monitor, you know, people will talk

471
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,820
Don't say it anymore.

472
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,760
What? I mean it.

473
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,920
I'm telling the truth.

474
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,980
SPORTS DAY
LET YOUTH BLOOM WITH VITALITY

475
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,140
Don't look around.

476
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,520
Jiang Qiaoxi is probably
in the principal's office.

477
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,480
Alright,

478
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,980
let's run through one final rehearsal
before hitting the stage.

479
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,440
Keep your energy up.

480
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,360
Remember,

481
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,640
you're all radiant.

482
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,000
After the performance,

483
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,360
don't rush to change.

484
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,480
We're heading to the principal's office

485
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,480
for a group photo
with the Qingbei delegation.

486
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,800
<i>- Come.</i>
- He can't come to you,

487
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,080
but you can always go to him.

488
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,620
And yes, in this outfit.

489
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,400
Are you okay?

490
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,880
Are you okay, Qin Yeyun?

491
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,060
Did you get hurt from the fall?

492
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,260
- Let her take a moment to recover first.
- Did you get hurt?

493
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,340
Don't stand up immediately.

494
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,580
Qin Yeyun.

495
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,860
Why the mistake?

496
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,680
Coach,

497
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,320
I mixed up the moves.

498
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,100
Won't happen again.

499
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,780
Sure.

500
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,880
Have a rest.

501
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,800
Take her to sit there.

502
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,860
The rest of you,
take a quick break where you are.

503
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,740
Take your time.

504
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,240
We'll run through it again shortly

505
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,120
- Okay?
<i>- Take a rest.</i>

506
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,960
- Could it be low blood sugar?
<i>- Qin Yeyun.</i>

507
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,480
Your didn't sleep all night.
You sure you can handle this?

508
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,460
Your didn't sleep all night?

509
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,900
What happened?

510
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,100
Coach,

511
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,980
I'm just a bit nervous.
I couldn't sleep last night.

512
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,980
But just now was totally accidental.

513
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,160
I'm fine, really.

514
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,900
Performance is secondary.

515
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,940
Your safety comes first.

516
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,700
If something like that happened again,

517
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,600
you stumble forward
when you should fall back…

518
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,080
What if you get seriously hurt?

519
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,620
Coach, I…

520
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,580
Safety first.

521
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Qin Yeyun.

522
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,900
there's no way you're going on stage
today as you are now.

523
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,560
Coach.

524
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,600
I know this is my fault

525
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,040
and I should take responsibility.

526
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,200
I'll sit this one out.

527
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,640
But the other three in our lifting group

528
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,120
shouldn't suffer for my mistake.

529
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,340
A trio lift isn't realistic.

530
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,020
Could they maybe adjust the choreography?

531
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,200
Coach,

532
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,920
we've trained so hard for this,

533
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,820
pulling us out last minute

534
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,080
would waste everything.

535
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,280
With your group missing a member,

536
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,040
the coordination will be completely off.

537
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,080
It's okay.

538
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,720
It's better if your entire team
sits this one out.

539
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,660
The remaining members
will reorganize the formation.

540
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,740
The show must go on smoothly.

541
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,780
Don't drag the whole team down

542
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,640
or dampen morale.

543
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,440
Let's do as Xiaoman suggested.

544
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,260
Everyone, give it your all.

545
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,180
<i>Alright,</i>

546
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,320
<i>class, gather up.</i>

547
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,640
<i>Hurry up!</i>

548
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,280
<i>Come on. Quickly.</i>

549
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,740
- It's okay.
<i>- The first formation.</i>

550
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,460
<i>You stand in front.</i>

551
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,480
It's okay.

552
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,980
<i>Come here, you fill in the gap.</i>

553
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,960
<i>Here.</i>

554
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,220
I fetch my bag.

555
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
<i>You come over here.</i>

556
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,380
<i>Back there.</i>

557
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,320
<i>- Here.</i>
- It's okay. I can take them.

558
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,680
<i>Good.</i>

559
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,180
<i>The third formation.</i>

560
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,680
I'm sorry.

561
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,480
Qin Yeyun, do you really think
an apology fixes this?

562
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,560
We trained for months,

563
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,700
and now because of you,

564
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,140
we don't even get to step onstage.

565
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,680
How is that fair?

566
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,240
Wu Shuang, I know you're furious,

567
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,860
but Qin Yeyun didn't mess up on purpose.

568
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,880
She's been pushing herself…

569
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,600
to the limit lately.

570
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,160
She hates this more than anyone.

571
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,960
Lin Qile.

572
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,300
why are you still defending Qin Yeyun?

573
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,460
You've fought so hard to go from stumbling
over your own feet to where you are now.

574
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,840
Don't you know how hard that was?

575
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,760
And now, because of her,

576
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,040
you've lost your shot at performing too.

577
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,420
How can you just not even care?

578
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,160
Why take her side?

579
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,720
Between Qin Yeyun and the performance,

580
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,220
I'd choose her, of course.

581
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,120
Sorry, I didn't mean to sound cliquish.

582
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,380
I just panicked and spoke too fast.

583
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,500
I know

584
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,740
how devastated you are about us
missing the show.

585
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,160
What hurts isn't

586
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,120
missing the show,

587
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,960
it's that…

588
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,220
no one's ever said things like this to me.

589
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,980
Wu Shuang.

590
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,580
If you're going to
be upset over Cen Xiaoman,

591
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,140
you might as well just be mad at me.

592
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,380
The truth is, you two…

593
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,900
What's it?

594
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,400
That we were never

595
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,200
real friends, is it?

596
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,460
I didn't mean that.

597
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,880
Honestly, I've always known.

598
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,620
When Cen Xiaoman and I

599
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,380
walk together,

600
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,060
if my shoelaces come undone

601
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,680
and I stop,

602
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,280
she'd never wait.

603
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,200
She keeps me around

604
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,900
just to show off

605
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,420
how popular she is.

606
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,980
And me,

607
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,380
I stuck with her

608
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,080
to be part of the cool clique.

609
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,060
You've got it all figured out,

610
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,700
so why the long face?

611
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,160
If I were her,

612
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,300
I wouldn't sacrifice my friend

613
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,580
just because I don't want

614
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,180
some girl I hate to go onstage.

615
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,800
I won't ignore her feeling.

616
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,780
That's way

617
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,600
you should be feeling sorry for her.

618
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,040
You were the true friend here.

619
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,100
If she couldn't see that,

620
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,160
it's her loss.

621
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,320
Let her drown in regret, right?

622
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,660
Thanks.

623
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,480
Actually…

624
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,580
there might still be a way.

625
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,340
Maybe…

626
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,880
we can salvage our chance to perform.

627
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,080
Listen up, everyone.

628
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,200
Remember the new formation.

629
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,320
Don't mix it up with the old one.

630
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,440
- Coach, wait, please.
- Stay calm and do as usual.

631
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,320
Coach,

632
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,060
Changing the formation now
isn't a good idea.

633
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,300
These moves may look easy,

634
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,080
but if even one person slips up,

635
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,940
- the whole thing falls apart.
- Wu Shuang.

636
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,160
Coach, we just nailed the rehearsal.

637
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,860
Coach, about the lift, we've drilled it

638
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,920
countless times with the new lineup.

639
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,100
Zero room for error, I promise.

640
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,860
- Trust us on this.
- Wu Shuang.

641
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,900
You're throwing this together last minute?
Are you sure?

642
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,320
Coach, even at our worst,

643
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,180
we'd only mess up the final move.

644
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,460
But now with one group missing…

645
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,680
- You can't make absolute decisions.
- Everyone…

646
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,460
You need to
take responsibility for your safety.

647
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,980
We've been rehearsing for so long.

648
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,300
If you suddenly jump in now,

649
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,740
what if someone else gets hurt?

650
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,000
Alright.

651
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,840
All four of you,

652
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,840
fall back in line.

653
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,460
- Thank you, Coach.
- Thank you, Coach.

654
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,740
Thank you, Coach.

655
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,540
Listen, team, after decades of coaching,

656
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:34,000
do you really think I don't understand?

657
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,560
Today's performance,

658
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,280
however it goes,

659
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,220
it will be forgotten
by the audience tomorrow.

660
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,540
Because it doesn't matter to them.

661
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,660
But for you, this matters.

662
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,160
So give it everything.

663
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,640
Leave no regrets.

664
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,060
That will be perfect for you.

665
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,200
Understood?

666
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,340
- Yes.
- Alright team,

667
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,520
let's hype ourselves up!

668
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,840
On three,

669
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,640
three, two, one.

670
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,980
Go team!

671
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,300
Here,

672
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,420
take this bracelet back.

673
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,760
I don't need it anymore.

674
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,679
Plenty would kill for this

675
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,120
if you don't want it.

676
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,020
Don't regret it later.

677
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,940
I know Qiaoxi will com back today.

678
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,520
I made sure we're here to visit you.

679
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,560
You've been working so hard, Ms. He.

680
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,880
Thank you for saying that.

681
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,300
Teaching exceptional students
like Jiang Qiaoxi

682
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,199
is our reward as teachers.

683
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,920
Now, over here.

684
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,440
<i>Go for it!</i>

685
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,020
SOARING YOUTH, UNSTOPPABLE ENERGY

686
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,300
<i>Go!</i>

687
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,820
<i>Nice!</i>

688
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,420
Sir,

689
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,320
any chance for restroom?

690
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,980
<i>Sure.</i>

691
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,080
<i>Go!</i>

692
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,640
CLASS 12, YEAR 11

693
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,880
CLASS 13, YEAR 11

694
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,200
Xiaoman!

695
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,600
Lin Qile!

696
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,400
Xiaoman!

697
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,540
Lin Qile!

698
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,820
<i>Qiaoxi, sit here.</i>

699
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,960
Scoot over a bit.

700
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,760
Scoot over.

701
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,580
<i>Lin Qile!</i>

702
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,240
Quit slouching.

703
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,040
Chin up, shoulders back.
Today you're the stunning one, so own it.

704
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,240
I am a knockout every single day, okay?

705
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,020
Come here.

706
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,680
Auntie Liang.

707
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,280
Xiaoman.

708
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,940
This is our school's cheer squad.

709
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,820
<i>- Go.</i>
<i>- Let's go.</i>

710
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,040
These kids have been training for months.

711
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,720
That was Jiang Qiaoxi's mom, Auntie Liang.

712
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,000
Isn't she stunning? So elegance.

713
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,560
Xiaoman, you and Qiaoxi's mom
are that close?

714
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,280
You are this tight?

715
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,420
<i>- Lin Qile, you and Jiang Qiaoxi</i>
- Let them wait here.

716
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,520
- were classmates in Qunshan.
<i>- They're in meeting now.</i>

717
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,320
You should know his mom.

718
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,400
Sort of.

719
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,640
We talked.

720
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,500
Jiang Qiaoxi stares right at you.

721
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,620
I'm good-looking.
Who else should he be staring at?

722
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,700
Got the guts to say it louder?

723
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,460
<i>Alright, students,</i>

724
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,820
<i>head inside for the group photo.</i>

725
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,440
<i>Come on, big smiles.</i>

726
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,360
<i>Be happy. Smile.</i>

727
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,480
<i>Over here, please.</i>

728
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,340
<i>This way.</i>

729
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,040
<i>Qiaoxi, come here.</i>

730
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,100
Here.

731
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,020
- Principle.
- Here.

732
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,300
- I'll block others.
- In the middle.

733
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,180
That's fine.

734
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,040
- Next to the teachers.
- I'll find a place.

735
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,780
- Being shy?
- Come.

736
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,180
- Please, Sir. You in the middle.
- Okay.

737
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,340
Everyone, get tight.

738
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,260
First row, down on your haunches
so we can see the second row.

739
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,540
- Sure.
- Okay.

740
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,800
<i>Lin Qile,</i>

741
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,820
<i>move to the left.</i>

742
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,680
You stepped on me.

743
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,460
Sorry.

744
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:49,000
<i>Everyone, tuck your shirts.</i>

745
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,000
<i>Smooth your collars.</i>

746
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,140
<i>Teachers, smile.</i>

747
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,060
<i>Be happy.</i>

748
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,080
What are you looking at?

749
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,400
- I didn't look at you.
- You did.

750
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,420
I felt it.

751
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,660
I didn't.

752
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,120
<i>Okay, smile.</i>

753
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,160
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

754
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,640
<i>Hi.</i>

755
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,040
<i>Qiaoxi, once winter camp wraps up,</i>

756
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,520
<i>you should pay a visit to Qingbei.</i>

757
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,280
- Quick.
- What?

758
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,720
- Quickly.
- Look how worked up you're getting!

759
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,640
Jiang Qiaoxi.

760
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,980
I kept your study materials
organized for you this whole time.

761
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,860
Let me get change.

762
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,200
- I'll bring them to you later.
- Sure.

763
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,080
<i>- Sir, I'll head back first then.</i>
- Auntie Liang.

764
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,200
- Let me grab Qiaoxi's stuff.
<i>- Okay.</i>

765
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,140
- Thank you, Xiaoman.
<i>- Sure.</i>

766
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,340
<i>- We'll meet at Qingbei University.</i>
- Not at all.

767
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,220
Sure.

768
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,420
Principal, I'll take my leave now.

769
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,780
<i>He's so outstanding.</i>

770
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,240
<i>- This way.</i>
- Let's go.

771
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,460
JIALIN NO. 1 EXPERIMENTAL HIGH SCHOOL

772
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,220
Now what?

773
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,100
We met finally.

774
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,600
But the jujube buns and
stuffed lotus roots…

775
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,500
Also a lot more stuff

776
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,200
I wanted to say to him.

777
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,860
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>

778
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,000
Auntie Liang.

779
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,140
Xiaoman.

780
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,420
All the materials I've been
collecting for you these days.

781
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,300
Thanks.

782
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,020
Let's go then.

783
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,120
Goodbye.

784
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,220
- Bye.
- Bye-Bye.

785
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,800
There might still be another way.

786
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,840
What's it?

787
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,660
