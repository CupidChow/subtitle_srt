1
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,500
I stood here,

2
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,620
under this sky of burning sunset.

3
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,920
For the first time, I prayed in my heart.

4
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,180
Let the day in Hongyang

5
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,900
be a cloudy day without sunset glows.

6
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,240
Yingtao must not see the sunset glow.

7
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,660
So she won't think of me.

8
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,380
Let her be happy…

9
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,080
even just a little.

10
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,880
Maybe you were right.

11
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,940
Maybe on that day,

12
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,600
I didn't see any sunset.

13
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,140
Most days,

14
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,620
I was in the library

15
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,020
or stuck in class at night.

16
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,420
I didn't get to see sunsets anyway.

17
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,920
I know that's just me lying to myself.

18
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,600
It's not the sunset

19
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,960
that reminds you of me.

20
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,940
It's because you thought of me

21
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,380
that led you to the view of sunsets.

22
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,000
So, I can't blame your sadness

23
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,680
on the sunset.

24
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,260
It's me. I'm to be blame.

25
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,740
There are times I can't stand myself.

26
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,140
I don't even know why,

27
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,720
but when I left you that night,

28
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,760
I told you,

29
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,600
"Don't forget me, Yingtao."

30
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,380
But the truth is,

31
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,040
the people I care about, near or far,

32
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,720
I never had the strength
to hold on to any of them.

33
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,100
There were days my chest felt so tight,

34
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,840
I thought I'd explode.

35
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,880
For the first time,

36
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,340
I wanted to find a place
and cry my heart out.

37
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,880
I ducked behind a pillar,

38
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,840
but tourists were taking photos.

39
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,560
I went down the stairs,

40
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,620
and there were couples kissing.

41
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,420
So, I held it in.

42
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,300
I held it in all the way until around

43
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,240
ten o'clock at night.

44
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,040
<i>The crowd thinned out.</i>

45
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,360
<i>I bought a Ferris wheel ticket.</i>

46
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,200
<i>I sat alone in a cabin</i>

47
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,760
<i>and finally let it all out.</i>

48
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,320
<i>That was September 6th,</i>

49
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,980
<i>of 2008.</i>

50
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,460
<i>That night,</i>
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi was a miserable guy.</i>

51
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Because he had no idea

52
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,100
that 639 days later,

53
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,800
he'd be standing here again.

54
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,320
Lin Yingtao would be right beside him.

55
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,620
Jiang Qiaoxi, you dummy.

56
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,160
Why don't you just call Lin Yingtao?

57
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,000
Tell her

58
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,720
you feel terrible.

59
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,720
She would've fought through it with you.

60
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,860
<i>But even if you don't, it doesn't matter.</i>

61
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,380
<i>Because in 639 days,</i>

62
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,760
Lin Yingtao

63
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,040
will come looking for you.

64
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,460
<i>No matter where you are,</i>

65
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,460
<i>I'll always find you.</i>

66
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,380
<i>Don't sell yourself short.</i>

67
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,140
You've done something amazing.

68
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,880
And from this day on,

69
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,660
I'm staying right by your side.

70
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,840
You're stuck with me now.

71
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,680
No more running.

72
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,280
If only I'd been there back then.

73
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,940
<i>You could've stepped</i>

74
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,280
<i>off that Ferris wheel</i>

75
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,300
<i>and fallen into my arms.</i>

76
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,020
<i>You weren't late.</i>

77
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,940
It is me

78
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,080
who couldn't find my way home.

79
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,540
Jiang Qiaoxi,

80
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,120
where can we watch the sunrise
in Hong Kong?

81
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,740
Let's go find it.

82
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,220
It's beautiful.

83
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,780
Let's keep walking.

84
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,260
There.

85
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,800
Jiang Qiaoxi.

86
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,480
Back at the pier,

87
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
you told me

88
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,960
how much you hated yourself

89
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,100
for asking me not to forget you.

90
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,680
Please don't think that way.

91
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,540
All these years,

92
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,100
even without hearing from you,

93
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,460
those words

94
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,020
reminded me you still needed me.

95
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,760
That's why I kept going.

96
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,100
So no, you didn't do anything wrong.

97
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,640
Yingtao,

98
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,760
have you ever heard

99
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,540
the story of Wei Sheng and the bridge?

100
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,020
There once was a man

101
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,660
named Wei Sheng.

102
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,800
He fell in love with a woman.

103
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,040
But her parents were against it.

104
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,600
So, they made a pact

105
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,760
to run away together.

106
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,640
They agreed to meet at dusk

107
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
by the bridge on the outskirts of town.

108
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,800
But when the day came,

109
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,840
he waited, but the lady didn't show up.

110
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,860
Not long after,

111
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,880
a flash flood hit.

112
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,120
Wei Sheng was in danger.

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,340
But he refused to break

114
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,539
the promise between them.

115
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,500
He clung to that bridge pillar

116
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,160
until the woman arrived
and found him drowned.

117
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,460
He never let go.

118
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,000
Well, I'm not Wei Sheng.

119
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,940
If the one doesn't show up,

120
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,960
I'll go find them.

121
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,100
If they run,

122
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,780
I'll go seek.

123
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,000
If I can't catch up,
I'll block their path.

124
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,960
Either way, you're not getting away.

125
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,420
If I see even the tiniest sign
that you still love me,

126
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,200
I'll act on it.

127
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,960
You're not getting away.

128
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,560
Your hair,

129
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,100
your eyebrows…

130
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,040
your eyes,

131
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,820
your nose…

132
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,020
your mouth…

133
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,300
Every part of you

134
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
is mine.

135
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,180
You're awake.

136
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,100
You know

137
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,920
why I wanted to see the sunrise?

138
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,360
Three years ago,

139
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,640
when you all bid your goodbyes
to me in Qunshan,

140
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,040
you said,

141
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,940
"Sunsets are not going away.

142
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,460
They're just

143
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,720
on their way back.

144
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,940
Next time we see them,

145
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,900
they'll be the rosy light of dawn."

146
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,940
Welcome home,

147
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,060
Jiang Qiaoxi.

148
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,480
I'm back.

149
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,420
And I'm not leaving again.

150
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,440
Go on.

151
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,440
Say that again.

152
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,300
I want to record it.

153
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,100
Let the sunrise be our witness.

154
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,440
I'm back.

155
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,080
And I'm not leaving again.

156
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,060
I, Jiang Qiaoxi, swear,

157
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,840
nothing in this world

158
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,980
can keep me

159
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,840
from staying by Lin Yingtao's side.

160
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,900
Not a financial crisis.

161
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,140
Not a volcanic eruption.

162
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,880
Not a tsunami.

163
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,860
Not a heavy suitcase.

164
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,480
Not a water-stained wall.

165
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,580
Not a broken AC unit.

166
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,820
Not overcast skies.

167
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,700
Not pride.

168
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,800
Not shame.

169
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,680
Not ego.

170
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,780
Not fallen leaves.

171
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,940
Not a rusted fence.

172
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,880
Not even

173
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,840
morning dew.

174
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,060
Not moss-covered stone paths.

175
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,160
Not an anthill.

176
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,020
Not even

177
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,980
a plastic bottle

178
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,220
that missed the trash can.

179
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,120
Missed bottles?

180
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,620
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>

181
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,360
Maybe I shouldn't have

182
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,140
brought you to see the sunset.

183
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,960
Sunsets are beautiful,

184
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,840
but they fade too fast.

185
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,580
I should've taken you to see the sunrise.

186
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,880
Though, in that case,

187
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,600
you wouldn't be Jiang Qiaoxi.

188
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,920
You should be at the east of the crest,
as Jiang Qiaodong.

189
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,720
Hey, cousin-in-law.

190
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,060
<i>Vincent, your cousin's missing.</i>

191
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,200
Have you seen my cousin's wife?

192
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,180
Qiaoxi.

193
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,220
- Cousin-in-law.
- You're here.

194
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,400
Your cousin can barely stand.

195
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,360
I'm scared he might do something stupid.

196
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,160
Don't worry. I'll go find him right now.

197
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,740
Come on.

198
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,800
Where do you think he'd go?

199
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,840
Jiang Qiaoxi.

200
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,720
Look.

201
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,500
Cousin!

202
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,820
Cousin!

203
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,480
Is that him?

204
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,540
Jiang Ruocheng!

205
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,380
Cousin!

206
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,260
Jeez.

207
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,320
We just snuck off for ice cream.

208
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,600
No need to send a whole rescue squad.

209
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,920
Not him?

210
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,720
Come on.

211
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,020
Mercy Hospital at Victoria Harbor.

212
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,180
We have a missing patient.

213
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,460
Male, 37 years old.

214
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,180
About five foot ten.

215
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,140
In a hospital gown.

216
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,440
It happened

217
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,640
about an hour ago.

218
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,000
Yes, I'm his family.

219
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,480
Ruocheng is home?

220
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,160
Thanks for your help.

221
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,040
He didn't even have money on him.

222
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,400
Your cousin went home.

223
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,839
Hey, I'm sorry.

224
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,220
I think we found him.

225
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,160
Sorry for the trouble.

226
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,859
Could you ask him
if he knows how worried we were?

227
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,460
You went off on your own,

228
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,520
and now you're back safe.

229
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,680
Jiang Ruocheng!

230
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,500
How'd you even find this place?

231
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,860
I've been in the hospital for so long,

232
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,600
most of that time stuck in bed,

233
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,580
couldn't even get up.

234
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,500
All I could do was lie there,
staring at the ceiling.

235
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,580
Sometimes I'd wonder,

236
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,940
without me around, how did you all

237
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,180
get by these past few years?

238
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,320
What I didn't expect

239
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,800
was that this is how you've been living.

240
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,520
No matter how we've lived,

241
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,780
we still managed.

242
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,000
You call this managing?

243
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,260
If I'd known it'd turn out like this,

244
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,820
that day…

245
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,120
I'd rather you hadn't saved me.
You should've just let me die.

246
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,800
What are you talking about?
Don't say things like that.

247
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,300
You have no idea

248
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,060
how much Yalin's been through
these past two years.

249
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,880
You don't know how she got through it.

250
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,640
You are getting better now,

251
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,280
and you're here talking like this?

252
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,300
Mom, it's because I know
how hard it's been for her.

253
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,000
Look at me. Look at what I've become.

254
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,240
I've lost everything.

255
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,720
The place at Repulse Bay is gone.

256
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,760
The money for Qiaoxi

257
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,860
to study abroad is gone too.

258
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,960
We're broke.

259
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,980
We have nothing left.

260
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,480
And all because

261
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,220
you chose to save me.

262
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,740
Now look where you're living.

263
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,460
It's my fault you ended up like this.

264
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,100
Don't you see that, Mom?

265
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,380
Don't say anything more.

266
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,260
Ruocheng,

267
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,160
you didn't drag me down.

268
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,560
I believed in you.

269
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,380
If the doctors hadn't told me

270
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,280
you might get better,

271
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,820
I wouldn't have made it this far.

272
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,500
You've always had something in you.

273
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,560
This place is not
so different from before.

274
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,600
There's nothing left in me.

275
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,180
What's left for you to believe in?

276
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,100
I've lost everything.

277
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,820
Even holding my own daughter

278
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,060
feels like a memory I can't reach anymore.

279
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,720
Look at my legs.

280
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,020
- I came home, saw my dad like that,
- It's fine…

281
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,520
- and I couldn't even walk over to him.
- We will be fine…

282
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,160
I've lost everything.

283
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,980
Look at what I've become.

284
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,760
- I'm just a wreck now.
- Jiang Ruocheng!

285
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,880
I waited all this time,

286
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,300
took care of you for so long.

287
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,360
When you are finally getting better,

288
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,440
I don't what to hear
something this cruel now.

289
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,580
If that's all you've got,

290
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,600
then maybe I'd rather
you stayed in the hospital.

291
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,860
At least there was still hope.

292
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,340
Right now,

293
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,800
there's none.

294
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,560
So, stop doing this to me.

295
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,880
I'm so sorry.

296
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,300
I'm so sorry, honey.

297
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,560
I didn't know…

298
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,500
Come on. Let's go.

299
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,940
I'm a bad husband.

300
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,600
I didn't know…

301
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,560
It'll be alright.

302
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,320
Excuse me.

303
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,200
Are you ready to order?

304
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,660
Two beers, please.

305
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,900
Coming right up.

306
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,380
I don't usually like you drinking.

307
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,780
But I think today,

308
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,240
we deserve a drink.

309
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
Here you go. Two beers.

310
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,860
Thanks.

311
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,740
Thanks.

312
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,980
Enjoy.

313
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,260
That was my first time
meeting your cousin.

314
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,720
Honestly? He was pretty much the same

315
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,600
as how I pictured him.

316
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,680
Carried himself with class.

317
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,800
Good-looking too.

318
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,120
If you look half that good

319
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,900
when you're his age, I'll be happy.

320
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,740
You didn't see him before.

321
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,260
Back then,

322
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,780
just one look in his eyes

323
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,580
and you'd think

324
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,800
there's nothing in the world
he couldn't do.

325
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,360
He could kill it in business,

326
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,540
take great care of his family,

327
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,400
and still

328
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,200
find time to pave the way

329
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,980
for a clueless little cousin like me.

330
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,800
I know you've always looked up to him.

331
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,960
You puked on that jacket
he gave you as a kid

332
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,420
and still kept it.

333
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,100
I wanted to be like him.

334
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,340
Responsible.

335
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,560
Reliable.

336
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,440
Smart.

337
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,200
But even someone like that,

338
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,760
someone who never put a foot wrong…

339
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,660
lost everything

340
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,600
in just one day.

341
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,940
Are you afraid?

342
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,860
Afraid that…

343
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,200
the same thing could happen to you?

344
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,260
No.

345
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,400
When my mom had the accident,

346
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,940
lying on the ward bed,

347
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,760
she told me,

348
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,700
"Jiang Qiaoxi,

349
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,980
you don't know how the world works."

350
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,820
I didn't believe her then.

351
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,280
But six months later,

352
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,780
my cousin had his accident.

353
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,820
That's when I realized…

354
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
she was right.

355
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,900
People don't get to choose.

356
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,840
The only real choice…

357
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,820
is whether the world

358
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,980
decides to be on your side.

359
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,900
Jiang Qiaoxi,

360
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,020
don't get stuck in the nihilism crisis.

361
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,600
Come on. People make choices.

362
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,260
We make choices every day.

363
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,220
Look.

364
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,620
Today we chose congee,

365
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,920
so we didn't get

366
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,340
claypot rice.

367
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,700
We picked beer,

368
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,280
so we missed out on lemon tea.

369
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,240
I…

370
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,220
Oh no, I'm so sorry!

371
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,460
I'm so sorry!

372
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,100
Let me bring you a fresh one.

373
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:48,980
It's fine.

374
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,860
I'm sorry.

375
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,700
Don't worry about it.

376
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:54,980
Here, use this napkin.

377
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,200
Drink mine if you want.

378
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,580
I've got one.

379
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,580
I've got one.

380
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,420
I should've come to check in sooner.

381
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,700
But the market was rough,

382
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,440
and it took me a while to bounce back.

383
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,740
Before I knew it,

384
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,020
this was the only time I had.

385
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,080
No worries.

386
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,900
If you'd come earlier,

387
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,000
you'd have caught me lying here
pretending to be Sleeping Beauty.

388
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,740
- Cousin. Cousin-in-law.
- Qiaoxi.

389
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
- Cousin-in-law.
- Yingtao.

390
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,840
These flowers are for you.

391
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,440
Hi, cousin.

392
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,320
You didn't have to.

393
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,420
- Hey.
- Hi there.

394
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,860
Let me…

395
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,420
You must be Yingtao, right?

396
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
That's me.

397
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,280
Hard to believe

398
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,540
it is the first time we meet.

399
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,720
Feels like I've known you forever.

400
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,460
This kid's been talking about you

401
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,880
since he was little.

402
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,020
And Jiang Qiaoxi's always
going on about his cousin.

403
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,540
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.

404
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,140
Yes.

405
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,960
I, um… I brought some snacks for you.

406
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,720
Nothing expensive or fancy.

407
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,700
Just figured hospital food

408
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,880
probably doesn't have much flavor,

409
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,240
so I got a bit of everything.

410
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,920
You're so sweet. That's really thoughtful.

411
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,460
No wonder

412
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,540
Qiaoxi always says nice things about you.

413
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,120
Qiaoxi,

414
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,300
Yingtao lives up to her name.
Sweet as a cherry.

415
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,940
So, this is the little genius

416
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,200
from your family?

417
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,180
Didn't think he'd be this tall.
Or this good-looking.

418
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,820
The Jiangs are just built like that.

419
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,280
Good genes. Can't help it.

420
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,620
My cousin here

421
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,940
now studies
at the University of Hong Kong.

422
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,220
Double major, finance and math.

423
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,420
Top marks across the board.

424
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,700
Hey, isn't that

425
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,940
what you studied too?

426
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,320
If he gets

427
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,460
into the financial sector,

428
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,580
he's bound to make waves.

429
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,460
Big things ahead.

430
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,520
He'll surpass me, no doubt.

431
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,840
I've never worried

432
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,900
about this one.

433
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,320
Hey, cousin,

434
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,160
once you find a good stock,

435
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,560
you better tip me off.

436
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,120
If I can cash out again,

437
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,180
my kids'll be set for life.

438
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,960
- Sure.
- Hey,

439
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,420
- remember that EV stock
- Let me.

440
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,180
you told me to buy?

441
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,980
You kept saying it had serious potential.

442
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,920
So, I convinced my wife

443
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,100
to put all our savings into it.

444
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,020
Two years later, it shot up 14 times.

445
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,540
That's great.

446
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,400
Smart move.

447
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,540
Too bad

448
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,000
he's just lying in bed now.

449
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,560
Totally useless.

450
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,460
Remember

451
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,540
when we worked at that printing factory?

452
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,940
He chewed us out all night

453
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,400
over one typo.

454
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,820
He's not so high and mighty now.

455
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,560
When he heard I was headed to Singapore,

456
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,960
he looked at me

457
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,680
like some sad stray dog.

458
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,120
His wife though?

459
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,340
Still a knockout.

460
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,900
Jiang Qiaoxi.

461
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,720
So pretty, it's ridiculous.

462
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,240
- Jiang Qiaoxi.
- What did you say?

463
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,660
- Let go!
- Don't hit him, Jiang Qiaoxi!

464
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,940
- Let go.
- Get over here.

465
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,840
- Jiang Qiaoxi, calm down!
- Are you crazy?

466
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,100
Qiaoxi!

467
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,500
- Jiang Qiaoxi!
- Qiaoxi!

468
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,680
Let go!

469
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,760
Hey, no violence.

470
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,080
Ruocheng was nice to you.

471
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,800
Have you even visited him once?

472
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,140
How many times did he help you out?

473
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,320
- Hey.
- Don't ever show your face again!

474
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,460
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

475
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,360
<i>What's going on?</i>

476
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,300
Asshole!

477
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,940
Hey.

478
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,260
Are you okay?

479
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,660
I'm fine.

480
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,420
Are you?

481
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,120
Yeah, I'm okay.

482
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,000
No violence.

483
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,780
Let's go.

484
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,520
I didn't freak you out, did I?

485
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,820
Of course not.

486
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,420
I've always known

487
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,500
what you're like.

488
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,720
What did surprise me

489
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,120
was how your cousin-in-law reacted.

490
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,420
She was like a swordswoman out of…

491
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,460
a wuxia novel.

492
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,740
Yingtao,

493
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,480
do you think

494
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,060
I've changed

495
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,960
after I came to Hong Kong?

496
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,480
Yeah, you have.

497
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,020
What do I do, Yingtao?

498
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,060
Feels like the cracks and bruises on me…

499
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,140
just keep piling up.

500
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,460
Like you didn't have

501
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,520
plenty of cracks and bruises before.

502
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,980
The difference now

503
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,340
is you don't fake it around me anymore.

504
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,380
You don't try to hide it like you used to.

505
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,000
Now,

506
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,860
in front of me,

507
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,840
you are able to close your eyes

508
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,700
and let me know. That's different.

509
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,820
And you don't just charge ahead doing

510
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,160
what you think is good for us

511
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,720
without asking us first.

512
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,980
Back then, you…

513
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,280
Forget it.

514
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,920
All I know

515
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,560
is I like who you are now.

516
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,700
Hi, cousin-in-law.

517
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,960
Okay.

518
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,120
What's up? Are we going upstairs?

519
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,480
No. She said

520
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,900
she's taking us out.

521
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,340
Out?

522
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,400
- Welcome.
- Hi. We booked a private room.

523
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,280
This way, please.

524
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,240
Mind your step.

525
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,160
Don't worry.

526
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,360
Your cousin's got a VIP card here.

527
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,300
There's money on it.

528
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,420
Let's get the three-way
Australian lobster,

529
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,860
steamed crab,

530
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,560
- and premium abalone.
- Got it.

531
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,100
Star grouper.

532
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,340
Asparagus with morels.

533
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,860
And for dessert…

534
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,040
Little Lin, would you like
the bird's nest soup

535
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,200
or the black truffle chocolate cake?

536
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,320
They do both Chinese and Western
desserts really well here.

537
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,300
Honestly, I'm good with either.

538
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,660
- Then we'll have both.
- No problem.

539
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,840
- Thanks. That's it for now.
- Got it.

540
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,760
Can I get a takeaway box too, please?

541
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,360
Little Lin.

542
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,560
I've been so tied up with Ruocheng lately.

543
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,840
I haven't had a proper meal with you.

544
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,320
Sorry about that.

545
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,340
No, it's fine.

546
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,980
Then, let this dinner

547
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,000
be your welcome dinner.

548
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,820
Ruocheng should've joined us,

549
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,540
but since he snuck out before,

550
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,100
the doctors
won't let him leave the hospital.

551
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,980
Sorry about that.

552
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,520
Please, don't be sorry.

553
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,600
If anything, I should
be thanking you and cousin.

554
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,980
Oh, I forgot the wine.

555
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,300
You don't drink much, do you?

556
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,500
Not really.

557
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,580
Maybe a little beer at school parties

558
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,420
or at home.

559
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,240
What about red wine?

560
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,920
Any favorites?

561
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,480
Not much of a wine drinker.

562
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,320
- Fair enough.
- Hey, cousin-in-law.

563
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,800
Fancy wine.

564
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,760
Fancy restaurant.

565
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,760
They can wait.

566
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,620
Qiaoxi,

567
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,200
at the toughest times, like now,

568
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,100
we should drink the best wine,

569
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,220
dine at the best places, right?

570
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,920
Isn't that exactly

571
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,800
when we have to hold
our heads high and live

572
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,600
the decent life to keep
believing in ourselves?

573
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,580
Let's go with what she says.

574
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,300
Let's drink the good wine.

575
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,100
Yes, let's do it.

576
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,200
When I was your age,

577
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,740
I used to read novels all the time.

578
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:09,500
There was this one,

579
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,100
<i>Wounded City</i> by Yishu.

580
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,080
Back then,

581
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,560
I could never

582
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,840
quite understand the ending.

583
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,380
But today,

584
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,320
I think I finally do.

585
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,880
I read that one.

586
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,380
I know the story.

587
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,360
What was the story?

588
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,280
There is a man

589
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:53,840
who gets shot in the waist with an arrow.

590
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,159
And…

591
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,320
he just lives with it, never pulls it out.

592
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,400
People ask if it hurts.

593
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,720
He says

594
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,260
it hurts only when he remembers

595
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,680
he has an arrow in the waist.

596
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,720
I brought you both out tonight.

597
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,880
It was meant to lift your spirits.

598
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,000
To remind you

599
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,300
of the good days we once had together.

600
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,320
But sitting here now,

601
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,060
those memories feel more

602
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,720
like that arrow.

603
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,300
Since your cousin's accident,

604
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,720
I've never thought of it as hard.

605
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,200
But Qiaoxi,

606
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,820
you're the one who's sacrificed the most.

607
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,480
You gave up your studies overseas.

608
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,820
Now you're juggling for his medical bills,

609
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,060
with three jobs on your shoulders.

610
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,020
You worked so hard.

611
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,580
Cousin-in-law…

612
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,620
He's my cousin.

613
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,860
Even if you'd told me to leave,

614
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,940
I wouldn't have gone.

615
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,380
If it weren't for everything
with the family,

616
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,900
you and Yingtao wouldn't have spent
so many years apart.

617
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,520
Seeing the two of you now,

618
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,740
my heart aches for what you've lost.

619
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,100
No, cousin-in-law.

620
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,260
Please don't feel that way.

621
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,760
When I met Jiang Qiaoxi,

622
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,700
I knew from the start his cousin

623
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,980
meant everything to him.

624
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,880
If he hadn't stayed,

625
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,720
he wouldn't be the same
Jiang Qiaoxi I know.

626
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,340
I'm sorry.

627
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,840
Here.

628
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,280
Thank you. Both of you.

629
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,760
Jiang Ruocheng.

630
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,880
Ruo, as in something fleeting.

631
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,940
Cheng, as in honesty.

632
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,440
Sorry, sir.

633
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,120
Our restaurant changed hands recently,

634
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,500
and the system's been glitchy.

635
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,920
We won't be able to check your balance

636
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,860
until tomorrow.

637
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,260
We're sorry.

638
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,760
Tomorrow, right?

639
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,020
Yes. We're sorry.

640
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,620
Alright then.

641
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,560
I'll pay in cash.

642
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,940
That'll be 4,512.

643
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,460
Can I use UnionPay?

644
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,960
- UnionPay.
- No, no. I've got my card.

645
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,260
I've got money.

646
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,000
And I've been meaning
to treat her to dinner.

647
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,080
Hands off.

648
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,820
- Thank you.
- Tell…

649
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,140
All settled?

650
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,320
Yep, done.

651
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,760
Thanks for the meal, cousin-in-law.

652
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,360
Food was great, wine was perfect.

653
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,940
I'm totally stuffed.

654
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,520
Why don't we take a walk?

655
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,820
Let me get that.

656
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,200
Hope to see you again.

657
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,220
Thank you.

658
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,460
Hope to see you again.

659
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,480
Qiaoxi,

660
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,260
Yingtao, wait here.
I'm just gonna grab something.

661
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,480
I won't be long.

662
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,720
- Going by yourself?
- Hey…

663
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,820
Mark Six.

664
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,400
Tonight's the draw.

665
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,940
One ticket each.

666
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,640
What made you think

667
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,940
of buying lottery tickets?

668
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,520
Over the past two years,

669
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,080
whenever life felt too hard,

670
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,120
I'd buy one.

671
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,460
It gave me something

672
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,460
to hope for.

673
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,060
Yingtao,

674
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,560
you treated us tonight,

675
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,000
so this is the best

676
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,200
I can do in return. A little luck.

677
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,600
Go ahead. Pick one.

678
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,720
- I get to choose first?
- Yes.

679
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,800
Well…

680
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,540
Then I'll just grab one.

681
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,300
This one.

682
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,200
Wouldn't it be nice

683
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,820
if it actually hit the jackpot?

684
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,280
You have a better shot
at getting hit by lightning

685
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,820
than winning the Mark Six.

686
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,900
Why would you say that?

687
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,260
Way to kill the mood.

688
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,780
Don't rain on our parade, alright?

689
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,320
I think she's right.

690
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,420
It's not just a ticket.

691
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,960
It's hope.

692
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,240
Cousin-in-law, that reminds me.

693
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,040
Jiang Qiaoxi told me the other day

694
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,300
he thinks

695
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,680
people don't get to choose.

696
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,640
The real choice

697
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,300
depends on whether the world

698
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,240
is on your side.

699
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,660
Maybe

700
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,380
there's some truth to that.

701
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,580
But I think

702
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,780
even if the world isn't on our side,

703
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,920
we can still choose.

704
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,640
We can choose to hope.

705
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,500
And that's something

706
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,340
nobody can take from you.

707
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,180
Thank you, cousin-in-law,

708
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,360
for giving me hope.

709
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,920
Thank you, Yingtao.

710
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,880
It's been a long time

711
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,200
since I've heard something like that.

712
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,720
Cousin-in-law,

713
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,020
don't worry.

714
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,360
"Whatever pain you're feeling right now,

715
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:18,880
it'll pass.

716
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,220
Even the bad things can turn

717
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,640
into something good, eventually."

718
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,960
That's what my dad told me.

719
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,280
And cousin's already

720
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,580
getting better.

721
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,920
Things are only gonna go up from here.

722
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,820
Thank you, Yingtao.

723
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,220
It still blows my mind.

724
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,940
That just one little Mark Six ticket

725
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,580
can carry so much hope.

726
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,100
But if we don't win,

727
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,820
isn't it just a useless piece of paper?

728
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,040
But before 9:30 p.m.,

729
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,400
it's a proof that something good
might happen.

730
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,120
But what if we don't win after 9:30 p.m.?

731
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,080
Isn't that even more disappointing?

732
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,960
Then…

733
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,080
Then we buy another one.

734
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,480
Wait for the next draw.

735
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,680
Keep the hope going for another day.

736
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,800
Don't tell me you're not
even a little curious

737
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,680
if yours might actually win.

738
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,400
Not even the tiniest bit?

739
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,920
Mark Six odds are like

740
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,240
one in ten million.

741
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,640
But the odds of meeting Lin Yingtao?

742
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,920
That's one in a trillion.

743
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,420
So yeah, I already hit the jackpot.

744
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,340
Jiang Qiaoxi.

745
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,380
Since when did you get

746
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,980
this cheesy?

747
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,860
Say that again.

748
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,100
- Good lines only come once.
- Now.

749
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,940
- Nope.
- What time is it now?

750
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,060
- 9:45 p.m.
- Time to check the results.

751
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,040
Let me see. I'll go first.

752
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,600
Here.

753
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,140
You hold it. I'll read it.

754
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,420
Zero-one,

755
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,780
29,

756
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,120
zero-six,

757
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,660
22…

758
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,940
Hold on.

759
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,860
Zero-one, 29, 22.

760
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,160
- Zero-six.
- Zero-six.

761
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,980
Forty-four, 45.

762
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,960
- Forty-five.
- Twenty-seven.

763
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,900
- Thirty-six.
- Twenty-seven. And the last one…

764
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:15,940
Thirty-six?

765
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,120
Two misses.

766
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,760
Five hits.

767
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,040
Only two misses. That's painful.

768
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,800
Five should still be worth
something, right?

769
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,220
No idea.

770
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,500
As long as there's money, we're good.

771
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,920
How many times are you gonna count?

772
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,640
- Stop it.
- Two, three…

773
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,180
Five main numbers matched.

774
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,660
That's fourth prize.
9,600 Hong Kong dollars.

775
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,900
That's official.

776
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,720
See? I told you.

777
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,560
Even the universe feels sorry for me.

778
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,120
You just didn't believe it.

779
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,740
The universe might feel bad for you,

780
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,560
but if you don't put it away,

781
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,760
even the universe

782
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,200
won't stop you from getting mugged.

783
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,120
Jiang Qiaoxi.

784
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,340
My mom always said,

785
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,420
money like this

786
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,500
from gambling or winning the lottery

787
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,880
isn't earned the right way.

788
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,460
Spend it fast or it brings bad luck.

789
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,060
Let's blow it all here in Hong Kong.

790
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,940
Sure. What are you thinking of buying?

791
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,500
Actually, there is something.

792
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,740
Ray-Ban sunglasses.

793
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,040
For… Yu Qiao?

794
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,500
Who else do you think?

795
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,720
Come on. Let's go. Show me.

796
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,620
