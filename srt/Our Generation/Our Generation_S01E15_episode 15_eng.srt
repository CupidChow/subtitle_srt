1
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:38,944
 

2
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:44,159
 A hundred days of intense hard work 

3
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,459
 achieves high scores to reward our prime years. 

4
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:50,752
 Feels like my coming to Experimental High School
just happens yesterday. 

5
00:01:50,752 --> 00:01:51,879
 

6
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:55,920
 But now the college entrance exams
are pushing us to graduate. 

7
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,232
 Jiang Qiao Xi has started
preparing for her overseas exams 

8
00:02:03,232 --> 00:02:06,159
 before returning to school again. 

9
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,599
 Later I even suspected 

10
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:13,060
 that the materials his cousin mailed
under the guise of Olympiad preparation 

11
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,099
 were probably already covering overseas exams. 

12
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,860
 Because Jiang Qiao Xi didn't
receive much extra tutoring, 

13
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,279
 and his exam entry happened too quickly. 

14
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,500
 No matter what I asked him, 

15
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,979
 whether it's normal or strange, 

16
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:32,300
 school-related or comic-related, 

17
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,459
 he answered me quickly. 

18
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:38,784
I understand now.

19
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:47,319
 Even when Qin Ye Yun asked about
new film updates from Chen Jin Hong, 

20
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,139
 he would go collect information. 

21
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:52,319
 
 He could've just taken photos and emailed them, 

22
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,039
 yet he'd buy magazines. 

23
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:59,260
 Everything went smoothly for him. 

24
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,960
Nothing Jiang Qiao Xi does would surprise me.

25
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,219
In Qun Shan, he was always sticking with us.

26
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:21,199
At Experimental High School,
he pretended not to know us.

27
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,679
Later he started sticking with us again.

28
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,860
Now he's not replying to Du Shang's messages.

29
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,199
Listen, Lin Qi Le,
Jiang Qiao Xi is a very ambitious person.

30
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,339
He always does whatever he wants.

31
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,759
There's nothing you can do about him.

32
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,740
 So, Jiang Qiao Xi stopped
replying to almost everyone. 

33
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,679
 To be honest, I didn't take it too seriously. 

34
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,840
 Mom's explanation was much more comforting. 

35
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,580
Mr. Cai told us,

36
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,080
Qiao Xi's overseas exams are extremely difficult.

37
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,520
Many cover university-level courses,

38
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,759
subjects like architecture and psychology.

39
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:07,419
I bet he must be so occupied

40
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,499
and have no time to chat with others.

41
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,408
Makes sense.

42
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:15,800
Cherry.

43
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,360
 Later I learned Jiang Qiao Xi
was indeed occupied at that time, 

44
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,379
 but not from exam difficulties like we thought. 

45
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:31,480
 It was a different kind of stress
what adults would face. 

46
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,839
See? It has dropped for few days.

47
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,008
It's already like this.

48
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,879
Ms. Liang told me to sell the stocks.
Something must have happened.

49
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,759
I don't understand. How much is the loss?

50
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,100
Well,

51
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,879
about an Audi car worth per day.

52
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,720
That much?

53
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:55,459
Why is she urgently needing money?

54
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:57,000
No idea. Just said it's for emergency.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,660
No matter how much it lost, sell it.
She just needs cash.

56
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,439
Is Jiang Qiao Xi in trouble?

57
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,860
I'm back.

58
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,920
Welcome back.

59
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,819
What's wrong?

60
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:09,720
- You're back.
- Mr. Cai.

61
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,120
There's a moth in my room again?

62
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,319
No way.

63
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,639
He chatted with me,
reminiscing about the past again.

64
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,379
- He wanted to find a childhood photo of you and Cai Fang Yuan.
- Yes, right.

65
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:20,540
What photo?

66
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,019
- This one.
- This?

67
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:23,279
You found it.

68
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,560
I was so tanned when I was a kid.

69
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,568
Not at all. Look how fair-skinned you were.

70
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:27,199
You were this tall back then.
I could pick you up with one arm.

71
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,899
Then I'll send it to you.

72
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,759
- No need. Well...
- Just wanted to take a look.

73
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,459
Make some tea for Mr. Cai.

74
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:36,040
- I forgot earlier.
- Okay.

75
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:39,259
By the way, we have rose tea, chrysanthemum tea,

76
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:40,699
and plum wine.

77
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,300
Chrysanthemum tea.
Why drink wine in broad daylight?

78
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,352
Chrysanthemum tea then.

79
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:57,160
Tell me, did something happen to Jiang Qiao Xi?

80
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,660
Let me tell you,
I'm sure it's not about Jiang Qiao Xi.

81
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,600
If it were Qiao Xi, Ms. Liang wouldn't be so calm.

82
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,220
Right?

83
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,279
Mr. Cai, Cai Fang Yuan
has been studying very hard lately.

84
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,680
He's been working hard at school.

85
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,339
So if he slacks off a bit at home,
please don't be mad at him.

86
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:18,019
When he encounters difficult problems,
Jiang Qiao Xi always explains them to him.

87
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:20,420
So rest assured.

88
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,272
Okay.

89
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,768
 I think Jiang Qiao Xi has become such a chatterbox
since moving to Hong Kong. 

90
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:32,600
 When he's sick with a cold and a headache,
he still keeps talking to me. 

91
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,304
 I always wish he'd talk les and rest more. 

92
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:43,860
 Although Jiang Qiao Xi
usually doesn't bother with others, 

93
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,579
 I somehow always get
the most conversation from him. 

94
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:54,340
 So I never imagined
what if he didn't talk to me anymore. 

95
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:02,520
 Someone wrote that he wants
to become provincial richest. Oh my! 

96
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,579
 You'll definitely achieve your ambitions. 

97
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,240
Alright, get off now.

98
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,879
Don't forget your ID cards
and exam admission tickets.

99
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,879
 Jiang Qiao Xi, you promised to tell me
your exam results after my exams yesterday. 

100
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,279
 Why haven't you told me yet? 

101
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,560
 Jiang Qiao Xi, why haven't you replied? 

102
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,579
 Did you go grocery shopping? 

103
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,300
 It's a pity that you're not on this bus. 

104
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,139
 We're planning to take the bus
to Zhou Zhou Eatery. 

105
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,860
 There are too many people,
and even Mr. Cai's car can't fit everyone. 

106
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,579
 I'll definitely order
your favorite garlic spare ribs. 

107
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,100
 It's over! Finally! Jiang Qiao Xi. 

108
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,320
 Guess how I did. 

109
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,659
 Jiang Qiao Xi, what about you? 

110
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:39,980
 Was your high school life over
on the day you left Hong Yang 

111
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,259
 and moved to Hong Kong? 

112
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:45,399
 After one more exam this afternoon,
my entire high school life will be over. 

113
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,360
 My mom keeps forcing me to eat fish porridge,
but I just can't finish it all. 

114
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,139
 My mom said snakehead fish
boosts energy and is very nutritious. 

115
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:53,399
 I must eat it for exams. 

116
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,360
 Jiang Qiao Xi, our exams will be over tomorrow. 

117
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,960
 When are you coming back? 

118
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,659
 Yu Qiao and Cai Fang Yuan want
to have fun during summer break. 

119
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:04,120
 Will you come back and hang out with us? 

120
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,220

121
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,860

 Congratulations on finishing your exams. 

129
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,720
Go start your college journey well.

130
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,179
Your life is boundless.

131
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,240
Jiang Qiao Xi replied to me.
Jiang Qiao Xi replied!

132
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,660
Look, Jiang Qiao Xi replied to me.

133
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,379
Alright, I'll call him.

134
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:06,500
I'll tell him we're having fun here,

135
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,744
and he has nothing in Hong Kong.

136
00:10:07,744 --> 00:10:08,759
No rush.

137
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,120
You all sit down and eat. Eat.

138
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,340
Finish eating first, okay?

139
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,400
The food's getting cold, Cherry.
It's getting cold.

140
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,460
 The number you dialed is currently unavailable. 

141
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,660
 Please try again later. 

142
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,259
It's fine. Have some first.

143
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:41,024
Eat more. Eat more.

144
00:10:41,024 --> 00:10:43,040
- Eat this first. Come on.
- Okay.

145
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,376
Cheers.

146
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,048
Jiang...

147
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,860
Should we serve your sweet soup now?

148
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,000
A fruit plate for free to you.

149
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,479
Sweet rice wine dumplings.
They help cut the greasiness.

150
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,420
Go on serving dishes. Go ahead.

151
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,040
- What is she getting?
- Steamed buns.

152
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,760
Cherry, didn't you eat enough?

153
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,560
Not eat enough?

154
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:52,139
I'm going out.

155
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:53,984
What's wrong?

156
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,779
Cherry, why are you squatting here so late?

157
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,659
Come on, go home with me.

158
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:46,399
No need, Grandma Jia.

159
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,220
I'm waiting for Ms. Liang and Mr. Jiang.

160
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,759
Jiang? They have moved away.
They don't live here anymore.

161
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,679
What? What do you mean?

162
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,059
It seems Liang went abroad for work.

163
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:02,220
She said she needed to earn more money
for their expenses.

164
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,620
Then Jiang moved out too.
They're not living here anymore.

165
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,820
They are not living here anymore? What?

166
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,639
If Jiang Qiao Xi comes back, he won't have a home.

167
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,940
This house hasn't been sold yet.

168
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,359
Qiao Xi will come back.

169
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,100
 I'm planning to pack my stuff
at the White Building tomorrow. 

170
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,979
 Want to come? 

171
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,144
 No. 

172
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:23,580
 

173
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:28,200
 Okay, see you at nine tomorrow. 

174
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,220
When I saw you in the cheer team uniform,

175
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,220
walking across the field,
I was completely stunned.

176
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,639
I never expected our school
to have such a proper cheer team.

177
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,099
You weren't yourself,
yet you seemed like a new version of you.

178
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,720
New version of me?
Because of what I wore that day?

179
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,640
No.

180
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,340
Back when we were at Qun Shan Middle School,

181
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,879
you hardly spoke for three whole years,

182
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,419
nor participated in class activities.

183
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:03,320
And you left immediately after school every day.

184
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,959
I thought you were introverted,

185
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,140
always silent and indifferent, like Lu Xue Qi.

186
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:16,079
Have you been writing too many novels
and seeing characters everywhere?

187
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,639
Then I realized I was wrong.

188
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,820
That wasn't the real you.

189
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,720
The you at Experimental High School was different,

190
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,319
or maybe the Qun Shan Middle School version
was the new you.

191
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,632
 

192
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,439
Looks no different from regular classrooms.

193
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:50,340
Whether it's me, Jiang Qiao Xi,

194
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,799
or everyone in this class,

195
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,579
we're all just ordinary carbon-based lifeforms.

196
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,768
This was my seat.

197
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:07,240
I thought you've packed already.

198
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:10,976
Right.

199
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:12,352
 ♫ Gently ♫ 

200
00:16:12,352 --> 00:16:15,040
 ♫ Brushes against the cheek ♫ 

201
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,184
 ♫ She timidly ♫ 

202
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:20,096
Lin Qi Le.

203
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:21,820
What?

204
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,640
What do you think of me?

205
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,820
What do you mean?

206
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,340
We've finished the college entrance exams,

207
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,740
and are basically college students now.

208
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,940
During those countdown days before exams,

209
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,779
I had another countdown in my heart.

210
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:42,039
I've been waiting to confess
my affection to you at this moment,

211
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:45,459
wanting to build up
a closer relationship with you.

212
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,320
What do you think?

213
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,840
 ♫ Shaking head and saying goodbye ♫ 

214
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,880
 ♫ Aye aye oh ♫ 

215
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,792
 ♫ Aye oh ♫ 

216
00:16:57,792 --> 00:16:59,616
 ♫ A little straw hat ♫ 

217
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:04,352
 ♫ Hitting the road with me ♫ 

218
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,339
Class Monitor, I'm sorry.

219
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:18,539
Lin Qi Le, don't be sorry.

220
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,660
I'm the one who should be sorry.

221
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,640
I knew your answer already,
yet still asked you this question.

222
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,656
Sorry for causing you distress.

223
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:33,619
But you didn't come here today
just to help me pack, right?

224
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,720
You knew it?

225
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,400
I knew it.

226
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,099
You came to see Jiang Qiao Xi's seat
in this classroom, didn't you?

227
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:43,456
 ♫ You held my hand ♫ 

228
00:17:43,456 --> 00:17:47,328
 ♫ Running towards the mountain top ♫ 

229
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:49,220
Jiang Qiao Xi's seat was right there.

230
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,808
 ♫ All the worries ♫ 

231
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:53,920
 ♫ You are in my eyes ♫ 

232
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,456
 ♫ I look at you ♫ 

233
00:17:55,456 --> 00:17:56,992
 ♫ Without noticing ♫ 

234
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,912
 ♫ It's all you ♫ 

235
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,032
 ♫ At this moment ♫ 

236
00:18:00,032 --> 00:18:02,528
 ♫ I finally understand ♫ 

237
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:10,099
I always thought he'd come back
for his stuff after May.

238
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,119
Take them back for him.

239
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,104
 ♫ Maybe there'll be regrets ♫ 

240
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:22,048
 ♫ Aye aye oh ♫ 

241
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:24,960
 ♫ Aye oh ♫ 

242
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,136
 ♫ Sunflowers can't wait to meet ♫ 

243
00:18:27,136 --> 00:18:30,752
 ♫ They've been budding for days ♫ 

244
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:33,792
 ♫ Aye aye oh ♫ 

245
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:37,024
 ♫ Aye oh ♫ 

246
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:39,264
 ♫ Sunflowers follow the sun ♫ 

247
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:41,220
 ♫ Fall together ♫ 

248
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,920
I understand. Jiang Qiao Xi

249
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,819
is a natural genius, born lucky.

250
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,879
 
How could I compete with him? What could I win?

251
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,240
He's not born lucky.

252
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:02,460
He has worked extremely hard to make it to today.

253
00:19:12,004 --> 00:19:15,259
 

254
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:17,519
Is it heavy? Need my help?

255
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,279
No need, I can do it.

256
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,319
Cherry, don't worry. He'll definitely come back.

257
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,539
A junior named Qi Le once told me.

258
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:29,079
Those competing in Olympiads
get exhausted from consecutive exams.

259
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:32,019
Some wander around until midnight after exams,

260
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:33,480
while some don't even bother returning.

261
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,980
They go travel to relax.

262
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,800
But Jiang Qiao Xi won't.

263
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,119
He'd always call you without fail, rain or shine.

264
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:43,839
After every exam, every session, he'd call you,

265
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:45,500
and never bother hiding it from anyone.

266
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,579
How to describe it?

267
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:51,220
He's being arrogant and unrestrained.

268
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,760
So don't worry. He has to return to school.

269
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,339
And I guarantee, when he returns,
you'll be the first person he looks for.

270
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:20,516
 ♫ You lock up your heart ♫ 

271
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:24,448
 ♫ The key is in the clouds ♫ 

272
00:20:25,412 --> 00:20:27,264
 ♫ Passing through dreams ♫ 

273
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:31,264
 ♫ Leaving no trace ♫ 

274
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,560
 ♫ Little us ♫ 

275
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,988
 ♫ Can't fly beyond fingertips ♫ 

276
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,968
 ♫ But I want to ♫ 

277
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:43,684
 ♫ Forget the glimmer as starlight ♫ 

278
00:20:43,684 --> 00:20:45,856
 ♫ For you ♫ 

279
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,192
 ♫ In the gentle night ♫ 

280
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:49,984
 ♫ You pretend to walk away ♫ 

281
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:51,744
 ♫ Palms not yet warm ♫ 

282
00:20:51,744 --> 00:20:54,304
 ♫ Breath left behind ♫ 

283
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:57,472
 ♫ We advance and retreat like tides ♫ 

284
00:20:57,472 --> 00:20:59,904
 ♫ Loop till the end ♫ 

285
00:20:59,904 --> 00:21:02,560
 ♫ Go with you ♫ 

286
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,144
 ♫ You are the reason I stop burning ♫ 

287
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:08,736
 ♫ Memory ♫ 

288
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:12,288
 ♫ Breaking into the unknown forbidden zone ♫ 

289
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:16,288
 ♫ Turn around and fall into your unsaid love ♫ 

290
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:20,160
 ♫ You are the reason I can shine ♫ 

291
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,464
 ♫ Yearning ♫ 

292
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,339
 I promise you and Chun Lu 

293
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,339
 that I'll come home soon. 

294
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,232
Jiang Qiao Xi.

295
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:28,220
Are you here to steal from your own home?

296
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Cherry, what are you talking about?

297
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:44,159
Why sneak around like a thief here?

298
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,419
Are you running away from home again?

299
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,259
What do you think, Cherry?

300
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,136
I think...

301
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:18,740
I think you are here for me.

302
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,180
Yes. I'm not going abroad anymore.

303
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:43,440
I want to stay here with you.

304
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,639
You're not going abroad?

305
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,660
I knew you wouldn't cut contact without reason.

306
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,900
And you wouldn't disappear without reason.

307
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,480
Your phone line must've been cut.

308
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,659
And my letters must've been torn up again, right?

309
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:09,020
Jiang Qiao Xi,
you wouldn't leave me voluntarily, right?

310
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,032
Of course not.

311
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,480
I'm doing well in Hong Kong.

312
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,879
My cousin is nice too. He even has a daughter now.

313
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,980
My studies in Hong Kong are going smoothly.

314
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,900
You know I can always score high marks.

315
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,379
I can get into any college I want,

316
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,380
but I don't want to choose any of them.

317
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:48,020
Because none of those places have you,

318
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,319
nor your mom's date steamed buns.

319
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,672
I want...

320
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:01,696
I want to stay.

321
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,579
It's good you're not going abroad.

322
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:11,640
It's good having you by my side.

323
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,579
I always take you to the best places.

324
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:20,299
Did you read my messages?

325
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:22,899
Do you know how well I did
on the college entrance exams?

326
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,559
I know. Northern Normal University.

327
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,140
I never expected you to score so high.

328
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,140
With your Olympiad achievements,

329
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,740
you could get into any university in Hong Yang.

330
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:44,700
Do you know the top schools
are all close to Northern Normal?

331
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,008
I know.

332
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:53,680
I'll choose one closest to yours.

333
00:25:54,579 --> 00:26:01,579
Then we can go to school together,
eat at the cafeteria together,

334
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,839
and stick together every single day.

335
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:15,519
Seriously?

336
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,859
Can we really stick together every day?

337
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:23,940
Of course. When have I ever lied to you?

338
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:33,700
True. You can always achieve anything you want.

339
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:46,339
But why do you sound like
you're about to cry when saying this?

340
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:54,819
Nothing. I just...

341
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:03,659
When I think about our wonderful future,
I feel happy.

342
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:12,300
Then I need proof.

343
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,859
What proof?

344
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,912
You have canine teeth, right?

345
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,952
Cherry.

346
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,500
Don't forget me.

347
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:27,319
Cherry, I want to eat
your mom's date steamed buns.

348
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:32,859
You're so lucky. Mom just made a lot today.

349
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:39,140
- Let's go eat then.
- Okay.

350
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,088
Let's go.

351
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,560
Jiang Qiao Xi.

352
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,328
Jiang Qiao Xi.

353
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,359
Jiang Qiao Xi.

354
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:20,416
Jiang Qiao Xi.

355
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:27,339
If we'll be together every day,

356
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:31,259
could you wear something brighter,

357
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:34,440
instead of these dark ones all the time?

358
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,680
Whenever you wear something in bright colors,

359
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,039
it makes me happy.

360
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,940
You feel happy too, right?

361
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,740
I don't look good in bright-colored clothes.

362
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:49,139
You look great, really.

363
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:52,680
Okay, then I'll wear them from now on.

364
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:07,559
Jiang Qiao Xi. Jiang Qiao Xi.

365
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:10,079
Jiang Qiao Xi.

366
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,144
Cherry.

367
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,800
Don't you think I'm missing something?

368
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,592
What's missing?

369
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,659
My suitcase.

370
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:41,079
Right, where's the suitcase?

371
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,660
Should be at my doorstep.

372
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,200
I wonder if someone might take it.

373
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,799
Alright, you'd go up first and steam the buns.

374
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,140
I'll go back to get the suitcase.

375
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,680
By the time I return, they'll be ready to eat.

376
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,159
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

377
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:21,839
Jiang Qiao Xi, when you go up and meet my parents,

378
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:26,460
just say you met me on the way.

379
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,500
I'm warning you, don't talk nonsense.

380
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,859
Okay, no nonsense.

381
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,504
Jiang Qiao Xi.

382
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,120
What's wrong?

383
00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:00,339
I like you. I really, really like you.

384
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,368
I know.

385
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,616
I love you.

386
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:03,040
- Who's there?
- Who is it?

387
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:05,279
Me.

388
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,039
Didn't you bring your key?

389
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,039
I forgot.

390
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,500
What are you doing?

391
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,480
I'll reheat the date steamed buns.

392
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,840
Jiang Qiao Xi is hungry. He wants to eat them.

393
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,119
- Qiao Xi?
- Yes.

394
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,919
Qiao Xi is back?

395
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,239
When I passed by his house,

396
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:28,579
I happened to see him coming out.

397
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:32,539
He's gone back home to get his suitcase.
He'll be here soon.

398
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,360
Mo way.

399
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,119
Let me do it.

400
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,096
Wait over there.

401
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,820
- What are you doing?
- Lotus root sandwiches.

402
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,219
Don't.

403
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:59,240
I will fry them in the pan later.

404
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,420
Don't pour it like that.

405
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,944
Just leave it. I will handle it later.

406
00:35:06,944 --> 00:35:08,768
Okay.

407
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,859
What's up, Cherry?

408
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:37,280
I-I was wondering why he has not arrived yet.

409
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,460
Who?

410
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,440
Jiang Qiao Xi.

411
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,059
 The number you dialed is currently unavailable. 

412
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:12,100
 Please try again later. 

413
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,019
 The number you dialed is currently unavailable. 

414
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:31,060
 Please try again later. 

415
00:36:36,512 --> 00:36:37,679
Where are you going?

416
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:39,039
You just came back. Why are you leaving again?

417
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,939
- Cherry!
- Cherry!

418
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,856

He's wearing a hat and carrying a suitcase.

426
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:01,739
He took a taxi at the entrance and went that way.

472
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:44,400
 In 2008, a financial crisis triggered
by the U.S. subprime mortgage market 

473
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,760
 swept through global financial markets
like a sudden tsunami, 

474
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,300
 dealing a heavy blow to the world economy. 

475
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,719
Many called it the worst economic crisis
since the 1929 Great Depression.

476
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,679
Our children just started college

477
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:00,479
and already face such turmoil
at the beginning of their lives.

478
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,119
Each generation
has its own destiny and challenges.

479
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:06,500
Let the children forge their own path.

480
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,820
What's happening this year?

481
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:12,019
Natural disasters and economic crises
happened all at once.

482
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:14,239
Everyone's tightening their purse strings.

483
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:17,260
Even my convenience store
isn't doing as well as before.

484
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,699
Don't worry, Mr. Qin.

485
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:20,380
The country is boosting domestic demand.

486
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,239
Didn't they say interest rates will be adjusted?

487
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:25,280
When the investments come in,
the economy will recover soon.

488
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,168
Exactly.

489
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,760
Nice.

490
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,679
Its shape looks good.

491
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:35,839
It really captures that lucky symbolism.

492
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,000
I learned how to make this dish a long time ago.

493
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,460
I just wanted to wait until the day
the kids got into college to show off my skills.

494
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,380
You're amazing!

495
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:49,260
It feels like they were still kids just yesterday,
and now they're all college students.

496
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,880
Cherry hated studying so much when she was little.

497
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,519
All she did was play.

498
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:55,119
Back then, I was really worried

499
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,960
that she couldn't get into college.

500
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,800
You don't have to worry anymore, right?

501
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,900
Cherry's score was the highest among all the kids.

502
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,720
She even scored over ten points
higher than my Yu Qiao.

503
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:09,179
And Du Shang, he was so tiny back then,

504
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:11,199
always practicing martial arts.

505
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:13,480
Now he's been accepted into medical school.

506
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,280
He's going to be a doctor.

507
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,199
He's perfect for becoming a doctor.

508
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:22,039
If I need medical care in the future,
I know I can trust him.

509
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,639
Stop it.

510
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:25,480
Let's focus on the good things.

511
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,699
I'm looking forward to riding on
a plane driven by Yu Qiao someday.

512
00:42:28,699 --> 00:42:32,079
The Northern Aviation Academy
is so hard to get into,

513
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,199
but he got accepted!

514
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:36,719
All our kids have made us proud.

515
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:38,280
Absolutely.

516
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,719
Your Fang Yuan has already become an owner.

517
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,579
Yesterday, his father and I

518
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:45,679
took him shopping for college supplies.

519
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:46,940
But he surprised us,

520
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,420
using his own money to buy outfits for both of us.

521
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,219
Really?

522
00:42:52,219 --> 00:42:54,059
How sweet!

523
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:55,340
You used to complain

524
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,536
that Fang Yuan was always upsetting you.

525
00:42:57,536 --> 00:43:00,000
What now? Look at him.

526
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,800
Now he's made such a success
with his internet business.

527
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,208
Exactly! Your Fang Yuan has really proven himself.

528
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,219
Exactly.

529
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:10,260
He's just not academically gifted.

530
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,139
But getting into
that second-tier college in Shanghai

531
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:16,459
is good enough for me.
At least he'll be with Du Shang.

532
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,739
Cherry and Yu Qiao
can look after each other in Hong Yang.

533
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:24,539
But Yun could've gone to Hong Yang too,

534
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:26,340
but insisted on staying at home.

535
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,640
She's sensible
and just wants to stay close to her dad.

536
00:43:30,619 --> 00:43:33,039
Daughters are better, so thoughtful.

537
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:34,440
Not like sons.

538
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,159
Cai Fang Yuan wants to go to Shanghai desperately.

539
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:43,160
Juan, how's Cherry been lately?

540
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,900
She seems okay,

541
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,139
but keeps all her concern inside.

542
00:43:50,139 --> 00:43:51,880
Yesterday she told me

543
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,760
not to send her off to Hong Yang.
She insists on going alone.

544
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,459
I wonder what's on her mind.

545
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,939
This doesn't really seem like Cherry.

546
00:44:14,212 --> 00:44:17,504
 ♫ Once again in the night ♫ 

547
00:44:17,504 --> 00:44:21,184
 ♫ I am like dust ♫ 

548
00:44:21,184 --> 00:44:23,584
 ♫ Blown away by the wind ♫ 

549

 ♫ I gaze at the sea ♫ 

552
00:44:34,912 --> 00:44:36,992
 ♫ But hear the sound ♫ 

553
00:44:36,992 --> 00:44:40,000
 ♫ Of the surging dreams ♫ 

554

 ♫ Breaking through the darkness ♫

 ♫ I want ♫

 ♫ I want you to see ♫

 ♫ I want to sing for you ♫ 

563
00:45:05,312 --> 00:45:08,640
 ♫ My loneliness and confusion ♫ 

564
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,728
 ♫ I want to forget ♫ 

565
00:45:09,728 --> 00:45:12,032
 ♫ I want to forget the past ♫ 

566
00:45:12,032 --> 00:45:15,552
 ♫ Those ordinary years of growth ♫ 

567
00:45:15,552 --> 00:45:17,312
 ♫ Brewing ♫ 

568
00:45:17,312 --> 00:45:18,624
 ♫ Gazing out ♫ 

569
00:45:18,624 --> 00:45:22,496
 ♫ Towards the horizon ♫ 

570
00:45:29,732 --> 00:45:32,896
 ♫ Once again in my dream ♫ 

571
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,904
 ♫ I smell fragrance ♫ 

572
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,648
 ♫ Like white wildflowers on morning paths ♫ 

573
00:45:39,648 --> 00:45:41,728
 ♫ Fragrance ♫ 

574
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,824
 ♫ Breaking through the darkness ♫
