VIDEO CALLING JIANG QIAOXI

2
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,640
- Jiang Qiaoxi.
- <i>Hey, Yingtao.</i>

3
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,280
Where are you?

4
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,780
Why weren't you online today?

5
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,280
<i>Sorry. Something came up over here.</i>

6
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,460
<i>I forgot to tell you.</i>

7
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,040
Can you try

8
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,280
to give me a heads-up next time?

9
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,500
I get really worried when you do that.

10
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,520
<i>What?</i>

11
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,180
<i>Worried I'd ghost you again?</i>

12
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,040
You've got a track record, okay?

13
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,940
Don't act so innocent.

14
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,960
Well…

15
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,300
If you're busy,

16
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,340
I'll let you go.

17
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,120
We can video call tomorrow.

18
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,560
<i>Wait.</i>

19
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,540
<i>It's fine. I'm on the way somewhere,</i>
<i>but I can still talk.</i>

20
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,180
<i>Weren't you preping for the internship</i>
<i>at the school?</i>

21
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,740
<i>How's that going?</i>

22
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,080
Not bad.

23
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,780
I told you

24
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,480
I'll be teaching a class
of first graders, right?

25
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,360
I figured

26
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,280
they might still like to hear
some fairy tales.

27
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,680
So today,

28
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,180
I went through

29
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,760
storybooks from all over the world,

30
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,640
trying to find something
fun and new to read them.

31
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,000
<i>Well, did you find anything good today?</i>

32
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,040
<i>Wanna share with me, a big kid here,</i>
<i>one of the stories?</i>

33
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,920
A big kid asking for fairy tales?

34
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,700
I read one called <i>The Fox's Window</i>.

35
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,840
If you shape your hands
like a fox's window,

36
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,060
you can see from the window

37
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,540
for anything you wish for.

38
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,020
<i>Anything I wish for?</i>

39
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,940
<i>How do you make the window?</i>

40
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,339
It's a little tricky.

41
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,140
With your left hand back-facing,
right hand palm-facing towards your body.

42
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,500
Then use your right middle
and ring fingers

43
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,520
to press over your left index finger.

44
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,680
Sounds like a tongue twister.

45
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,540
Then you'll find,
when your fingers overlap,

46
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,240
there's a tiny window in the middle.

47
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,380
<i>Yeah, sounds complicated.</i>

48
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,720
Well…

49
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,080
I'll show you in person

50
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,160
when we meet.

51
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,120
<i>Deal.</i>

52
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,040
<i>Are you sure it will really show</i>
<i>what I wish for the most?</i>

53
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,400
Of course.

54
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,480
You don't trust Ms. Lin?

55
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,460
<i>I do.</i>

56
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,580
<i>So, you?</i>

57
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,540
<i>What do you want to see most right now?</i>

58
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,840
Do I really have to spell it out?

59
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,900
Jiang-Qiao-Xi.

60
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,680
<i>Jiang-Qiao-Xi.</i>

61
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,540
<i>Then come to your balcony.</i>

62
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,760
<i>Take your little fox window with you.</i>

63
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,000
<i>Maybe you'll see exactly</i>
<i>what you're hoping for.</i>

64
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,840
A FEW YEARS LATER

65
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,360
Jiang Qiaoxi.

66
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,620
You scared me.

67
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,120
Up so early?

68
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,880
Smells amazing in here.

69
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,460
Did you lose weight?

70
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,480
You feel lighter somehow.

71
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,960
- You serious?
- Totally.

72
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,180
Then clearly you haven't been
feeding me enough.

73
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,360
I haven't?

74
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,800
Look what I made this time.

75
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,140
Try it.

76
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Fresh out of the pan.

77
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,960
Well?

78
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,680
Alright, you eat.
I have to go to the office.

79
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,540
Today again?

80
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,880
The market's picking up.

81
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,980
Boss wants to invest
in a few more startups.

82
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,260
I have a meeting with one this morning.

83
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,700
Have to hear their pitch.

84
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,860
Be honest. What time
did you go to bed last night?

85
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,380
Around 4:30 a.m.?

86
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,240
It's 8:30 a.m. now.

87
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,180
You barely got four hours of sleep--

88
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,420
Hello?

89
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,480
Yeah, I read the email. I know.

90
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,600
Alright.

91
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,660
I'll be there soon.

92
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,160
You can't--

93
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,840
Got it.

94
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,500
And if the founders are just college kids,

95
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,540
don't make it feel like an interrogation.

96
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,580
Let them talk. Listen more.

97
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,260
Yingtao,

98
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,860
I'm heading out.

99
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,740
Wait.

100
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,020
You just graduated yourself,
and now you're calling them college kids?

101
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,760
When will you be back?

102
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,500
Tonight. I'll try to make it early.

103
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,880
- Tonight?
- Hm.

104
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,940
Qin Yeyun!

105
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,300
Lin Yingtao,

106
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,680
act your age. You're 25 now.

107
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,620
It's embarrassing.

108
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,620
You were supposed to visit
the wedding venue with Jiang Qiaoxi,

109
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,660
and he didn't show up.

110
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,320
So, what exactly are we doing here?

111
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,920
Don't even ask.

112
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,480
He says

113
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,540
the investment market is hot right now.

114
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,700
They've got him running
for meetings nonstop.

115
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,500
He's like a wind-up toy lately.
All he cares about is stocks and deals.

116
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,280
He's got no time for this.

117
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,200
He doesn't even care
about his own wedding.

118
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,940
Always at work, never home.

119
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,700
You sure everything is okay?

120
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,520
What are you saying?

121
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm saying,

122
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,200
last time you cried and called me
was four years ago.

123
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,180
It's been four years.

124
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,500
Maybe it's time.

125
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,340
Don't say stuff like that, Qin Yeyun.

126
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,220
What?

127
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,800
It's the truth.

128
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,400
Men are like that.

129
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,720
Thanks for the wisdom.

130
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,080
You've known him growing up.
You know what he's like.

131
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,040
Even when he's working late,

132
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,200
he comes home in the morning
just to cook me breakfast.

133
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,260
Sometimes I'm asleep
and he's already left for work,

134
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,040
but the food's still warm in the pot.

135
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,940
And what does that prove?

136
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,700
That proves Jiang Qiaoxi likes cooking.

137
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,540
He made your breakfast, sure,
but who's he making dinner for?

138
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,980
One more word
and I'm tossing you in the water.

139
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,540
<i>Even I can't believe it.</i>

140
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,560
<i>I'm surprised you're in gaming.</i>

141
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,140
I know this funding round

142
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,420
is risky for our firm.

143
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,660
But if it works out,

144
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,440
everything that felt impossible in my head

145
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,540
suddenly becomes possible.

146
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,080
And if I fail,

147
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,900
then I'll have nothing left.

148
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,100
Have you looked over
Mr. Liang's contract carefully?

149
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,540
The contract?

150
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,760
I don't understand that stuff.

151
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,980
My coworkers handle all the legal stuff.

152
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,580
But they did say we're supposed to add
some kind of side agreement.

153
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,040
You mean

154
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,160
we're signing a drawer contract,

155
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,980
where they give us a discount
to lower their issue price.

156
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,480
And in exchange,
we increase our investment.

157
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,820
If that's the case,

158
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,560
the original shareholders
will be heavily diluted.

159
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,940
That's their problem.

160
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,520
What I care about

161
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,420
is that this is a small company

162
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,420
with core tech,

163
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,440
in an up-and-coming gaming industry,

164
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,340
and we can spin it for buzz.

165
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,240
Once it takes off,
we buy low and sell high.

166
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,680
Companies like theirs come to us hoping

167
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,180
we can help them grow long-term.

168
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,380
If we pull a move like this,

169
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,920
isn't it kind of unfair?

170
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,940
Getting the best outcome

171
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,060
at any cost.

172
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,420
That's the simplest rule

173
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,620
in finance.

174
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,600
Vincent,

175
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,800
the sooner you figure out
what really matters,

176
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,820
the better off we both are.

177
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,460
<i>Can you believe he forgot</i>
<i>something as important</i>

178
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,840
<i>as checking the wedding venue?</i>

179
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,280
<i>Said he had to work overtime.</i>

180
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,720
<i>Honestly, what is wrong</i>

181
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,020
<i>with Jiang Qiaoxi?</i>

182
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,500
<i>Yingtao, just wait.</i>

183
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,720
<i>Next time I see him,</i>

184
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,520
<i>I'll give him a proper talk for you.</i>

185
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,480
Please do.

186
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,500
Let him have it.

187
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,880
Yingtao, I'm home.

188
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,860
Perfect timing. Come here.
I'm on a video call with Uncle Jiang.

189
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,920
Hurry up.

190
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,420
What are you putting away?

191
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,340
Come here.

192
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,520
I bought some groceries.

193
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,380
I'm talking to Uncle right now.

194
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,500
- Dad.
- Back from work?

195
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,580
Yeah, just finished.

196
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,860
Say something.

197
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,460
Hi, Dad.

198
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,620
Everything good in Africa?

199
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,940
I'm doing fine. Everything's good.

200
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,480
Are you doing alright?

201
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,540
Yeah, all good.

202
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,780
Dad,

203
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,200
I'll go make dinner.

204
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,340
<i>Go on then.</i>

205
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,560
<i>Cook something nice for Yingtao.</i>

206
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,440
<i>Take care, okay?</i>

207
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,540
Got it.

208
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,460
What's the rush? I'm not even hungry yet.

209
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,540
Hi. Flower delivery for you.

210
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,980
I didn't order any flowers.

211
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,660
"To my favorite teacher, Ms. Yingtao."

212
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,340
These are for you.

213
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,700
Stop sulking.

214
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,820
I didn't forget what today is.

215
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,240
Today marks 6,000 days since we first met.

216
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,940
Sixteen years.

217
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,820
Let's eat.

218
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,500
Yingtao, what's really bothering you?

219
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,880
I'm not in a rush to get married.

220
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,600
But you kept saying,

221
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,060
"Auntie Juan's jujube bun recipe
is only passed down to family, right?"

222
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,140
Or "I have to call her Mom
to count as family, right?"

223
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,840
You rushed me to get the marriage
certificate when we came of age,

224
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,860
then

225
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,500
kept pressuring me to plan the wedding.

226
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,540
And now?

227
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,780
Now that it's happening,

228
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,080
you forget all about it.

229
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,180
I'm sorry. I forgot.

230
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,600
Today was the day we were supposed
to check on wedding venues.

231
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,280
I seriously forgot.

232
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,900
I've just been so swamped.

233
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,760
I'm really sorry.

234
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,060
I just remembered it now.

235
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,040
I promise,

236
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,000
if anything like this ever happens again,
I won't forget. Ever.

237
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,380
Any free time I have,
I'll come help you arrange flowers.

238
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,060
Time for flower arranging?
Are you quitting?

239
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,180
This is me doing a heartfelt
reflection on my mistake.

240
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,780
Morning, Ms. Lin!

241
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,000
Morning, Ms. Lin!

242
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,900
Morning, everyone.

243
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,000
Don't run. Slow down.

244
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,040
Good morning, Miss!

245
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,000
Morning.

246
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,220
Morning, Ms. Yingtao!

247
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,200
Morning, Ms. Yingtao.

248
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,980
Alright, class is starting soon.

249
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,960
Hi, Miss.

250
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,140
Hi, Miss.

251
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,740
Hi, Miss.

252
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,560
- Hi. Good morning.
- Ms. Lin, what did you do this weekend?

253
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,580
I went out for burgers.

254
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,760
I went to see my best friend.

255
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,120
Miss, they say you're getting married.

256
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,500
Is it true?

257
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,740
Look, Ms. Lin.

258
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,940
My mom bought me this new pencil case.

259
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,320
- What do you think?
- It's lovely.

260
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,580
Miss, I brought something too.

261
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,940
- Miss…
- I have one…

262
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,580
- Miss…
- I…

263
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,460
Okay, settle down.

264
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,100
Get ready for class now.

265
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,980
What's up, Haolei?
Why are you sitting here all alone?

266
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,680
How about I sit with you for a bit?

267
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,940
Wanna tell me what's on your mind?

268
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,600
Do you want the little chair
to protect you?

269
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,620
But look,

270
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,560
you've got your classmates all around,

271
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,320
and the sun is shining too.

272
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,660
I'm about to start storytime.

273
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,960
Wanna come out and join us?

274
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,380
Everyone packed their homework?

275
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,820
Don't forget your textbooks tomorrow.

276
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,360
Bye, Ms. Lin.

277
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,720
Lin Qile.

278
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,400
Cen Xiaoman.

279
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,900
Are you picking up your kid?

280
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,020
Oh no,

281
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,500
I'm helping my boss pick up hers.

282
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,460
You probably don't know.

283
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,800
I am now working at a magazine
after my studies abroad.

284
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,140
That's great. It suits you.

285
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,619
Didn't think I'd bump into you today.

286
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,760
What's that kid called?
I'll get them for you.

287
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,880
Xu Haolei. He's in Class 1, Grade 1.

288
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,460
That's my class.

289
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,980
Lei!

290
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,460
Someone's here to pick you up.

291
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,400
Time to go, Lei.

292
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,940
I've only seen him a couple of times,

293
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,020
but every time, he's like this.

294
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,860
My boss is a total career woman.

295
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,840
Barely has time to be around him.

296
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,960
So, it's not surprising
he's kind of quiet.

297
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,300
I don't think he's just quiet.

298
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,760
He seems really sensitive.

299
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,780
And super imaginative.

300
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,460
He'd imagine himself
as a little mushroom in the corner.

301
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,760
Maybe

302
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,920
you could

303
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,700
try talk to him in that way,
as a mushroom.

304
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,840
Is that how you won over Jiang Qiaoxi?

305
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,760
If those dramas hadn't happened,

306
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,760
I think we would've just been good friends

307
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,200
in high school.

308
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,620
Come on, Lei.

309
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,020
Let's go get some candy.

310
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,840
Say bye to Ms. Lin.

311
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,280
See you tomorrow.

312
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,820
<i>Guys, turn on the news.</i>

313
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,960
<i>Yu Qiao was in an accident.</i>

314
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,040
<i>A black kite crashed</i>
<i>into his plane's engine.</i>

315
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,140
Yu Qiao…

316
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,780
<i>A Hongyang Airlines flight</i>

317
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,080
<i>experienced a bird strike</i>

318
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,540
<i>during takeoff…</i>

319
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,680
Within seconds,
the system detected the fault

320
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,900
and warning lights came on.

321
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,820
Yu Qiao.

322
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,180
- Qin Yeyun.
- Come sit.

323
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,620
Are you trying to kill us from panic?

324
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,960
Why didn't you explain it properly?

325
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,860
Stop running.

326
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,220
- I'm not gonna eat you.
- Hey, you.

327
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,100
You're late.

328
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,360
- Stop right there.
- I'm fine.

329
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,240
- I am good.
- A penalty drink.

330
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,500
- I'm driving.
- All limbs attached.

331
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,580
Still breathing. No problem.

332
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,980
Then stop and let me check.

333
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,000
Quit dodging.

334
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,100
I swear I'm okay.

335
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,700
Couldn't you just say that from the start?

336
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,820
Had to give us a heart attack?

337
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,860
I'm back now, aren't I?

338
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,640
Drink some water and chill.

339
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,360
You're still young. Maybe time
to consider switching careers?

340
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,360
Qin Yequn,

341
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,000
this isn't the time to say stuff
that kills the mood.

342
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,960
Look at it this way.

343
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,880
Now I've got real in-flight

344
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,440
emergency experience.

345
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,460
How many pilots can say
they've been through that?

346
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,100
And let's be honest.

347
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,520
A pilot who's been
officially commended like me,

348
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,740
if I step away, that's a loss
for the civil aviation industry.

349
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,060
Yeah, yeah.

350
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,340
Once you've made up your mind,
no one can talk you out of it.

351
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,820
Qin Yeyun told me

352
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,960
the anti-cancer drug you were working on
tested positive for carcinogens.

353
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,200
How's everything going now?

354
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,720
Could be better.

355
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,120
I knew at the time
when I chose to be a doctor,

356
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,560
it was never gonna be easy.

357
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,860
Especially now that I'm trying
to develop an anti-cancer drug.

358
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,980
If there were no issues,
that'd be the real red flag.

359
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,300
And if Yu Qiao can pull through

360
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,200
a life-or-death flight,

361
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,960
I'm sure I can handle it too.

362
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,320
Otherwise, I'd be embarrassed.

363
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,400
Right, Yu Qiao?

364
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,320
Right.

365
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,940
This is how a role model works.

366
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,340
After I brought up my heroic story,

367
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,880
this dinner instantly leveled up.

368
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,840
Oh, please.

369
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,740
To the role model.

370
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,840
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

371
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,820
- Here.
- To the role model.

372
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,700
To the role model.

373
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,980
It's been a while since we've
all been together like this.

374
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,160
Do you remember that thing

375
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,820
we never got time to do?

376
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,680
I think today's the perfect day for it.

377
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,360
What is it?

378
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,160
Come on.

379
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,140
Let's go.

380
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,120
Come on.

381
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,780
- We're all here.
- What is it?

382
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,660
Quick, quick.

383
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,900
Help me out.

384
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,780
On it.

385
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,780
- Put it there?
- So much stuff.

386
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,660
Right?

387
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,640
Honestly,

388
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,940
it feels like I bought this car
just for this moment.

389
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,080
- Let's hit the road.
- Get in, everybody.

390
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,240
Qin Yeyun, you're driving?

391
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,700
Of course.

392
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,580
<i>Okay.</i>

393
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,520
<i>Then I'm riding shotgun.</i>
<i>You're co-pilot for the day.</i>

394
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,780
<i>I want my hands on the wheel,</i>

395
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,320
<i>with my music playing,</i>

396
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,260
<i>and the road ahead of me,</i>

397
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,200
<i>the best views waiting out there.</i>

398
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,240
<i>And next to me, I want Yingtao,</i>

399
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,000
<i>Cai Fangyuan, Du Shang,</i>

400
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,380
<i>and even Yu Qiao.</i>

401
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,820
Wow.

402
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,940
Qunshan Squad!

403
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,420
Pilot ready for takeoff.

404
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,220
We're not getting married
till later this year.

405
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,840
Isn't it a bit early
for the wedding envelope?

406
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,900
This isn't a wedding envelope.

407
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,560
It's that half-letter

408
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,140
Yingtao wrote you in Year 10.

409
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,360
<i>The one I snatched away.</i>

410
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,740
So, I've passed your probation? Approved?

411
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,200
You've been promoted and certified.

412
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,740
I am not the one to approve.

413
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,700
This letter.

414
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,160
I kept it in my possession for years.

415
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,640
I always wanted to open it.

416
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,340
But I never did.

417
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,620
Took every ounce of my moral restraint.

418
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,680
Now it's yours.

419
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,700
Hot potato officially passed.

420
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,220
Thanks.

421
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,180
Yingtao.

422
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,740
What's next?

423
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,280
I want to try that one.

424
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,280
They're done?

425
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,720
All burned out.

426
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,080
Yu Qiao.

427
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,680
There were things I thought

428
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,000
I'd never be able
to tell you in this life.

429
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,560
But after your incident,

430
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,520
I realized if I didn't say it,
I'd regret it forever.

431
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,460
I don't want to live with that.

432
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,940
Then tell me.

433
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:54,100
I never know which flight you're on.

434
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,620
But every time I look up

435
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,060
and see a plane overhead,

436
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,240
I always feel…

437
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,480
it's gonna be you.

438
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,060
Then, from now on,

439
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,620
<i>every time I'm up there,</i>

440
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,480
<i>I'll look down</i>

441
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,300
<i>and think about you</i>

442
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,500
<i>looking up at me.</i>

443
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,740
That's all I wanted to say.

444
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,340
Let's go set off fireworks.

445
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,300
Let's go.

446
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,860
- Run!
- Go, Qiaoxi!

447
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,740
Go!

448
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,720
So beautiful.

449
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,460
<i>Today saw a major correction across</i>
<i>the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets.</i>

450
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,560
<i>Key indices dropped sharply</i>

451
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,460
<i>and volatility spiked.</i>

452
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,920
<i>Regulators said</i>

453
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,260
<i>they're closely monitoring</i>
<i>market developments</i>

454
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,460
<i>to help maintain stability.</i>

455
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,540
- Morning, Ms. Lin.
- The second the market opened,

456
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,200
it crashed past 3,000 points.

457
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,940
I thought my screen was broken.

458
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,540
Can you believe that? What are the odds?

459
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,680
My husband and I were this close

460
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,920
to putting our one-bedroom money in

461
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,460
- and turning it into a two-bedroom.
- What's going on with Ms. Sun?

462
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,780
You didn't invest in the stocks.
You won't know.

463
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,280
Over a thousand stocks
hit their lower limit.

464
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,300
The index dropped straight to 3,000.

465
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,000
That's a 40% wipeout.

466
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,880
Lin Qile.

467
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,140
What are you doing here?

468
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,100
Have you talked to Jiang Qiaoxi?

469
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,120
No. Why?

470
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,560
His boss got taken in for questioning.

471
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,960
Fei Linge just told me.

472
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,780
Jiang Qiaoxi had warned him

473
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,180
that the hedge fund they were working with
had a drawer contract.

474
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,140
Said they might dump
their shares and bail.

475
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,260
Once Fei Linge heard,
he backed out of the deal.

476
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,820
Now the market's tanking.

477
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,280
His boss is under investigation.

478
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,080
Fei Linge tried calling,
but his phone's off.

479
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,720
This is serious.

480
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,000
I figured

481
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,320
I had to come find you.

482
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,660
Let me try calling him.

483
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,100
I'll head home and check on him.

484
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:26,980
Go now. Hurry.

485
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,680
- Thanks.
- No need for that. Just go.

486
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,180
TO JIANG QIAOXI, SUNFLOWERS ARE BLOOMING

487
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,100
COME SEE THEM WITH ME

488
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,400
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi,</i>

489
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,800
<i>I've said so much to you,</i>

490
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,940
<i>but I forgot to ask.</i>

491
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,360
<i>Do you still remember Chunlu?</i>

492
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,480
<i>Do you still remember you're her dad?</i>

493
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,600
<i>Do you</i>

494
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,920
<i>still remember me?</i>

495
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,000
<i>I've remembered you all along.</i>

496
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,000
<i>When I think about you,</i>

497
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,720
<i>I think about the days</i>
<i>when we were little.</i>

498
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,100
<i>Back then,</i>

499
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,960
<i>time flew in the blink of an eye.</i>

500
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,840
<i>The ice cream cone was just in your hands</i>

501
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,660
<i>and it'd be melting.</i>

502
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,140
<i>We were just reaching the mountaintop</i>

503
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,540
<i>for the sunset.</i>

504
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,580
<i>It'd be all dark before we took it in.</i>

505
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,460
<i>Time to head back down.</i>

506
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,640
<i>But without you,</i>

507
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,020
<i>without our friends,</i>

508
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,360
<i>the past five years have felt so slow.</i>

509
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,280
<i>Like an afternoon nap</i>
<i>you couldn't wake up from.</i>

510
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,180
<i>What about you?</i>

511
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,600
<i>Did your time go by fast or slow?</i>

512
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,600
<i>Was it because you met new people?</i>

513
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,080
<i>People you liked better?</i>

514
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,180
<i>Did they make your days flow quicker?</i>

515
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,580
<i>If that's true,</i>

516
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,940
<i>I guess I'd feel a little sad.</i>

517
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,840
<i>But only a little.</i>

518
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,940
<i>Because if you're doing well,</i>

519
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,260
<i>I'll feel like I'm doing okay too.</i>

520
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,720
<i>Still,</i>

521
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,640
<i>I hope you tell your new friends this.</i>

522
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,620
<i>Your name is Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>

523
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,980
<i>It means</i>

524
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,960
<i>the most beautiful sunset glow</i>
<i>on the mountaintop of Qunshan.</i>

525
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,980
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi,</i>

526
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,700
<i>writing this letter</i>

527
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,000
<i>took every piece of courage I had.</i>

528
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,960
<i>I was afraid you might've forgotten me.</i>

529
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,600
<i>But then I thought,</i>

530
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,040
<i>if it's really you,</i>

531
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,180
<i>you wouldn't.</i>

532
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,540
<i>So, can you tell me?</i>

533
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,580
<i>I know you're probably busy,</i>

534
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,480
<i>maybe buried in math problems,</i>

535
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,260
<i>but</i>

536
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,540
<i>if one day you're not so busy,</i>

537
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,420
<i>could you come back to Qunshan?</i>

538
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,320
<i>I want to go up the mountain</i>

539
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,940
<i>with you again to watch the sunset.</i>

540
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,900
<i>I want to hear you tell me</i>

541
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,480
<i>how the past five years</i>

542
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,060
<i>have been for you.</i>

543
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,680
<i>Did your time</i>

544
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,520
<i>go by fast or slowly?</i>

545
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,660
<i>From your Lin Yingtao, hoping to watch</i>

546
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,860
<i>another sunset with you on the mountaintop</i>

547
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,500
<i>of Qunshan.</i>

548
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,100
Jiang Qiaoxi.

549
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,640
It's okay, Jiang Qiaoxi.

550
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,940
Really, it's fine.

551
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,980
As long as you're alright,
that's what matters.

552
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,980
Why did you say

553
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,600
as long as I am alright?

554
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,060
I heard everything.

555
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,400
Cen Xiaoman came to find me.

556
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,960
She said your boss
got taken in for questioning.

557
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,400
You didn't do anything wrong,

558
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,220
- did you?
- Relax.

559
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,860
Sit down.

560
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,060
I quit before

561
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,640
anything could go wrong.

562
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,300
Then why are you crying?

563
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,960
Because of the stock market?

564
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,840
No.

565
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,720
Hey, it's okay.

566
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,940
Money comes and goes.

567
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,960
As long as you're safe,
that's all I care about.

568
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,200
It's not about the market.

569
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,500
I already sold all my shares.

570
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,900
You did?

571
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,840
You sold everything and didn't tell me?

572
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,520
You quit your job and didn't tell me?

573
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,860
Nothing you care to share, is it?

574
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,760
- What are you doing?
- Come here.

575
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,480
Why?

576
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,820
Don't tell me you used the stock money

577
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,460
to buy the ring?

578
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,820
Jiang Qiaoxi, what have you done?

579
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,760
Relax.

580
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,140
There's enough.

581
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,440
Yingtao,

582
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,260
I know

583
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,700
saying this now

584
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,180
might be pretentious.

585
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,000
But

586
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,660
I still want to ask.

587
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,900
Will you spend your life with me?

588
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,100
Haven't I already been doing that?

589
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,680
That's different.

590
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,560
Will you?

591
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,120
Come on.

592
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
You're blinding me.

593
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,820
Okay, okay, stop flashing it around.

594
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,400
That ring's too bright.

595
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,600
It's so shiny.

596
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,100
Qiaoxi,

597
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,680
how long are you two staying

598
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,200
this time?

599
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,200
Just the weekend.

600
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,720
I still have classes,
so we have to head back soon.

601
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,300
Alright.

602
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,060
I know you've both got things to do
back in Hongyang.

603
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,680
It's fine.

604
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,700
You're both grown now.

605
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,560
You've got your own careers.

606
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,680
If you're back for a couple of days,
just enjoy them.

607
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,720
Qiaoxi,

608
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,840
I'll make extra jujube buns this time.

609
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,940
And stuffed lotus root too.

610
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,560
Take them home, put them in the freezer.

611
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,700
That's too much trouble, Auntie.

612
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,040
You could just teach me the recipe.

613
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,500
I'll make them for Yingtao

614
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,600
when we're back in Hongyang.

615
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,120
That won't do.

616
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,420
Better teach me instead.

617
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,460
He does all the cooking now.

618
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,960
If he ever gets sick of it
and starts bossing me around,

619
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,820
I'll need something to reign him in.

620
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,920
So clever, aren't you?

621
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,960
- This kid.
- Uncle, Auntie,

622
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,380
there's something I'd like to say.

623
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,460
Even though Yingtao and I
haven't had the wedding yet,

624
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,260
I was wondering

625
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,300
if I could start calling you
Mom and Dad from today.

626
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,360
If you want to, go ahead.

627
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,220
We've seen you as family
since you were little.

628
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,740
Well then, it all depends

629
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,400
on how you behave from now on.

630
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,200
Dad.

631
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,280
Mom.

632
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,940
That's more like it.

633
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,000
Since Jiang Qiaoxi's changed
how he addresses you,

634
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,340
can we skip the red envelopes?

635
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,219
No way.

636
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,860
- Tradition is tradition.
- He's already calling you Mom and Dad,

637
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,500
so no need for red envelopes
at the wedding,

638
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,199
- right?
- Listen to this penny pincher.

639
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,360
Yingtao,

640
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,260
you're starting

641
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,540
a new chapter with Qiaoxi now.

642
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,139
You two are your own family.

643
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:56,040
You've got to start planning
for your own little household.

644
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,220
No way.

645
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,700
Even if I have my own family,

646
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,340
I'll always love Mom and Dad the most.

647
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,860
That's not how it works.

648
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,060
From now on,
you two are building a life together.

649
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,020
Take care of each other.

650
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,820
And if anything ever happens, call me.

651
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,220
‪Sure.

652
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,560
What are you "sure" about?

653
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,380
Know what that means?
Let me break it down.

654
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,420
My dad is saying

655
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,300
don't you dare bully me.

656
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,320
Because if you do,

657
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,680
I'll give him a call.

658
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,040
He'll show up

659
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,180
- and give you a beating.
- Hey, don't.

660
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,040
- You're gonna break him.
- It's fine.

661
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,720
- Hurts your heart?
- Of course it does.

662
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,700
You poked through it.

663
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,500
Oh no, it's broken.

664
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,660
Let me see.

665
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,020
Looks good. Really nice.

666
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,420
Good.

667
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,240
Mine doesn't look as good as yours.

668
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,320
Looks great to me.

669
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,800
You'll get the hang of it.

670
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,520
Okay.

671
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,200
Yingtao.

672
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,980
Does Qiaoxi still stay
in touch with his parents?

673
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,400
Same as always.

674
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,520
You know what his family's like.

675
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,280
He can hold a conversation
with Uncle Jiang now,

676
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,800
but it's still pretty distant.

677
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,780
Auntie Liang

678
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,740
calls once in a while, checks in briefly.

679
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,180
But the calls don't last a minute
before she hangs up.

680
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,580
There's something

681
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,920
his mom didn't want me
to tell you back then.

682
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,820
But now that you and Qiaoxi are married,

683
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,000
I think

684
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,760
I should tell you.

685
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,760
What is it?

686
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,320
How are things at work?

687
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,600
A couple of years ago,

688
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,720
his mom came back
from her post in Nigeria.

689
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,960
She came by our place.

690
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,820
Do you know why she came?

691
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,300
Why?

692
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,880
To do exactly what you're doing now.

693
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,740
<i>At the time,</i>

694
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,920
<i>watching her,</i>

695
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,640
<i>I suddenly understood her.</i>

696
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,160
Anyone in her situation,

697
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,740
anyone at all,

698
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,280
would've crumbled.

699
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,600
It gets exhausting sometimes.

700
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,080
But you've still got

701
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,660
to live life

702
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,760
the best you can.

703
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,640
When we get back,

704
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,600
I'll let him know about this.

705
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,220
Thinking about you getting married
still tugs at my heart a little.

706
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,200
Alright, alright.

707
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,180
Yingtao.

708
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,040
You are the best daughter
in the whole wide world.

709
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,360
And you're the best mom
in the whole wide world too.

710
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,920
So much so,

711
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,740
I almost don't want
to share you with Jiang Qiaoxi.

712
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,620
What?

713
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,180
What is it you don't want to share?

714
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,380
<i>Dear Lin Yingtao of 16 years old.</i>

715
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,180
<i>Hey. It's Jiang Qiaoxi. I'm 25 now.</i>

716
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,360
<i>Sorry</i>

717
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,360
<i>it took me nine years to write back.</i>

718
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,240
<i>Still, I hope you receive it.</i>

719
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,400
<i>Maybe it's a good thing I replied late.</i>

720
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,580
<i>Now I can finally tell you</i>

721
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,260
<i>about our life for the past nine years.</i>

722
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,620
<i>Do you want</i>

723
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,060
<i>to hear the ending first?</i>

724
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,320
<i>It's a happy one.</i>

725
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,460
<i>We're getting married soon.</i>

726
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,200
<i>These days,</i>

727
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,540
<i>we share the same parents,</i>

728
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,260
<i>live under the same roof,</i>

729
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
<i>share the same meals,</i>

730
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,860
<i>even use the same body wash.</i>

731
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,300
<i>I wonder</i>

732
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,980
<i>if this is the kind of life</i>

733
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,700
<i>you'd like.</i>

734
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,440
<i>But you probably weren't</i>

735
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,300
<i>thinking that far ahead at 16.</i>

736
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,180
Well…

737
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,760
What I'm feeling right now is…

738
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,960
<i>Over these nine years,</i>

739
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,640
<i>all the time I spent alone,</i>

740
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,340
<i>I got through it</i>

741
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,420
<i>by picturing us together</i>

742
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,460
<i>watching sunsets in Qunshan.</i>

743
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,200
Watch out.

744
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,880
- <i>That's how I held on.</i>
- Why two cakes?

745
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,620
<i>I made believe</i>

746
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,120
<i>you were part of everything I did.</i>

747
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,560
- <i>That way,</i>
- You prefer this one?

748
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
<i>the future</i>

749
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,140
<i>didn't feel so dark.</i>

750
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,720
<i>When I first left Qunshan</i>
<i>and couldn't see you anymore,</i>

751
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,520
<i>I used to picture myself</i>

752
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,280
<i>still by your side.</i>

753
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,920
<i>Saving the chocolates my teacher gave me,</i>

754
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,960
<i>bringing you your favorite peanut milk,</i>

755
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,260
<i>heading to the hills with you and Chunlu</i>

756
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,740
- <i>to catch the sunset.</i>
- Feel it?

757
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,800
Yingtao, do you remember

758
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,680
when we were kids,

759
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,480
sitting right here

760
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,180
reading <i>Harry Potter</i>?

761
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,820
Excuse me.

762
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,780
Back then, you didn't even
read it yourself.

763
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,080
You made me read it to you.

764
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,040
And

765
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,860
we definitely never sat on a hilltop
to read <i>Harry Potter</i>.

766
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,740
You remember it wrong.

767
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,140
I'm sure we did.

768
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,120
You just don't know it yet.

769
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,040
<i>Back in junior high,</i>

770
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,520
<i>I used to imagine</i>

771
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,280
<i>we'd never been apart.</i>

772
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,000
<i>That we were still in school together,</i>

773
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,360
<i>still reading</i> Harry Potter <i>side by side.</i>

774
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,020
<i>But Yingtao,</i>

775
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,380
<i>now I don't have</i>

776
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,700
<i>to imagine anymore.</i>

777
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,860
<i>Because in this moment,</i>

778
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,940
<i>you're really here with me.</i>

779
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,740
<i>The sunset tonight is stunning.</i>

780
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,520
<i>I wish I could scoop it up</i>
<i>and hand it to you,</i>

781
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,200
<i>so you could carry it with you.</i>

782
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,060
<i>Just like</i>

783
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,820
<i>how you gave me that amber necklace</i>

784
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,160
<i>you are always wearing.</i>

785
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,880
<i>But here's the problem, Yingtao.</i>

786
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,920
<i>I can't give you piece of sunset.</i>

787
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,820
<i>But I'm greedy.</i>

788
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,780
<i>Because now I want to try</i>
<i>your jujube buns too.</i>

789
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,120
<i>Do you think Yingtao</i>
<i>nine years down the road</i>

790
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,960
<i>would make them for me?</i>

791
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,820
<i>I think you,</i>

792
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,220
<i>nine years from now,</i>

793
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,020
<i>probably would.</i>

794
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,880
<i>From your Jiang Qiaoxi,</i>
<i>watching the sunset</i>

795
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,620
<i>with you.</i>

796
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,680
You are so grown up now.

797
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,420
And today, you're even becoming a bride.

798
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,420
Yeah.

799
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,660
I'm getting married today.

800
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,040
Is it the same as how you'd imagine it?

801
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,060
Honestly, I never imagined
myself in a wedding dress.

802
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,500
I didn't even think much about growing up.

803
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,620
And now that you see it all,

804
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,520
do you like it?

805
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,320
Are you still fearless
like you used to be?

806
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,700
Of course.

807
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,160
But

808
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,900
being a grown-up

809
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,520
sometimes means pretending to be scared.

810
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,660
Then,

811
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,460
do you love the person you're marrying?

812
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,460
Yes, and I can't love him more.

813
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,380
He's the one you always pictured.

814
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,280
So,

815
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,160
am I handsome?

816
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,740
Are you really me?

817
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,660
Why wouldn't I be?

818
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,260
You're so smiley now.

819
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,000
The real you

820
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,980
always loved to smile.

821
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,180
And the real you

822
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,960
has been woken up.

823
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,560
The one who woke you up,

824
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,380
was it Yingtao?

825
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,580
Who else

826
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,340
could it be?

827
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,600
In fairy tales,

828
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,180
the princess marries the prince,

829
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,020
and they live happily ever after.

830
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,160
But the story always ends there.

831
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,820
Is that real?

832
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,360
Will they really live happily ever after?

833
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,480
Are you wondering

834
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,820
if Jiang Qiaoxi and I

835
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,260
can stay like this forever?

836
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,200
Staying happy…

837
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,860
isn't easy after all.

838
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,180
In the future,

839
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,460
we'll definitely face tough times,

840
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,760
bad weather, ups and downs.

841
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,000
But as long as I'm by his side

842
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,740
and he's by mine,

843
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,960
I'm not afraid of anything.

844
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,980
What I want most now

845
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,040
is to stay by her side.

846
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,900
So Yingtao…

847
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,220
can always be Yingtao.

848
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,380
Keep it up and good luck.

849
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,160
Don't worry.

850
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:58,500
I will.

851
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,660
Then I like it.

852
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,700
I like it very much.

853
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,760
I like who you grew up to be.
The fearless you.

854
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,800
Jiang Qiaoxi, look.

855
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,920
Why do you wear those?

856
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,560
Red shoes with a white dress?
You're jumping into--

857
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,380
Exactly.

858
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,560
I want to leap right into life with you,

859
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,140
wearing these heels.

860
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,700
Jiang Qiaoxi,

861
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,400
you may now kiss your bride.

862
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:19,640
THE END

863
