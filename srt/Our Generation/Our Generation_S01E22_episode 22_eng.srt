1
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:39,008
 

2
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,420
Standing here, I saw the sky
filled with a sunset glow.

3
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,900
For the first time, I prayed in my heart

4
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:52,700
that day in Hong Yang must be overcast
without sunset hues.

5
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:56,040
Cherry mustn't see the sunset colors.

6
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,000
That way, she wouldn't think of me
and could feel happier.

7
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,899
Even just a little bit.

8
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:11,759
Maybe you were right.
Perhaps I didn't see any sunset that day.

9
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:20,199
Truth is, I often can't see sunsets when studying
in the library or attending evening classes.

10
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,539
I know I'm fooling myself.

11
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:32,560
You don't think of me because you see sunsets.

12
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,880
You look for sunsets because you think of me.

13
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,360
So what does the sunset
have to do with your sorrow?

14
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,880
I'm the real root of this pain.

15
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,060
Sometimes I truly despise myself,
and I don't know why.

16
00:02:53,060 --> 00:03:00,300
When I left, I told you not to forget me, Cherry.

17
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:06,460
For people I care about, whether near or far,

18
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,339
I never have enough strength
to protect them properly.

19
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:14,840
All my emotions are trapped
in my chest, ready to burst.

20
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,719
For the first time in my life,
I wanted to find a place to cry.

21
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:23,300
I hid behind a pillar,
but tourists were taking photos.

22
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:29,239
I went under the stairs,
but couples were kissing there.

23
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:37,120
Finally, I held it in until around 10 PM.

24
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,179
With fewer tourists,
I bought a Ferris wheel ticket.

25
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,439
I sat in the empty cabin and cried my heart out.

26
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,820
That was September 6th, 2008.

27
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:00,339
Jiang Qiao Xi was pitiful that day.

28
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:08,499
He didn't know that 639 days later,
I'd come back here

29
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,880
with Lin Cherry by my side.

30
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,860
Silly Jiang Qiao Xi, you should call Lin Cherry.

31
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,579
Tell her you're sad,
and she'll fight alongside you.

32
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:54,600
It's fine if you don't call.

33
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:02,139
Because in 639 days,
Lin Cherry will come find you.

34
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:07,160
No matter where you are, I'll track you down.

35
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,840
Don't underestimate yourself.
You've done amazing things.

36
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,319
And from now on, I'll always be with you.

37
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,619
You can't escape. Not anymore.

38
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,980
I wish I could've been there then.

39
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:41,248
Then I could've hugged you
the moment you stepped off.

40
00:05:42,368 --> 00:05:48,879
You didn't come late.
I was the one who couldn't find my way home.

41
00:05:54,699 --> 00:06:00,480
Jiang Qiao Xi, where can we
watch the sunrise in Hong Kong? Let's go.

42
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,020
It's so beautiful.

43
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:15,088
Let's go. Further ahead. There.

44
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:19,337
 ♫ Warmly kissing her ♫ 

45
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,585
 ♫ Open your eyes, little prince ♫ 

46
00:06:21,585 --> 00:06:25,448
 ♫ Riding a white horse ♫ 

47
00:06:25,448 --> 00:06:27,238
 ♫ Looking up at the sky ♫ 

48
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:31,305
 ♫ The distant clouds stay silent ♫ 

49
00:06:31,305 --> 00:06:33,594
 ♫ Quietly spinning ♫ 

50
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:37,286
 ♫ Waiting for his reply ♫ 

51
00:06:37,286 --> 00:06:39,017
 ♫ A ray of moonlight ♫ 

52
00:06:39,017 --> 00:06:40,579
 ♫ Gently ♫ 

53
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:43,371
 ♫ Brushes against the cheek ♫ 

54
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:44,425
 ♫ She timidly ♫ 

55
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:49,353
 ♫ Hides into the clouds ♫ 

56
00:06:49,353 --> 00:06:51,182
 ♫ The serene blue sky ♫ 

57
00:06:51,182 --> 00:06:52,706
 ♫ Muttering ♫ 

58
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:55,337
 ♫ Lying in the grass ♫ 

59
00:06:55,337 --> 00:06:56,931
 ♫ Unintentionally ♫ 

60
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:57,673
 ♫ The dragonfly ♫ 

61
00:06:57,673 --> 00:07:07,264
 ♫ Lands on my nose tip ♫ 

62
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:10,496
 ♫ Aye aye oh ♫ 

63
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,184
 ♫ Aye oh ♫ 

64
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:15,584
 ♫ Sunflower tiptoes ♫ 

65
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:20,066
 ♫ Shaking head and saying goodbye ♫ 

66
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:27,480
Jiang Qiao Xi, you just told me at the pier

67
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,460
that you hate how you told me
not to forget you back then.

68
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,400
You mustn't think that way.

69
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,360
Though I had no news of you these years,

70
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,639
those words at least showed me you needed me.

71
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,660
That's how I persevered. You did nothing wrong.

72
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:06,119
Cherry, do you know the story
of Wei Sheng embracing the pillar?

73
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,600
Once a man named Wei Sheng
fell in love with a girl,

74
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,180
but his parents objected.

75
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,800
They decided to elope.

76
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,540
They arranged to meet
at the suburban bridgehead at dusk.

77
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,019
On the chosen day,
Wei Sheng waited endlessly at the bridge.

78
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:36,819
When floods came, he clung to the bridge pillar.

79
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,179
Even facing death, he kept their promise.

80
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:50,959
He held on, and when she finally came,
he had drowned.

81
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,260
He never let go.

82
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,899
I'm not Wei Sheng. If you don't come, I'll search.

83
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:13,080
If you run, I'll chase.

84
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,459
And if I can't catch up, I'll intercept you.
You can't escape.

85
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,040
The moment I see any sign you love me, I'll act.

86
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,559
You can't get away.

87
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,920
Your hair, your eyebrows,

88
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:54,944
your eyes, nose, lips...

89
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:58,279
 ♫ Through the window of time ♫ 

90
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,200
Every part of you belongs to me.

91
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,932
 ♫ I gaze from afar ♫ 

92
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:06,076
 ♫ The unspoken wishes of that year ♫ 

93
00:10:06,076 --> 00:10:09,308
 ♫ Familiar shadows lengthen ♫ 

94
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,036
 ♫ Beyond sight ♫ 

95
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:15,296
 ♫ Your silhouette is so gentle ♫ 

96
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:19,356
 ♫ The world is spinning ♫ 

97
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:24,892
 ♫ The breeze is shouting ♫ 

98
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:30,464
 ♫ The scenery in amber ♫ 

99
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,852
 ♫ Clear as yesterday ♫ 

100
00:10:33,852 --> 00:10:35,452
 ♫ Reality is in front of me ♫ 

101
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:39,488
 ♫ The future folds in the palm ♫ 

102
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:45,088
 ♫ You're the key to who I am ♫ 

103
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:49,984
 ♫ Accompany me to become myself ♫ 

104
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:53,312
 ♫ The night is long ♫ 

105
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:55,840
 ♫ My stubbornness grows wildly ♫ 

106
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,176
 ♫ I can't stop running ♫ 

107
00:10:58,176 --> 00:11:01,280
 ♫ The silent call of the dream ♫ 

108
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,340
 ♫ You're the sparkling of my dreams ♫ 

109
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,392
You're awake.

110
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:12,128
 ♫ Accompany you to become yourself ♫ 

111
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:14,912
 ♫ Boundaries dissipate ♫ 

112
00:11:14,912 --> 00:11:18,560
 ♫ Loneliness melts in an embrace ♫ 

113
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,224
 ♫ I've always been here ♫ 

114
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,859
Do you know why I wanted to watch the sunrise?

115
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:38,200
When you all saw me off
in Qun Shan three years ago,

116
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,340
you said the sunset glow never disappears.

117
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,700
It's just on its way back.

118
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,720
When we see it again, it becomes the morning glow.

119
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,020
Welcome home, Jiang Qiao Xi.

120
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,300
I'm back, and I won't leave again.

121
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,340
Say that again.

122
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,519
I want to record this
and let the morning glow bear witness.

123
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,899
I'm back, and I won't leave again.

124
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:21,359
I, Jiang Qiao Xi, swear nothing can stop me
from staying with Lin Cherry.

125
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,779
Not financial crises, not volcanic eruptions,

126
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,240
not even tsunamis.

127
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,519
Not heavy suitcases, not water-stained walls,

128
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,559
and not broken air conditioners.

129
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,779
Not cloudy days, not pride,

130
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,779
not shame, and not arrogance.

131
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:41,980
Not fallen leaves, not rusty fences,

132
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,960
and not morning dew either.

133
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,899
Not mossy stone paths, not ant colonies,

134
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,259
and not plastic bottles that missed trash cans.

135
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:55,059
They missed.

136
00:12:56,576 --> 00:13:00,613
 ♫ Cheering for you ♫ 

137
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,872
 ♫ Maybe the world's a bit harsh ♫ 

138
00:13:05,248 --> 00:13:07,779
 ♫ Always extinguishing hope ♫ 

139
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:15,320
 Jiang Qiao Xi, I don't think
I should have shown you the sunset glow. 

140
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,940
 It's beautiful but fades too quickly. 

141
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,260
 I should've shown you the morning glow instead. 

142
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,439
 Though then you wouldn't
be Qiao Xi, but Qiao Dong. 

143
00:13:31,424 --> 00:13:36,035
 ♫ Don't forget about tomorrow ♫ 

144
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:40,192
 ♫ Love is in your eyes ♫ 

145
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:45,299
 ♫ You will see flowers blooming ♫ 

146
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:47,960
 ♫ Every minute and every second ♫ 

147
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,224
 ♫ I will be with you ♫ 

148
00:13:53,344 --> 00:13:57,696
 ♫ Flying over that sea ♫ 

149
00:13:57,696 --> 00:14:02,822
 ♫ No regrets can hinder ♫ 

150
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:06,283
 ♫ This is the most devoted and steadfast me ♫ 

151
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:10,720
 ♫ Cheering for you ♫ 

152
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,328
 ♫ Cheering for you ♫ 

153
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:19,456
 ♫ Heart towards the horizon ♫ 

154
00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:20,820
 ♫ Endless anticipation ♫ 

155
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,620
- Hello? Ya Lin.
- Vincent, your brother is missing!

156
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,880
Hello. Where's she?

157
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,220
Qiao Xi.

158
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,259
Ya Lin.

159
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:38,279
Ruo Cheng just regained mobility in his legs,

160
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,319
and I'm afraid he might do something rash.

161
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,040
Don't panic. I'll look for him immediately.

162
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:51,699
Let's go.

163
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,439
Where could Ruo Cheng have gone?

164
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,679
Jiang Qiao Xi, look.

165
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:30,179
Ruo Cheng. Ruo Cheng.

166
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,559
Is that him?

167
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,359
Jiang Ruo Cheng.

168
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,300
Ruo Cheng.

169
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:49,439
We just came to sneak some ice cream.
No need for this manhunt.

170
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,879
Is it not him?

171
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,679
Let's go.

172
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,419
I'm at Victoria Mercy Hospital.
We have a missing patient,

173
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:47,220
male, 37 years old, about 178cm tall,

174
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,184
wearing a hospital gown.

175
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,380
He disappeared about an hour ago.

176
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,500
Yes, I'm his family.

177
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,300
Ruo Cheng went home?

178
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,840
Alright, thank you.

179
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,740
He doesn't even have money on him.

180
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,059
I think your cousin has gone home.

181
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,200
Sorry, I think we've located him. Thank you.

182
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,500
Ask if he knows how worried we've been!

183
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,379
Jiang Ruo Cheng.

184
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,359
How did you find this place?

185
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:41,680
During my long hospitalization,
I mostly lay paralyzed in bed

186
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,720
and couldn't even get up.

187
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,539
I stared at the ceiling every night,

188
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:50,980
wondering how you managed
without me all these years.

189
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,740
I never imagined you'd be living like this.

190
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,819
We endure whatever comes our way.

191
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:03,296
Is this living?

192
00:18:03,296 --> 00:18:05,980
Had I known this would happen,

193
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,160
you should have just let me die that day.

194
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,279
What nonsense are you saying?

195
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:19,920
Do you know how hard Ya Lin has worked
these past two years? You have no idea!

196
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,319
You're mostly recovered now.
Why this defeatist talk?

197
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,960
Mom, that's exactly what I'm saying.

198
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,799
Look what I've become.

199
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,839
We lost everything, our Repulse Bay house,

200
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,900
Qiao Xi's overseas tuition money...

201
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,480
We're penniless now. Nothing left.

202
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,779
Saving me landed you in this shabby place.

203
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:44,700
I dragged you down. Don't you see?

204
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,420
- Mom.
- Don't say that.

205
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:53,980
Ruo Cheng, you're not a burden. I rely on you.

206
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:59,619
If not for the doctor's prognosis of recovery,
I wouldn't have lasted this long.

207
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,359
You're quite capable.
Our life is the same as before.

208
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:12,319
What ability do I have now?
How could I give you any hope?

209
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,619
I've lost everything now.

210
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:20,380
I can't even walk over to hold
my daughter. Look at my legs.

211
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,559
When I saw Dad in that state,
I couldn't even bring myself to approach him.

212
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,160
I have nothing left. Look at what I've become.

213
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,119
I'm just a useless person now.

214
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,819
Jiang Ruo Cheng, I've waited so long
and taken care of you for so long.

215
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:39,660
I didn't wait all this time just to hear
these hurtful words upon your recovery.

216
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:45,079
If this is how you'll be, you might as well
stay hospitalized. At least we had some hope.

217
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:51,200
Seeing you like this destroys all my hope.
Please don't be like this.

218
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,599
I'm sorry, my dear.

219
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,399
Let's go.

220
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,480
It's fine.

221
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:46,059
Boss, two bottles of beer please.

222
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:47,859
Coming right up.

223
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:56,480
I normally don't like you drinking,
but today seems like a good exception.

224
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,740
Two cold beers for you.

225
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,900
Thank you.

226
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,700
Thanks.

227
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:28,339
This is my first time meeting your cousin today,
and he matches what I imagined.

228
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:31,480
Distinguished presence and handsome features.

229
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,540
I wish you'll be this good-looking
when you reach his age.

230
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,380
You never saw him in his prime.

231
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,460
Back then, just looking into his eyes

232
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,419
would convince you
that there was nothing he couldn't accomplish.

233
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:51,440
He built a thriving career
while maintaining a perfect family life.

234
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,940
He even paved the way
for his overambitious younger cousin.

235
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,160
I know you've admired him since childhood.

236
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,819
Remember that jacket he gave you? You refused
to throw it away even after vomiting on it.

237
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:09,299
I wanted to be exactly like him,

238
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:13,399
responsible, reliable, and brilliant.

239
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,319
Yet even someone so perfect and flawless

240
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:29,240
lost everything in a single day.

241
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:42,000
Are you scared?
Afraid the same might happen to you?

242
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,272
No.

243
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,740
When my mother
was hospitalized after her accident,

244
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:57,400
she told me, "Jiang Qiao Xi,
you don't understand this world at all".

245
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,460
I didn't believe her then.

246
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,440
But just six months later,

247
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,720
when my cousin had his accident,
I realized she was right.

248
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,779
We don't get to choose.

249
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:17,779
Real choice depends on
whether the world sides with you.

250
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:27,819
Mr. Jiang Qiao Xi,
don't fall into this nihilistic spiral.

251
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:33,640
How can we not have choices?
We make them every day!

252
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,380
Today we chose porridge instead of claypot rice.

253
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,319
We picked beer over iced lemon tea.

254
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,259
I...

255
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:45,640
So sorry! I am so sorry.

256
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,140
Let me get you a fresh one right away.

257
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,859
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

258
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:54,940
Happens all the time. Wipe that.

259
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,159
Have mine.

260
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,540
It's fine. I have this.

261
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,259
I should've come sooner.

262
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:34,359
But the market crash
took all my energy to recover from.

263
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:37,059
Time flew by until now.

264
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:44,240
No worries. If you came earlier,
you'd have found me playing Sleeping Beauty here.

265
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Ruo Cheng. Ya Lin.

266
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Qiao Xi.

267
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,759
- Ya Lin.
- Cherry.

268
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:49,380
Flowers for you.

269
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,799
Hello, Ruo Cheng.

270
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,799
Hello.

271
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,599
Hi.

272
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:02,319
You must be Cherry?

273
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:04,000
That's me.

274
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,259
Technically, this is our first meeting,

275
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:10,779
but I feel like I've known you forever.

276
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:14,520
This kid wouldn't stop
talking about you since childhood.

277
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,700
Jiang Qiao Xi constantly mentions you, too.

278
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,700
Really?

279
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,900
Absolutely true.

280
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,740
I brought some snacks for you. Nothing fancy.

281
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,740
I just thought hospital food might be bland.

282
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,400
So I got a variety of flavors.

283
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:42,079
How thoughtful of you.
No wonder Qiao Xi raves about you.

284
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,859
Qiao Xi, Cherry sure is sweet indeed.

285
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,960
Mr. Jiang, this must be your genius nephew?

286
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,020
I didn't expect such height and good looks!

287
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,559
Typical Jiang family genes.
You can't fight good DNA.

288
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:04,500
My cousin here studies Finance and Math at HKU,

289
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,339
top of his class.

290
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:09,640
Same as your academic background, right?

291
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,619
He'll dominate the financial world in no time.

292
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:16,259
Impressive!

293
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:20,299
He'll surpass me. I never worry about this one.

294
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:24,599
Qiao Xi, give me stock tips when you get famous!

295
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:29,140
Another windfall could secure my kids' future.

296
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,140
Deal.

297
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,019
Mr. Jiang, remember that EV stock you recommended?

298
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:36,064
Thank you!

299
00:26:36,064 --> 00:26:38,720
Your prediction about its potential

300
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,900
convinced me to go all-in with our savings.

301
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,859
14x returns in two years!

302
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,759
Smart move. Well done.

303
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,599
He's miserable now, bedridden and useless.

304
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:59,619
Remember when we were printshop laborers?

305
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:04,859
He used to scream over typos all night.
How the mighty have fallen.

306
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:10,279
When I mentioned going to Singapore,
he looked like a drowned puppy.

307
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:13,059
At least his wife's still a stunner.

308
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:15,400
Jiang Qiao Xi.

309
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
Jiang Qiao Xi.

310
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,500
What did you say?

311
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,500
Let go.

312
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,700
Stop fighting, Jiang Qiao Xi!

313
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,680
- Let me go!
- Come here.

314
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,940
Jiang Qiao Xi, calm down!

315
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,660
- Qiao Xi!
- Jiang Qiao Xi!

316
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,839
Qiao Xi.

317
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:29,639
Let go.

318
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,599
You can't hit people.

319
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:43,079
How has Ruo Cheng treated you?
Have you visited him once in these years?

320
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,200
How did he help you before?

321
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Ya Lin.

322
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,000
Don't let me see you again.

323
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,400
Hello? Hello? What's wrong?
What's happening there?

324
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,200
You're such a joke.

325
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:24,700
Ya Lin, are you okay?

326
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,160
I'm fine. Are you hurt?

327
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
I'm okay.

328
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,960
Don't hit people.

329
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,740
Let's go.

330
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,220
I didn't scare you, did I?

331
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:44,539
No, I've known your personality all along.

332
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:47,440
I'm just surprised Mrs. Jiang acted that way.

333
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,280
She looked like a heroine.

334
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:06,900
Cherry, don't you think I've changed
since coming to Hong Kong?

335
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:13,200
You've definitely changed.

336
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:24,180
What should we do, Cherry?
My flaws and wounds keep multiplying.

337
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,359
Don't act like you had
fewer wounds and flaws before.

338
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:37,079
The difference now is you don't
pretend to be strong around me.

339
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:40,220
You don't hide anything from me anymore.

340
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:49,960
The kind of change that lets you
close your eyes and open your heart before me.

341
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:56,759
You've stopped stubbornly
doing things you think are good for us.

342
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:01,079
Like how you used to be... Never mind.

343
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:06,159
Anyway, I prefer who you are now.

344
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:24,839
Hello? Ya Lin? Okay.

345
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:27,200
What is it? Should we go up?

346
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,500
No, she said she'll take us out.

347
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,300
Out?

348
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,980
Welcome.

349
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,440
We've reserved a private room.

350
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,240
This way, please.

351
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,099
Watch your step.

352
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:22,019
Don't worry.

353
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:27,020
Ruo Cheng has a membership card here
with some balance.

354
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,019
- Australian lobster, steamed crab, abalone.
- Got it.

355
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:43,000
Hong Kong grouper,
morel mushroom with asparagus, and desserts...

356
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,240
Lin, would you prefer bird's nest soup
or black truffle chocolate cake?

357
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,119
They make excellent both Chinese
and Western desserts here.

358
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,059
I'm fine with either, Mrs. Jiang.

359
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:56,059
We'll have both.

360
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:57,299
Certainly.

361
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:58,400
Thank you. That'll be all for now.

362
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,200
Okay.

363
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,559
Could we get a takeout box? Thank you.

364
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,599
Lin, I've been occupied
with Ruo Cheng's matters these days.

365
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,359
I'm sorry we haven't had a proper meal together.

366
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:14,579
Not at all.

367
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:18,500
Consider this meal as your welcome dinner then.

368
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,579
Ruo Cheng should be here,
but he sneaked off earlier.

369
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:26,519
The doctors wouldn't let him leave. My apologies.

370
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:31,339
Please don't feel that way, Mrs. Jiang.
I should be thanking you and Mr. Jiang.

371
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:38,240
I forgot to order wine.
You don't drink much, do you?

372
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:47,859
Not really. Just some beer
at home or school gatherings.

373
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:52,819
What about red wine? Any favorites?

374
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:55,280
I don't drink red wine much.

375
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:57,759
I see.

376
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:05,500
Ya Lin, there'll be plenty of chances
for expensive wines and restaurants.

377
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:18,140
Qiao Xi, shouldn't we drink expensive wine
and dine at luxurious places

378
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,420
precisely during times like this?

379
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:27,000
The tougher times get, the higher
we should hold our heads, right?

380
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,440
Let's follow Mrs. Jiang's advice.
We'll drink premium.

381
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,240
Yes, only the finest.

382
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:06,540
When I was your age, I read novels often.

383
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,899
There's this Yi Shu novel, City of Hurt.

384
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:18,280
I never understood the ending back then.

385
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:25,120
But today, I think I get it.

386
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:32,000
I've read that story.

387
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:39,240
What's the story?

388
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,159
It's about a man with an arrow in his waist

389
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,559
who lives with it permanently.

390
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:01,440
When asked if it hurts,

391
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:08,399
he says it only hurts when he remembers the arrow.

392
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,479
I brought you out today to lift your spirits,

393
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:23,260
to remind you of the good times we shared.

394
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:29,519
But these memories reminded me of that arrow.

395
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,940
These two years since Ruo Cheng's accident
haven't been hard,

396
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,519
but Qiao Xi, your biggest sacrifice
was giving up studying abroad.

397
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:45,760
Now you're working triple shifts
for his medical bills,

398
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,819
taking on so many jobs.

399
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:53,260
Ya Lin, after what happened to Ruo Cheng,

400
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:59,479
I wouldn't leave even if you told me to.

401
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:06,720
If not for family matters,
you and Cherry wouldn't have been apart so long.

402
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:12,780
Seeing you like this breaks my heart.

403
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,939
No, Mrs. Jiang. Don't think that way.

404
00:36:18,699 --> 00:36:20,800
Actually, when I first met Jiang Qiao Xi,

405
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,420
I knew Mr. Jiang meant everything to him.

406
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,560
If he hadn't stayed then,
he wouldn't be the real Jiang Qiao Xi.

407
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,080
I'm sorry.

408
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,580
Ya Lin.

409
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,240
Thank you both.

410
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,780
Jiang Ruo Cheng. Ruo Cheng.

411
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,159
I'm sorry. Our restaurant
changed owners previously.

412
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,420
Today, the system encountered another issue.
We can see your balance tomorrow at the earliest.

413
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,480
I'm sorry.

414
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,800
It needs to wait until tomorrow, right?

415
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,819
Sorry. My apologies.

416
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,800
Fine. I'll use cash.

417
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,740
4,512.

418
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,980
Do you accept UnionPay? UnionPay?

419
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,780
No no. I have my card.

420
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:36,859
I can pay. And I wanted to treat
Mrs. Jiang anyway. Don't move.

421
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,860
- Thank you.
- Here...

422
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,179
All settled?

423
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:52,699
All paid, Mrs. Jiang. Thanks for treating me.

424
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:57,059
The food was delicious.
The wine too. I'm completely stuffed.

425
00:37:57,059 --> 00:37:59,379
Should we take a walk?

426
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,139
Let me carry that.

427
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:04,239
Please visit again.

428
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,260
Thank you.

429
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,060
Come again soon.

430
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,719
Qiao Xi, Cherry, wait here.
I need to buy something.

431
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,039
- I'll be quick.
- Are you going alone?

432
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,839
Ya Lin?

433
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:20,679
Lottery tickets. One each for tonight's draw.

434
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:23,380
Why the sudden lottery idea, Ya Lin?

435
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,119
These past two years, whenever life felt too hard,

436
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:33,280
I'd buy a lottery ticket
and give myself something to hope for.

437
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:41,760
Cherry, you spent too much tonight.
But I can only give you this lottery ticket.

438
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,400
You can pick first.

439
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,979
Me first? Okay, I'll...

440
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:53,260
Then I'll just take this one randomly.

441
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:01,480
If only this ticket could actually win.

442
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,539
The odds of winning are lower
than getting struck by lightning.

443
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,400
Why you gotta ruin the mood like that?

444
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,659
Don't dampen our enthusiasm, okay?

445
00:40:16,659 --> 00:40:22,060
Mrs. Jiang was right.
This isn't just a lottery ticket. It's hope.

446
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:29,159
Mrs. Jiang, I remembered
what Jiang Qiao Xi told me recently.

447
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:32,239
He thinks people don't have real choices.

448
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:36,599
True choice depends on
whether the world sides with you.

449
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,460
It makes a little sense,

450
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:47,000
but I believe even if the world's against us,
we still have choices.

451
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:54,140
We can choose hope. Because no one can steal hope.

452
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,100
So thank you, Mrs. Jiang, for giving me hope.

453
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:07,539
Thank you, Cherry.
I haven't heard such words in ages.

454
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:13,819
Don't worry, Mrs. Jiang.

455
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:22,599
All painful things will pass.
Bad things will eventually turn good.

456
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:24,640
That's what my dad always told me.

457
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:31,620
And Mr. Jiang's health is improving.
Things will keep getting better.

458
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:38,620
Thank you, Cherry.

459
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,219
I still find it unbelievable.

460
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:52,119
How a mere lottery ticket can give such big hopes.

461
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:54,860
But if it doesn't win, it's just worthless paper.

462
00:41:54,860 --> 00:42:00,200
Before 9:30 pm, it's proof of anticipation though.

463
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:05,960
Wouldn't failed hopes after 9:30 feel worse?

464
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:11,000
Then... we can buy another ticket
and wait for the next draw.

465
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,400
We'll spend another hopeful day.

466
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,719
Aren't you even slightly curious
if your ticket might win?

467
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:20,200
Even the slightest chance?

468
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:25,019
The lottery's winning probability
is one in ten million.

469
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:28,119
But meeting Lin Cherry
was one in a hundred million.

470
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:31,220
So I've already won my personal lottery.

471
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:38,039
Jiang Qiao Xi, when did you grow
a silver tongue? So corny.

472
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:39,719
- Say it again.
- No. Sweet words are only for once.

473
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:40,900
- Say it again.
- I won't.

474
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,700
Let me check the time.

475
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,980
It's 9:45.

476
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,199
Time to check the lottery then.

477
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:52,159
Let me check mine first. Here.

478
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:53,959
You hold it. I'll check.

479
00:42:55,579 --> 00:43:00,940
01, 29, 06, 22.

480
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,739
Wait.

481
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:05,660
01, 29, 22.

482
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,300
- 06.
- 06.

483
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,976
- 44, 45.
- 45.

484
00:43:10,976 --> 00:43:12,384
- 27
- 27

485
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:15,780
- 36.
- Final number, 36?

486
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,080
Only two numbers missing.

487
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,900
So I matched five numbers.

488
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,380
You missed by two. What a pity.

489
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,420
Do five matches win much?

490
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,659
Not sure.

491
00:43:26,659 --> 00:43:30,039
Enough! Any money's good!

492
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:33,679
How many times have you counted? Stop already.

493
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,699
Five base numbers matched.
Fourth prize: HKD 9,600.

494
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,639
No mistake here.

495
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:44,820
Told you! Heaven loves me. You didn't believe.

496
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,500
Heaven does love you.

497
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,919
But if you keep counting like this,
even Heaven can't stop muggers.

498
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,380
Jiang Qiao Xi, my mom says

499
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:06,920
money from gambling or lotteries
isn't proper earnings,

500
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,500
and we need to spend it fast.

501
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,099
Let's spend it all in Hong Kong.

502
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:13,899
Fine. What do you want?

503
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,379
Actually yes. Ray-Ban sunglasses.

504
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,539
For Yu Qiao?

505
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:30,680
Who else? Let's go. Take me there.

 ♫ I've always been here ♫ 

531
00:46:30,368 --> 00:46:33,564
 ♫ Rotating light in my palm ♫ 

532
00:46:33,564 --> 00:46:36,540
 ♫ Illuminating your cheeks ♫ 

533

 ♫ A smile that ran too fast ♫ 

534
00:46:40,892 --> 00:46:47,388
 ♫ Unexpectedly preserved ♫
