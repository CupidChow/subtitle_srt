1
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,140
Yingtao.

2
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,960
Yingtao.

3
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,860
Quick, get changed.

4
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,880
Uncle Yu just called.

5
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,120
He's taking us to
that breakfast spot by the gate.

6
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,780
Breakfast?

7
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,560
The <i>baozi</i> are here。

8
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,080
- Come on.
- Oky.

9
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,240
Okay.

10
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,200
Okay. Thanks.

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,900
Yingtao.

12
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,540
Try this <i>baozi</i>.

13
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,460
Here you are.

14
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,260
Tastes exactly like the ones
we had in Qunshan.

15
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,980
Exactly the same. Nothing changed.

16
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,700
Is it good?

17
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,000
How about it?

18
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,880
Delicious.

19
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,940
Look at our Yingtao,

20
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,220
as adorable as when she was little,

21
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,780
making everyone dote on her.

22
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,200
No wonder people think

23
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,280
she's dating someone.

24
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,040
Back when our Cai Fangyuan

25
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,640
was a first-grader

26
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,120
getting bullied by older kids,

27
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,700
it was little Yingtao

28
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,980
who stormed into their classroom
to defend him.

29
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,900
That's when I knew

30
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,940
our boy was blessed.

31
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,560
That feisty girl,

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,440
she had to be sweet

33
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,760
on him.

34
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,160
Mom!

35
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,260
Sister Kang, are you overthinking?

36
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,700
Our Du Shang gets her

37
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,120
justice service too.

38
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,520
No wonder Sister Kang reads into things.

39
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,480
Back when we first moved to Qunshan,

40
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,220
it was Yingtao who dragged

41
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,180
our Yu Qiao

42
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,080
to class every day,

43
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,840
showed him around.

44
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,700
I never thought

45
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,200
she'd fancy him.

46
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,800
But he sure adored her.

47
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,200
Mom, what are you saying?

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,220
Who among you

49
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,340
doesn't like Yingtao?

50
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,340
What your mom means is,

51
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,940
The connection between you all

52
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,060
are good friendship.

53
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,660
- Right.
- As childhood buddies.

54
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,980
We, as parents, get it.

55
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,480
Yeah, it's got nothing to do with

56
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,360
puppy love.

57
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,900
Forget all that

58
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,360
puppy love nonsense.

59
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,900
Let's not even talk about the other kids.

60
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,480
But Yingtao, she'd never date young.

61
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,420
Right.

62
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,320
If anyone can

63
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,900
prove otherwise,

64
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,560
I, Cai Wu, swear right now:

65
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,040
I'll buy the entire headquarter

66
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,280
breakfast for a month.

67
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,100
Li, you're my witness.

68
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,720
Manager Cai, duly noted.

69
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,020
I'll spread the words.

70
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,020
That's won't be necessary.

71
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,720
Let's leave it here.

72
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,860
Consider this matter dropped

73
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,480
and forget about

74
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,360
that breakfast bet.

75
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,860
Today's breakfast is

76
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,020
my treat, everyone.

77
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,420
It's on me.

78
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,440
- Four more, please.
- Sure.

79
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,980
- More <i>baozi</i>.
- Okay.

80
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,680
Eat <i>baozi</i>.

81
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,300
- Eat <i>baozi</i>, everyone.
- Delicious.

82
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,180
Eat the egg.

83
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,280
I peel it for you.

84
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,160
No need.

85
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,540
I peel it by myself.

86
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,620
That breakfast was awesome.

87
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,600
I took four fried dough twists,

88
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,740
and Mom didn't scold me.

89
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,760
With Uncle Li around,
no one would spread nonsense rumors.

90
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,700
Listening to them,

91
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,720
it hits me how much

92
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,220
of our childhood survival
depended on Yingtao's blessings.

93
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,320
Damn right!

94
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,580
We better remember that.

95
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,040
What's still worrying you?

96
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,440
Don't you find it strange?

97
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,760
Why is it?

98
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,700
Jiang Qiaoxi's mom

99
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,500
was supposed to be
on a business trip to Laishui.

100
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,680
How did she suddenly show up?

101
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,440
Even if she did come back early,
there's no way

102
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,840
Jiang Qiaoxi would've told her

103
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,860
he was meeting me.

104
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,080
So how did she know?

105
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,380
I know.

106
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,180
We've got a mole.

107
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,200
Not me.

108
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,920
What're you staring at?

109
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,820
Do you think it's me?

110
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,120
- It hurts.
- Be gentle.

111
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,500
Stop.

112
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,480
That leaves only

113
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,420
Qin Yeyun?

114
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,140
Why're you being so loud?

115
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,020
I…

116
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,480
Is it my fault?

117
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,000
Yingtao.

118
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,420
Come here.

119
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,700
Not a mole. It is an outsider.

120
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,000
How do you know?

121
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,200
That test paper

122
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,420
with our meeting details is gone.

123
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,380
I think

124
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,420
someone took it.

125
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,620
Who do you suspect?

126
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,340
Fei Linge.

127
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,420
He cares about Jiang Qiaoxi
more than anyone.

128
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,720
He's also the one took the letter

129
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,660
you wrote before.

130
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,920
You're saying

131
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,800
he already knows

132
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,800
I'm Lin Yingtao?

133
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,460
But why hasn't he done anything?

134
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,260
Maybe he's planning

135
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,440
something in the back.

136
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,800
Here's the plan.

137
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,880
First, we investigate.

138
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,440
If it's really him,

139
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,240
we settle all scores at once.

140
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
Damn right we will.

141
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,520
Have you noticed they

142
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,580
have been giving us

143
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,580
weird looks lately?

144
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,040
What's wrong with them?

145
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,360
Let's go.

146
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,760
Wasn't Jiang Qiaoxi supposed to

147
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,380
join the second training camp?

148
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,900
Why did he leave for the first one

149
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,580
so suddenly? Didn't even tell us.

150
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,140
Xiaoman, do you know why?

151
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,560
How should I know?

152
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,320
Maybe Auntie Liang has

153
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,840
some other plans for Jiang Qiaoxi.

154
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,260
Jiang Qiaoxi is

155
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,320
ghosting my calls.

156
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,080
I was counting on him
for some exam questions.

157
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,900
Go.

158
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,220
- What're you doing?
- I have something to ask him.

159
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,080
- Where are you going?
- Let's go.

160
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,620
Don't go with him, Fei Linge.

161
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,500
I refuse.

162
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,480
Listening to her now?

163
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,320
Go. The teacher is waiting for you.

164
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,720
- For me?
- Yes.

165
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,880
Start talking

166
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,080
about everything you've done.

167
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,420
And if your story doesn't add up…

168
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,740
You gonna talk or what?

169
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,160
Talk or not?

170
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,740
Talk or not?

171
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,160
Yingtao, you're going to beat him?

172
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,620
That's called vibes.

173
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,920
Is my vibe intimidating?

174
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,580
Yes.

175
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,740
Who's going to beat him?

176
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,240
What's this? You've got the nerve

177
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,980
to bully kids at Jialin Experimental?

178
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,140
Don't twist the facts.

179
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,320
You hit the floor by yourself.

180
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,520
We didn't do anything.

181
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,500
Well…

182
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,760
You know why

183
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,440
we called you here.

184
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,940
Go ahead. Confess.

185
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,500
What guilty things have you done to us?

186
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,500
Me do something guilty?

187
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,420
If anyone's guilty here,

188
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,760
it's you.

189
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,820
Then enlighten me

190
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,200
what guilty deeds have we supposedly done?

191
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,260
You know

192
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,360
what you've done.

193
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,600
Blame yourselves for being
so obvious about it.

194
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,440
So it was you.

195
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,380
Fei Linge.

196
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,980
What are you doing?

197
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,840
Xiaoman, go tell Ms. He

198
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,060
that they're dating.

199
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,360
I am not!

200
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,280
You don't admit it, right?

201
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,180
I have evidence.

202
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,980
Jiang Qiaoxi and I are not dating.
Stop spreading lies.

203
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,920
You think you could ever
date Jiang Qiaoxi?

204
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,220
Dream on!

205
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Let's go.

206
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,660
Alright, spill it.

207
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,840
When did you two start dating?

208
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,820
Since when are we dating?

209
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,860
Since when did we ever start?

210
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,020
Nobody even told us we were dating.

211
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,080
You two still have

212
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,300
the nerve to laugh about this?

213
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,460
Ms. He, they're showing

214
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,520
zero remorse.

215
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,100
Enough. No more discussion.

216
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,320
You two,

217
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,680
call your parents. Now.

218
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,820
Ms. He, we apologize for the trouble.

219
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,380
For the record, we parents were aware of

220
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,960
their aquarium trip.

221
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,640
We even paid for the tickets ourselves.

222
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,100
How can you parents

223
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,460
still be smiling about this?

224
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,060
At their age,

225
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,660
going out so brazenly.

226
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,200
Look at their behavior.

227
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,300
This…

228
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,800
This action?

229
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,280
Ms. He,

230
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,620
it's nothing.

231
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,340
Just some head-patting.

232
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,720
Their daughter even

233
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,940
spanked our Yu Qiao's butt

234
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,060
when they were toddlers.

235
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,360
I mean,

236
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,960
these two children

237
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,880
grow up together.

238
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,020
It's not a big deal to pat on the head.

239
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,200
We're both employees
of Electric Power Construction,

240
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,260
and these two children

241
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,940
have grown up together

242
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,960
as if they were brother and sister,

243
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,880
so there's no problem,

244
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,980
and you can rest assured.

245
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,140
However,

246
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,380
even in this case,

247
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,540
you as parents still need to be careful.

248
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,580
They are in puberty.

249
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,700
They need to know

250
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,280
differences between boys and girls

251
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,580
Don't let it affect their studies.

252
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,860
<i>True.</i>

253
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,320
<i>You were right.</i>

254
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,460
<i>Yes, Ms. He, we parents</i>

255
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,340
<i>- are watching them.</i>
- Fei Linge.

256
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,040
<i>Nothing will happen.</i>

257
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,760
These photos are really well-shot,

258
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
great composition too.

259
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,500
- Mind giving them to us?
- Pardon?

260
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,320
He says

261
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,660
nice shots,

262
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,320
good composition. He wants them.

263
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,480
Yu Qiao,

264
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,900
so you and Lin Qile

265
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,380
aren't actually a thing?

266
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
No wonder you've all

267
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,640
been giving us those looks.

268
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,080
Fei Linge's been

269
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,300
poisoning your minds.

270
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,200
Did the teacher give you any trouble?

271
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,360
Do you need me to vouch for you?

272
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,740
Don't worry.

273
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
These rumors are disgusting,

274
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,040
and I will set things straight.

275
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,140
I'll have a serious talk with Fei Linge.

276
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,380
No need, Monitor.

277
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,700
Just a misunderstanding.

278
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,920
I don't hold grudges
against small-minded people.

279
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,800
Ling Qile.

280
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,520
Has anyone ever told you

281
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,340
what an amazing girl you are?

282
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,680
Thank you, Monitor.

283
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,380
I know about this.

284
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,080
Stop whispering.

285
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,960
Focus on your studys.

286
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,840
Yu Qiao.

287
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,420
Mom?

288
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,540
Hello, Auntie.

289
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,420
Listen, Yingtao's

290
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,020
like a little sister
you've watched grow up.

291
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,780
She just transferred schools,

292
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,220
so you better look after her,

293
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,200
understand?

294
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,340
And ignore the gossip.

295
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,600
There's no way you two

296
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,680
are dating.

297
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,000
Mom!

298
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,940
Yingtao,

299
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,760
don't be shy.

300
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,260
No, I don't.

301
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,760
We're just happy you kids

302
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,200
get along so well.

303
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,600
- It warms our hearts.
- Mom!

304
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,020
- Don't be shy.
- Stop.

305
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,520
She is the Yingtao?

306
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,080
Come on.

307
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,160
Go back, mom.

308
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,960
<i>It's okay.</i>

309
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,820
<i>I want them to understand</i>

310
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,000
<i>to stop that dating nonsense.</i>

311
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,200
<i>Spreading that rumors</i>

312
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,400
<i>is just terrible.</i>

313
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,540
What to do?

314
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,840
I didn't tell you earlier
because I'm afraid

315
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,040
Jiang Qiaoxi would get angry.

316
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,700
How do you know?

317
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,820
Let's skip that question.

318
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,060
I've got something important to give you.

319
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,100
She hid it so well.

320
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,660
So Yu Qiao was covering

321
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,520
for her back then.

322
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,240
No wonder Jiang Qiaoxi's

323
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,480
been avoiding school lately.

324
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,360
Scared straight by her.

325
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,400
Didn't Jiang Qiaoxi

326
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,840
claim he didn't know her?

327
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,400
That rejection was beyond obvious.

328
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,360
He was just sparing her dignity.

329
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,880
But she even transferred to our school.

330
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,180
Surely a bold girl.

331
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,620
Exactly! And somehow

332
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,140
she still hid her identity.

333
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,360
Your careless talks

334
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,020
hurts people.

335
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,900
Now hand it over.

336
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,960
Monitor.

337
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,160
Why are you defending her?

338
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,220
<i>They're ruining</i>

339
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,240
<i>our class's reputation.</i>

340
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,500
<i>There's a misunderstanding.</i>

341
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,380
Yingtao.

342
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,700
<i>You don't know her.</i>

343
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,040
I'm stuck on a Chinese question.

344
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,100
Mind helping me?

345
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,720
Come in, Yingtao.

346
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,720
No need to stand there.

347
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,120
Yingtao.

348
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,540
Jiang Qiaoxi hasn't even said anything.

349
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,160
Why are you all spouting nonsense?

350
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,780
That paper with meeting details

351
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,060
between you and Jiang Qiaoxi,

352
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,820
are in their hands.

353
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,080
- My paper?
- Yes.

354
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,220
They've known that

355
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,200
Qile is Yingtao.

356
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,360
Yu Qiao.

357
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,040
Yu Qiao, what are you doing?

358
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,340
- What are you doing?
- Give it back.

359
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,760
My test paper is in your hand.

360
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
What? Did you steal it?

361
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,040
How is it your test paper?
Prove it's yours.

362
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,360
It's got my name on it.

363
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,520
You think everyone's like

364
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,500
that Yingtao,

365
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,600
fancy shady stuff?

366
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,660
I put my paper in my drawer.

367
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,960
You mean it was blown out?

368
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,760
You walk home with us today.

369
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,960
What's the occasion?

370
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,780
Since someone is having problems,

371
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,560
I must take advantage of the situation.

372
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,200
Do you think

373
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,080
I'm afraid?

374
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,900
In this school,

375
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,780
at least

376
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,900
five people

377
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,000
believe in me

378
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,000
and stand by my side.

379
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,480
I don't think anyone else could

380
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,860
handle what I've been through

381
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,440
as well as I have.

382
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,540
You've beaten Yu Qiao and say out loud

383
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,660
the punch lines of Hong Kong

384
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,540
movie protagonists.

385
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,320
Since you've figured it out,
then lighten up a little.

386
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,280
It's Saturday tomorrow.

387
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,160
Anyone free to come with me

388
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,780
to the Olympiad training?

389
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,800
No, I'm not.

390
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,840
I'll go with my dad to restock inventory.

391
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,720
Yingtao, I gotta go with my mom

392
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,340
to my grandma's place tomorrow.

393
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,020
- Tomorrow, I…
- You, Cai Fangyuan.

394
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,060
You have to go with me tomorrow.

395
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,060
You've been there before.
You know the way.

396
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,560
My only option.

397
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,180
It's tough doing this all by myself.

398
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,720
Yu Qiao.

399
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,580
Don't look at me.

400
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,740
I'm not going.

401
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,900
You…

402
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Lin Yingtao, you…

403
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,360
Stop right there!

404
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,500
The class should be over around this time.

405
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,300
Jiang Qiaoxi usually
goes for snacks in the cafe.

406
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,220
You guys can head

407
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,500
straight there to find him.

408
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,480
Back when I was training here,

409
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,000
I got too familiar with all the teachers.

410
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,940
I'd be recognized right away.

411
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,500
So I'll stay outside and
watch for you two.

412
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,500
Senior Jiang,

413
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,460
is this seat taken?

414
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,380
No, please.

415
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,260
All right.

416
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Senior Jiang,

417
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,820
the legendary genius,
I've heard so much about you.

418
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,020
I heard you were set for the next term.

419
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,300
Didn't expect you

420
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,400
to join us now.

421
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,720
I'm so lucky.

422
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,280
Thank you.

423
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,100
Senior Jiang,

424
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,740
did you join us so suddenly

425
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,140
to avoid that girl from Qunshan?

426
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,080
What?

427
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,640
My friend from Jialin Experimental

428
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,840
just called me.

429
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,820
Apparently, your school's forum is buzzing

430
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,640
about that Qunshan Girl.

431
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,800
Rumor has it she transferred

432
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,920
to your school just to chase after you,

433
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,980
even hid her background from everyone.

434
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,740
Also, she even asked you
to come out at midnight…

435
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,560
Cai Fangyuan said we should

436
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,440
turn left first after going in, right?

437
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,540
Yes. Turn left.

438
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,820
<i>- You two!</i>
- Oh, no.

439
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,740
<i>Stand right there!</i>

440
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,320
<i>We saw you earlier.</i>

441
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,800
<i>- Stop!</i>
- Run!

442
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,680
<i>- Li and Zhao, go for them.</i>
<i>- Stop!</i>

443
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,000
- I'm here!
<i>- Stop!</i>

444
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,600
<i>Go easy on them. They're students.</i>

445
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,680
Stop, you!

446
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,400
Our school cafeteria food
not good enough for you?

447
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,820
Every day there's always

448
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,000
students like you

449
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,940
rushing out to feast on junk foods.

450
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,360
Come with me to the security office.

451
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,240
- Let's have your teacher come collect you.
<i>- Stop!</i>

452
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,060
Stop running.

453
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,400
Mr.

454
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,280
Tell them to stop.

455
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,360
We're not…

456
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,120
- Stop arguing and just go.
<i>- Come back!</i>

457
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,220
I…

458
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,180
I'm here to find my rabbit.

459
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,260
Your rabbit?

460
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,920
My rabbit

461
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,440
accidentally slipped in

462
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,160
through your school gate.

463
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,580
I've come to look for it.

464
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,440
This rabbit is extremely

465
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,320
important to me.

466
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,820
If you happen to see my rabbit,

467
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,360
please tell it that

468
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,000
don't worry about me.

469
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,960
No matter what happens,

470
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,400
I can handle it.

471
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,300
You silly kid, what are you thinking?

472
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,320
How could a rabbit
possibly worry about you?

473
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,400
It's…

474
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,020
My rabbit does worry about me.

475
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,720
Classmate,

476
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,060
if you see my bunny,

477
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,300
please tell it that.

478
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,000
Sure.

479
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
Jiang Qiaoxi,

480
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,780
what are you doing here?

481
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,660
Mr.

482
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,840
I came out to look for my missing cat.

483
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,860
I can't find it anywhere.

484
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,940
Your cat?

485
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,440
Yes. It's the most

486
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,500
adorable little cat,

487
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,020
snow-white fur

488
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,860
with a cherry-red

489
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
nose.

490
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,900
Have you seen it?

491
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,140
Haven't seen it. No cats spotted

492
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,080
in our training camp.

493
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,240
Actually,

494
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,800
there is a little cat in our camp.

495
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,580
Maybe the bad weather,

496
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,840
the constant raining,

497
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,300
made my kitten

498
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,860
hide itself.

499
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,400
I was really worried about her at first.

500
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,780
I am worried that she'd struggle.

501
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,200
Others might mistreat her.

502
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,800
But…

503
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,540
But now I know:

504
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,260
she's the toughest,

505
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,780
bravest little cat.

506
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,540
She'll be comfortably

507
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,400
nap in sunlight,

508
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
watch sunsets with breeze.

509
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,640
Even without me,

510
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,040
she'll thrive.

511
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,580
Because she's the most

512
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,960
extraordinary cat.

513
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,120
I get it now.

514
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,260
You've all been

515
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,020
under too much pressure lately.

516
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,240
Mr, I forgot to mention earlier.

517
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,120
She's actually

518
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,020
a classmate from our school.

519
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,040
She might have come to visit us.

520
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,160
Would it be possible for me to…

521
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,640
Then you should have informed them

522
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,020
that visitors aren't allowed here.

523
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,520
Alright, it's getting late.

524
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,280
Qiaoxi, you go rest.

525
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,060
I'll escort them out.

526
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,200
- Go.
- Sure.

527
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,060
I'm fine, really. Go on back now.

528
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,640
Take care of yourself.

529
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,480
Rest assured.

530
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,220
<i>Whether youth was smoke</i>
<i>or a wish fulfilled,</i>

531
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:56,180
<i>all can be redeemed with laughter</i>

532
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,120
<i>Who changed the years</i>

533
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,020
<i>in just a blink?</i>

534
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,040
Cai Fangyuan!

535
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,920
Cai Fangyuan!

536
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,180
Cai Fangyuan.

537
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,800
We…

538
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,040
Shh, I am listening to music.

539
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,020
This is the power of love.

540
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,680
<i>With all my innocence,</i>

541
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,980
<i>I wrote this poem.</i>

542
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,280
<i>If beauty fades too soon,</i>

543
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,380
<i>remember that address</i>

544
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:35,540
<i>where we remain unchanged,</i>

545
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,980
<i>unafraid to disappear.</i>

546
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,680
Right here.

547
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,980
<i>How I wish to wake</i>

548
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,320
<i>with dawn winds soothing every sorrow</i>

549
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,600
<i>How I wish to turn</i>

550
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,600
<i>and find your gaze could melt all frost</i>

551
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,720
<i>How I wish to lift my eyes</i>

552
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,420
<i>to see your smile tomorrow</i>

553
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,620
<i>How I wish you'd</i>

554
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,680
<i>share your joys and pains</i>

555
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,680
<i>How I wish our family's hearts</i>
<i>could beat as one</i>

556
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,000
<i>How I wish each journey</i>

557
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,280
<i>warmed with kindness we'd designed</i>

558
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,720
<i>How I wish the world</i>

559
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,800
<i>returned your dreams when you let go</i>

560
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,200
<i>How I wish you knew</i>

561
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,440
<i>my love still flows</i>

562
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,920
<i>Life must always face the light,</i>

563
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,660
<i>Stumbling, yet standing upright</i>

564
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,040
<i>Count the meteors on your sleeve</i>

565
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,760
<i>I'm here, and never leave</i>

566
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,240
<i>Life must always face the light</i>

567
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,980
<i>Hope grows greater after night</i>

568
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,060
<i>Where the darkness starts to thin</i>

569
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:25,320
<i>Held-out happiness will bloom within</i>

570
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,820
<i>How I wish to wake</i>

571
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,100
<i>with dawn winds soothing every sorrow</i>

572
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,920
<i>How I wish to turn</i>

573
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,200
<i>and find your gaze could melt all frost</i>

574
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,560
<i>How I wish to lift my eyes</i>

575
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,860
<i>to see your smile tomorrow</i>

576
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,120
<i>How I wish you'd</i>

577
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,240
<i>share your joys and pains</i>

578
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,560
If you dare associate with

579
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,080
those people from Qunshan again,

580
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,240
I have ways to make them leave.

581
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,980
<i>Stumbling, yet standing upright</i>

582
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,920
<i>Count the meteors on your sleeve</i>

583
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,280
<i>I'm here, and never leave</i>

584
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,760
<i>Life must always face the light</i>

585
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,500
<i>Hope grows greater after night</i>

586
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,580
<i>Where the darkness starts to thin</i>

587
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:36,840
<i>Held-out happiness will bloom within</i>

588
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,900
Yingtao.

589
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,740
Will Jiang Qiaoxi

590
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,680
ever know you're singing for him?

591
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,840
Yes.

592
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,760
He knows.

593
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,960
Disband!

594
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,520
- Good!
- Okay!

595
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,020
<i>One basketball game?</i>

596
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,640
<i>- I need to put this back.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

597
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,520
Go.

598
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,000
Come on, let's hit the court.

599
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,940
Watch my game.

600
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,960
I won't go with you.

601
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,960
Monthly exams are coming up.
I'm heading back to study.

602
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,260
Then let Cai Fangyuan go with you instead.

603
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,800
He's busy with his grand ambitions.
I gotta go.

604
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,560
Then I'll go back with you.

605
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,800
No need to come back with me.

606
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,440
Go play basketball like you wanted.

607
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,080
It's not like I'll get eaten alive alone.

608
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,180
<i>Where is Yu Qiao? Let's go.</i>

609
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,760
<i>Hurry up. Don't waste time.</i>

610
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,600
<i>We need you to wipe the floor</i>
<i>for Class Six.</i>

611
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,500
Then I'll go?

612
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,900
Off you go.

613
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,040
<i>Come on, Yu Qiao.</i>

614
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,360
<i>- I was not expecting…</i>
<i>- I told her…</i>

615
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,620
<i>You refused?</i>

616
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,280
I'm completely mind-blown.

617
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,500
Lin Qile, I noticed
you struggling in class.

618
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,160
Here's my physics notes.

619
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,040
I just said,

620
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,980
here are my notes.

621
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,500
They're pretty thorough.

622
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,340
If any problems, ask me.

623
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,220
Our monitor is so helpful.

624
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,840
Monitor,

625
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,900
my chemistry's also a disaster.

626
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,760
Mind if I ask you about that too?

627
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,920
Of course.

628
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,500
I'm not exactly a chemistry whiz either,

629
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,540
but if you have any questions,

630
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,420
feel free to ask me.

631
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,480
Yeah, physics is definitely
our monitor's strong suit.

632
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,780
Thank you.

633
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,260
I will ask the teacher
if I have any questions.

634
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,620
Ling Yingtao, you look dead tired.

635
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,500
Robbed a bank last night?

636
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,900
Does stealing light through
a chiseled hole count as burglary?

637
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,280
You stay up late to study?

638
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,400
Too diligent.

639
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,260
Burning the night before exams?

640
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,780
That's not diligence.

641
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,520
That's just last-minute effort.

642
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,460
Physics is brutal.

643
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,340
I've memorized

644
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,020
all the formulas,

645
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,780
but when I actually try solving problems,

646
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,980
I realize that's all I know,
just the formulas.

647
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,120
Quickly!

648
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm coming.

649
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,100
How does Jiang Qiaoxi know everything?

650
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,280
Ling Yingtao.

651
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,960
Don't sell yourself short.

652
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,360
You earned your place
at Jialin Experimental

653
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
from Qunshan No. 1 Middle School
purely on merit.

654
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,960
And physics,

655
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
once it clicks for you,
those problems aren't so hard.

656
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,420
Maybe during today's exam,

657
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,100
you will gain your third-eye power.

658
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,100
Everything will make sense after.

659
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,620
During the last physics quiz break,

660
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,500
who was there to sing

661
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,900
<i>Nunchucks</i> at me for ten minutes?

662
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,500
When I took that test,

663
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,380
I was stuck on that

664
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,620
loop of "hu-hu-ha-hei".

665
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,440
Relax. I promise no antics
this exam season.

666
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,140
Besides, why compare yourself
to Jiang Qiaoxi?

667
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,820
You outshine him in everything else.

668
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,380
Even geniuses have their blind spots.

669
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,700
Listen up, class.

670
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,300
When it comes to math,

671
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,040
formulas are everything.

672
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,620
Memorize them accurately, drill them deep,

673
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,500
burn them into your brains.

674
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,680
Understood?

675
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,700
Yes!

676
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,500
Any questions about

677
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,380
today's formulas?

678
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,080
Raise your hand if any.

679
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,240
Then raise your hand if you get it.

680
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,980
Lin Qile, you've got it?

681
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,420
Got it all?

682
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,180
Come up here.

683
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,220
Solve this problem.

684
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,300
Get it wrong, and you'll be

685
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,340
taking this lesson

686
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,360
on your feet.

687
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
Come here.

688
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,700
Class, solve it on your notebook.

689
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:15,139
Ms, is it right?

690
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,920
Looks like the sun rose
from the west today.

691
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,659
Our class average

692
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,260
might actually improve for once.

693
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,239
Not bad. Go back.

694
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,520
Did everyone get these right?

695
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,900
- Yes!
- Yes!

696
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,780
All correct?

697
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,420
Well done, everyone!

698
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,560
Go.

699
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,820
Have a look.

700
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,040
Aren't you curious?

701
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,440
How'd your English exam go?

702
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,300
Monthly exam results are out.

703
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,880
Check your scores.

704
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,220
Stay humble in victory,
resilient in defeat.

705
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,620
What are you doing?

706
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,780
How was it?

707
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,160
Did I

708
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,340
do badly?

709
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,160
Lin Yingtao,

710
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,000
you are absolute legend.

711
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,540
You ranked 5th in the whole class?

712
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,960
Are you telling the truth?

713
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,100
Why did I lie to you?

714
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,880
I ranked 5th.

715
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,180
I gonna go.

716
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,140
You? What about you?

717
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,340
No beatings for you at home?

718
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,140
I…

719
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,180
I ranked 3rd.

720
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,300
You ranked 3rd?

721
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,500
Since when did you get

722
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,380
so good at exams?

723
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,300
Dead last.

724
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,760
Dead last?

725
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,840
Then my 5th…

726
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,520
You actually thought you'd rank high?

727
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,680
Come on. We're both

728
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,560
bottom-dwellers.

729
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,580
You're just two spots
less pathetic than me.

730
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,540
With scores like yours,

731
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,300
my parents

732
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,180
can't possibly

733
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,480
be too hard on me.

734
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,920
I will be hard on you.

735
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,080
Cai Fangyuan! Why did you lie to me?

736
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,900
Lin Yingtao, hold your fury.

737
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,240
- Even Yu Qiao couldn't escape.
- What's wrong with him?

738
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,700
He ranked 15th from the bottom.

739
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,860
Even he bombed this hard?

740
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,860
Just you wait.

741
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,740
She managed to score high enough

742
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,280
to get into our class before,

743
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,360
it has to be luck.

744
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,680
Exactly!

745
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,700
Who could have good fortune all the time?

746
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,260
Lin Qile spends all her time

747
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,620
with those Qunshan kids.

748
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,020
When exactly is she supposed to study?

749
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,900
Right.

750
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,400
Any cold water?

751
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,220
If you're here to get water,
then get water.

752
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,620
Stop the gossiping.

753
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,640
None of your business.

754
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,660
Yes.

755
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,860
It's none of our business.

756
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,640
None of us have

757
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,860
half of Lin Qile's skills.

758
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,200
First Jiang Qiaoxi,

759
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,340
then Feng Letian,

760
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,660
and now you.

761
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,000
All of you are defending her?

762
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,880
Exactly.

763
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,940
I saw Cai Fangyuan

764
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,240
fooling around with her

765
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,360
on the field just now.

766
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,680
You don't know this?

767
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,280
Jia Sisi, keep it civil.

768
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,580
- I'm uncivil?
- You say it again…

769
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,780
What are you doing?

770
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,600
How can you talk like that?

771
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,700
<i>- I will tell Ms.</i>
- She's a girl.

772
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,640
Why so harsh?

773
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,120
<i>He tried to hit me.</i>

774
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,020
Yu Qiao.

775
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,360
You used to have such good grades.

776
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,060
Hang around Lin Qile

777
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,340
and suddenly you're this rank?

778
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,640
- I didn't become this.
<i>- He tried to hit me.</i>

779
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,780
I chose it.

780
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,460
I want this ranking.

781
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,880
We've played basketball for ages.

782
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,900
Let me tell you.

783
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,400
Lin Qile isn't someone to mess with.

784
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,240
Let me tell you too.
Stop talking nonsense.

785
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,620
This Lin Qile

786
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,480
really does have some kind of magic.

787
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,220
- Feng Letian treats her like royalty.
<i>- Yu Qiao.</i>

788
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,580
- Yu Qiao tanks his grades for her.
<i>- You did good before this year.</i>

789
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,500
- Jiang Qiaoxi asked her to fetch water.
<i>- I haven't talked to you for the scores.</i>

790
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,020
I am not following this at all.

791
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,460
- What's wrong with these guys?
<i>- You're practically an adult.</i>

792
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,260
<i>Still solve problems with fists?</i>

793
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,860
Are you not ashamed?

794
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,900
Huang Zhanjie,

795
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,620
words can cut deeper

796
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,980
than fists.

797
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,920
Ever thought about that?

798
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,340
Ms. He.

799
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,300
It's not just me saying this.

800
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,720
Everyone's talking.

801
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,760
Does everyone's words

802
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,640
make it true?

803
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,780
Don't blindly follow the crowd.

804
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,220
If you want to know someone,

805
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,140
you need to learn and understand.

806
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,340
You can't define a person with hearsay.

807
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,300
From now on,
if I catch anyone forming cliques

808
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,340
and gossiping behind backs,

809
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,860
Class 18 won't have them.

810
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,600
Listen carefully.

811
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,540
Wherever you go in life,

812
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,100
you'll always be under
someone's gaze and judgment.

813
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,560
The person you see from other's eyes

814
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,820
isn't the real you.

815
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,540
Even the person you see in your own eyes

816
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,220
isn't the real you.

817
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,740
But the way you see others

818
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,520
is a truthful reflection

819
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,540
of who you really are.

820
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,940
Ms seems very angry.

821
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,880
Let's go.

822
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,040
Lin Qile, don't be nervous.

823
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,280
When we get to the office,

824
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,280
just explain calmly.

825
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,160
Ms. He is really kind.

826
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,280
She won't give you a hard time.

827
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,720
If you need me, I can come in with you

828
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,600
and help explain.

829
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,860
No need, Monitor.

830
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,800
I've got this.

831
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,480
Take it up for me.

832
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,660
<i>Words from your classmates.</i>

833
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,620
<i>Does it affect you?</i>

834
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,580
No? Really?

835
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,120
From now on,

836
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,020
try spending more time with the girls.

837
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,660
If you only hang out

838
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,740
with boys,

839
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,320
it's bound to raise eyebrows,

840
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,080
and it doesn't look good either.

841
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,900
Ms. He.

842
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,320
Cai Fangyuan,

843
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,420
Yu Qiao and others.

844
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,120
They are first my best friends,

845
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,380
then male classmates.

846
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,240
I don't think I've done anything wrong,

847
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,360
so I don't care how others see me.

848
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,380
But they are my close friends.

849
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,740
I have no reason to

850
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,280
distance myself from them.

851
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,760
Right now, your top priority

852
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,300
is to focus on studys.

853
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,860
Staying in Class 18
at Jialin Experimental isn't easy.

854
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,000
If you keep ranking low
in the monthly exams,

855
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,200
you'll get kicked out

856
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,980
by next semester.

857
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,280
Making good friends

858
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,140
doesn't go against my principles

859
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,100
or

860
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,660
against school rules.

861
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,780
But if

862
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,880
poor grades mean
getting removed out of Class 18,

863
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,140
if that is the policy…

864
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,120
I'll follow.

865
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,640
I'll study hard

866
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,540
to stay in the class.

867
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,920
Facing challenges

868
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,180
isn't about empty slogans,

869
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,180
it takes real work.

870
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,740
Since you're within the bottom 15th
of the class,

871
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,800
we'll have a half-day

872
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,860
tutoring on Saturdays.

873
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:48,960
Better make it count.

874
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:13,620
