00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,420
ROUTE K1, SMOOTH TRAVELS WITH HONGYANG BUS

2
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,580
Qin Yeyun!

3
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,560
Qin Yeyun!

4
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,520
What are you yelling for?
You're embarrassing me, Lin Yingtao.

5
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,660
It really is you!

6
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,220
I didn't recognize you

7
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,820
at first from across the way.

8
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,160
I didn't recognize you either.

9
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,160
You've changed a lot.

10
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,020
Let's go.

11
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,220
STUDENT CAFETERIA

12
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,260
<i>I'll put this down.</i>

13
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,800
Your university's cafeteria food

14
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,680
is somehow even worse

15
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,740
than our old cafeteria.

16
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,860
So salty. How do you eat this?

17
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,880
I'm used to it.

18
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,320
It's not just our cafeteria.

19
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,740
Everything in Hongyang is salty.

20
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,160
When I first moved here,
my senior told me,

21
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,160
"Hongyang's best food places?

22
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,480
Just one tip.

23
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,860
Hop on the bus Route 12,

24
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,000
get on the metro, take the airport line,

25
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,640
then get a ticket

26
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,440
and fly to Guangzhou."

27
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,060
Yu Qiao doesn't take you out

28
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,340
to eat better stuff?

29
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,300
If I wanted good food,
I wouldn't rely on him.

30
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Besides,

31
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,560
his cafeteria's worse than ours.

32
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,700
Slow down.

33
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,180
Have you noticed?

34
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,800
Everyone's staring at you.

35
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,580
Big star.

36
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,540
Big deal. So they looked at me.

37
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,280
These guys at your university.

38
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,840
None of them cares about appearances.

39
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,620
None to clap my eyes on.

40
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,320
You haven't told me

41
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,860
why you came to Hongyang.

42
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,100
Not even a heads-up.

43
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,240
Is this a surprise for me?

44
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,220
Really?

45
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,680
Yeah right.
You think you're that important?

46
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,480
So…

47
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,380
you came to see Yu Qiao?

48
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,780
What are you talking about?

49
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,720
We're in college now. We've moved on.

50
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,080
Then why are you here?

51
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,980
Don't tell me you came all the way

52
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,660
to Hongyang just to shop?

53
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,100
Not just shopping.

54
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,560
I'm restocking for my e-commerce store.

55
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,900
Give me your bag.

56
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,680
No thanks, I'll carry it.

57
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,840
You're carrying too much.

58
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,960
I'm not trying to help you carry it.

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,020
I'm making the bag look fuller.

60
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,000
The shop owners will think

61
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,400
I'm a big buyer for bulk purchases.

62
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,400
That way can I get more bargains.

63
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,720
Also,

64
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,600
if I don't get the price I want,

65
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,520
I'll give you a signal,
then you drag me away.

66
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,000
The seller'll definitely try to keep me.

67
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,800
And if they don't?

68
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,020
Trust me.

69
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,340
I've been selling stuff for years.

70
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,540
I know how this game works.

71
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,400
Just count to ten.

72
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,300
They'll stop us before you get to one.

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,240
Fine.

74
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,060
Excuse me, I'll take ten pieces.

75
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,940
30 yuan, okay?

76
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,520
Girl, why don't you ask for free, okay?

77
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,220
Come on, I'm running an online shop.

78
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,620
Let's just call this
a first-time connection.

79
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,040
If my shop takes off,

80
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,240
I'll be back often.

81
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,140
It's a small business.

82
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,280
I really can't go any lower.

83
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,200
Seems a bit steep, Miss Qin.

84
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,460
Should we check out someone else's booth?

85
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,840
Might find a better deal.

86
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,500
SMALL BUSINESS, NO HAGGLING
FROM 50 YUAN, NO REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES

87
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,440
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

88
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,140
five, four, three, two, one.

89
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,900
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six…

90
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,960
Ma'am, how about we try one more time?

91
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,240
Ma'am, can you please

92
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,840
lower the price a bit more?

93
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,800
We're just

94
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,740
starting out.

95
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,100
It's not easy. Please?

96
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,840
You're so pretty,

97
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,520
and you've got such a kind heart.

98
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,120
Tell you what,

99
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,240
go get yourselves a couple cold drinks.

100
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,880
Cheers.

101
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,340
This isn't just soda.

102
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,960
This is the sweet taste of victory.

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,740
Your reward for helping me out.

104
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,680
And you've got to

105
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,920
carry that bag back for me.

106
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,560
Let me call Yu Qiao then.

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,780
Lin Yingtao, don't even
think about bailing.

108
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,240
I'm not bailing.

109
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Since you're here,
the three of us should have dinner.

110
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,820
I didn't come here to see him.

111
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,820
I didn't tell him I came.

112
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,320
Why not?

113
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,140
Did you two fight?

114
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,440
No.

115
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,180
Then why avoid him?

116
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,300
Because

117
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,280
I'm seeing someone.

118
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,860
Wait, what?

119
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,140
When did that happen?

120
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,920
Why didn't you tell me? Who is it?

121
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,260
A few months ago.

122
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,940
He's a classmate.

123
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,840
Helped me a lot

124
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,580
when I was starting the shop.

125
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,620
We clicked. And it just kind of happened.

126
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,540
He's nothing special.

127
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,340
I didn't think it was worth mentioning.

128
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,140
Not worth mentioning?

129
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,260
It's your first relationship.

130
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,200
That's huge.

131
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,420
Can't believe you didn't tell me.

132
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,300
That's so not cool.

133
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,000
If I made a million,

134
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,420
I'd tell you first thing.

135
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,440
Now that's big news.

136
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,240
Dating?

137
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,240
Not a big deal.

138
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,700
Just means there's a guy around

139
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,200
who's a little more special

140
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,720
than the rest.

141
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,180
Is it really that simple?

142
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,600
You want it to be complicated?

143
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,440
Most people's relationships
start out just like that.

144
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,760
It's only yours

145
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,440
where the guy disappeared

146
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,400
without a trace.

147
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,320
Like smoke. Gone.

148
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,440
Why are you bringing him up?

149
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,760
Lin Yingtao,

150
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,960
who's Jiang Qiaoxi?

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,360
That name doesn't

152
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,580
ring a single bell.

153
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,919
Is he a figment of your imagination?

154
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,600
Qin Yeyun,

155
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,020
you're living proof

156
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,340
that people never change.

157
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,720
Same little devil as ever.

158
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,240
Such a mean girl.

159
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,940
- So mean.
- What is it?

160
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,880
Look.

161
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,760
Speak of the devil,

162
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,680
Yu Qiao just texted me.

163
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,220
What'd he say?

164
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,980
Why are you so nervous?

165
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,500
I'm only asking because
you look like something's up.

166
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,400
He said he's got something

167
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,320
for me.

168
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,880
But he's being all formal

169
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,120
- about it.
- <i>Yingtao, I've got something for you.</i>

170
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,000
<i>Are you free at five?</i>

171
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,200
<i>Meet me at your campus gate.</i>

172
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,060
Well… then go.

173
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,680
I'm not in a hurry.

174
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,860
I'll help carry

175
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,920
your stuff back first.

176
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,060
It's just some clothes.
Not even that heavy.

177
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,620
I'll grab a cab.

178
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,540
I booked a room in the hotel
near your campus.

179
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,540
You can swing by after.

180
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,200
Why'd you get a hotel?

181
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,580
Come back and stay with me.

182
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,560
I'll talk to my roommates.
We'll just share my bed.

183
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,220
They let friends do that all the time.

184
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,700
Nah.

185
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,940
I wanted to talk to you tonight.

186
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,820
Easier to chat outside.

187
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,800
Sure you don't wanna come?

188
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,860
Save some money.

189
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,700
Stop nagging.

190
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,560
- Hurry up and go.
- You…

191
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,700
Just go.

192
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,660
Go on.

193
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,240
Alright, I'll call you later.

194
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,120
Okay.

195
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,740
Go.

196
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,780
Yu Qiao.

197
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,100
What's this?

198
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,420
Glad you got here in time.

199
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,080
The cake hasn't melted.

200
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,200
You messaged me

201
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,080
just to give me cake?

202
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,320
I saw

203
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,660
this rabbit-shaped one.

204
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,740
So I bought it for you.

205
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,360
Seriously,

206
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,920
you two are being so weird today.

207
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,260
We two? Who is the other person?

208
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,380
Just tell me.

209
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,600
Did something happen?

210
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,900
Yingtao,

211
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,140
how much have you saved

212
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,060
from tutoring?

213
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,100
I knew it.

214
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,360
You're here to borrow money.

215
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,860
No wonder

216
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,040
you wanted to meet up
and even brought me cake.

217
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,440
Are you here to borrow money?

218
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,980
- So will you lend it to me?
- Nope.

219
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,820
We've known each other for years.

220
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,200
Do you really have to be this cold?

221
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,860
It's not cold.

222
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,800
It's called having sense.

223
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,760
Think about it.
If you needed serious money,

224
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,960
you'd go to Auntie Zhang Ping,

225
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,100
not me.

226
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,940
And if it's not serious?

227
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,860
Then I've got stuff to pay for.

228
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,500
My money's not lying around.

229
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,440
Right,

230
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,100
you're saving up

231
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,920
for plane tickets to every corner
of the globe.

232
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,560
Big plans.

233
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,160
Here. Take your cake.

234
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,080
I'm heading off.

235
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,640
Yu Qiao.

236
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,460
If you really want

237
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,680
a pair of Ray-Bans,

238
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
no need to borrow from me.

239
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,620
I'm going to Hong Kong this summer.

240
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,540
I'll bring you a pair.

241
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,080
For your birthday.

242
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
You're going to Hong Kong?

243
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,080
Do you know exactly where he is?

244
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,220
No.

245
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,820
But

246
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,920
I've gotta try.

247
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,940
Do you know

248
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,980
which pair of Ray-Bans…

249
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,560
I want?

250
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,000
You've talked about them nonstop.
How could I not know?

251
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,640
The ones from that poster in your room.

252
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,700
The pilot ones.

253
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,040
Then when I go somewhere,

254
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
I'll bring you gifts too.

255
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,000
Don't bother.

256
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,220
You don't even know what I like.

257
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,460
Of course I do.

258
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,080
Hey.

259
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,100
That looks heavy. Want a hand?

260
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,140
No thanks, I'm good.

261
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,980
Not sure what perfume that is,

262
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,820
but it smells amazing.

263
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,260
HAPPY STRAW HAT BAKERY

264
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,240
Hi there, what can I get for you?

265
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,520
You got any more of those bunny cakes?

266
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,200
Just one small one left.

267
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,880
Perfect. Wrap it up for me,

268
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,780
thanks.

269
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,820
Sure thing.

270
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,220
Qin Yeyun!

271
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,960
- Qin Yeyun!
- I heard you. Stop yelling already.

272
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,940
SHANGKEYOU HOTEL, 348 XINHUA STREET

273
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,820
Come on, let's go in.

274
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,540
What?

275
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,700
You are graduating in two years.

276
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,120
What's that supposed to mean?

277
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,720
You're acting way too chill.

278
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,160
You didn't…

279
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,160
Not what?

280
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,900
No, nothing happened.

281
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,520
Good.

282
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,800
Don't look.

283
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,120
But listen, if something does happen,

284
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,380
you better tell me.

285
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,040
No more keeping it to yourself

286
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,280
like you did with your boyfriend.

287
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,960
If you're not with me,

288
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,660
you'll be the first person I call.

289
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,160
Sure.

290
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,580
And same goes for you.

291
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,820
Wherever I am, call me.

292
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,640
Slowly.

293
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,980
Make a wish.

294
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
Cheers.

295
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,800
Let's do this.

296
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,680
Open it.

297
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,400
Seriously?

298
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,280
In Hongyang,

299
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,740
out of all the bakeries

300
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,920
and all the cakes,

301
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,520
you two managed to buy two cakes

302
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,580
of the the exact same shape?

303
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,599
I'll eat the one you got me.

304
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,579
He came all this way

305
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,359
just to give you a cake?

306
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,099
That's what he said.

307
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,260
But honestly, he was acting weird today.

308
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,260
I actually thought he was
going to ask me for money.

309
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,220
He's trying to get on your good side.

310
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,580
I don't think so.

311
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,700
Lin Yingtao,

312
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,100
don't worry about me.

313
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,420
I've got a boyfriend now.

314
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,360
You think I'm the type
who'd date two people at once?

315
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,240
Of course not.

316
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,980
You're the most honest,
loyal, and decent person I know.

317
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,300
Lin Yingtao,

318
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,000
have you ever really
thought about your future?

319
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,220
My future?

320
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,300
Well…

321
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,740
I want to be someone with dreams,

322
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,800
ambition, and someone
who contributes to society.

323
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,300
Why the deep question？

324
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,180
Lately, when I'm running my shop

325
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,540
or sorting out inventory,

326
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,980
there are times I just want to give up.

327
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,560
But whenever I get to that point,

328
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
I try to imagine

329
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,500
if I had a daughter one day,

330
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,820
what kind of mom would she hope I'd be?

331
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,220
She'd want me to be rich, ideally.

332
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,460
Strong, too.

333
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,240
So yeah, whenever I feel like
I can't go on,

334
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,840
I just remind myself

335
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,760
I want to be someone
my future daughter would be proud of.

336
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,880
And that thought alone
gets me through anything.

337
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,140
Yingtao,

338
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,880
in that future you picture,

339
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,420
does it have to be Jiang Qiaoxi?

340
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,440
The same

341
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,360
Jiang Qiaoxi

342
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,560
who never tells you the truth,

343
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
just leaves you

344
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,780
with one perfect lie

345
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,560
and vanishes without a trace?

346
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,060
Why not Yu Qiao?

347
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,280
What are you talking about?

348
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,920
I've been here this whole time.

349
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,980
No one sees you like I do.

350
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,660
You only started sighing

351
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,100
after you met Jiang Qiaoxi.

352
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,380
I'm not

353
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,900
as strong as you think.

354
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,660
Sometimes I wish…

355
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,240
I hadn't fallen for him.

356
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,780
I wish I'd liked someone else instead.

357
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,920
But that's where my thoughts stop.

358
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,300
Because in the future I imagined,

359
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,060
there just wasn't a version
without Jiang Qiaoxi in it.

360
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,680
I told you before.

361
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,120
Sometimes I feel like…

362
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,620
he and I are the same person.

363
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,320
So looking for him feels like

364
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,620
reaching myself.

365
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,760
Lin Yingtao,

366
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,700
how are you two even alike?

367
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,020
He's so selfish.

368
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,360
He left you hanging for two years

369
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,940
without a word.

370
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,680
You weren't even officially dating.

371
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,620
But every time

372
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,080
I think about what he said
the night he left…

373
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,760
The look on his face.

374
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,760
The glint in his eyes.

375
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,360
I can feel what he was feeling.

376
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,140
If my pain right now

377
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,800
is a ten, or a hundred,

378
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,140
his must've been a thousand,
maybe ten thousand.

379
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,580
I need to know

380
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,040
what happened to Jiang Qiaoxi right after

381
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,340
he finally got his freedom.

382
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,480
It has nothing to do with
how he treated me.

383
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,420
And it's not about

384
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,120
whether we were a couple.

385
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,200
He's just

386
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,720
really important to me.

387
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,460
Yingtao,

388
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,120
you're such an idiot sometimes.

389
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,500
How am I an idiot?

390
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,560
I got a daughter before you did, didn't I?

391
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,640
Jiang Chunlu.

392
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,180
Cake time.

393
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,580
Come on.

394
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,060
Sure you don't want me to come?

395
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,720
Can you carry all that by yourself?

396
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,020
Relax.

397
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,500
I've got it.

398
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,840
Alright.

399
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,340
I'm heading out.

400
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,820
Text me when you get there,

401
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,880
- so I know you're safe.
- Mm.

402
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,300
Bye now.

403
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,400
Wait, Yingtao.

404
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,700
Having second thoughts?

405
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,680
Actually,

406
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,680
Jiang Qiaoxi…

407
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,540
What about him?

408
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,360
What is it?

409
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,320
Okay, so these might not be fancy brands,

410
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,820
but they're all really good.

411
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,180
Maybe you should learn your makeups.

412
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,860
Don’t let it be a situation that you look

413
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,020
all worn out waiting for him.

414
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,000
If you're giving all this to me,

415
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,280
what are you gonna use?

416
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,600
I bought these for you in the first place.

417
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,920
Thought you might turn them down.

418
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,800
Come on, pack them up.

419
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,400
Throw them in your bag.

420
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,700
Jeez.

421
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,480
Thank you.

422
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,160
Why are you even thanking me?

423
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,540
Promise me you'll visit often.

424
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,420
I will.

425
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,220
I'm heading back.

426
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,460
Take care, okay?

427
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,240
Hey, fancy seeing you again.

428
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,580
I'm not sure we know each other.

429
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,480
I am not from your uni.

430
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,960
Then what are you doing
at our basketball court?

431
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,100
What,

432
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,860
you guys charge admission
for basketball court?

433
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,860
You here to check tickets?

434
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,440
So you looking for someone?

435
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,840
Who are you here for? Maybe I know them.

436
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,760
You've got thousands of students.

437
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,880
What are the odds?

438
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,620
Wait… You're not here
to find your boyfriend, are you?

439
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,480
I don't have a boyfriend.

440
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,980
No way. For real?

441
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,140
Why would I lie?

442
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,240
Well, my lucks.

443
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,420
I do like someone though.

444
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,360
Oh, is that it?

445
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,600
He used to play basketball all the time.

446
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,420
Every time I passed the court,

447
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,060
I'd glance over to see if he was there.

448
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,140
Just one glance.

449
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,980
But I never stopped walking.

450
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,100
I didn't want him to know I was watching.

451
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,780
Wouldn't it be better if he did?

452
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,900
Most of us guys are out here playing

453
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,980
just for the girls to watch.

454
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,980
It wouldn't.

455
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,300
Because the guy I like

456
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,700
already likes someone else.

457
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,580
And that someone is my best friend.

458
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,580
Whoa, that's messy.

459
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,260
That's not even the half of it.

460
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,760
My best friend's crush

461
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,820
suddenly vanished.

462
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,100
But the thing is

463
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,960
I know where he went.

464
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,320
But I never told her.

465
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,020
To get back at her?

466
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,220
No, never.

467
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,080
That guy keeps hurting her.

468
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,120
I just didn't want her to hurt anymore.

469
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,540
And I want my best friend

470
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,040
to end up with the person I like.

471
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,760
So I told her I was seeing someone.

472
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,300
That way she wouldn't feel bad about me.

473
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,000
But what about you?

474
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,740
You keep looking out

475
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,340
for everyone else.

476
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,380
Doesn't it

477
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,420
wear you down?

478
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,020
Alright, let's drop it.

479
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,920
I'm leaving. Bye.

480
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,540
Hey, girl.

481
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,840
The way you think about others

482
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,720
like that

483
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,660
is seriously impressive.

484
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,140
You've got a heart of gold.

485
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,740
Thanks.

486
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,660
Thank you for saying that.
It makes me happy.

487
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,160
<i>Hi, I'm a friend of your tutor.</i>

488
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
<i>Would it be okay</i>

489
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,200
<i>if you shared</i>

490
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,460
<i>his contact with me?</i>

491
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,060
Qiao, I'm taking my hairspray back.

492
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,800
What now?

493
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
Feeling yourself again?

494
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,640
Not exactly.

495
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,440
Met a girl today. Gorgeous.

496
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,620
Totally love-struck.

497
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,460
No idea what kind of guy she's into,

498
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,580
but he's gotta be blind.

499
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,680
She's stunning.

500
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,100
How could he not like her?

501
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,280
And what's that got to do
with you spraying hairspray?

502
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,980
I was thinking,

503
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,180
if I bump into her again,

504
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,840
I wanna show up looking sharp.

505
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,420
<i>I can show you my ID.</i>

506
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,780
<i>And if you're still unsure,</i>

507
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,880
<i>we can meet up too.</i>

508
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,720
Am I seeing this right, Qiao?

509
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,180
You're online-dating a girl
from Hong Kong?

510
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,940
Yeah.

511
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,320
As soon as my Exit-Entry Permit is ready,

512
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,740
I'm going to see her.

513
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,600
Qiao,

514
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,400
you can't be serious.

515
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,540
Aren't you afraid your miss
from Normal Uni will snap?

516
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,940
She won't.

517
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,380
This is my ID.

518
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,060
This one's my Exit-Entry Permit.

519
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,160
Here's my high school diploma.

520
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,360
I graduated from
Jialin Experimental High School

521
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,820
Yes. That's the same school
Mr. Jiang went to.

522
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,900
And this is my university student ID.

523
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,300
Northern Aviation University,

524
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,500
Flight Academy.

525
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,200
See the stamp? It's real.

526
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,620
Flight Academy?

527
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,820
So you're gonna be a pilot?

528
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,680
That's the plan.

529
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,600
You already told me

530
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,520
all this when we were

531
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,460
chatting on MSN.

532
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,800
But

533
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,060
you still haven't said

534
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,600
why are you trying to find Mr. Jiang?

535
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,760
He's my friend.

536
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,980
And someone I like

537
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,880
really cares about him.

538
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,860
So I need to know where he is.

539
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,640
Okay. Let me think.

540
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,780
I know where Mr. Jiang lives,

541
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,320
but my parents told me not to tell anyone.

542
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,420
Still, I'll tell you.

543
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,060
- Thanks.
- Not because you convinced me.

544
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,020
I just think

545
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,460
Mr. Jiang's pretty handsome.

546
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,300
But

547
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,960
every time he comes over for tutoring,

548
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,260
he always looks kind of down.

549
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,840
If he knew a friend

550
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,060
was looking for him,

551
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,080
he might cheer up a little.

552
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,520
Why are you smiling?

553
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,780
I was smiling because

554
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,340
Jiang Qiaoxi's really lucky.

555
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,540
Always got someone looking out for him.

556
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,200
ROUTE 12A, CITYBUS

557
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,380
WEST WING, FORTUNE MANSION

558
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,180
ELEVATOR

559
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,220
<i>Who plays like that?</i>

560
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,820
<i>You're unreal, man.</i>

561
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,580
<i>- Whoa.</i>
<i>- That's crazy.</i>

562
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:25,500
<i>Not you again! You've taken everything…</i>

563
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,720
…even my boxers.

564
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,580
Still not done?

565
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm out.

566
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,340
Useless. Didn't even back me up.

567
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,280
Yu Qiao?

568
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,060
What brings you here?

569
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,400
Jiang Qiaoxi.

570
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,520
- Your friend?
- Yeah.

571
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,800
Pull up a chair then.

572
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,780
He's not playing.

573
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,880
Let's step outside.

574
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,840
Looks like he's staying.

575
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,500
Scoot over.

576
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,720
Make room for him.

577
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,620
Come on.

578
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,420
Let's play.

579
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,500
Let's start.

580
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,020
Alright…

581
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,080
No money,

582
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,540
winner buys dinner.

583
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,300
- Alright.
- Put it away.

584
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,780
Okay.

585
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,280
You go first.

586
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,660
I'm in.

587
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,600
Your turn.

588
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,280
My turn.

589
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,720
Call.

590
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,340
Call.

591
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,080
Call.

592
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,060
Call.

593
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,480
I'm folding.

594
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,340
New guy.

595
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,260
All in.

596
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,480
Bold move.

597
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,800
I'm out.

598
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,360
I finally see you fold.

599
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,120
Not bad.

600
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,920
Dude, your friend's got your streak too.

601
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,800
He bluffed you, man.

602
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,960
I seriously thought he had a full house

603
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,900
to go all in like that.

604
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,720
Sneakier than you are.

605
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,440
I wasn't bluffing.

606
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,420
Never played play Texas Hold'em.

607
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,800
Then why'd you go all in?

608
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,220
Respect.

609
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,440
Let's run it back.

610
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,200
Next time.

611
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,140
Hey, don't bail.

612
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,820
- One more game.
- I said next time.

613
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,420
Hot pot's calling.

614
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,520
Don't be late.

615
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,280
How'd you find me?

616
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,520
That student you tutor?

617
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,700
She took your photo and posted it.

618
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,460
I recognized you.

619
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,740
Does Yingtao know?

620
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,300
If she did,

621
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,080
you think I'd be the one here?

622
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,860
So

623
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,560
you ghosted everyone

624
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,320
just to come hide out and play poker?

625
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,300
Just killing time.

626
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,240
Right.

627
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,980
Mr. Math Genius.

628
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,720
No one beats you

629
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,140
at odds or strategy.

630
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,500
You just did.

631
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,880
Only because you folded too fast.

632
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,160
So, how've you been?

633
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,700
Cut it out.

634
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,080
You want to know
how Yingtao's doing, don't you?

635
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,940
She's not great.

636
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,880
She pretends everything's normal,

637
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,160
but she's been grinding hard.

638
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,560
Tutoring nonstop,

639
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,100
saving every penny.

640
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,940
She says no matter where you are,

641
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,100
she will find you.

642
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,700
I know.

643
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,700
She…

644
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,100
She keeps messaging me.

645
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,700
I'm scared she'll call,

646
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,400
so

647
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,640
I usually turn off my phone.

648
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,040
Only around four or five in the morning

649
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,660
do I turn it on

650
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,340
to check if she wrote anything.

651
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,020
And you think showing me your soft side

652
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,560
is going to change anything?

653
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,160
Why haven't you told Yingtao?

654
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,040
You know

655
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,660
if you just sent her one message,

656
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,880
she'd feel so much better.

657
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,080
You've seen it for yourself.

658
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,520
Look at me.

659
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,000
Look at how I'm living right now.

660
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,940
Am I in any position

661
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,080
to be with Yingtao?

662
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,360
What are you talking about?

663
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,060
You missing an arm? Missing a leg?

664
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,280
What kind of life are you living?

665
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,040
Are you starving? Homeless?

666
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,220
Not that bad.

667
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,880
But it's not great either.

668
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,420
Jiang Qiaoxi,

669
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,640
what's really going on?

670
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,300
If you don't say, I won't ask.

671
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,100
But you seriously think

672
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,340
You think the way you are now
is the reason between you two?

673
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,540
It is me…

674
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,180
I am the reason between us.

675
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,640
