OUR GENERATION

00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,200
EPISODE 2

3
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,440
Lin Qile.

4
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,540
What were you dreaming about during class?

5
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,400
Yingtao, wipe the drool off your desk.

6
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,660
Lin Qile.

7
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,060
Lin Qile.

8
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,200
Lin Qile.

9
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,860
Wake up.

10
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,800
What's going on?

11
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,220
Ms. Wang wants you in the office.

12
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,660
Your mom's here.

13
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,880
Lin Qile's mom,

14
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,340
you really need to pay attention to her.

15
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,000
She's got potential.

16
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
But her mind just isn't on her studies.

17
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,280
She's already in Year 10.

18
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,180
School started long ago.

19
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,560
The college entrance exam is near.

20
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,820
She's still writing letters during class.

21
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
Several teachers have brought it up.

22
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,760
Students at this age

23
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,020
don't have much self-discipline.

24
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,580
Parents need to take more responsibility.

25
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,100
You're absolutely right.

26
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,760
Thank you for taking care of her,
now and in the future.

27
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,440
I'll head out now.

28
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,800
Of course.

29
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,220
Let's stay in touch.

30
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,040
- No need to walk me out, Ms. Wang.
- Alright then.

31
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,940
- Thank you.
- Sure.

32
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,280
Come on, let's go.

33
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,540
Yingtao, if you really want to
keep writing letters,

34
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,040
then write them at home.

35
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,240
I don't think writing letters is wrong,

36
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,640
but doing it in class

37
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,520
makes it harder for teachers
to manage the room.

38
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,160
Mom…

39
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,160
Am I…

40
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,740
a weird kid?

41
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,180
Why do I always make you and Dad worry?

42
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,880
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

43
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,899
You should be

44
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,060
with your friends.

45
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,820
But instead you're stuck out here,
alone in Qunshan.

46
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,320
What are you talking about?

47
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,020
I'm not alone.

48
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,280
I have you. I have Dad.

49
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,280
I have this town with mountains.

50
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,680
I don't think I could ever leave you two.

51
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,840
I want to stay and
be the last guardian of Qunshan.

52
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,540
- Really?
- Really.

53
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,300
Yingtao.

54
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,000
You're growing up.

55
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,920
It is a process of
stepping out of your old shell.

56
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,460
If you keep locking yourself in the past,

57
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,460
you'll suffocate.

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,200
People move on.

59
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,960
Feelings move on too.

60
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,800
If you keep clinging to the past,
to what's already gone,

61
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,080
of course you'll feel stuck.

62
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,080
But if someone…

63
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,660
can just let the past go,

64
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,660
like none of it ever happened…

65
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,820
doesn't that mean they're

66
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,860
better off now?

67
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,680
I don't know about other people…

68
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,780
But I know

69
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,340
you're not okay right now.

70
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,980
Those letters

71
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,060
will only make it when they are delivered.

72
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,180
JIANG QIAOXI, HOW'S YOUR DAY?

73
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,420
If you keep it here…

74
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,500
JIANG QIAOXI, IT'S YINGTAO.

75
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,560
…it just weighs you down.

76
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,320
I'M IN YEAR 7 NOW.

77
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,000
AND YOU? DO YOU LIKE IT THERE?

78
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,640
Jiang Qiaoxi.

79
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,700
The construction site's almost done.

80
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,800
Those three water towers
don't light up at night anymore.

81
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,120
Sometimes I wonder… if you ever
come back to Qunshan at night,

82
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,640
and you don't see those lights,

83
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,700
will you lose your way?

84
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,860
JIANG QIAOXI, THE CHERRY SAGE IS SO SWEET.

85
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,080
Jiang Qiaoxi.

86
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,280
The cherry sage is so sweet.

87
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,180
Every time I eat it,
I want to save some for you.

88
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,160
IF WE EVER MEET AGAIN…

89
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,400
If we ever

90
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,540
meet again in the summer,

91
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,580
I'll bring some with me when I see you.

92
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,100
Jiang Qiaoxi.

93
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,880
It's been five years.

94
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,420
How have you been?

95
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,840
Chunlu passed away

96
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,840
not long ago.

97
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,080
Remember what we said about it,

98
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,480
that she was your daughter?

99
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,600
So I thought I should let you know.

100
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,280
I buried her on that mountaintop
where we used to watch the sunset.

101
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,520
You were those glowing clouds.

102
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,880
This way,

103
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,280
she can always be with you.

104
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,740
Hello? Who is it?

105
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,840
Lin Yingtao, it's me,

106
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
Qin Yeyun?

107
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,900
You're calling early. What's wrong?

108
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,960
Lin Yingtao.

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,720
Did you send Jiang Qiaoxi

110
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,720
another long letter?

111
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,860
How'd you know?

112
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,380
I told you, stop contacting him.

113
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,380
Why?

114
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,080
He…

115
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,940
He was busy again?

116
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,640
Not have time to read a single letter?

117
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,900
Who cares if he's busy?

118
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,560
He's moved on. So should you.

119
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,000
Stop thinking about him.

120
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,299
Don't even mention his name.

121
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,860
Tell her the truth! She can't…

122
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,419
What truth?

123
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,200
Qin Yeyun, what's going on?

124
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,360
Did something happen?

125
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,740
Don't ask.

126
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,480
Just don't reach out to him again.
You can't.

127
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,380
Wait, you…

128
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,120
KING LONG COACH

129
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,740
Jiang Qiaoxi!

130
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,440
- Jiang Qiaoxi!
- Jiang Qiaoxi!

131
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,640
Jiang Qiaoxi!

132
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,740
Please write to me!

133
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,440
You must write to me.

134
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,520
Yingtao!

135
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,120
I'll be back after winter break!

136
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,060
Yingtao!

137
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,460
I'll be back after winter break!

138
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,000
I know.

139
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,080
No matter how brave I am,

140
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,300
I'll never grow wings.

141
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,140
Girl. Girl.

142
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,000
Are you carsick?

143
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,560
Here, orange peel helps.

144
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,640
- Try it.
- Thanks…

145
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,320
JIALIN

146
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,720
What is this place?

147
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,020
BUS STATION

148
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,660
BUS MAP

149
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,200
JIALIN EXPERIMENTAL MIDDLE SCHOOL

150
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,860
- Hey, did you hear?
- Jiang Qiaoxi

151
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,440
really used to live in Qunshan.

152
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,880
I thought he went to elementary school
in Hong Kong.

153
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,480
Now it's Qunshan? Which is it?

154
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,920
I'm not really sure…

155
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,340
Someone said a girl sent him a letter.

156
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,960
And you're all just passing it around?

157
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,860
Aren't you worried he'll be mad?

158
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,620
Who knows?

159
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,120
Yu Qiao and Fei Linge
were fighting over it in class earlier.

160
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,500
I heard he transferred from Hong Kong to
No. 1 Experimental Primary in first grade.

161
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,740
Fei Linge and Cen Xiaoman
were in that same class back then.

162
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,440
Right, they used to study together.

163
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,960
They were close friends.

164
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,460
BUILD A BETTER LIFE TOGETHER

165
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,360
LET CIVILITY GUIDE OUR WORDS AND DEEDS

166
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,540
JIALIN EXPERIMENTAL MIDDLE SCHOOL

167
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,080
LIVE WITH HONOR, LEARN WITH HEART

168
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,600
Yu Qiao!

169
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,420
What's wrong?

170
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,380
I think I heard someone
calling Yu Qiao at school.

171
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,820
- Who?
- A girl.

172
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,000
Sounded just like Yingtao.

173
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,080
Yingtao?

174
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,220
You must've imagined it.
No way she's here.

175
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,340
Bus is here. Come on.

176
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,040
DONGSHI ROAD

177
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,920
Hey, you.

178
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,720
Why aren't you wearing our school uniform?

179
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,240
You don't go here, do you?

180
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,700
I… I'm from No. 11 Middle School.

181
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,860
No. 11 Middle?

182
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,960
Looking for a friend.

183
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,640
Don't tell me you're here
for Jiang Qiaoxi?

184
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,600
You're that girl, Yingtao, right?

185
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,340
What's going on between you two?

186
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,140
Did you really write that letter?

187
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,080
Writing a letter's one thing,

188
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,800
but showing up at his school?

189
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,700
God.

190
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,960
She followed him all the way here.

191
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,660
Maybe they really do know each other.

192
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,280
Jiang Qiaoxi!

193
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,080
Jiang Qiaoxi's here.
Cen Xiaoman's with him.

194
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,220
Jiang Qiaoxi!

195
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,180
Jiang Qiaoxi!

196
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,120
Guess what?
That girl actually came for you.

197
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,080
She really didn't realize
how much trouble she's making for you?

198
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,740
This is none of your business.

199
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,120
And I don't need your help cleaning it up.

200
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,460
But she…

201
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,480
I don't know her.

202
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,280
What? Who is she then?

203
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,060
Doesn't know her?

204
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,540
He probably just doesn't want to

205
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,000
get involved with her.

206
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,700
He should be telling the truth.

207
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,260
He is too proud to lie.

208
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,320
Seriously?

209
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,680
Hey! Girl! Oh God!

210
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,620
Get down! What are you doing?

211
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,140
You could get hurt!

212
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,720
Girl!

213
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,760
Hey, um…

214
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,320
Bad exam? Fight at home?

215
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,520
Come on down.

216
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,640
Quick.

217
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,340
Here, I'll help you.

218
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,580
Come down from there!

219
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,940
Come on, don't be stupid.

220
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,940
Come down, it's too high!

221
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,760
Quick! Come on.

222
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,280
Easy, take it slow…

223
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,460
I wasn't trying to jump…

224
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,120
- Come on.
- I really wasn't…

225
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,640
Careful.

226
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,260
See how high that was?

227
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,440
- I'm fine.
- Still, that is dangerous, huh?

228
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,380
Come on!

229
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,960
Where's your family?

230
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,000
Come on, sit here a while.

231
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,460
The soda's cold.

232
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,920
Here, have some hot water.

233
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,600
- Thanks.
- Let it cool down.

234
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,160
Watch some TV.

235
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,180
This one's good.

236
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,740
Men like him

237
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,020
don't come around often.

238
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,900
Auntie, I should get going. Thank you.

239
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,380
Don't go just yet, girl.

240
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,080
There's somewhere I want to take you.

241
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,000
Here.

242
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,720
Jiang Qiaoxi.

243
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,300
Your mom called.

244
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,320
She's coming to get you.

245
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,920
Were you following me?

246
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,160
You seemed off.

247
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,040
So I…

248
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,100
Don't worry, I won't tell your mom.

249
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,940
Girl!

250
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,560
Come on.

251
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,600
Let me show you something.

252
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,300
Wait up.

253
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,760
Watch your step.

254
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,760
Yingtao!

255
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,940
Yingtao.

256
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,040
What happened to you?

257
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,220
Who even are you?

258
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,260
I…

259
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,280
You're hurt and still making jokes?

260
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,160
How did you hurt your ankle? Is it bad?

261
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,680
It's nothing. I…

262
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,740
My shoelace came undone and I tripped.

263
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,620
You're not a kid anymore.

264
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,820
Come here, I'll carry you.

265
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,880
You're only making it worse.

266
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,300
I'm not a kid.
I don't need you to carry me.

267
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,220
Stop being so polite with me.

268
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,740
You looks stumbled from your steps.

269
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,940
Watching you limp is painful.

270
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,880
Then close your eyes.

271
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,760
Don't look.

272
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,100
Lin Yingtao.

273
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,920
You've got snot on your face.

274
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,240
I do not.

275
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,560
Remember those chocolate liquor candies

276
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,500
at Uncle Tan's wedding?

277
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,940
Du Shang and I scarfed ours down,

278
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,300
then you pulled out your one
and waved it in our faces.

279
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,040
Then you dropped it in the ditch

280
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,920
and cried forever. Your snot dried
on your cheeks. You didn't even…

281
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,460
Stop! Stop talking! Still laughing at me?

282
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,940
You and Cai Fangyuan…

283
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,240
You to are total scaredy-cats.

284
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,420
Climbed that giant locust tree,
got scared stiff halfway up.

285
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,640
Then Wei Yong walked by
and made both of you shout like…

286
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,520
Shut up already.

287
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,420
Easy… slow down.

288
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,620
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

289
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,200
Hey! Put me down.

290
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,640
- I can walk just fine!
- Let's go.

291
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,140
- Quit it!
- Alright, alright!

292
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,980
I can't see! Let go!

293
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,940
I've got legs. Don't need a ride.

294
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,500
We've known each other forever.
We've seen it all.

295
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,340
We're just a few years older now.

296
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,040
You suddenly put on that apologist face?

297
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,980
No means no. You're not carrying me.

298
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,620
Why not?

299
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,640
Someone's gonna end up getting hurt.

300
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,240
The way you're now is hurtful.

301
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,560
What did I even do?

302
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,180
Puffy eyes don't lie.
Who could possibly be more hurt than you?

303
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,420
Can you grab me some water and tissues?

304
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,300
Thanks.

305
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,420
What are you doing?

306
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,140
Just water and tissues.
I don't need your money.

307
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,480
Take it.

308
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,000
Here.

309
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,140
Drink a little first.

310
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,880
Slow down.

311
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,820
Aren't you curious

312
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,180
why I came all the way to the city?

313
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,380
Come over to my place later.
What you want to eat?

314
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,340
I went to your school today.

315
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,340
Heard a lot of stuff. About me.

316
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,760
Shouldn't you be the one
explaining something?

317
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,340
About…

318
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,980
Jiang Qiaoxi.

319
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,580
Yingtao,

320
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,440
you really need to
stop thinking about him.

321
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,460
He's not the same person
we knew growing up.

322
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,300
Then who is he?

323
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,680
Ever since he came to the city,
he's kept his distance from us.

324
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,340
Like we were never even part of his life.

325
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,660
Yingtao, from now on, let's just
pretend we never knew him either.

326
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,780
So

327
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,440
that's why he never reached out…

328
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,080
And every time I asked about him,

329
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,020
you guys just said
he was studying or too busy.

330
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,460
It… It was Qin Yeyun.

331
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,940
She said girls get emotional,
so she told everyone

332
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,460
not to tell you anything.

333
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,980
Then what about the letter?

334
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,680
What happened with that?
Why did it suddenly become public?

335
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,560
It was Fei Linge. He passed it around.

336
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,980
He is Jiang Qiaoxi's friend now.

337
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,020
- Today, I…
- So Jiang Qiaoxi told him to?

338
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,420
Even if he didn't, he still let it happen.

339
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,380
I saw him today.

340
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,900
He's way taller now.

341
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,100
But I recognized him in an instant.

342
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,020
And he said he didn't know me
right in front of everyone.

343
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,520
How could he turn into
that kind of person?

344
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,100
Yingtao…

345
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,600
You used to say
the city eats people alive.

346
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,980
Think of it like this.

347
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,160
The Jiang Qiaoxi we knew

348
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,260
got eaten by the city.

349
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,140
True.

350
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,700
Fresh and bone swallowed. Nothing left.

351
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,180
If my parents knew you were here,

352
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,800
they'd be over the moon.

353
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,720
Of course they would.

354
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,780
Uncle Yu and Auntie Zhang
adored me back in Qunshan.

355
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,840
Exactly.

356
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,320
My mom used to joke about kidnapping you
so you could be their daughter instead.

357
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,320
- What is it?
- That's Jiang's car.

358
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,260
The building ahead is for cadre housing.

359
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,040
SOLIDARITY, COMPASSION,
PROFESSIONALISM, DEVOTION

360
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,260
Auntie Liang, I'm not going up.

361
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,220
I'll grab a cab home.

362
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,100
Xiaoman,

363
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,320
I'll call your parents

364
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,480
to come pick you up.

365
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,640
No, it's okay, Auntie Liang.

366
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,620
And please…
don't tell them what happened today.

367
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,180
Honestly, I'm really disappointed in you.

368
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,260
At your age, you should focus on studies.

369
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,640
How can you hang around with him?

370
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,100
I understand, Auntie Liang.

371
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,940
But please don't blame Jiang Qiaoxi.

372
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,320
We won't let this happen again.

373
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,080
So…

374
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,360
where

375
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,920
do you think they went?

376
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,500
Who knows?

377
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,900
That girl's name is Cen Xiaoman.

378
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,720
They say she's the prettiest girl
in class.

379
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,140
And she's smart too.

380
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,100
Jiang Qiaoxi is first in the class.

381
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,980
She's second.

382
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,400
Are they close?

383
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,040
That… I don't know.

384
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,980
He stopped talking to us a long time ago.

385
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,960
Now he hangs out with the smart kids.

386
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,820
Girls like her.

387
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,640
There are others too.

388
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,920
There's this one guy.
Kind of a jerk, actually.

389
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,060
I heard someone wrote him a love letter,

390
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,940
and it caused a huge scene.

391
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,560
Plenty of girls write to Jiang Qiaoxi.

392
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,540
But he never responds to any of them.

393
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,300
- Let me take you home.
- It's fine. Really, I'm okay.

394
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,520
You all go home and rest.

395
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,020
Alright then.

396
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,400
- Be safe.
- I will.

397
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,740
So tell me…

398
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:48,000
Do you think he let my letter
get passed around

399
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,840
because of that girl?

400
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,920
That's beyond me.

401
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,620
I really don't know.

402
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,300
Let's head back.

403
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,300
They're here.

404
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,180
Yu Qiao!

405
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,860
Coming!

406
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,700
- Lin Yingtao!
- Hey…

407
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,040
- Yingtao!
- Yingtao.

408
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,940
You two are way too late.

409
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,900
She already left.

410
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,300
She left?

411
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,000
Alright. Guess we should head out too.

412
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,340
- You two…
- Lin Yingtao!

413
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,220
Lin…

414
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,920
Yingtao…

415
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,260
You think we won't recognize you now?

416
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,640
I knew you wouldn't leave
without seeing us first.

417
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,140
You two are way better at finding me now

418
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,420
than when we played hide-and-seek as kids.

419
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,300
Alright…

420
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,080
Qin Yeyun told me
to bring you clothes to change.

421
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,580
She said she's helping her dad
sort inventory, so she couldn't make it.

422
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,840
How's Uncle Qin's leg?

423
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,900
He won't spend a dime at the hospital.

424
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,840
Still doing his qigong.

425
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,800
Will those exercises work?

426
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,900
Only he believes they do.

427
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,980
Probably just a mental thing.

428
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,560
- He says he is better now.
- Be careful.

429
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,640
Okay.

430
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,580
Eat up.

431
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,280
- Wow.
- Easy now.

432
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,580
Alright, alright, I've got it.

433
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,000
- Wow.
- Hey.

434
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,140
Yingtao,

435
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,900
come on, tell us about life in Qunshan.

436
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,020
I miss those days so much.

437
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,280
Did they tear down my row of houses?

438
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,760
Almost all gone now.

439
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,920
How's life in Qunshan?
Kind of lonely, I guess?

440
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,100
You guys probably forgot

441
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,440
about the strawberry field, huh?

442
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,360
Still grows every year.

443
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,080
The sunflowers bloom too.

444
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,420
That big locust tree.

445
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,980
It still blossoms in spring.
So many flowers,

446
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,540
I can't even finish them all.

447
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,180
Mom still makes steamed
locust blossom rice, just for me now.

448
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,380
Let me tell you, I feel amazing.

449
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,640
Enough about me. How about you guys?

450
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,800
Yingtao, your parents are here!

451
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,160
- Come in.
- Ping.

452
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,580
- Yingtao.
- Dad!

453
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,560
Ow! You almost crushed me!

454
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,420
You're not going anywhere.
Told you! No way we'd ever lose you.

455
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,540
Wherever you go,
your mom and I will always find you.

456
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,580
See?

457
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,700
You scared us half to death.

458
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,980
- She's fine.
- I am sorry.

459
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,520
Come on, she's here with us,

460
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,000
- safe and sound.
- Yeah, see?

461
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,160
- She's here at the Yu house.
- Of course she is.

462
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,500
- Sit, Haifeng.
- Have a seat.

463
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,180
- Come. Sit.
- Here, let me take your bag.

464
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,900
Sorry for worrying you both.

465
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,380
Next time, at least let us know first.

466
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,300
Actually, we've decided something.

467
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,340
You've decided?

468
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,940
Yingtao's transferring to Jialin
Experimental Middle School.

469
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,300
Yingtao, listen to me.

470
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,600
No more living in Qunshan.

471
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,520
Transfer here.

472
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,720
Go to school with your friends.

473
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,840
It'll be great.

474
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,020
Lin, take our advice.

475
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,100
The project's only got
another year left anyway.

476
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,760
Exactly, Haifeng.

477
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,300
And you both know

478
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,260
Yingtao loves being around people.
She's happiest with a big crowd.

479
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,600
You really think

480
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,380
she's there alone in Qunshan
and loving it?

481
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,920
I'm happy wherever I am, Auntie Zhang.

482
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,900
- Yingtao, it's ok to be a kid.
- That's right.

483
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,420
We watched you grow up.

484
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,380
Even if your parents don't say it,

485
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,560
when it comes to school,

486
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,500
- we've already made the arrangements.
- Yeah.

487
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,520
If Manager Jiang were here today,

488
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,440
he could even help to
speed up the paperwork for your house.

489
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,580
No rush.

490
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,200
He knew you two were coming,
said he'd drop by to say hello.

491
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,660
But then something came up.

492
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,400
I heard Qiaoxi ran off
with a girl from his class.

493
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,440
- Liang Hongfei had to bring him back.
- Well.

494
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,400
- Heh.
- Oh.

495
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,200
It's alright.

496
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,140
You two, slow down!

497
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,220
Where are you even taking me?

498
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,860
Du Shang, can you go any faster?

499
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,820
Yu Qiao, slow down!

500
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,980
Du Shang's got Yingtao!

501
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,320
Yeah, I'm carrying someone here!
You two slow it down!

502
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,740
Lin Yingtao!

503
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,540
Are you that heavy?

504
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,820
Heavy? Look at yourself!
You think you're light?

505
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,200
Hop on Du Shang's bike then.

506
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,060
What is your problem?

507
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,100
Climbing around the park at night?

508
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,800
Come on.

509
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,139
Just get inside. You'll see.

510
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,620
- Come on, heroine.
- Hurry.

511
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:14,880
What are you guys up to?

512
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,940
I can climb it myself.

513
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,020
Watch your step.

514
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,380
Wow, not bad.

515
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,679
You're quick.

516
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:26,760
Wait for me!

517
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,260
Careful.

518
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,219
Hurry!

519
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,340
Way farther than I thought.

520
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,220
Yingtao, remember that cliff?
We never made it past.

521
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,980
We hiked so far but never got to see
that big goose you were talking about.

522
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,260
Well, these swans today?

523
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,500
Let's say they're your geese.

524
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,100
Look, Yingtao. That one swan

525
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,560
is the boldest. Always showing off.

526
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,860
We all agreed that it is most alike to you
when you were little.

527
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,760
Right? Don't you think so?

528
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,200
That's ruthless.

529
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,880
Huh?

530
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,160
The big city hasn't
swallowed you up after all.

531
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,800
Yingtao, come to the city.

532
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,760
It's not that you need us.

533
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,280
We need you.

534
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,860
Ugh, do you have to be so corny?

535
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,240
Ignore him. He's always been like that.

536
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,080
You guys are the worst!

537
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,920
Yingtao. We've done all this for you.
So? Are you coming or not?

538
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,480
I can't stand you guys.

539
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,560
Stop crying, Yingtao.

540
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,820
Hey, look behind you.

541
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,700
Someone's there.

542
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,720
- What the hell?
- Hey you.

543
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,660
Careful, careful.

544
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,840
Cai Fangyuan, you jerk!

545
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,980
Last one up! Watch your back!

546
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,380
Oi!

547
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,720
Hey you.

548
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,060
- Slow down.
- Oi!

549
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,080
Yu Qiao is the last!

550
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,880
- Yu Qiao, you're the last one.
- Coming…

551
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,420
Slow down, careful!

552
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,240
Yingtao.

553
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,240
Why did you come here?

554
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,860
Qin Yeyun told me you were here.

555
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,220
I came to find you.

556
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,940
Do we even know each other?

557
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,980
I'm sorry, Yingtao.

558
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,540
Then why did you say

559
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,180
you didn't know me?

560
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,520
I didn't know what else to do.

561
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,740
At the time…

562
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,160
it felt like the best solution.

563
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,520
Best solution?

564
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,460
So, in your mind,

565
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,220
pretending that you don't to know me

566
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,620
was your way of keeping me safe?

567
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,140
Like that would stop people from talking?

568
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,640
But you had other choices.

569
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,260
You could've just said we are friends.

570
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,860
We were friends.

571
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,100
That the letter wasn't a love letter.

572
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,520
That Chunlu was a rabbit.

573
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,800
It wasn't something

574
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,640
I could say at the time.

575
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,500
Not with someone else presented there.
Awkward, right?

576
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,360
Let's take another way.

577
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,400
JIALIN CITY POWER CONSTRUCTION
HOUSING COMPOUND

578
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,700
That girl's name is Cen Xiaoman.

579
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,480
They say she's the prettiest girl
in class.

580
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,140
And she's smart too.

581
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,860
Jiang Qiaoxi is first in the class.

582
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,740
She's second.

583
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,920
He stopped talking to us a long time ago.

584
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,300
Now he only hangs out with the smart kids.

585
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,800
It wasn't something

586
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,980
I could say at the time.

587
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,940
Not with someone else presented there.
Awkward, right?

588
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,720
I heard

589
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,180
Qiaoxi ran off with a girl from his class.

590
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,800
Liang Hongfei had to bring him back.

591
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,800
