1
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:39,060
 

2
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,900
In the coming days, all of you will leave home
one after another for university.

3
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,540
Today, our families are gathered together

4
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,939
as a small farewell gathering for you.

5
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:53,780
Also, since you've turned 18,

6
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,000
you're allowed to drink a little alcohol today.

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,880
Dad, we're not drinking.

8
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,579
We're still students.

9
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,079
Don't think I don't know.

10
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,832
Who drank that bottle of Wuliangye
from our cabinet?

11
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:07,679
Have you guys ever...?

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,360
Fang Yuan, take this.

13
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,764
Pour for everyone.

14
00:02:13,764 --> 00:02:15,584
Come on.

15
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,259
Forget it. If you don't want to smile,
don't force it.

16
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:21,152
What is this stuff?

17
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,920
Where's your amber pendant?
Why aren't you wearing it?

18
00:02:26,624 --> 00:02:28,419
Feeling a bit down.

19
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:32,099
It disappeared after Jiang Qiao Xi
returned last time.

20
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,599
Come on.

21
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,180
Listen up,

22
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,599
although you've secretly drunk alcohol before,

23
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,696
you still don't know how to drink properly.

24
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:43,500
Let me teach you today.

25
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,479
Hold the glass with your right hand
and support the bottom with your left.

26
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:53,840
When clinking glasses, keep your glass
slightly lower than others'.

27
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,599
Why? To show respect.

28
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,379
Respect.

29
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,960
- No, don't.
- Let's toast!

30
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,240
- Let's all drink together! Drink up!
- Come on, everyone.

31
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,559
- Cheers!
- Come on now.

32
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,200
- Down it in one go!
- Yu Qiao.

33
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,719
Yun, Cherry,

34
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:16,259
no casual drinking outside, understand?

35
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:20,319
A girl should never get drunk
under any circumstances.

36
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,319
Do you hear that?

37
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,560
- Got it.
- When have you ever seen my daughter

38
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,939
- actually drinking?
- We'll remember, Mr. Cai.

39
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:26,319
Qin Ye Yun getting drunk?

40
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,439
She's more likely to outdrink others!

41
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,060
- Just joking! They're teasing.
- Joking.

42
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,080
When you're away from home,
you'll need to rely on yourselves for everything.

43
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,199
Stay vigilant and aware of your surroundings.

44
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,139
Think carefully and use your wits
when problems arise.

45
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:47,820
Face challenges head-on yourself.

46
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:54,119
If you can't overcome them, come home and tell us.

47
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:04,759
I'll stop here.

48
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:07,519
Anyone else want to say something?

49
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:11,240
Let me add a few words.

50
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:17,920
I just hope you'll eat well, sleep well,
and study well.

51
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,339
Strive to be all-around outstanding students.

52
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:24,420
Don't worry about family matters.

53
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,296
We've got everything handled here.

54
00:04:27,296 --> 00:04:29,600
That's all. I'm done.

55
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,112
Come on.

56
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:41,879
Heaven has endowed me with talents for greatness.
Hoist sails to ride the vast waves!

57
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:45,400
I wish you a bright future.

58
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:51,424
Thank you.

59
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,920
Let me handle this.
You've made the atmosphere too heavy.

60
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,992
Go ahead.

61
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:02,079
Your dad wants to say a few words.

62
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,759
I don't usually talk much,

63
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,819
but today I need to speak up.

64
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,920
From now on, you'll have to take care
of yourselves and live your own lives.

65
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,379
Of course I hope only good things happen to you.

66
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:20,620
No bad things at all, right?

67
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,300
But think carefully.

68
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,759
How could life only have good things
without any bad?

69
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,899
How could you avoid getting hurt sometimes?

70
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:35,079
There must be some heartbreaks, right?

71
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,600
Remember this.

72
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,339
The bitterness you feel now will pass.

73
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:45,420
Those bad things will eventually turn into good.

74
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,699
Let me leave you with a wise saying.

75
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:50,920
Wade through life's river.

76
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:57,519
Your pains and joys will become
the view you behold.

77
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,379
You'll become the best scenery in your own lives.

78
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:02,800
Well said.

79
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,832
- Well said.
- That's great.

80
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:10,339
Okay, now it's Mom's turn.

81
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:13,060
- Bao Xuan, say something.
- Say...

82
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,399
What's there to say? It's too sentimental.

83
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,040
I won't say anything. Everyone take care.

84
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,220
Why the tears? This is a happy occasion.

85
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,208
Happy. We're happy.

86
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,040
Have we been too loud?
Are we disturbing the neighbors?

87
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,720
I'll get the door.

88
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,060
Cherry, your surprise is here.

89
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,459
Wait for it.

90
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:38,819
- Surprise?
- What surprise?

91
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,768
Jiang Qiao Xi?

92
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:43,360
Hello.

93
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:47,200
You are...

94
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,300
Come in.

95
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,400
Don't block the doorway. Get inside.

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,680
Cherry, don't you remember? Chen Ming Hao.

97
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,560
Cherry, you've grown so much!

98
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,420
Chen Ming Hao.

99
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,819
Hello, everyone.

100
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,608
Have a seat.

101
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:06,519
- How did you get here? Come on.
- Sit down.

102
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,839
You brought so many gifts.

103
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:11,379
Ming Hao, how are your parents doing?

104
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,879
They're well, just very busy.

105
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:16,100
Otherwise, they would've come back with me.

106
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,540
My parents always say you two
take great care of my grandparents.

107
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,480
They insisted I visit you
when I finally returned to the country.

108
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,939
We're longtime neighbors. Don't stand on ceremony.

109
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:28,699
Besides, your grandma always
took such good care of us back then.

110
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,240
She always shared the best treats with us.

111
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,639
Ming Hao, where are you studying abroad?

112
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,780
Australia, Mr. Yu.

113
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:42,000
Australia? How high is the tuition fee?

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,019
The cost depends on the school and location.

115
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:47,519
There can be huge variations
between different areas.

116
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,160
Yun could apply for an Australian graduate program
after finishing her bachelor's degree.

117
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,620
Dad, stop entertaining these fantasies.

118
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,420
Studying abroad is still studying.
I'm not interested.

119
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:04,060
Ming Hao, have you been alone
overseas all these years?

120
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,459
Yes, I was alone.

121
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:08,120
Was it difficult being abroad by yourself?

122
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,959
Did you manage meals alright? Make friends easily?

123
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:16,019
Was the language barrier challenging at first?

124
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:17,660
Actually, I adjusted fairly well.

125
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,000
But students working while studying
had it much harder.

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,660
Study hard, work part-time waiting tables.

127
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,399
My parents strictly forbade me
from taking part-time jobs.

128
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,860
They insisted I focus entirely on my studies.

129
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,839
They even rented me an apartment off campus.

130
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,720
I hosted weekend parties there for friends.

131
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,299
Made for an eventful experience.

132
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,720
Your parents are wonderful.

133
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,240
Cherry, I heard you got
into North Normal University.

134
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,159
You used to wear that red bead necklace
when you were little.

135
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,840
That little girl chasing after me

136
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,899
has now entered
such a prestigious university. Impressive!

137
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:55,799
Thank you. But that wasn't glass, it was amber.

138
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,759
Oh! My mistake. I'm sorry.

139
00:08:58,759 --> 00:08:59,904
Ming Hao, have some more.

140
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:00,992
Here.

141
00:09:00,992 --> 00:09:02,976
Here, eat more.

142
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,639
Eat your fill.

143
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:07,200
We'll leave. You can stop here.

144
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,299
- Bye, bro.
- Bye, Ming Hao.

145
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,200
Travel safely.

146
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,679
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

147
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,960
Why did you invite Ming Hao so suddenly?

148
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,399
So this was your big surprise for Lin Cherry?

149
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,519
Come on, Du Shang, explain yourself.

150
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,140
What's the meaning behind this surprise?

151
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,799
Cherry, have you completely forgotten?

152
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,919
When we saw Ming Hao off as kids,

153
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:36,120
you cried so hard I thought you'd dehydrate.

154
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,740
Your wailing echoed across all of Qun Shan.

155
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,299
But today you didn't even recognize him yourself.

156
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:46,620
That's why you should embrace campus life fully.

157
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,800
Maybe someday you'll think of that person
with the same detachment.

158
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,979
- Really?
- Absolutely.

159
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,380
But that's Jiang Qiao Xi.

160
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,760
- What?
- You really think you've got it all figured out?

161
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,679
- Well...
- There isn't any problem.

162
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,360
What do you mean?

163
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,740
Didn't you see that she was upset?

164
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,679
Why are you walking so fast alone?

165
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:24,759
I just feel that if it weren't for Jiang Qiao Xi,

166
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:27,860
I wouldn't have started studying
so hard in middle school.

167
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,500
I wouldn't have gotten into First Experimental
High School or North Normal University.

168
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,020
That was a pretty abrupt change of topic.

169
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:41,880
I'm afraid I'll forget.

170
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,368
Where did he go?

171
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,336
I don't know.

172
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,000
Don't worry, I'll help you figure it out.

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,959
Besides, he has to go to college eventually.

174
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,699
We'll definitely hear news about him.

175
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,568
That's what I think too.

176
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,360
By the way, Lin Cherry,

177
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,600
our schools are less than three kilometers apart.

178
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,320
Our registration dates are only one day apart.

179
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,439
Why don't you want to go with me?

180
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,019
I want to experience
what it's like to leave home alone

181
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:26,520
and go to a new place by myself.

182
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:54,219
Cherry, I think Jiang Qiao Xi
is pretty despicable.

183
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:01,659
Look, he gave you lipstick and red high heels
before leaving for Hong Kong.

184
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:04,200
After 18, you're not a girl anymore.

185
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,279
You will gradually become a woman.

186
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,840
Lipstick and high heels are essentials for women.

187
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,479
He wants to completely occupy
your identity as a woman.

188
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:21,259
He's truly awful.

189
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:24,640
Yeah, he wants you to remember him for life.

190
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,920
Jiang Qiao Xi studies Olympiad math.
His brain works differently.

191
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,079
Cherry, don't forget me.

192
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,059
Why do you all want me to forget him?

193
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:46,120
We want you to be happier.

194
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,120
He'll come back.

195
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,096
When?

196
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,620
You and Yu Qiao will go to Hong Yang together.

197
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,840
Have him accompany you more. Go out and have fun.

198
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,740
Actually, Yu Qiao is great,
better than Jiang Qiao Xi.

199
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,256
What are you talking about?

200
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:14,848
I can already imagine it.

201
00:13:14,848 --> 00:13:17,379
Yu Qiao will become a pilot, wearing the uniform.

202
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,799
A bunch of girls will definitely
have a crush on him.

203
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,879
Don't let the good stuff go to outsiders.

204
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:24,520
Rather than leaving him for others,
keep him for yourself.

205
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,559
What nonsense are you spouting?

206
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,279
Don't worry about me.

207
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,820
With my looks,
I'll have my pick of guys in college.

208
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,399
Someone who treats me well,
buys me high heels and lipstick,

209
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,579
all that'll be easy.

210
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,480
But you?

211
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,500
Other than grades being better than mine,

212
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,680
looks, figure, IQ, EQ,

213
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,112
all aspects are average.

214
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,600
Why are you sleeping in my bed and belittling me?

215
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,039
Why say that? Stop sleeping here.

216
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,840
Go back. Go home.

217
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,819
You're getting on my nerves.

218
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,940
Alright, I surrender.

219
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,864
I'm wrong.

220
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:28,000
Qin Ye Yun,

221
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,480
this time, only you're staying behind.

222
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,900
We're all leaving. Will you be sad?

223
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,179
You're all leaving, but I'm staying here.

224
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:45,140
Aren't you the ones feeling sad?

225
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,859
Frankly, you're getting on my nerves too.

226
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,640
Since childhood, you've always acted
fearless and indifferent.

227
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,740
But the more you act like this,
the more worried we become.

228
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,859
Let's sleep. You've got a journey tomorrow.

229
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:38,656
I feel like I'll never love anyone
this much again.

230
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,120
You're only 18. Don't talk about "forever."

231
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:12,700
 Jiang Qiao Xi, will you call me
after moving to the provincial city? 

232
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,919
 Yes. 

233
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,540
 You lied. You never called. 

234
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,240
 Cherry, I'm sorry. 

235
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,360
 Jiang Qiao Xi! 

236
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,260
 Where did you go? Come back! 

237
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,500
 I'm warning you, my memory isn't that good. 

238
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,800
 I really will forget you. 

239
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,719
 Jiang Qiao Xi. 

240
00:17:11,332 --> 00:17:15,744
 

241
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:20,320
 

242
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,136
 

243
00:17:29,604 --> 00:17:37,344
 

244
00:17:41,636 --> 00:17:44,960
 

245
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,404
Okay, next one.

246
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,856
Here.

247
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:01,160
Come on, look at the camera.

248
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,520
Tuck your chin a bit. Good.

249
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,180
Who are you?

250
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,079
Sorry, senior.

251
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:10,920
I'm Lin Qi Le, a 2008 freshman
in Elementary Education.

252
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,480
Hello, seniors. Did I wake you up?

253
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,240
- I'm sorry.
- Turn on the light first.

254
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,680
Get up now.

255
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,680
It's okay. I'll do it.

256
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,519
Just help me get it.

257
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,200
How heavy is this thing?
You want me to get it for you?

258
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,024
Whose is this?

259
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:46,912
I'll put it down for you.

260
00:19:46,912 --> 00:19:49,040
You clean up.

261
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,759
Where are you from?

262
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm from Jialin.

263
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,940
I've brought you some local snacks from Jialin.

264
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,940
Who did this? It's spilled all over the table.

265
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,420
Who didn't finish their drink? Meng Li Jun.

266
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,920
Enough. Both of you stop arguing.

267
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,299
How annoying!

268
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:10,379
Sit for a while. There's no hurry.

269
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,940
 Why are you rooming with seniors? 

270
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,779
 Can you talk to the counselor? 

271
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:19,180
 
 It's better to room with your own classmates. 

272
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,140
 You'll get to know each other faster that way. 

273
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,039
 Senior students are much older than you.
You might not get along well. 

274
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:31,099
It's fine. Living with senior students
feels good to me.

275
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:34,859
I can consult them if I have academic questions.

276
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:35,880
Exactly. Right.

277
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,819
Settle down and live with those seniors properly.

278
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,539
Get along well. Be more proactive.

279
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,539
 Call us if anything feels uncomfortable. 

280
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:43,779
Got it.

281
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:46,180
Cherry, did you buy all your bedding?

282
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,220
 Remember, for the inner filling for the comforter, 

283
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,339
 make sure to get high-quality ones. 

284
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:54,059
 Check the cotton inside.
It shouldn't look discolored. 

285
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:57,220
 And get a firmer pillow. 

286
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,680
 It's better for your neck. 

287
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,640
Also, the first cup of water
in the morning is crucial.

288
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,440
It helps with detox and hydration.

289
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,220
Have some water.

290
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,619
 Did you listen to your mother? 

291
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:09,799
 She knows. You've repeated it many times. 

292
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:12,279
 Well, I used to pour her morning water. 

293
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:15,039
 Have to repeat it to her more.
She doesn't pay attention. 

294
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,200
 She knows. She's not a child anymore. 

295
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,920
That's because you brought it
before I could pour it myself.

296
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,059
 Okay, I got it. 

297
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:25,920
 Don't worry about me. I'll manage. 

298
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,059
I need to go to the freshmen
training base this afternoon.

299
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:31,019
I'll go pack now.

300
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:32,599
Alright. That's all. Bye.

301
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,740
Stay safe.

302
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,720
- No more talk.
-  Bye. 

303
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:52,480
Dress right!

304
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,440
Quick steps! Face forward!

305
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,800
At ease! Attention!

306
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:04,359
On my command, left face!

307
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,359
Freeze! Who told you to move?

308
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,400
What's wrong with you?

309
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,839
Instructor, I feel dizzy.

310
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,220
Real dizziness or faking it?

311
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,420
I've been unwell these days.

312
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,380
My head hurts really bad.

313
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,440
Someone help her out of formation.

314
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,099
Take her to the infirmary.

315
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:26,140
- Other students...
- Are you okay?

316
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,599
On my command, right face!

317
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:32,359
Are you okay? Hang in there.

318
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:34,304
Almost at the infirmary.

319
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:37,019
Slow down.

320
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:39,008
Slow down.

321
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:47,200
Let's go back to the dorm.

322
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:49,640
Are you okay now?

323
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,899
I'm dizzy. You too, right?

324
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,819
I'm not dizzy.

325
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:59,819
I'm dizzy.

326
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:01,780
Aren't you dizzy?

327
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,280
Face forward!

328
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,680
Dress right! Face forward!

329
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,819
Reporting back, sir!

330
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:22,752
Fall in!

331
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,079
All units, right face!

332
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,940
Forward march!

333
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,779
Left, right!

334
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,079
- Report, Instructor.
- Speak.

335
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,799
I think I have heatstroke. My head's spinning.

336
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,640
Step forward!

337
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:44,020
Eyes forward. Chin up!

338
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,440
- Report, Instructor.
- Speak.

339
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,519
My stomach hurts.

340
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:51,839
Step out!

341
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,899
You all stand like ragdolls!

342
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:00,380
Some are lying to skip training.

343
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,980
But we do have role models here.

344
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,839
Take Lin Qi Le for example.

345
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,440
Such a slender girl

346
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,680
has been standing strong since day one.

347
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,400
That's the standard you should follow.

348
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,360
Chest out! Head up!

349
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,240
We're here.

350
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,280
Finally back at college.

351
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,336
Bye.

352
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,664
Bye.

353
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,040
I wouldn't want such roommates.

354
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,680
Then do something about it!

355
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,819
This is so boring.

356
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:09,740
Let's tell ghost stories.

357
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,339
Really? You're not scared?

358
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,940
Qi Le, care to join us?

359
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,659
I'll listen.

360
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:30,940
Have any of you heard

361
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,299
about the dorm at the end of the hallway?

362
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:38,980
The end? That's our dorm!

363
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,039
What's special about it?

364
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:42,359
You've never heard this story?

365
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:44,819
It's a true story.

366
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:48,800
About ten years ago,

367
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:55,180
that dorm was never assigned to anyone.

368
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,559
Always kept locked.

369
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:00,200
Teachers called it a storage room.

370
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,440
Summer break arrived. Since
Xiao Hong's family was struggling financially,

371
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,339
she decided to stay at school,
working part-time while studying.

372
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:16,559
One evening, it was raining
as she returned to the dormitory.

373
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:23,159
She noticed the light was on
in the dorm at the end of the corridor.

374
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:25,560
She thought,

375
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,799
"This can't be right.

376
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:31,079
This dorm room should be unoccupied."

377
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:34,720
She slowly approached the room.

378
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,960
Peering inside,

379
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,599
she saw a mirror positioned directly facing her.

380
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,440
In the reflection was someone else's face.

381
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:56,059
A torso-only figure about one meter tall.

382
00:27:56,059 --> 00:28:00,480
It appeared to have been severed at the waist.

383
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,019
How terrifying!

384
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:14,519
Well, Qi Le? Aren't you scared?

385
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:17,260
I'm... okay.

386
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,839
Were you hoping I'd be scared?

387
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,768
You're not frightened?

388
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,520
You don't seem like the brave type.

389
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,399
Actually, I know a ghost story too.
Want to hear it?

390
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:46,139
Have you heard The Story
of Best Friends Back-to-Back?

391
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:55,680
Qi and Yue were best friends sharing a dorm room.

392
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,799
They slept in bunk beds,

393
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:01,599
chatting late into every night.

394
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:09,460
One night, their conversation turned
to the school's July 15th incident.

395
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,319
Rumors say that on July 15th of a particular year,

396
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:17,440
two close friends killed each other
over a trivial matter.

397
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,180
After that, every July 15th,

398
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,680
arguments echo through the dormitory halls.

399
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,759
Qi and Yue decided

400
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:33,160
to investigate the building this July 15th.

401
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,579
But days before the fateful date,

402
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:41,040
Yue vanished without trace.

403
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,640
Qi waited endlessly,

404
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,779
until midnight struck with no sign of Yue.

405
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:55,000
The phone suddenly rang. Dead silence answered.

406
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,960
"Hello? Yue?" Qi called out.

407
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,260
"Yue, say something!"

408
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,899
A ghostly voice finally responded.

409
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,079
"I'm... so cold..."

410
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,660
Qi dismissed it as a prank and hung up.

411
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,319
But the next night at midnight,

412
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,680
Yue called again.

413
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:27,619
"I'm so cold..."

414
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,720
On the third day, the fourth...

415
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,020
Until the seventh day,

416
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:42,279
July 15th, Yue's call came once more.

417
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:44,239
Qi finally begged her.

418
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:46,200
"Yue, please come back!

419
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,619
Stop playing these tricks!"

420
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:50,688
But Yue said,

421
00:30:50,688 --> 00:30:53,299
"I've been here all along...

422
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:56,420
Best friends back-to-back."

423
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:01,180
Qi was absolutely terrified.
She quickly ducked back under the covers.

424
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:05,400
But she couldn't fall asleep no matter what.
She tossed and turned restlessly.

425
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:10,140
She turned over and suddenly saw Yue.

426
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:16,740
But it wasn't Yue, but her skin.

427
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,859
Then the voice came to her ear again.

428
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:24,079
"See? I told you I've always been here.

429
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:27,359
Best friends back-to-back."

430
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:33,260
Good friend, come look at me!

431
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:47,180
Qi Le, that's quite a story you've got.

432
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,680
Better than mine.

433
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,799
I'll remember this.
Next time I'll tell it to my boyfriend.

434
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:52,859
I'm going to sleep now.

435
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:56,064
Go to sleep. I've heard plenty of these stories.

436
00:31:56,064 --> 00:31:57,359
They're pretty boring.

437
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:00,319
Right. We still have classes tomorrow.

438
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:14,220
 Today is my first day in the dorm. 

439
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,619
 But my senior roommates want to drive me out. 

440
00:32:17,619 --> 00:32:20,559
 They tried to scare me with ghost stories. 

441
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,379
 Not only was I unafraid,
but I even scared them back. 

442
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,440
 Jiang Qiao Xi, are you okay? 

443
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,480
 Are the people around you treating you well? 

444
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,480
What are you doing?

445
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:07,020
I wanted her to accompany me to the restroom.

446
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,420
Qi Le, could you come with me to the restroom?

447
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,579
What, senior?

448
00:33:13,579 --> 00:33:15,616
Go to the restroom.

449
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,599
It's nothing.

450
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,936
It's okay, senior.

451
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,099
Why isn't it here yet?

452
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:45,079
Faster, come on. Faster.

453
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:47,072
One, two, three.

454
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:52,096
I'm so scared.

455
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:10,600
Qi Le, maybe we should sleep together tonight.

456
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,700
I guess that could work.

457
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,880
We'll fit.

458
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,319
Are you super scared?

459
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:39,960
Not too bad.

460
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,359
But I notice you're completely fearless
when telling ghost stories.

461
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,700
Actually, I have a special chant.

462
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,664
What kind of chant?

463
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,859
Ghost, if you're here,
please turn on the light for me.

464
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,199
Such a chant.

465
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,960
A soul-summoning incantation?

466
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,320
Well, think about it.

467
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,280
If the ghost can turn on the light for you,

468
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,139
that means it's a kind ghost and won't hurt you.

469
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:19,960
If the light doesn't turn on,

470
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,099
it's just a powerless little ghost

471
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:24,032
and definitely can't harm you.

472
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,559
Where did you even hear this nonsense?

473
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,440
That's what my dad told me.

474
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:34,440
Isn't that just psychological comfort?

475
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,260
Isn't this just psychological fear?

476
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,859
There aren't really ghosts in this world.

477
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,880
That actually makes sense. I'll try it.

478
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:53,120
Ghost, if you're here,
could you turn the lights on?

479
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,940
How did you two end up sharing the same bed?

480
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,780
Not sleeping at midnight,
and now you're chatting with ghosts?

481
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:09,459
Who's talking to me?

482
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:12,219
Get up.

483
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:13,840
If there are ghosts,
they're just a bunch of scaredy-cats.

484
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,880
Trying to scare others
but ending up terrifying yourselves.

485
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,856
This is beyond ridiculous.

486
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:28,820
Seniors, I should apologize for frightening you.

487
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,440
But you were the ones who started it.

488
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,359
You scared me first with those ghost stories.

489
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,420
See? This kid's vindictive.

490
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,840
We scared you, so you have to scare us back?

491
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,904
I just wanted to show you with this attitude

492
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,056
that I'm not to be messed with.

493
00:36:45,056 --> 00:36:46,280
You can't drive me away.

494
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,079
Drive you away? Why would we do that?

495
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:52,340
Exactly! You're so adorable and fun.

496
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,699
We want to cherish you. Why drive you away?

497
00:36:54,699 --> 00:36:56,672
How could you...?

498
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,859
I heard everything.

499
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:04,280
I heard it all from outside the door.

500
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,000
You said you didn't want a roommate like me.

501
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,539
And you discussed ways to get rid of me.

502
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:11,980
Then I didn't dare come back.

503
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,519
I stayed downstairs alone until dorm curfew.

504
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:18,139
I thought you were all asleep,
so I climbed onto my bed.

505
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:21,620
But the moment I laid down,
you started telling ghost stories to scare me.

506
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,039
What's so funny?

507
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:29,420
This is why taking things
out of context is dangerous.

508
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,720
 Isn't freshman military training ending today? 

509
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,740
 Qi Le should be coming back, right? 

510
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:38,219
 Let me tell you something. 

511
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:41,159
 We shouldn't have argued in front of her that day. 

512
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,700
 That girl must've been terrified. 

513
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,060
 We were still hungover that day.
Alcohol ruins everything. 

514
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,940
 She's always been so quiet and well-behaved. 

515
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,359
 She won't be scared of us now, will she? 

516
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:58,320
 She wouldn't want to move out, would she? 

517
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,499
 That's actually a real possibility. 

518
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:04,439
 If I were her, I wouldn't want such roommates. 

519
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:07,879
 Then do something about it! 

520
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,460
 Want to try something meaningful
that touches the soul? 

521
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,079
 How exactly? 

522
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,139
 The Suspension Bridge Effect,
also known as the Capilano Bridge Effect. 

523
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:18,739
 It's a psychological phenomenon. 

524
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:22,480
 The theory is that when people
experience fear or excitement, 

525
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,760
 in these intense emotional states, 

526
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,460
 the body will develop physiological reactions
like increased heart rate, 

527
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,440
 elevated blood pressure,
and accelerated breathing. 

528
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,780
 These physiological arousal responses 

529
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,699
 are often misinterpreted by individuals 

530
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:37,539
 as attraction towards their current companion. 

531
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:39,456
 That's simple enough. 

532
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:42,199
 We'll tell her a ghost story. 

533
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:45,760
 When her heart races and blood pressure rises, 

534
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,099
 Meng Li Jun, you play the caring senior. 

535
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:51,239
 Let her share a bed with you. 

536
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:54,420
 After one night sharing a bed, 

537
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,379
 your friendship will be solidified. 

538
00:38:57,099 --> 00:38:59,000
How can you be like this?

539
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,480
You're senior students!
How can you still be so childish?

540
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,472
What's wrong with that?

541
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,500
But you're quite nice.

542
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,000
Even thought we were pushing you out,
you still accompanied me to the restroom

543
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,300
and even agreed to share my bed.

544
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:23,319
Senior, do you like me?

545
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,800
Do you like me?

546
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,939
I think you really like me.

547
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:34,719
I think the Suspension Bridge Effect
is pretty accurate.

548
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:36,400
Right?

549
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,639
Yeah.

550
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,659
That makes some sense.

551
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:43,480
Next time I'm looking for a partner,
I'm definitely using this trick.

552
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,440
- Total domination.
- Complete control.

553
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,264
Seriously.

554
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,440
Cherry, look.

555
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,139
The show's starting again.

556
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:10,399
Every night's more lively
than the Spring Festival Gala.

557
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,239
Let's go.

558
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:16,980
- What's wrong?
- Let's go.

559
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,699
Li Jun, could you call Si Si for me?

560
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:21,899
Boys aren't allowed in the girls' dorm.

561
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:29,500
Li Jun, he...

562
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,439
He's not here for me.

563
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:34,199
Who's he here for?

564
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:37,079
Si Si's boyfriend, Shi Zhan.

565
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:41,239
Did he come to apologize
after fighting with Si Si?

566
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,699
It's not that simple.

567
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:44,699
We're seniors now.

568
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:48,260
Shi Zhan wants to go back to Shandong
for teacher certification.

569
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,139
Si Si wants to return to Suzhou
for civil service exams.

570
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:55,239
Shi Zhan wants Si Si to marry him
and go back to his hometown.

571
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:57,839
Si Si wants to break up with him.

572
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:05,480
 
I never heard Si Si mention this.

573
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,459
If she doesn't want to talk about it,
we can't bring it up.

574
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,159
We got drunk the day you came over.

575
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:13,979
That's exactly what we were discussing.

576
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,416
Is he still downstairs?

577
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,760
Yes, he is.

578
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:51,616
Si Si.

579
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:09,720
Si Si, what do you mean by that?

580
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,599
Relationships take two people.

581
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,199
It's not something one person can decide alone.

582
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:19,168
Si Si.

583
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:35,269
It's okay.

584
00:42:35,269 --> 00:42:37,519
I told him

585
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,739
to stop wallowing in self-pity down there.

586
00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:45,580
I knew from the start

587
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,600
that we'd break up after graduation.

588
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,060
This just makes it a year earlier.

589
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,260
You guys go about your business.

590
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,919
I just need some time alone.

591
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,780
Cherry, go change your clothes.

592
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,640
The shower room will close soon.
