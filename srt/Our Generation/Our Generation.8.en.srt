00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,160
OUR GENERATION

2
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,500
EPISODE 8

3
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,280
I think you did well this time.

4
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,100
Well, you didn't tried hard and still

5
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,400
landed fifth from the bottom.

6
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,880
I did try.

7
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,140
I really did.

8
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,740
What class are you in again?

9
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,380
Jialin Experimental Middle School.

10
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,820
Class 18.

11
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,380
Not coming dead last is already something.

12
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,980
Anyway, I'm very proud of you.

13
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,560
I think you did great, okay?

14
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,100
This has nothing to do with effort.

15
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,960
- So you're saying I'm just dumb?
- Let's eat.

16
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,880
- Have some soup first.
- Hot!

17
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,440
Mmm, smells great. What is it?

18
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,820
Pig brain soup.

19
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,760
I made it just for you.

20
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,280
Good for your brain, they say.

21
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,540
You really do think I'm dumb.

22
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,040
What are you two laughing at?

23
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,320
My parents made me pig brain soup.

24
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,000
That's love right there.

25
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,020
I flunked

26
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,460
and didn't even get yelled at.

27
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,840
Hey Yingtao,

28
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,920
don't talk like your mom
ever laid a hand on you.

29
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,560
I am the one got whipped by tag team

30
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,700
since day one.

31
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,160
Though this time, no beating.

32
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,460
They saw the report card

33
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,700
and found out Yu Qiao

34
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,140
ranked 15th from the bottom.

35
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,440
They figured the test
must've been really tough.

36
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,420
Not ranking dead last

37
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,600
was a win in their eyes.

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,820
You sure are proud of that.

39
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,000
Hey Yu Qiao,

40
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,440
what happened with your test?

41
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,240
I heard you bombed it on purpose.

42
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,740
You usually do way better than this.

43
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,140
Never.

44
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,180
Come on, would I tank a test on purpose?

45
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,720
I just

46
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,780
didn't do well this time.

47
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,980
I needed an excuse when people asked.

48
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,380
Better

49
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,980
than admitting I tanked it.

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,680
There are fifteen of us

51
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,200
in the tutoring class.

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,860
Three from Qunshan.

53
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,420
That's a fifth of the class.

54
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,260
We better represent.

55
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,380
Let's not embarrass

56
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,320
our hometown, yeah?

57
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,180
How about this?

58
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,920
I'll ask my mom
to make more pig brain soup,

59
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,180
we'll all have some.

60
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,140
No thanks. You can have my share.

61
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,240
Seriously though, Yu Qiao,

62
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,380
no matter what happens,

63
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,460
don't start fights at school.

64
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,440
I only fought because I saw you do it.

65
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,860
I…

66
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,540
Of all my great traits,

67
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,000
you only picked up the worst ones.

68
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,880
You?

69
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,740
What other good qualities
can you share with me?

70
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,040
- Give me the paper.
- I'm not done yet.

71
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,100
Not yours.

72
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,460
Still cheating here?

73
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,740
Real impressive.

74
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,160
AIM HIGH, STUDY HARD, AND THINK DEEPLY

75
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,660
Yu Qiao, why aren't you finished yet?

76
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,960
You're usually good at physics.

77
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,220
I'm just double-checking, sir.

78
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,700
No need. Hand it in.

79
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,500
Alright.

80
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,020
Stop writing.

81
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,660
I can't hold up any longer.

82
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,560
Wanna copy mine?

83
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,820
Just go.

84
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,220
- I got this.
- Then hurry up.

85
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,380
<i>Looks alright.</i>

86
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,900
<i>- Okay, go home.</i>
<i>- Thanks, sir.</i>

87
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,620
Lin Qile, Cai Fangyuan,

88
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,900
why are you two still dawdling?

89
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,960
Have you finished?

90
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,380
- Almost done.
- Hand it in first.

91
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,260
Let me see.

92
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,100
Hey, good luck.

93
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,520
You can't just memorize formulas
for the sake of it.

94
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,980
You have to use abstract thinking.

95
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,300
The ball falls naturally

96
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,520
and hits the spring.

97
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,540
The spring compresses.

98
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,580
The force builds up.

99
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,660
<i>Coming!</i>

100
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,860
Yingtao. Yingtao!

101
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,240
Yu Qiao's here.

102
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,220
Okay.

103
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,980
Yu Qiao, talk some sense into her.

104
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,740
She's been glued to that desk
since she got back.

105
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,900
Hasn't moved at all.

106
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,420
Don't worry, Auntie Juan. Leave it to me.

107
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,120
Alright, I'll let you handle it.

108
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,000
- Just go.
- Okay.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,020
What?

110
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,760
Why are you fighting yourself like this?

111
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,640
Don't distract me.

112
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,360
Otherwise, I'll fight you instead.

113
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,820
Relax.

114
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,780
I'm here to help.

115
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,880
Help me?

116
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,560
Physics, you know,

117
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,840
isn't something I was good at right away.

118
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,260
But I figured it out. And now I can

119
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,360
pass that wisdom on to you.

120
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,580
- Please.
- But I've got conditions.

121
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,080
- Say it.
- Sports Day's coming.

122
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,400
I'm signing up for basketball.

123
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,840
You need to be in my cheering squad.

124
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,680
That's it?

125
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,260
Even if you didn't ask,

126
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,140
I'd still cheer for you, okay?

127
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,440
You better mean that.

128
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,220
To understand physics,
you've gotta feel it.

129
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,600
Feel it?

130
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,620
Didn't you say you'd show me the way?

131
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,800
Why the balloon?

132
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,560
Lin Yingtao,

133
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,440
here's your mission.

134
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,840
Don't let the balloon hit the floor.

135
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,920
Here.

136
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,000
What is this?

137
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,340
Feel the air resistance.

138
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,400
Feel the magic of physics.

139
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,740
Are you messing with me?

140
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,580
Lin Yingtao,

141
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,460
trust me.

142
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,480
If you don't go through this today,

143
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,800
you might not solve that problem tomorrow.

144
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,320
But if you can keep that balloon
off the ground

145
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,000
for 30 minutes,

146
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,420
you've got a good shot at cracking it.

147
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,360
If you don't believe me, go back now.

148
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,540
Really?

149
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,560
Fine.

150
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,440
If I don't get the answer tomorrow,

151
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,280
I'll smack you as many times

152
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,380
as I bopped this balloon.

153
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,060
No more talking. Just focus.

154
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,640
Here.

155
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,220
What's your deal?

156
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,060
If you wanna play, play properly.

157
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,320
What'd the balloon ever do to you?

158
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,780
Yu Qiao, you're seriously annoying.

159
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,920
What's up with the ringtones?

160
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,240
What ringtones?

161
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,920
Lin Yingtao, call me.

162
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,500
Call you?

163
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,300
Why are you laughing?

164
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,540
I've gotten three custom ringtones
this week.

165
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,720
I was so confused.

166
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,040
I didn't even sing the song.

167
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,440
How is that my fault?

168
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,320
I called customer service.

169
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,420
They said

170
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,160
it was set up by someone

171
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,520
with the number ending in 6019.

172
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,400
Ten yuan for a song.

173
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,520
Yu Qiao, what's your problem?

174
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,020
Coming up with new ways to mess with me?

175
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,760
Wow, Yu Qiao.

176
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,540
I thought we were friends.

177
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,720
You gave one to Qin Yeyun

178
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,400
but not to us?

179
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,580
What kind of nonsense.

180
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,440
Obviously it was Yu Jin.

181
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,440
Yu Jin?

182
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,240
You let Yu Jin use your phone again?

183
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
Three songs. That's 30 yuan.

184
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,200
Cancel it now.

185
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,020
- Chill.
- I barely have any credit left.

186
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,320
Where's your phone?

187
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,500
In my bag.

188
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,240
Here.

189
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,440
Don't be mad.

190
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,920
Ugh, that Yu Jin.

191
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,100
He caused a mess again.

192
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,780
Cancel it.

193
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,560
Cancel what?

194
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,160
Let him burn through his whole balance.

195
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,340
Fine, burn it all.

196
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,160
Is it gone?

197
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,780
Lin Yingtao!

198
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,120
Look.

199
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,080
What?

200
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,640
YOUR COMPATIBILITY INDEX
WITH LIN QILE IS 80%.

201
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,900
YOU ARE HIGHLY IN TUNE WITH EACH OTHER.

202
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,920
BUT IT COULD RUIN YOUR CAREER.

203
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,900
PRESS A FOR ADVICE FROM <i>ZHUGE</i>

204
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,280
PRESS B TO CHECK YOUR LUCK THIS YEAR

205
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,040
Don't say anything.

206
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,700
You…

207
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,320
‪Where is she?

208
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,380
Qin Yeyun!

209
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,380
Qin…

210
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,180
Stop. Just hear me out.

211
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,860
What's there to say?

212
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,520
It was clearly a joke.

213
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,760
You're seriously mad at me?

214
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,180
Well, now I'm mad that you're mad.

215
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,080
So what do you want me to do?

216
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,400
Should I clap for you?

217
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,080
Pick you a ringtone to cheer you on?

218
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,580
No, come on.

219
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,860
Qin Yeyun,

220
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,200
we're students.
Right now our priority should be school,

221
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,660
not getting wrapped up in distractions.

222
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,140
So what about Jiang Qiaoxi?

223
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,020
Is he a distraction now too?

224
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,860
Stop lying to yourself.

225
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,840
Really, why?

226
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,740
Did you two do anything wrong?

227
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,700
What's with you?

228
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,300
Why did you leave without us

229
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,280
this morning?

230
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,480
Yingtao, who upsets you?

231
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,420
No one upsets me.

232
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,900
I just wanted to be alone.

233
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,780
- Wh… What did we do wrong?
- Why shut us out?

234
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,280
I just want to focus on my studies.

235
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,720
Lin Qile, come on. That's harsh.

236
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,480
How exactly are we
stopping you from studying?

237
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,960
You are distracting me.

238
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,180
I've been helping you study.

239
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,840
Your help is the reason I'm struggling.

240
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,920
That balloon thing…

241
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,480
- What happened?
- I did that

242
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,460
balloon thing

243
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,800
because I had no other choice.

244
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,580
Enough. I know how to study now.

245
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,080
So leave me alone.

246
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,640
Especially you, Yu Qiao.

247
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,820
Stop interfering.

248
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,820
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

249
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,900
I didn't do anything.

250
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,380
Then why did she call you out?

251
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,260
I came to school alone today.

252
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,560
From now on, I won't be eating
with Yu Qiao and the others.

253
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,540
The whole class sees me as a problem.

254
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,080
I am not intended to fit in.

255
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,460
So now I only have you to eat lunch with.

256
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,220
Who asked you to push Yu Qiao away?

257
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,280
Who asked you to change for me?

258
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,180
Lin Yingtao,

259
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,340
do you think acting selfless
makes you so great?

260
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,940
Are we eating lunch or not?

261
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,680
Or do you want to make me look worse?

262
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,020
Are you with me or not?

263
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,900
Guys, look.

264
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,220
The way Qin Yeyun treats Yingtao?

265
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,320
That's exactly how
Yingtao's been treating us.

266
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,200
Wait, what happened
between Yingtao and Yeyun now?

267
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,960
I get it.

268
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,440
It's not like we did anything

269
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,720
to upset Yingtao.

270
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,600
It is a fallout between they two.

271
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,920
We're just caught in the crossfire.

272
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,560
We are the collateral damage.

273
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,460
<i>Pass the ball!</i>

274
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,900
Alright, class.

275
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,040
This is the signup sheet
for the Sports Day events.

276
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,400
Whatever you sign up for,

277
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,960
take it seriously.

278
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,840
We're doing this

279
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,320
for class pride.

280
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,920
Lin Qile,

281
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,140
didn't expect this from you.

282
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,500
You signed up for cheer squad?

283
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,360
Looking forward to your performance.

284
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,600
I didn't sign up for cheer squad.

285
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,300
- She's in cheer squad?
- What?

286
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,480
Who?

287
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,500
Lin Qile.

288
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,140
Seriously? With her grades?

289
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,660
Still desperate for attention, huh?

290
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,400
Not scared she'll get
kicked out of Class 18?

291
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,660
I signed you up.

292
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,140
You said it yourself

293
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,580
that if I played in the basketball match,

294
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,500
you'd cheer for me.

295
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,280
So I helped you sign up.

296
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,240
I…

297
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,780
I don't want to do it.

298
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,440
I need to study.

299
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,080
I can't bomb the next test too.

300
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,160
Studying takes time.

301
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,560
You can't just grind all day.

302
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,260
Doing cheer squad helps.
Balance, you know?

303
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,760
Trust me.

304
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,420
Yu Qiao.

305
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,160
Do me a favor.

306
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,960
Stop meddling in my life.

307
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,420
Thanks.

308
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,180
Guess who else signed up?

309
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,840
Who?

310
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Lin Qile.

311
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,840
Can't believe she actually signed up.

312
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,220
Does she even know how to dance?

313
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,420
Xiaoman, everything you have

314
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,480
is so unique.

315
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,680
I've never

316
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,520
seen a bracelet like this
in all of Jialin City.

317
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,819
If you like it, it's yours. Here.

318
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:20,579
I can't.

319
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:21,859
This looks expensive.

320
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,359
Not really.

321
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,440
My dad brought it

322
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,240
back when he went overseas.

323
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,240
He travels a lot

324
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,700
and always brings stuff like this.

325
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,420
If you like it, keep it.

326
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,480
Thanks, Xiaoman.

327
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,840
You're always so generous.

328
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Don't mention it.
We're on the same squad now.

329
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,380
Look.

330
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,660
There she is with that poker face.

331
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,940
She's no fun at all.

332
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,100
She was on the cheer squad last year too.

333
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,280
Barely said a word to anyone.

334
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,520
<i>Excuse me, I'm Lin Qile from Class 18.</i>

335
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,880
<i>Someone in my class</i>

336
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,080
- <i>pranked me</i>
- Who cares about her?

337
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,080
- <i>by signing me up for cheer squad.</i>
- Exactly.

338
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,860
I didn't want to join.

339
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,820
You're Lin Qile?

340
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,020
I know who you are.

341
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,720
When we pick people,
we look at body type and balance.

342
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,960
You've got a small frame.

343
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,420
You're great for lift routines.

344
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,580
Since you're here already,
join the practice.

345
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,640
Ms…

346
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,240
I…

347
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,180
am afraid of heights.

348
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,100
I can't do lifts.

349
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,240
In fact,

350
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,340
my grades have dropped recently…

351
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,560
My grades have dropped, sure.

352
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,960
Still,

353
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,540
I want to take part
in something collective.

354
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,000
So I'll face my fear.

355
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,920
I can do this.

356
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,640
- Great.
- I'll go join the others.

357
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,240
Got your uniform?

358
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,800
Yeah.

359
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,800
Good.

360
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,180
What are you listening to?

361
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,280
What are you listening to?

362
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,560
<i>Even Lin Qile signed up?</i>

363
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,720
<i>Wow, she really wants to be seen.</i>

364
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,320
It's open signup.

365
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,000
If you meet the height
and build requirements, you're in.

366
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,540
<i>Here are the formation sketches.</i>
<i>They might change later.</i>

367
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,360
Hey, can we stand together
during the routine?

368
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,620
If you don't answer,
I'll take that as a yes.

369
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,260
Woah, it is loud.

370
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,860
<i>Alright, everyone, come stretch.</i>

371
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,400
<i>Count your beats.</i>

372
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,660
<i>Chang.</i>

373
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,620
<i>Chang.</i>

374
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,700
- <i>Shen me.</i>
- <i>Shen me.</i>

375
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,780
<i>Come on, step into it!</i>

376
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,800
Yingtao said she wouldn't join.

377
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,000
I knew she couldn't

378
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,260
stay out of the spotlight.

379
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,760
She's always been like this.

380
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,000
Ever since we were kids.

381
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,840
Every Children's Day,

382
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,460
she was the first to volunteer.

383
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,340
I signed her up for cheer squad

384
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,880
because Qin Yeyun signed up.

385
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,840
It might help patch things up
between them.

386
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,220
And if they make up,

387
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,160
the rest of us won't suffer for it.

388
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,360
<i>Shen me.</i>

389
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,380
<i>Shen…</i> Again.

390
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,960
<i>Shen me.</i>

391
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,180
<i>Shen me.</i>

392
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,540
- Correct.
- <i>Looking great, girls.</i>

393
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,580
<i>Shen me.</i>

394
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,880
- <i>Shen me.</i>
- <i>Nice hustle, everyone.</i>

395
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,280
Today we're blocking formations.

396
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,980
Whoever nails it

397
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,960
will lead the routine.

398
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,400
<i>Come on, Ms.</i>

399
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,060
Xiaoman's the obvious choice.

400
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,320
She's made for center stage.

401
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,760
<i>Yeah, Cen Xiaoman, hands down.</i>

402
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,100
<i>You all think so?</i>

403
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,940
Ms… Coach.

404
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,720
Qin Yeyun dances really well too.

405
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,200
And she's got the look.

406
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,540
She should be considered.

407
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,820
Can you not make a scene?

408
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,700
Qin Yeyun would make a great lead.

409
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,920
You did great last year.

410
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,040
But Xiaoman's no slouch.

411
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,000
Let's see how both of you do.

412
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,400
Everyone, give it your best.

413
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,960
Anyone could be picked.

414
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,280
We're practicing

415
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,340
group lifts today. Four per group.

416
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,520
Pair yourselves up,

417
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,720
decide who lifts and who's flying.

418
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,460
- Got it.
- Sure.

419
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,680
- Come with me.
- Okay.

420
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,060
You four are together?

421
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,640
Qin Yeyun, Lin Qile, you two are a team?

422
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,160
- Ms, we're not…
- Ms,

423
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,960
we're already paired.

424
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,320
That won't work.

425
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,900
You need four for a proper lift.

426
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,860
You six, form a group.

427
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,580
Wu Shuang, Han Xiaoxiao, join them.

428
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,380
Ms, I don't really know them well.

429
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,460
Qin Yeyun and Lin Qile.

430
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,580
What's that got to do with anything?

431
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,860
This is a school event,

432
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,940
not a playdate.

433
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,060
No, I mean,

434
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,440
without basic trust,

435
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,540
how can we pull this off?

436
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,040
How can I trust them to catch me?

437
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,960
And they probably

438
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,940
don't trust me either.

439
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,020
If you have that many issues,

440
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,280
have the stage to yourself.

441
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,580
I'll jump backwards.

442
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,640
Catch me.

443
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,060
Are you serious?

444
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,740
That's kind of high. Scary.

445
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,120
What's so scary about that?

446
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,300
I've got the skill,
there's nothing to fear.

447
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,280
Qin Yeyun, what do you mean?

448
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,500
Just saying it like it is.

449
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,700
Can't handle that?

450
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,380
Guess your nine years of school
went to waste.

451
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,860
Alright, knock it off.

452
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,880
Wu Shuang, Qin Yeyun,

453
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,320
talk it out.

454
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,940
You're all part of the same team.

455
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,000
You two, go to that group.

456
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,320
Ms…

457
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,580
Wu Shuang, one more complaint

458
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,360
and you're out.
I can't coach you like this.

459
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,660
Come on. Let's go.

460
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,300
ROUTE 25, FROM DONGSHI ROAD
TO JIALIN BUS TERMINAL

461
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,380
Here.

462
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,260
- <i>Alright, take five.</i>
- You okay?

463
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,920
<i>Okay.</i>

464
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,560
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

465
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,260
This is hopeless. You're a goner.

466
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,160
Qin Yeyun, you alright?

467
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,140
Help me go over it again.

468
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,480
If I mess up, they'll laugh at me.

469
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,740
<i>Every time</i>

470
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,760
<i>we switch moves,</i>

471
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,080
I get lost.

472
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,020
I can't keep up.

473
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,720
Well, they have every reason to laugh.

474
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,600
This is you.

475
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,600
Like a baby giraffe.

476
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,420
Qin Yeyun.

477
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,100
- Ms.
- Nicely done.

478
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,360
Even knowing Lin Qile's struggling,

479
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,680
you're still helping her.

480
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,960
Your tone could use work,

481
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,400
but I like the effort.

482
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,440
- Ms…
- Ms, yeah.

483
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,400
Qin Yeyun really was helping me.

484
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,880
She's killing it with her own move.

485
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,760
She is helping me too.

486
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,040
She's got the moves and the heart.

487
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,580
Pretty, talented, kind.

488
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,820
That's everything

489
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,280
a lead dancer should be.

490
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,260
Good work.

491
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,360
Oh,

492
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,760
and she also offered to stay

493
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,820
after evening classes

494
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,380
and train me for half an hour

495
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,380
until I get it.

496
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,400
That's amazing.

497
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,980
Take good care of her, okay?

498
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,880
Let's go, team.

499
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,520
Let's go, team.

500
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,300
Qin Yeyun,

501
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,080
you know

502
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,320
why I wanted you to stay late with me?

503
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,860
I don't want to know.

504
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,240
Because I want us to go home together.

505
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,300
You know why I agreed to stay?

506
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,720
Why?

507
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,700
No! I can't!

508
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,720
So your screaming

509
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,240
wouldn't bother the rest of the team.

510
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,540
I said train me,

511
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,280
not torture me.

512
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,100
Crawl before you walk.

513
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,840
- Take it or leave it.
- Ow!

514
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,740
Am I there yet?

515
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,960
How many more?

516
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,040
Just 100.

517
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,240
No good moves with poor stamina.

518
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,320
You in or out?

519
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,460
I'm in.

520
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,180
Didn't expect you to stick it out.

521
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,940
I need to get stronger.

522
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,300
I want to make sure
I can hold you next time.

523
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,680
No more dropping you.

524
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,380
Don't act like I only have you.

525
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,280
There are two others

526
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,540
spotting me.

527
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,020
STADIUM

528
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,040
Qin Yeyun,

529
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,380
when did you take dance lessons?

530
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,100
You're really good.

531
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,400
I never did.

532
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,460
I practiced on my own.

533
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,120
You learned all that by yourself?

534
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,760
Seriously?

535
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,580
That's impressive.

536
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,860
It's nothing.

537
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,340
I needed to prove that I could do it.

538
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,080
Even without all their fancy stuff,

539
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,340
I knew I could be just as good.

540
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,100
No. Even better.

541
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,240
I want to be someone I'm proud of.

542
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,380
Don't worry.

543
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,920
As one of your lifters,

544
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,620
I'm not letting you down.

545
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,340
Yingtao.

546
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,360
Yingtao…

547
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,140
- Um…
- What's up?

548
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,160
Jiang Qiaoxi…

549
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,980
What happened with Jiang Qiaoxi?

550
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,440
He ran into an old Olympiad classmate

551
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,500
of mine at his new school.

552
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,980
He asked for my number.

553
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,800
And?

554
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,440
He called me.

555
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,740
Then he asked for yours.

556
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,060
Get to the point.

557
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,480
He's calling you right now.

558
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,140
You've been ignoring it.

559
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,000
<i>The number you dialed</i>

560
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,420
<i>is currently busy.</i>

561
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,780
<i>Please try again later.</i>

562
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,520
One, two, three, four.

563
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,900
Jiang Qiaoxi.

564
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,740
Hey, Yingtao?

565
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,680
Jiang Qiaoxi.

566
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,440
How have you been lately?

567
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,460
I…

568
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,580
Wait,

569
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,340
did something happen?

570
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,540
No. I'm okay.

571
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,760
I'm doing fine.

572
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,080
The only flaw is

573
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,800
you are not arround.

574
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,920
But you'll be back eventually, right?

575
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
So

576
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
it's okay.

577
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,620
Don't worry about me.

578
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,260
As long as I stay focused,

579
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,040
nothing at school can beat me.

580
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,700
You know me.

581
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,860
How's it going for you over there?

582
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,080
If you're doing alright,

583
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,360
I've got no complaints.

584
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,040
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi, lights out!</i>

585
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,900
Shouldn't you hang up soon?

586
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,120
Aren't you not allowed
to call after hours?

587
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,720
Not really.

588
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,180
Lights out soon.

589
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,760
But I've got a bit of time left.

590
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,840
What do you wanna talk about?

591
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,420
I think

592
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,260
you should get some sleep.

593
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,720
Rest is important.

594
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,240
I hope the next time we see each other,

595
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,960
we're both in a good place.

596
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,600
We will be.

597
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,960
Nice job, everyone.

598
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,720
Looking great.

599
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,960
Strong presence.

600
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,720
Sharp rhythm.

601
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,600
Nice work, Lin Qile.
You've really stepped it up.

602
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,900
- What's wrong?
- Xiaoman?

603
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,700
Xiaoman?

604
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,580
- You okay?
- Want to head to the nurse?

605
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,960
Give me a second.

606
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,280
Are you alright?

607
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,380
It wasn't her fault, Teacher.
Lin Qile didn't mean it.

608
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,340
No, you stepped on my foot.

609
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,140
You're right,

610
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,400
it was me.

611
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,120
I'm sorry, Lin Qile.

612
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,980
What's that supposed to mean?

613
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,920
- You…
- Alright, that's enough.

614
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,280
Take a break, everyone.

615
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,180
You two, help her off to the side.

616
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,580
Careful now.

617
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,420
<i>You okay, Xiaoman?</i>

618
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,780
<i>Yeah,</i>

619
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,600
<i>I just hope it doesn't</i>
<i>throw off my routine.</i>

620
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,060
<i>That Lin Qile really crossed a line.</i>

621
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,700
Ms said one nice thing

622
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,460
and she jumped at the chance
to take you down.

623
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,120
You think

624
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,360
she's trying to steal your spot

625
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,440
as lead?

626
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,840
No way.

627
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,219
I don't even know if I want to stay.

628
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,060
If anyone should leave, it's her.

629
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,659
People like that don't belong here.

630
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,820
<i>She's worked way too hard to walk now.</i>

631
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,219
<i>She's not quitting.</i>

632
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,760
You're not thinking of leaving, are you?

633
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,199
If you go, I'm going too.

634
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,280
Same here.

635
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,159
I'm with you, Xiaoman.

636
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,239
You all said it.

637
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,060
<i>But even if you leave,</i>

638
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,440
<i>others will take your place.</i>

639
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,260
<i>If I can teach Lin Qile,</i>

640
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,900
I can teach anyone.

641
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,139
Might even

642
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,060
to be captain while I'm at it.

643
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,340
Cen Xiaoman, don't back out now.

644
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,660
I know you're not mad at me anymore.

645
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,440
I heard everything.
You stuck up for me today.

646
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,640
Stop acting like you don't care.

647
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,760
That was really cool of you.

648
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,320
How about this?

649
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,200
Sunday we go get the outfits.

650
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,720
After that, you can take me shopping.

651
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,920
You said I've lost my style

652
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,480
since transferring here.

653
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,300
Well, you're the style queen.

654
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,780
Help me fix it.

655
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,640
Then we grab

656
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,180
some bubble tea.

657
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,560
That'll make it

658
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,820
our official

659
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,820
makeup session.

660
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,960
What do you say?

661
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,900
I'll think about it.

662
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,400
Alright.

663
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,260
Think hard.

664
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,380
Qin Yeyun…

665
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,740
Seriously?

666
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,880
Lin Qile,

667
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,080
where's Qin Yeyun?

668
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,400
She left you hanging?

669
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,680
Wu Shuang,

670
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,680
drop it.

671
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,120
<i>This outfit is adorable.</i>

672
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,000
<i>Check this out.</i>

673
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,420
<i>- Wow, it looks amazing on you.</i>
<i>- Nice.</i>

674
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,420
<i>Give us a twirl.</i>

675
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,420
<i>Here. Ready?</i>

676
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,080
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

677
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,280
<i>Great for long legs.</i>

678
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,600
<i>Let me see.</i>

679
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,740
<i>Try it.</i>

680
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,120
<i>I like this one.</i>

681
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,380
Purple lightens your look.

682
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,720
The purple makes your skin pop.

683
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,880
This red one's kind of nice too.

684
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,720
Red is way too loud.

685
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,200
- So tacky.
- <i>Let's try this one.</i>

686
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,240
<i>Yeah, let's try it.</i>

687
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,020
<i>- Let's try this one.</i>
<i>- Yeah, let's try it.</i>

688
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,160
- <i>Come on.</i>
- Xiaoman,

689
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,300
you look stunning in that.

690
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,100
<i>You look even fairer..</i>

691
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,220
<i>- Really suits you.</i>
<i>- That's so good.</i>

692
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,380
<i>Totally.</i>

693
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,780
- Gorgeous.
- You look amazing.

694
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,040
Shows off your waist too.

695
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,640
Our team's skin tone is perfect

696
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,600
for red.

697
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,620
<i>We'll all glow in it.</i>
<i>Red's definitely the move.</i>

698
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,680
<i>You're right.</i>

699
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,280
<i>You're so thoughtful, Xiaoman.</i>

700
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,320
<i>Always thinking of the team.</i>

701
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,400
<i>Of course we trust your fashion sense.</i>

702
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,940
<i>So red it is?</i>

703
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,820
<i>Everyone in?</i>

704
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,960
Yeah, sure.

705
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,040
We're team Xiaoman.

706
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,440
<i>It really is pretty.</i>

707
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,020
<i>Makes your legs look so long.</i>

708
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,800
<i>And your skin?</i>

709
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,060
<i>Glowing.</i>

710
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,260
<i>Good choice.</i>

711
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,580
Lin Qile, what do you think?

712
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,920
Like I have a choice.

713
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,860
Don't be like that.

714
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,520
I may be lead, but I'll respect

715
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,460
everyone's vote.

716
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,300
So, thoughts?

717
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,000
Lin Qile,

718
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,540
just go with the group.

719
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,720
Red it is.

720
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,880
Make sure you grab Qin Yeyun's outfit.

721
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,260
Xiaoman, that really looks amazing on you.

722
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,880
- Makes your posture look perfect.
- <i>So this is the one?</i>

723
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,160
<i>- Yep.</i>
<i>- Let me check the back for your sizes.</i>

724
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,280
<i>- Is this your size?</i>
<i>- Is it a small?</i>

725
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,040
<i>- Yeah, small.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

726
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,300
<i>Want me to take it in a bit?</i>

727
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,080
<i>Yeah, in the middle.</i>

728
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,200
<i>Here you go.</i>

729
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,160
Wait for me, this one's got an issue.

730
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,900
Excuse me, ma'am?

731
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,440
This one's discolored.

732
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,860
Oh, you're right. Hang on,

733
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,720
I'll grab a fresh one from the stockroom.

734
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,980
- Can you make it quick?
- Sure.

735
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,380
Wait for me, guys!

736
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:34,380
NO CLIMBING, STAY SAFE

737
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,880
CONTACTS

738
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,760
JIANG QIAOXI

739
