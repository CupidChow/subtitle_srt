1
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,960
<i>Work hard, sprint fast,</i>
<i>a hundred days to glory.</i>

2
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,620
<i>Top the honor roll,</i>
<i>reap your golden story!</i>

3
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,780
<i>Coming to Experimental High School</i>
<i>feels like yesterday.</i>

4
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,820
KNOWLEDGE TODAY FOR CHANCES TOMORROW.
READING AVOIDS STAGNANT MINDS.

5
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,860
<i>Yet here we are,</i>

6
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,480
<i>the college entrance exam</i>
<i>is calling us to graduate.</i>

7
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,200
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi didn't start</i>
<i>preparing for his overseas exams</i>

8
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,240
<i>only after returning to school.</i>

9
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,080
<i>Later, I even suspected</i>

10
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,020
<i>those materials his cousin mailed</i>

11
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,000
<i>under the guise of Olympiad prep</i>

12
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,600
<i>were probably for admission all along.</i>

13
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,360
<i>Because Jiang Qiaoxi's</i>
<i>got too little time for prepping,</i>

14
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,840
<i>yet he went straight in those tests</i>
<i>remarkably fast.</i>

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,980
<i>No matter what questions I had for him,</i>

16
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,760
<i>normal or weird,</i>

17
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,760
<i>school-related</i>

18
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,320
<i>or even manga trivia,</i>

19
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,000
<i>he answered everything in a flash.</i>

20
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,080
I get it.

21
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,280
<i>Even when Qin Yeyun asked if there was any</i>
<i>news about actor Chen Jinhong's new films,</i>

22
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,640
<i>he would go and research for it.</i>

23
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,600
<i>He could've just snapped a photo</i>

24
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,800
<i>and sent an email,</i>

25
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,140
<i>but he'd have the mood</i>
<i>to buy magazines instead.</i>

26
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,900
<i>Back then,</i>
<i>everything came so easily to him.</i>

27
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,960
Nothing Jiang Qiaoxi does
surprises me anymore.

28
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,700
Back in Qunshan,
he was all clingy with us.

29
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,660
New to Experimental High School,
he pretended not to know us.

30
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,160
Then we got chummy again.

31
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,280
Now he's ignoring Du Shang's messages.

32
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,000
Listen, Lin Qile.

33
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,660
That guy marches entirely to his own drum.

34
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,840
He'll do exactly what he wants.

35
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,140
You can't do anything about him.

36
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,820
<i>Eventually,</i>

37
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,080
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi pretty much stopped</i>
<i>replying to other's messages.</i>

38
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,900
<i>Honestly,</i>

39
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,140
<i>I didn't dwell on it much.</i>

40
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,180
<i>Mom certainly put a nicer spin on things.</i>

41
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,460
Uncle Cai told us all about Qiaoxi's

42
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,980
exams for studying abroad,
they're ridiculously hard,

43
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,940
covering university-level subjects

44
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,860
like architecture

45
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,260
and even psychology.
Really absurd courseworks.

46
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,380
Honestly, he's probably
drowning in all that.

47
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,080
Too overwhelmed to chat with anyone.

48
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,400
It makes sense.

49
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,800
- Yingtao.
<i>- It was only later that I realized</i>

50
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,180
- Did your math and science scores
<i>- Jiang Qiaoxi</i>

51
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,779
- drop this time?
<i>- was drowning back then,</i>

52
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,880
<i>just not in the way we assumed.</i>

53
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,220
<i>Not from exam stress,</i>

54
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,520
<i>but from the kind of…</i>

55
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,600
I've finished.

56
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,880
<i>grown-up chaos we couldn't yet fathom.</i>

57
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,360
Have you seen this?

58
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,700
It's been falling nonstop for days.

59
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,040
With such a steep drop,

60
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,200
Mrs. Liang told me to sell the stocks.

61
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,420
Something must be happening.

62
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,420
Can't make sense of this.

63
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,080
How much is it losing?

64
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,540
How to put it?

65
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's just say

66
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,920
she's losing one Audi car every day.

67
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,920
That much?

68
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,520
Why is she so urgently

69
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,420
in need of money?

70
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,780
Not sure, just said it's urgent.

71
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,880
She wants to sell everything
for cash, no matter how.

72
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,400
Could it be something
happened to Jiang Qiaoxi?

73
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,740
I'm back.

74
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,400
- You're back.
- What's wrong?

75
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,720
<i>You're back.</i>

76
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,660
- Uncle Cai.
- Hi.

77
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,080
There are moths in my house again?

78
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,260
No!

79
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,600
He was just chatting with me,
then suddenly got nostalgic.

80
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,800
He wanted to dig up some old photo
of you and Cai Fangyuan as kids.

81
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,380
- Right.
- What photo?

82
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,520
This one!

83
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,720
- This one?
- You found it!

84
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,560
Back then, I was so tanned.

85
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,440
Tanned? No way.

86
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,160
You were only this tall.
I could pick you up with one arm.

87
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,860
Then I'll send it to you.

88
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,440
- No need.
- Just have a look.

89
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,460
Make a cup of tea for your uncle.

90
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,260
I forgot just now.

91
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,600
Okay.

92
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,380
There's rose tea, chrysanthemum tea,
and plum wine available.

93
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,140
Chrysanthemum tea.
No drinking in broad daylight.

94
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,200
Chrysanthemum tea.

95
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,240
Just a moment.

96
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,000
You go first.

97
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,880
Okay.

98
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,400
Could it be something

99
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,120
happened to Qiaoxi?

100
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,120
Listen, it can't be Jiang Qiaoxi.

101
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,000
If it were Qiaoxi,

102
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,540
Mrs. Liang wouldn't be this calm.

103
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,460
Right?

104
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,340
Don't you think?

105
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,980
- Uncle Cai.
- Hey, yes?

106
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,200
Cai Fangyuan's been working
really hard lately

107
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,180
at school and everything.

108
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,040
So if he slacks off a bit at home,
don't scold him, okay?

109
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,620
And don't worry about

110
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,840
the problems he can't solve.

111
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,400
Jiang Qiaoxi's got him covered.

112
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,420
Sure.

113
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,520
<i>Because honestly,</i>

114
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,320
<i>ever since Jiang Qiaoxi</i>
<i>moved to Hong Kong,</i>

115
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,720
<i>- he's turned into a total chatterbox.</i>
- Next one.

116
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,600
My dream is

117
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,680
<i>- Even when he's sick with a cold,</i>
- to become a firefighter.

118
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,540
<i>- he keeps talking nonstop.</i>
- Wow!

119
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,020
<i>I just think he'd be better off</i>

120
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,340
<i>speaking less</i>

121
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,760
<i>and resting more.</i>

122
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,340
My dream is to become…

123
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,220
<i>Even though Jiang Qiaoxi</i>
<i>can't be bothered with most people,</i>

124
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,740
<i>I've always</i>

125
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,500
<i>- gotten the most dialogue from him.</i>
- My dream is to become

126
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,640
<i>- So it never crossed my mind</i>
- richest person

127
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,740
<i>- what it'd be like</i>
- in the province.

128
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,160
<i>if he stopped talking to me.</i>

129
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,040
Who wrote it?

130
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,560
<i>Someone actually wrote "my dream's to</i>
<i>be the richest person in the province".</i>

131
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,960
<i>Good lord.</i>

132
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,040
<i>You can also achieve your dream.</i>

133
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,360
TRIUMPH IN THE REALM OF KNOWLEDGE,
JIALIN STUDENTS TO CLAIM THE LAUREL CROWN.

134
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,560
Come on, hurry up and get off the bus!

135
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,220
Don't forget your ID
and exam admission ticket!

136
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,520
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi,</i>

137
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,380
<i>you promised to tell me</i>
<i>your grades after my exam.</i>

138
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,540
<i>Why haven't you?</i>

139
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,360
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi,</i>

140
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,720
<i>why are you not replying?</i>

141
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,680
<i>Did you go grocery shopping or what?</i>

142
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,240
<i>Too bad you're not on this bus.</i>

143
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,640
<i>We're taking the bus to Zhouzhou Bistro.</i>

144
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,520
<i>It's so crowded this time</i>

145
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,360
<i>that Uncle Cai's car couldn't fit us all.</i>

146
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,080
<i>I'll definitely order</i>
<i>your favorite garlic spare ribs.</i>

147
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,420
<i>Done! Finally.</i>

148
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,820
<i>Done with the exams! Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>

149
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,260
<i>Guess how I did?</i>

150
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,620
<i>And you,</i>

151
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,059
<i>did your high school life</i>

152
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,940
<i>technically end the day you transferred</i>
<i>from Hongyang</i>

153
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,220
<i>to Hong Kong?</i>

154
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,520
<i>Just one more exam this afternoon,</i>

155
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,880
<i>and my high school era is officially over.</i>

156
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,040
<i>Mom's forcing fish congee on me again.</i>

157
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,320
<i>I can't finish it!</i>

158
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,380
<i>But she insists</i>

159
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,100
<i>it boosts energy</i>

160
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,360
<i>and is essential for exams.</i>

161
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,540
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi,</i>

162
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,300
<i>our exams end tomorrow.</i>

163
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,460
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

164
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,540
<i>Yu Qiao and Cai Fangyuan said</i>

165
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,160
<i>they want to have a proper summer break.</i>

166
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,640
<i>Will you join us?</i>

167
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,200
<i>What am I singing?</i>

168
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,180
<i>Everything feels right</i>

169
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,820
<i>Oh, you are,</i>

170
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,720
<i>you are my greatest hit</i>

171
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,380
<i>- What are you saying?</i>
- Cheers.

172
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,540
<i>- Even heard just once,</i>
- Cheers.

173
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,060
<i>- I'll remember</i>
- Relax.

174
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,960
<i>Twice, and my heart burns</i>

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,400
<i>What am I doing?</i>

176
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,480
<i>Everything feels bright</i>

177
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,960
<i>Seeing you…</i>

178
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,320
<i>Am I a fish?</i>

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,440
<i>Congratulations on finishing your exams!</i>

180
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,680
<i>Now go begin your university journey.</i>

181
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,460
<i>Your life stretches boundless before you.</i>

182
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,280
Jiang Qiaoxi replied!

183
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,200
He actually replied!

184
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,900
Look. He texted me back.

185
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,240
- Ask him if he wants to go out with us.
- Right.

186
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,000
Fine.

187
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,900
I'll call him.

188
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,500
I'm gonna tell him

189
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,360
we're here living large,

190
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,820
while he's stuck there with nothing.

191
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,720
- Don't rush!
- He don't have this in Hong Kong.

192
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
You all…have your seats.

193
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,260
Eat first.

194
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,660
The food's getting cold, Yingtao.

195
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,760
The food's getting cold.

196
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,260
<i>Hello.</i>

197
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,400
<i>The subscriber you have dialed</i>
<i>is currently unavailable.</i>

198
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,660
<i>Please try your call again later.</i>

199
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,220
Never mind, have some more.

200
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,240
Eat a bit more.

201
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,700
- Eat.
- Okay.

202
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,780
Eat.

203
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,920
Eat!

204
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,860
It's okay.

205
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,080
Jiang…

206
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,860
Can we get you the sweet soup now?

207
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,960
A gift of fruit-infused sweet Tangyuan
for private-room guests.

208
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,040
Sure, we can have it now.

209
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,920
Go ahead.

210
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,340
- What is she taking?
- Buns.

211
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,680
<i>Yingtao.</i>

212
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,220
<i>You didn't fill up earlier?</i>

213
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,560
She didn't fill up?

214
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,200
I'm going out for a while.

215
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Huh?

216
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,860
Yingtao,

217
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,620
what are you doing here late at night?

218
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,840
Come on, let's go home.

219
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,900
- Sit for a while.
- No need, Grandma Jia.

220
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm waiting for Auntie Liang
and Uncle Jiang.

221
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,200
Ah, Jiang.

222
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,840
Their family moved away.

223
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,720
They don't live here anymore.

224
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,600
Moved away?

225
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,620
What do you mean?

226
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,700
Liang apparently went abroad for work.

227
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,960
She said

228
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
she needed to earn more.
Living costs were too high.

229
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,900
After that, Jiang moved out too.

230
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,160
They don't live here anymore.

231
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,740
If they don't live here anymore,

232
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,300
how can that be?

233
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,240
If Jiang Qiaoxi ever comes back,

234
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,420
he won't have a home.

235
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,360
The house isn't sold yet.

236
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,620
That boy Qiaoxi,
he'll come back eventually.

237
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,880
FENG LETIAN

238
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,800
LOADING

239
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,040
<i>Tomorrow I'm going to the White Villa</i>
<i>to sort things out.</i>

240
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,140
<i>Do you want to come along?</i>

241
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,140
<i>No.</i>

242
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,600
<i>Yes.</i>

243
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,200
<i>See you at nine tomorrow.</i>

244
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,160
That day, I saw you
in your cheerleader outfit,

245
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,540
walking across the field,

246
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,340
and I was stunned.

247
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,260
I never expected

248
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,120
our school to have
such a legit cheerleading squad.

249
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,740
You didn't even look like you.

250
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,660
But at the same time,
you were like a whole new you.

251
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,100
Is this "new me"

252
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,960
because of what I was wearing that day?

253
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,560
No.

254
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,300
Back when we were
in middle school at Qunshan,

255
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,660
for all three years, you barely spoke.

256
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,900
You hardly ever
joined in class activities.

257
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,240
You left right after school.

258
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,500
Back then,
I thought you were just introverted,

259
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,640
always…

260
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,220
quiet and expressionless,

261
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,740
like Lu Xueqi.

262
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,660
Have you been writing too many novels?

263
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,640
You're starting to
see everyone as a character.

264
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,520
But later

265
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,380
I realized I was wrong.

266
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,760
That wasn't the real you.

267
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,160
The you at Experimental High
is the true you,

268
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,840
or the one at Qunshan Middle School
was a new you.

269
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,860
It doesn't feel much different

270
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,000
from a regular classroom.

271
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,820
Whether it's me, Jiang Qiaoxi,

272
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,300
or anyone in this advanced class,

273
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,780
we're no different from regular humans.

274
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,080
Just carbon-based lifeforms.

275
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,960
This was my seat.

276
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,620
Didn't you finish packing already?

277
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,860
Been done for a while.

278
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,020
Lin Qile.

279
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,060
What is it?

280
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,980
Do you think I'm qualified?

281
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,500
Qualified for what?

282
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,620
Now that the college entrance exams
are over.

283
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,580
We're almost university students.

284
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,440
Throughout that final countdown,

285
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,920
I've been keeping
another timer in my heart.

286
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,620
I waited all this time

287
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,620
because I wanted to tell you now,
at this very moment.

288
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,960
I hope to be in a deeper relationship
with you, more than being classmates.

289
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,060
Will you?

290
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,200
Monitor.

291
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,780
I'm sorry.

292
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,520
Lin Qile,

293
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,940
you've done nothing wrong.

294
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,780
The fault is entirely mine.

295
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,220
I knew your answer.

296
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,099
Yet I asked anyway,

297
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,720
forcing this burden upon you.

298
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,040
But…

299
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,400
you didn't come here today

300
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,000
just to help me pack, did you?

301
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,960
You know it.

302
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,120
I knew it.

303
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,700
You came to see

304
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,480
Jiang Qiaoxi's seat, didn't you?

305
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,380
Right over there.

306
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,440
I always thought

307
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,400
he'd come back

308
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,600
for these things after May.

309
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,320
Take his things back for him.

310
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,460
I get it.

311
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,420
Jiang Qiaoxi,

312
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,360
a genius, a star who were born lucky.

313
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,700
What do I have to compete?

314
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,300
What could I ever win?

315
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,660
He's no lucky star.

316
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,820
He fought bitterly for it.

317
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,000
Every step of the way.

318
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,200
HALL OF KNOWLEDGE AND ACTION

319
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,120
Is it heavy?

320
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,440
Do you need me to carry it for you?

321
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,840
No. I can do it myself.

322
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,540
Yingtao, you don't need to worry so much.

323
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,880
He'll definitely come back.

324
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,480
A junior named Qi Le once told me

325
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,020
how exhausting those Olympiads were,

326
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,020
back-to-back exams.

327
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,160
Some would leave the venue

328
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,960
and wander outside till midnight.

329
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,400
Others refuse to return,

330
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,120
heading straight to
tourist spots to unwind.

331
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,880
But not Jiang Qiaoxi.

332
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,260
He'd only call you,

333
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,640
rain or shine.

334
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,940
After every exam, every single day,

335
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,220
he'd call you,

336
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,280
never mind who might see.

337
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,540
That demeanor of his, how to describe it?

338
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,680
Unrestrained.

339
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,680
Recklessly bold.

340
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,320
So don't you worry.

341
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,280
Yes, he had to leave for school,

342
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,320
but I guarantee

343
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,180
the moment he returns,

344
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,960
you'll be his first to find.

345
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,600
BUILDING A BETTER POWER COMMUNITY TOGETHER

346
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,200
I promise you

347
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,820
and Chunlu too.

348
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,840
I'll come home soon

349
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,280
Jiang Qiaoxi?

350
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,380
Are you stealing from your own family?

351
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,740
Yingtao,

352
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,440
what are you saying?

353
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,340
Why are you sneaking around

354
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,320
your own home like a thief?

355
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,900
Are you running away again?

356
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,760
What do you think,

357
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,600
Yingtao?

358
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,260
I think…

359
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,140
I think…

360
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,180
you're here to see me.

361
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,580
Right.

362
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,440
I'm not going abroad.

363
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,880
I want to…

364
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,140
stay right here,

365
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,920
with you.

366
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,000
You're not going abroad?

367
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,680
I knew it.

368
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,580
You wouldn't just
cut me off for no reason.

369
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,460
You wouldn't vanish without cause.

370
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,400
They must have cut your phone line,

371
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,820
and my letters,
torn to pieces again, right?

372
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,340
Jiang Qiaoxi.

373
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,240
You'd never leave me willingly.

374
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,580
Tell me I'm right.

375
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,200
Of course.

376
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,520
I've been well in Hong Kong.

377
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,540
My cousin too.

378
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,340
He even has a daughter now.

379
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,740
I am also studying well

380
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,360
in Hong Kong.

381
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,980
You know how it is.

382
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,920
Top marks, as always.

383
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,620
Could've picked any university.

384
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,860
But…

385
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,740
I don't want any of that.

386
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,780
Because none of those places

387
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,480
have you, Lin Yingtao.

388
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,600
Or Auntie's jujube buns.

389
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,460
So I…

390
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,780
I think I'll stay.

391
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,060
Good that you are not going now.

392
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,140
Having you by my side is everything.

393
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,040
Haven't I always taken you
to the best places?

394
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,160
And did you

395
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,800
read my texts?

396
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,500
Do you know how well I did
on the college entrance exam?

397
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,560
I know.

398
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,900
Northern Normal University, right?

399
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,780
Never imagined you'd score that well.

400
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,960
Well…

401
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,640
with your Olympiad results,

402
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,160
you could've waltzed into
any top university in Hongyang.

403
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
And you know

404
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,980
all the best ones are just a stone's throw
from Northern Normal University.

405
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,780
I know.

406
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,620
And I…

407
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,220
I'll pick the campus closest to yours.

408
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,780
That way,

409
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,660
we can walk to class together…

410
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,180
queue at the same canteen,

411
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,520
and just…

412
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,460
be together.

413
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,420
What you said…

414
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,680
Is it real?

415
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,760
We could really be…

416
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,480
together every day?

417
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,320
Of course. When have I ever lied to you?

418
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,160
You're right.

419
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,660
You've always achieved everything

420
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,000
you set your mind to.

421
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,400
But…

422
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,700
when you said it, why do you sound like

423
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,600
you're holding back tears?

424
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,240
No.

425
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,300
It's just…

426
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,320
it's just that…

427
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,100
when I imagine

428
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,460
our future together so bright,

429
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,080
this happiness feels unbearable.

430
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,840
Then I want proof.

431
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,020
What proof?

432
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,280
Do you have little fang teeth?

433
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,820
Yingtao.

434
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,700
Don't forget me.

435
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,860
Yingtao.

436
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,300
I want to eat

437
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,660
jujube buns made by Auntie.

438
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,840
You're so lucky.

439
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,560
My mom made

440
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,360
a lot today.

441
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,580
Then let's go back to eat.

442
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,220
Okay.

443
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,980
Let's go.

444
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,660
Jiang Qiaoxi.

445
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,860
‪Yes?

446
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,460
Jiang Qiaoxi.

447
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,800
Jiang Qiaoxi.

448
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,320
Jiang Qiaoxi.

449
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,720
When our future arrives…

450
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,360
when we're truly together every day,

451
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,460
could you wear…

452
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,980
brighter colors?

453
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,580
No more of these muted grays. Please?

454
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,640
Every time you dress in sunlight hues,

455
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,180
it's like watching joy made visible.

456
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,340
I think you feel it too.

457
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,300
I don't look good in brighter colors.

458
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,360
Good-looking.

459
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,340
Good-looking!

460
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,020
Okay, I'll wear it later.

461
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,900
Jiang Qiaoxi.

462
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,640
Jiang Qiaoxi.

463
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,420
Jiang Qiaoxi.

464
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,040
- Yingtao.
- Hm?

465
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,960
Don't you think I'm missing something?

466
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,640
What's missing?

467
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,840
My suitcase.

468
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,320
Right.

469
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,440
Where is the suitcase?

470
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,020
It's probably at my doorstep.

471
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,400
Hope no one's taken it.

472
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,820
Look, here's the plan:

473
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,740
you go up first
and start steaming the buns.

474
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,100
I'll dash back for the suitcase.

475
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,840
I'll be back just as they're ready to eat.

476
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,960
Okay.

477
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,900
Go.

478
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Jiang Qiaoxi.

479
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,180
When we see my parents upstairs,

480
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,340
you tell them…

481
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,720
we met on the way here.

482
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,500
And I'm warning you,
not a single word out of line.

483
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,380
Sure. I won't.

484
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Jiang Qiaoxi.

485
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,200
What is it?

486
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,980
I like you.

487
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,900
I like you very much.

488
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,520
I know.

489
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,480
I love you.

490
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,620
Go back.

491
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,040
<i>Who's there?</i>

492
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,580
<i>Who's there?</i>

493
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,760
<i>Me.</i>

494
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,000
<i>Didn't you bring the key?</i>

495
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,199
I forgot.

496
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,340
What are you doing?

497
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,400
I'll warm up the jujube buns.

498
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,800
Jiang Qiaoxi's hungry. He's craving them.

499
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,960
- Qiaoxi?
- Yes.

500
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,260
Qiaoxi's back?

501
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,060
I…

502
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,760
I was passing his place
when I just happened to see

503
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,460
him step out.

504
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,500
He's gone back to grab his luggage now.

505
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,179
He'll be right over.

506
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,679
That's not how you steam buns.
Here, let me.

507
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,340
Just go wait over there.

508
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,679
What are you doing?

509
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,280
- Stuffed lotus roots.
- Don't turn it on.

510
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,160
Later,

511
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,640
Mom will fry them properly in the pan.

512
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,340
Stop pouring like that.

513
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,400
Just leave it. I'll handle it.

514
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,880
Fine.

515
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,240
<i>What are you doing, Yingtao?</i>

516
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,580
I…

517
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,760
I was wondering why he hadn't come yet.

518
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,100
<i>Who?</i>

519
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,200
Jiang Qiaoxi.

520
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,740
<i>Hello.</i>

521
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,980
<i>The subscriber you have dialed</i>
<i>is currently unavailable.</i>

522
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,460
<i>Please try your call again later.</i>

523
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,680
<i>Hello.</i>

524
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,820
<i>The subscriber you have dialed</i>
<i>is currently unavailable.</i>

525
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,340
<i>Please try your call again later.</i>

526
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,580
<i>Where are you going?</i>

527
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,900
<i>You just got back. Heading out again?</i>

528
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,920
Yingtao!

529
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,260
Yingtao!

530
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,800
Yingtao!

531
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,960
Jiang Qiaoxi!

532
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,000
Uncle!

533
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,460
Uncle, have you seen
a boy in black clothes,

534
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,300
wearing a hat, and pulling a suitcase?

535
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,560
He caught a taxi right outside,

536
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,620
headed that way.

537
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,500
Thanks!

538
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,360
Jiang Qiaoxi!

539
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,920
Jiang Qiaoxi!

540
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,020
Jiang Qiaoxi!

541
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,960
Jiang Qiaoxi!

542
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,080
<i>- Yingtao!</i>
<i>- Yingtao!</i>

543
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,440
<i>Yingtao!</i>

544
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,320
Yingtao!

545
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,700
Yingtao!

546
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:31,860
Yingtao.

547
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,460
Yingtao.

548
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,380
You…

549
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,180
What happened?

550
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,940
Jiang Qixoi…

551
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,300
Jiang Qixoi,

552
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,940
he lied to me.

553
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,080
Le't get up. We're going home.

554
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,160
Let's go.

555
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:02,980
Let's go.

556
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,220
He lied to me.

557
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,780
We'll talk back home.

558
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,820
Go!

559
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,120
Jiang Qiaoxi will call me.

560
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,320
Let's back home.

561
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,020
Let's be back.

562
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,720
<i>In 2008,</i>

563
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,360
<i>a financial crisis triggered</i>
<i>by American subprime mortgage market</i>

564
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,660
<i>swept across global financial markets</i>

565
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,720
<i>like a sudden tsunami.</i>

566
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,180
<i>A devastating blow to the world economy…</i>

567
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,480
They say it is the most
severe economic crisis

568
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,500
since the Great Depression of 1929.

569
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,600
And now, just as our child starts college,

570
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,980
at the beginning of their adult life,

571
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,020
they have to face
such tremendous upheaval.

572
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,080
<i>A generation's fate and challenges.</i>

573
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,800
<i>Let the kids forge their own path.</i>

574
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,320
<i>What is with this year?</i>

575
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,520
<i>Natural disasters, economic crises.</i>

576
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,620
<i>Everyone's tightening their belts.</i>

577
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,660
Even my mart's feeling the pinch.

578
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,240
Don't worry, Qin.

579
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,860
The country is boosting domestic demands.

580
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,000
Haven't you heard?
They are adjusting the interest rates.

581
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,340
Once investments start flowing in,

582
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,960
- the economy will bounce back in no time.
- Exactly!

583
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,860
Great!

584
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,620
This carp shape is spot-on!

585
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,100
You've really captured that energy
of triumphant leap to success

586
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,900
I've learnt this dish ages ago.

587
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:42,040
I am saving it for today,
for when the kids got into college.

588
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,960
Now, let me show you.

589
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,600
Amazing you!

590
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,420
I still see them as little kids,

591
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,180
and now poof,
they're already college students.

592
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,820
When Yingtao was little,
she hated studying,

593
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,440
always off playing somewhere.

594
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,980
Back then, I was thinking,

595
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,800
will this kid even make it to college?

596
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,680
No need to worry now.

597
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,840
Yingtao scored the highest
of all the kids.

598
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,900
Even a solid dozen points
above our Yu Qiao.

599
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,360
And Du Shang,

600
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,140
remember that tiny kid

601
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,680
always practicing martial arts?

602
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,960
Now he's gotten into medical school.

603
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,140
Future doctor right there.

604
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,680
With his personality, perfect for the job.

605
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,620
When I need check-ups later,

606
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,160
I'm booking him, no second thoughts.

607
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,580
Enough about illnesses.

608
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,420
Let's focus on the good stuff.

609
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,100
Just imagine us someday
flying together on Yu Qiao's plane.

610
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,020
Northern Aviation University,
that's insanely competitive,

611
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,340
yet he got in like it was nothing.

612
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,540
All our kids

613
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,680
are making us proud.

614
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,560
Exactly!

615
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,440
Hasn't your Fangyuan
already made it as a boss?

616
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,320
Get this. Yesterday,
his dad and I took him shopping

617
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,200
for school supplies, but guess what?

618
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,880
The young man turned the tables

619
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,020
and used his own money

620
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,360
to buy us new outfits instead.

621
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,640
Really?

622
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,240
Nice.

623
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,220
And to think you used to

624
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,980
complain Fangyuan drove you crazy,
remember?

625
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,180
Well, look at him now,

626
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,060
built his own internet empire

627
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,180
with such a big success.

628
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,720
Right!

629
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,240
Your Fangyuan's killing it. What a star!

630
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,120
Exactly.

631
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,760
Sure, he's no natural at studying.

632
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,620
But he got into a decent university
in Shanghai.

633
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,400
That's more than enough for me.

634
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,920
Plus, he got to keep Du Shang as buddies.

635
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,900
At least Yingtao and Yu Qiao
can look out for each other in Hongyang.

636
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,460
But Yunyun? She could've gone too,

637
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,860
yet chose to stay home alone.

638
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,880
That girl's got a good heart.
She just wants to stay close to her dad.

639
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,520
Daughters really are the best,
so thoughtful.

640
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:34,920
Not like sons.

641
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,820
Our Cai Fangyuan,

642
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,280
even talking in his sleep,
he's begging to go to Shanghai.

643
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:40,960
Juan,

644
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,700
how's Yingtao been lately?

645
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,380
She seems fine on the surface,

646
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,400
but who knows what's brewing beneath?

647
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,760
Yesterday she insisted on

648
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,220
going to Hongyang alone, wouldn't even
let me or her dad see her off.

649
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,900
Really makes you wonder
what's going on in that head of hers.

650
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,140
This doesn't sound like Yingtao at all.

651
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,160
