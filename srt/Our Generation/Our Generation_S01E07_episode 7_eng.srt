00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,190
   

3
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,208
   

4
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:47,720
 - Cherry. 
 - Cherry. 

5
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:52,800
Hurry up and get dressed.

6
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,339
Mr. Yu called and told us to have breakfast 
 at the shop near the gate.

7
00:01:57,339 --> 00:01:59,480
"Have breakfast"?

8
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,599
 The buns are here. 

9
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,599
Come on.

10
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,159
- Great. 
 - Nice. Nice.

11
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay, thank you.

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,460
Cherry, try the buns, come on.

13
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,180
These buns taste just like those in Qunshan.

14
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,740
Do you like it?

15
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,939
How is it?

16
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,700
It's good.

17
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,460
Let me tell you guys.

18
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,139
Cherry is still the same as 
 when she was young, so lovable.

19
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:33,780
No wonder some people think Cherry 
 is in a young love relationship.

20
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,580
When Cai Fang Yuan was in first grade, 
 older kids bullied him.

21
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,500
And Cherry took him straight to their classroom 
 to stand up for him.

22
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,499
Back then, I thought Fang Yuan was lucky.

23
00:02:48,499 --> 00:02:52,199
This little girl probably took a liking to him.

24
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,199
Mom!

25
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,419
Ms. Kang, I think you're overthinking.

26
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:58,659
When Du Shang gets bullied, 
 Cherry stands up for him, too.

27
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:00,759
No wonder Ms. Kang overthinks.

28
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,659
When we first moved to Qunshan,

29
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:05,340
Cherry hung out with our Yu Qiao every day,

30
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,039
taking him to classes and showing him around.

31
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,240
I never thought Cherry fancied Yu Qiao.

32
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,900
But Yu Qiao likes Cherry.

33
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,340
Mom, what are you talking about?

34
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,460
Which one of you boys doesn't like Cherry?

35
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,020
What your mom means is 
 that your affection is like that of a close friend.

36
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:23,860
- Right. 
 - Childhood friendship.

37
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,020
We adults understand that.

38
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,879
Yes. It has nothing to do with puppy love.

39
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,400
Let's not talk about liking or puppy love.

40
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,320
- Don't mind those kids. Cherry isn't dating. 
 - Yes, yes.

41
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,839
If anyone can find evidence of Cherry's dating,

42
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,580
I, Cai Wu, declare here today,

43
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,319
that I'll treat everyone at the Power Construction 
 headquarters to breakfast for a month.

44
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,139
Li, remember this!

45
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:45,659
All right, Manager Cai! I'll remember that.

46
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,139
I'll tell everyone about this from now on.

47
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:51,400
Let's not mention it. 
 Consider this matter closed.

48
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,560
Don't pay for the breakfast either.

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,360
Today's breakfast is on me. I'll treat you guys.

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,279
- Four more, please. 
 - Okay, okay.

51
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:01,539
Bring some more buns.

52
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,659
Have some steamed buns. Go ahead.

53
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,240
Have more buns. They're delicious.

54
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,339
Let me peel this egg for you, Sweetie.

55
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:10,680
I'll do it. I'll do it. You can keep eating.

56
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,659
That was such a satisfying meal. 
    

57
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,260
I ate four dough fish 
 and my mom didn't say anything.

58
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,759
With Mr. Li around, 
 no one dares spread rumors anymore.

59
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,740
Now that they mentioned it,

60
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,260
we owe Cherry a lot since childhood.

61
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,779
Exactly. We should remember this well.

62
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:32,140
What are you still worried about?

63
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,480
Don't you find it strange?

64
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,740
What?

65
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,099
Wasn't Jiang Qiao Xi's mom 
 on a business trip to Laishui?

66
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:40,576
Why did she suddenly return?

67
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:42,380
Even if she did come back unexpectedly,

68
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,879
Jiang Qiao Xi wouldn't have told her 
 that he was meeting me.

69
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,979
So, how did she find out?

70
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,439
No doubt. There's a mole.

71
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,440
It's not me!

72
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,459
What are you looking at? Do you suspect me?

73
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:05,760
- That hurts, bro. 
 - Be gentle.

74
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,860
Be gentle.

75
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,519
Then the only one left is...

76
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,760
Qin Ye Yun?

77
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,180
Why are you yelling?

78
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,300
But... is that my fault?

79
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,279
Cherry. Cherry, come over here.

80
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:49,520
It wasn't a mole, but an external informant.

81
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,279
How do you know?

82
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,240
The test paper with the meetup time 
 and place with Jiang Qiao Xi is missing.

83
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,520
I suspect someone took it.

84
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,659
Who do you suspect?

85
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,519
Fei Lin Ge. He cares more 
 about Jiang Qiao Xi than anyone.

86
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,879
He was the one who took that letter 
 you wrote earlier too.

87
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,819
Are you saying he already knows I'm Lin Cherry?

88
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:24,140
But he hasn't reacted.

89
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,630
Maybe he's secretly planning something.

90
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:35,979
Let's make sure first.

91
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:40,079
If it's really him, we'll settle 
 both old and new scores together.

92
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:42,839
Absolutely.

93
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:56,720
Have you noticed that lately everyone 
 has been looking at us strangely?

94
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,680
These people are crazy.

95
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,539
Let's go.

96
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:05,440
I thought Jiang Qiao Xi was joining 
 the second training session.

97
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,930
Why did he go to the first one?

98
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:09,660
He left abruptly without even telling us.

99
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,820
Do you know why, Xiao Man?

100
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,279
How should I know?

101
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,879
Maybe Ms. Liang has some 
 special arrangements for Jiang Qiao Xi.

102
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,360
He isn't answering calls either.

103
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,300
I hoped he'd bring back 
 some real exam questions for me.

104
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,039
Let's go.

105
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,839
- What are you doing? 
 - I need him for something.

106
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,039
- Where are you going? 
 - Let's go

107
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,660
You shouldn't go, Fei Lin Ge.

108
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,599
I'm not going.

109
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,779
Are you listening to her?

110
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:37,260
Let's go. The teacher is calling you.

111
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,420
- Calling me? 
 - Right.

112
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,540
Confess everything you've done.

113
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,520
If you can't explain clearly...

114
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,279
Confess or not? Confess now!

115
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,300
Confess now! Now!

116
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,300
Cherry, will you really hit him?

117
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,470
It's about intimidation.

118
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,520
Can my intimidating presence scare him?

119
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
Yes.

120
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,940
Who said anything about hitting?

121
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,019
How dare you bully someone 
 at Experimental High School?

122
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:31,120
Don't make false accusations.

123
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,419
You tripped yourself just now. 
 We didn't do anything!

124
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,640
You know why we called you here, right?

125
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,980
Just admit it.

126
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,520
What bad things did you do to us?

127
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,580
"What bad things"?

128
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,070
If anyone did wrong, it's you guys!

129
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,000
Then tell us what bad things we did.

130
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,879
You know exactly what you've done.

131
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,459
Blame yourselves for being so brazen.

132
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,380
So it was you.

133
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,860
 Fei Lin Ge, what are you doing? 

134
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,360
Xiao Man, go tell Ms. He 
 about their secret relationship.

135
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,820
I don't have a secret relationship!

136
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,899
You won't admit it? I have evidence.

137
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,140
Jiang Qiao Xi and I aren't dating. Stop lying!

138
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,690
Do you wish you could date 
 Jiang Qiao Xi?

139
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,820
In your dreams.

140
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,420
Let's go.

141
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,679
Out with it. When did you two start dating?

142
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:43,460
When did we ever date?

143
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,279
When did this even start?

144
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,080
No one even told us.

145
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:55,100
How can you two laugh about this?

146
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,480
Ms. He, they show no remorse.

147
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,100
Enough. No more excuses.

148
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,620
Both of you, call your parents.

149
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,220
 Ms. He, sorry for the trouble. 

150
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,100
 We parents knew about their aquarium trip. 

151
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,539
We even paid for the tickets.

152
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:20,360
How can you parents smile about this?

153
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,220
Kids their age shouldn't hang out so openly.

154
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,939
Look at their gestures.

155
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:29,170
"Their gestures"...

156
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,610
This...

157
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,140
Ms. He, these gestures are harmless, right?

158
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,759
It's just head patting, simple touching.

159
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,600
Their daughter even slapped 
 my son Yu Qiao's butt when they were kids.

160
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,819
I mean, they grew up together.

161
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:50,860
This gesture is nothing, Ms. He.

162
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,980
We all work at Power Construction, 
 and they grew up together since childhood.

163
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,480
Their relationship is like that of real siblings.

164
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,010
Everything is absolutely fine. 
 You can rest assured, Ms. He.

165
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:05,519
But even so, you must be more attentive.

166
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,220
They're teenagers now. 
 Boys and girls need to maintain proper boundaries.

167
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,320
 - Don't let it affect their studies. 
 - Yes, you have a point. 

168
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,000
 - Right, Ms. He. As parents...  
 - Fei Lin Ge.

169
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,419
Your photos look nice with good composition.

170
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:22,779
Can you give them to us?

171
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:24,480
What did you say?

172
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,600
He said your photos were well-shot.

173
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,399
Good composition. Give them to him.

174
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,430
Yu Qiao,

175
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,190
so you and Lin Qi Le are okay.

176
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,919
No wonder you were giving us 
 strange looks all day.

177
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:52,360
Fei Lin Ge must have misled everyone.

178
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,820
Did they give you any trouble?

179
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,220
Should I vouch for you?

180
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,419
No, everything's fine.

181
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:09,170
Such rumors are truly malicious.

182
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,600
Don't worry. I'll make sure justice is served

183
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,179
and have a proper talk with Fei Lin Ge.

184
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:17,740
No need, Class Monitor. 
 It's all a misunderstanding.

185
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,040
A mature person 
 doesn't dwell on other's faults.

186
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,000
Lin Qi Le,

187
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,410
has anyone told you 
 what an amazing girl you are?

188
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:40,279
Thank you, Class Monitor. I know that.

189
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,920
No more chitchat. Let's get back to self-study.

190
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:01,530
Yu Qiao.

191
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:04,579
Mom. Madam.

192
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:05,779
Listen now.

193
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:08,420
Cherry is like a sister you've watched grow up.

194
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,260
She just transferred here. 
 You must take good care of her.

195
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,750
Understand?

196
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,500
Ignore the gossip.

197
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,750
There's no way you two are in puppy love.

198
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,159
Mom!

199
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,499
Cherry, don't be shy.

200
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:27,259
I'm not.

201
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:31,299
We adults are happy 
 seeing you kids get along well.

202
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:34,159
- Mom, stop! 
 - Don't be embarrassed.

203
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:36,619
So she's that Cherry.

204
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:38,120
Let's go.

205
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,020
Go back, Mom.

206
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,500
 It's okay. 

207
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,220
 I just wanted them to know 
 that this "puppy love" nonsense 

208
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,440
is just gossip-mongering.

209
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,500
What should we do?

210
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,720
I didn't tell you earlier because I feared 
 Jiang Qiao Xi would get angry.

211
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,880
How did you find out?

212
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Don't ask that.

213
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,059
I have one more important thing for you.

214
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:13,200
She hid it so well.

215
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,319
So Yu Qiao was covering for her back then.

216
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:24,440
No wonder Jiang Qiao Xi hasn't dared 
 come to school recently. He's terrified of her.

217
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,620
Didn't Jiang Qiao Xi say he didn't know her? 
 His rejection was very obvious.

218
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,299
 He was just saving face for her. 

219
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:34,779
 Now she's come to Experimental High School. 
 She's courageous. 

220
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:39,199
 Exactly. But she actually hid her identity. 

221
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,859
Your gossip could really hurt someone. 
 Give it to me

222
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:45,539
Class Monitor, why would you protect her?

223
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:48,220
She's corrupting our class atmosphere.

224
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,739
- There must be some misunderstanding. 
 - Cherry.

225
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:52,720
You don't know her.

226
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,340
There's a Chinese question I can't solve. 
 Can you help me with it?

227
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,559
Come in, Cherry. Don't stay out there.

228
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,159
Cherry.

229
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,119
Jiang Qiao Xi hasn't said anything. 
 Why are you spreading nonsense?

230
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:21,800
They got hold of the test paper 
 where you scheduled time with Jiang Qiao Xi.

231
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,100
- My test paper? 
 - Yes.

232
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,519
They've now figured out that Qi Le is Cherry.

233
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,050
Yu Qiao!

234
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,080
Yu Qiao! What are you doing?

235
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,380
Give it back.

236
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,679
You had my test paper. What? Did you steal it?

237
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:37,079
How can you claim it's yours? 
 Where's your proof?

238
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,380
It has my name on it. What do you think?

239
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,539
Not everyone sneaks around like that Cherry.

240
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:45,160
The paper was in my desk. 
 Did the wind blow it out?

241
00:15:56,028 --> 00:15:58,710
♫  Wish I could wake up  ♫

242
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:03,288
♫  The morning breeze would soothe the sorrow  ♫

243
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:05,928
♫  Wish I could turn around  ♫

244
00:16:05,928 --> 00:16:10,144
♫  The gaze would melt the frost  ♫

245
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,500
♫  Wish I could look up  ♫

246
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,744
♫  See your smiling face  ♫

247
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:18,500
♫  Wish you could  ♫

248
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,232
♫  Tell me your joys and sorrows  ♫

249
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,416
♫  Wish our family could aim for the same direction  ♫

250
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,832
♫  Wish along the way  ♫

251
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:31,012
♫  We'd embrace warm understanding  ♫

252
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:32,316
♫  Wish upon letting go  ♫

253
00:16:32,316 --> 00:16:34,656
♫  The world would return your dreams  ♫

254
00:16:34,656 --> 00:16:36,000
♫  Wish you knew  ♫

255
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,144
♫  Love flows deep in my heart  ♫

256
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:41,724
♫  Life should always face the light  ♫

257
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:45,276
♫  Even if we stumble, we must be strong  ♫

258
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:47,840
♫  Counting meteors falling on your shoulder  ♫

259
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,483
♫  And I'm always by your side  ♫

260
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:56,074
♫  Life should always face the light  ♫

261
00:16:56,074 --> 00:16:59,689
♫  After disappointment, embrace more hope  ♫

262
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:02,085
♫  The end of the night is called sunlight  ♫

263
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:08,650
♫  The happiness in our hands  ♫ 
 ♫  Will eventually bloom  ♫

264
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:19,280
Why are you willing to go home with us today?

265
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,750
Some people ran into trouble,

266
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,750
so I can't miss the chance 
 to kick them while they're down.

267
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,940
Do you think I'm afraid?

268
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,790
There are at least five people in this school

269
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:37,350
who believe in me and stand by my side.

270
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:42,280
I think nobody can handle problems 
 like mine better than I do.

271
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:47,919
You even beat Yu Qiao quoting lines 
 from Chinese Hong Kong movie protagonists.

272
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,119
If you've figured it all out, 
 shouldn't you be happier?

273
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,680
Who's free to accompany me

274
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,860
to the Olympiad training class tomorrow?

275
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,550
Not going.

276
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,459
I'm helping my dad 
 with stock replenishment tomorrow.

277
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:10,719
Cherry, my mom and I will visit my grandma, 
 and won't be back until the next day.

278
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:13,019
- I also— 
 - You, Cai Fang Yuan.

279
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:14,999
You're coming with me tomorrow.

280
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:17,719
You've been to the Olympiad Camp before. 
 You know the way.

281
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:19,619
You're my only option.

282
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,080
Helping you alone might be tough.

283
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,380
Yu Qiao.

284
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,580
Don't look at me. I won't go.

285
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,759
You...

286
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,839
Lin Cherry, you...

287
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,660
Stop right there!

288
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,440
They should be done with class by now.

289
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,230
Jiang Qiao Xi will go to the cafeteria for snacks.

290
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,539
Just head to the cafeteria to find him later.

291
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:55,880
I got too familiar with the teachers before, 
 and would immediately get caught.

292
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,659
I'll keep watch outside for you two.

293
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,590
Senior Jiang,

294
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,520
is this seat taken?

295
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,820
- No. Have a seat. 
 - All right.

296
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,520
Senior Jiang, the academic legend. 
 I've heard so much about you.

297
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,159
I heard you were scheduled for the next session.

298
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:19,510
I didn't expect you'd transfer 
 to our session.

299
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,520
How lucky.

300
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,919
Thanks.

301
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,679
Senior Jiang, why did you suddenly 
 switch to this session?

302
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:29,319
Are you hiding from that Qunshan girl?

303
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:31,019
What?

304
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:32,840
My classmate also goes 
 to Experimental High School.

305
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,759
He just called me saying 
 that your school's forum is really active.

306
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,680
Everyone's discussing that girl from Qunshan.

307
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,140
They say she got go into 
 the Experimental High School to chase after you.

308
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,659
And she hid her identity from her classmates.

309
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:47,119
Rumors say she asked you out late at night—

310
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,180
Cai Fang Yuan said we should 
 turn left when we enter, right?

311
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,439
Yes, yes. Left side.

312
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,759
-  You two.  
 - Oh, no.

313
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:02,959
 Freeze! We see you. Don't run! 

314
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:04,360
Hurry, hurry, hurry! Mr. Li, Zhao!

315
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,640
- Don't run. 
 - This way.

316
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,039
- Stop running! 
 - They're just students. Go easy on them!

317
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,599
Hey kid, stop running!

318
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,640
Isn't our cafeteria good enough?

319
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,280
Every day, there are students like you 
 scrambling to eat gutter oil outside.

320
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,440
Come with me to the security office.

321
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,040
Tell your supervising teacher 
 to come collect you. Hurry.

322
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,140
 ­ 

323
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,799
Sir, Sir. Don't let them chase him. We're not...

324
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,160
- Not what? Stop talking back! 
 - Move it.

325
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,180
I...

326
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,320
I'm here to find my rabbit.

327
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,220
"Rabbit"?

328
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,100
My rabbit accidentally slipped in 
 through your school gate,

329
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,880
so I came to look for my rabbit.

330
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,820
My rabbit is extremely important to me.

331
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,959
If you see my rabbit, please tell him.

332
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,600
Don't worry about me.

333
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,000
No matter what happens, I'll handle it.

334
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,239
What nonsense is going through your head?

335
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:21,440
How could a rabbit worry about you? This is...

336
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,119
My rabbit does worry about me.

337
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:31,939
Hey, if you see my rabbit, 
 please relay my message.

338
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:33,039
Okay.

339
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,739
Jiang Qiao Xi, what are you doing here?

340
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:38,880
Sir, I came out to look for my kitten.

341
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,999
My kitten is missing.

342
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,480
Your cat?

343
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,719
Yes. She's a very adorable kitten.

344
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:48,310
She has snow-white fur

345
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:53,120
and a cherry-red nose.

346
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,720
Have you seen her?

347
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,359
No. There's no cat in our training camp.

348
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:03,499
Yes, there is a kitten in our camp.

349
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:05,880
Maybe the recent rainy weather

350
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,719
made my kitten hide somewhere.

351
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,479
I was quite worried about her.

352
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:29,960
I worried she'd have a hard life 
 or get mistreated by others.

353
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,220
But now I realize

354
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,599
that she's the strongest, bravest little cat.

355
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:42,339
She can nap in sunlight, 
 watch sunsets, and enjoy breezes.

356
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:47,959
Even without me, she'll live well on her own.

357
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:52,039
Because she's the most amazing, best kitten.

358
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,959
I get it. You've all been 
 under too much pressure lately.

359
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:06,179
Sir, I forgot to mention,

360
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:09,510
she is from my school.

361
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,440
She might've come to visit us.

362
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,800
Can I please...

363
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,640
Then tell your friend, 
 visitors aren't allowed here.

364
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,459
All right. It's getting late.

365
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:23,560
Qiao Xi, go get some rest. 
 I'll escort them out. Hurry.

366
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,360
Okay.

367
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,700
It's okay. I'm fine. Go back.

368
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,839
Take care.

369
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,639
Don't worry.

00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:11,540

425
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:48,700
Cherry, would Jiang Qiao Xi know

426
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,000
that you were singing for him?

427
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,990
He would.

428
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,900
He would.

429
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,780
Dismissed.

430
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,480
Let's go.

431
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,960
Come with me to the court 
 and watch me play basketball.

432
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,380
I'm not going to watch you play basketball.

433
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,199
The monthly exams are coming up, 
 and I must go study.

434
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:35,599
Well, Cai Fang Yuan can go with you. He's there.

435
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:40,360
He's busy with his grand plans. I'm leaving.

436
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,559
Then I'll go study with you.

437
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:48,380
You don't need to come. 
 Go play basketball if you want.

438
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,799
I won't get bothered alone.

439
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,220
 Where's Yu Qiao? Yu Qiao! Let's go! 

440
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,699
 Hurry up. Don't waste time. 

441
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:57,199
 Class Six is waiting for you to deal with them. 

442
00:28:57,199 --> 00:28:58,959
All right, I'm going then.

443
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,859
Go on, go!

444
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,000
 Hurry up, Yu Qiao! 

445
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,979
Lin Qi Le, I noticed you're struggling in class. 
 Here are my physics notes.

446
00:29:53,979 --> 00:29:57,959
I said these are my physics notes. 
 They're pretty comprehensive.

447
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:00,559
Ask me if you have questions.

448
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,000
Our Class Monitor is always so helpful.

449
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,840
Monitor, I didn't understand chemistry either.

450
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,650
Can I ask you questions, too?

451
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:14,439
Of course, although I'm not 
 very good at chemistry,

452
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:18,800
if you have any problems, feel free to ask me, too.

453
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,480
Right, physics is our Class Monitor's strong suit.

454
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,159
Thanks, Class Monitor, 
 but I'll ask the teacher if I have questions.

455
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,660
 Lin Cherry, you look exhausted. 

456
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,439
Did you go thieving at night? 
    

457
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:21,840
Is studying hard considered theft?

458
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,939
Studying all night? That's some dedication.

459
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:30,120
Cramming before exams isn't dedication, 
 just last-minute effort.

460
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,410
Senior Two Physics is so hard.

461
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,959
I memorized the formulas,

462
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:38,919
but when solving problems, 
 I realize that's all I know.

463
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:40,160
Hurry!

464
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,159
 Coming! 

465
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,440
How does Jiang Qiao Xi know everything?

466
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,000
Lin Cherry, don't underestimate yourself.

467
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,579
You earned your place at Experimental High School 
 from Qunshan No.1 Middle School.

468
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:54,939
Besides, physics isn't hard 
 once it "clicks" for you.

469
00:31:54,939 --> 00:32:00,099
Maybe during today's exam, 
 you'll have an epiphany and understand everything.

470
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,660
During the last physics quiz break,

471
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,419
who was singing Double Cudgel 
 at my seat for ten minutes?

472
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:09,419
And during the exam, my mind 
 was completely occupied by that "hoo-ha" rhythm.

473
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:11,840
Don't worry. I won't let it happen 
 during this month's exams.

474
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,080
And why do you insist 
 on comparing yourself to Jiang Qiao Xi?

475
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,659
Except for studying, 
 you surpass him in everything.

476
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:19,380
Geniuses always have their weaknesses.

477
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:27,979
 Class, the key to learning math 
 lies in mastering formulas. 

478
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,679
 Memorize these formulas accurately and thoroughly. 

479
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:33,420
 Engrave them in your minds. Understood? 

480
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,759
 Yes. 

481
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:38,900
 Is anyone still struggling 
 with today's formulas or problems? 

482
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,160
 Raise your hand if you don't understand. 

483
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,620
 Now raise your hand if you do understand. 

484
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,479
 Lin Qi Le, do you claim to understand, too? 

485
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:52,840
 Everything? 

486
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,259
 Well, come up here 
 and solve this problem on the board. 

487
00:32:56,259 --> 00:33:01,020
 If you make a mistake, 
 you'll stand for the rest of the class. Go ahead. 

488
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,660
 ­ 

489
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,600
 Class, work on this problem at your desks. 

490
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,980
 Ma'am, did I solve it wrong? 

491
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,079
 Well, isn't this a miracle? 

492
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,300
 Our class average might actually improve. 

493
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,539
 Not bad. Return to your seat. 
 Did everyone get it right? 

494
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:26,980
 Yes. 

495
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:30,620
 Did you? Well done, everyone. 

496
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:45,230
 ­ 

497
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:00,830
Let's go check it out.

498
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,590
 ­ 

499
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:07,800
Monthly exam results are posted. 
 Review your scores.

500
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,719
Don't get cocky if you did well. 
 Don't lose heart if you didn't.

501
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,680
What are you doing?

502
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:10,039
So how bad was my score?

503
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:13,990
Lin Cherry!

504
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,450
You got fifth place in our class!

505
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,900
Are you serious?

506
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,199
Why would I lie?

507
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,019
I ranked fifth?

508
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,930
Let's go.

509
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,170
What about you?

510
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,700
Will you get beaten at home?

511
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,219
Well, I got third place.

512
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,560
"Third place"?

513
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,350
When did you become so studious?

514
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,280
From the bottom.

515
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,530
"From the bottom"?

516
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,859
Then I...

517
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:57,820
Are you expecting top ranks? 
 We're both bottom-dwellers.

518
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,550
You're only two places above me.

519
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,460
If that's your score,

520
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:10,980
my parents won't punish me too harshly.

521
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,119
But I will. Cai Fang Yuan, why did you trick me?

522
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:18,419
Lin Cherry, don't panic. 
 Yu Qiao's doomed this time, too.

523
00:37:18,419 --> 00:37:19,739
What happened to him?

524
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:23,720
Yu Qiao ranked 15th from the bottom.

525
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,820
He did that poorly, too?

526
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,700
Just wait.

527
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,420
So when she previously scored high enough 
 to join our class, it was pure luck.

528
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:48,199
Of course! You can't rely on luck all the time.

529
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,650
Lin Qi Le is always with those guys from Qunshan.

530
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:51,950
How does she even have time to study?

531
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:53,759
Exactly.

532
00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:58,359
Do you want cold water?

533
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,659
If you're here to get water, then just do that. 
 Stop gossiping here.

534
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:06,779
It's none of your business.

535
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,360
Right, it's none of our business.

536
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,800
None of us have Lin Qi Le's special talents.

537
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,280
First Jiang Qiao Xi, then Feng Le Tian,

538
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,939
and now you. Why is everyone speaking up for her?

539
00:38:18,939 --> 00:38:20,760
Exactly.

540
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,400
Didn't we just see Cai Fang Yuan 
 playing with her on the playground?

541
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,639
Don't tell me you didn't know?

542
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:28,959
Jia Si Si, watch your language.

543
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:30,059
Am I the one who's unclean?

544
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:31,980
Say that again!

545
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,739
What are you doing? 
 How can you talk like that?

546
00:38:35,739 --> 00:38:38,939
She's a girl. Why are you being so harsh?

547
00:38:38,939 --> 00:38:41,250
 ­ 

548
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,400
Yu Qiao, you used to have good grades.

549
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,340
How did hanging out with Lin Qi Le 
 drop you to this ranking?

550
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:49,679
I didn't become like this.

551
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:53,360
I wanted to be this way. I want this ranking.

552
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,820
We've been playing basketball together for a while.

553
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,199
Let me warn you, Lin Qi Le is no easy character.

554
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:02,139
I suggest you stop spouting nonsense!

555
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:06,419
 Lin Qi Le really is something. 

556
00:39:06,419 --> 00:39:08,499
 Feng Le Tian looks out for her so much. 

557
00:39:08,499 --> 00:39:11,659
Yu Qiao scores low for her, 
 and now fights because of her.

558
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:14,580
Before this, Jiang Qiao Xi 
 even asked her to fetch water.

559
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,999
I really don't understand 
 what's wrong with these boys.

560
00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:21,959
Aren't you ashamed?

561
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:27,500
Huang Zhan Jie, do you know, 
 verbal violence is more hurtful than physical violence.?

562
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,019
Ms. He, it's not just me saying this. 
 Everyone's talking about it.

563
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:35,299
Does that make something right?

564
00:39:35,299 --> 00:39:37,820
Don't just listen to what others say.

565
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:41,479
If you want to know someone, 
 get close and understand them.

566
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,340
You can't define a person with a few words.

567
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:52,420
From now on, anyone caught 
 forming cliques or badmouthing classmates

568
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,600
will be dismissed from Class 18!

569
00:39:56,199 --> 00:40:02,019
Wherever you go in life, 
 people will always watch and judge you.

570
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:05,059
The "you" in others' eyes isn't the real you.

571
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:08,160
Even the "you" in your own eyes isn't the real you.

572
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,470
But how you see others

573
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,350
 reflects your true self. 

574
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:17,780
Ms. He seems angry. Let's go.

575
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,979
Lin Qi Le, don't be nervous.

576
00:40:25,979 --> 00:40:28,240
When we get to the teacher's office, 
 explain properly.

577
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,320
Ms. He is kind. She won't give you a hard time.

578
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,560
If needed, I'll come in and explain for you.

579
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,700
No need, Class Monitor. I can handle it.

580
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,300
Help me take this back.

581
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:09,640
 Did what your classmates say affect you? 

582
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:12,339
Not at all?

583
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,460
From now on, you should 
 spend more time with female classmates.

584
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:23,740
Always hanging out with male classmates 
 will inevitably spark gossip.

585
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,959
Secondly, the impact isn't good either.

586
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,760
Ms. He,

587
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,910
Cai Fang Yuan and Yu Qiao are, 
 first and foremost, my close friends.

588
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,619
Their gender comes second.

589
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:45,390
I don't think I've done anything wrong,

590
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:48,210
so I don't care about others' opinions.

591
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,430
But they're my good friends,

592
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:55,240
and I have no reason to distance myself from them.

593
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,600
Your priority now 
 should be to focus on your studies.

594
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,420
Class 18 at Experimental High School 
 isn't easy to stay in.

595
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,939
If you keep ranking low in monthly exams,

596
00:42:06,939 --> 00:42:10,780
next semester you'll be transferred 
 out of Class 18.

597
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:17,139
Making good friends 
 doesn't go against my wishes,

598
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:21,559
nor does it violate school regulations.

599
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:29,039
But if getting kicked out for poor grades 
 is a school policy,

600
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:32,440
then I'll comply,

601
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,680
I'll study hard.

602
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,940
I'll try my best to stay in the class.

603
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:41,740
Facing challenges requires 
 more than just bold words.

604
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:47,119
The bottom 15 students will attend 
 Saturday morning remediation sessions.

605
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,919
Work hard.
