3
00:01:35,204 --> 00:01:38,244
 

4
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:43,879
- Here, I've chopped these.
- Okay.

5
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,280
You're back.

6
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,059
Why is she upset? Go check on her.

7
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,280
Let me check on her.

8
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,104
Cherry?

9
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,520
What's wrong?

10
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,520
Is this the cheerleading uniform?

11
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,630
Let me see.

12
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,620
It looks pretty good.

13
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,879
Why did you bring two sets home?

14
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,379
One belongs to Qin Ye Yun.

15
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,779
Will you take it to her?

16
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:44,479
She didn't bother to get it. So lazy.

17
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,760
Yun's family grocery store is closed today.

18
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,739
I bet Mr. Qin took her to visit relatives.

19
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,219
Who still visits relatives at her age?

20
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:54,879
Her family background is peculiar.

21
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,800
Her dad takes her to visit relatives

22
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,560
so that they will look after her in the future.

23
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,112
But aren't we looking after her?

24
00:03:02,112 --> 00:03:04,676
What else should I do?

25
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,799
What's wrong? Did you fight?

26
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,599
I didn't do anything. I had no idea.

27
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,240
And she treated me like that.

28
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,300
What else does she want from me?

29
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,800
Give her the clothes and tell her,

30
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,199
"Since she doesn't want to hang out with me,

31
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:29,579
I'll never speak to her again. We're done."

32
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:33,220
Cai, what's wrong?

33
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:38,439
You're still saying the same things
you did as a kid.

34
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:42,980
Whenever you lost fights with Yun,
you'd come back ranting like this.

35
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,359
I'm not ranting.

36
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,260
That's enough.

37
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,412
- What's wrong?
- Come here.

38
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:53,039
What's wrong?

39
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,860
Manager Cai called.

40
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,860
Qin was hospitalized.

41
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,039
- Is it serious?
- I don't know.

42
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,400
We should check on him.

43
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,270
Hospital?

44
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,040
Qin Ye Yun.

45
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,172
I don't need hospitalization. Really.

46
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:17,400
Please... talk to Yun for me.

47
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,419
Tell her not to believe the doctor's nonsense.

48
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,380
Why would I need hospitalization?

49
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,439
Just let me leave.

50
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,599
Qin, listen to the doctor.

51
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,579
If you really care about Yun, get proper treatment.

52
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,700
We just ran into Yun out there.

53
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,839
She said she'd only be at ease when you recover.

54
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,679
Don't make this harder for her.

55
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,960
Yeah, you have such a good daughter.

56
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,779
Do it for her sake.

57
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:47,660
Get treatment and don't make things hard for her.

58
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,539
Earlier, someone said that I'm blessed to have such a good daughter.

59
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:57,179
She's only 17, but she's acting like a grown-up.

60
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:59,900
I can't stand hearing that.

61
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,100
She's never really been allowed to be a child.

62
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,710
After her mom was gone,

63
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,470
she's been taking care of everything at home.

64
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,539
I didn't help her with anything.

65
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:16,739
Cai.

66
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:22,060
I just want to save some money
so that her life is easier.

67
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,460
I can't waste our money on hospitals.

68
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,500
Besides, my leg can't be cured anyway.

69
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,039
Qin, don't worry about the medical fees.

70
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,620
This is a work-related injury.

71
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,520
All the expenses will be covered.

72
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,900
Lie down. Don't get up.

73
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,940
- Stop moving.
- What are you doing?

74
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:45,879
Cai, the factory has already given me
a lump sum compensation back then.

75
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,760
The expenses are still covered?

76
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,320
Y-Yeah, of course.

77
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,019
It's a new policy. You didn't know?

78
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52,679
Ask Lin or Yu if you don't believe me.

79
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,739
- N-New policy.
- Yeah, new policy.

80
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:56,840
- New policy.
- New policy.

81
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,080
But this is an old injury from over a decade ago.

82
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,359
It's a flare-up.

83
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,472
The fees are covered. Just listen to me. I'm telling you.

84
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:11,679
Treat it properly, okay?

85
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:12,960
Yeah.

86
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Rest well now.

87
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,600
Rest well. It's okay.

88
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,960
Have some fruit.

89
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,539
Let him rest.

90
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,050
Let me do it.

91
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,360
You don't know how to pack.

92
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,520
Then you...

93
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,270
Not with your hands. You'll get cut.

94
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,772
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

95
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,004
Let me handle it.

96
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:46,439
I didn't go today. You're not mad at me, are you?

97
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:49,220
Why would I be mad at you?

98
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,120
I knew something must have come up.

99
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,020
I knew you wouldn't stay angry with me.

100
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,820
I wasn't mad at you.

101
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,600
I was even going to bring your uniform.

102
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,820
Lin Cherry, you don't have to do this.

103
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,339
You did nothing wrong.

104
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:13,740
I've been upsetting you these days.

105
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,140
Actually, I owe you an apology.

106
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,439
But now, I want to say thank you.

107
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,280
What for?

108
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,959
To be honest, I was a little upset today.

109
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,779
Just a tiny bit, though.

110
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:37,360
I should still thank you.

111
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,059
What for?

112
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,840
For bringing you the uniform?

113
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,990
Or keeping you company while you pack?

114
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,640
Cherry, promise me one thing.

115
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,420
Go ahead. I promise.

116
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,559
Don't go to school alone tomorrow. Go with them.

117
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,179
I-I...

118
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:07,700
The rumor about Yu Qiao liking you
is just a misunderstanding.

119
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:14,159
Yu Jin sent those messages to ask about
your relationship with Yu Qiao.

120
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,340
He wants you to be his sister-in-law.

121
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,759
Yu Jin sent those?

122
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:24,779
I knew it was a joke. There's no way.

123
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,120
You knew Yu Jin did it, but you were still mad at me?

124
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,030
That was so mean.

125
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:33,600
I only found out last night.

126
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,559
Yu Jin confessed when he came to buy bubble gum.

127
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,320
How dare that little kid play matchmaker recklessly?

128
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,600
And Yu Qiao shouldn't have
let others take his phone.

129
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,799
I'll scold him when I see him.

130
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:52,879
Just pretend you don't know about this for now.

131
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,840
Okay, got it.

132
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,560
I'll play dumb.

133
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,540
Those two brothers made me suffer for no reason.

134
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,779
Yeah, it's all their fault.

135
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,740
- I'll get a bag.
- Okay.

136
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,690
Yun,

137
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,690
Listen.

138
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:20,640
We've paid your dad's hospital bills.

139
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,299
The doctor said it should cover everything
until your dad is discharged.

140
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:27,020
Repay us after the reimbursement comes through.

141
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,220
No rush.

142
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,819
Mr. Cai, does the factory cover
the treatment of a decade-old injury?

143
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:35,039
I'm a manager. Would I lie about this?

144
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,260
Don't worry about money anymore. We'll handle it.

145
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,079
Mr. Cai, how much did you pay?

146
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:42,620
Let me withdraw cash to pay you back.

147
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,408
Come on. No need.

148
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:46,059
We all know your dad.

149
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:47,799
I bet his money is in a fixed deposit.

150
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:50,020
Withdrawing it now would waste the interest.

151
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,539
Yeah, you'd lose all the interest.

152
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:55,299
That's so nice of you. Thank you so much.

153
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:57,316
Don't mention it.

154
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,580
Yun, you're still in school.

155
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,740
The coursework of Senior Two is intense.

156
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,899
I take on odd jobs and sell fried skewers.

157
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:12,736
Now that it's getting cold,
fried food doesn't sell well.

158
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:13,756
How about this?

159
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,020
I'll take care of your dad during the day.
You can focus on your studies.

160
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,699
We'll switch shifts
after you come back from school.

161
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:23,860
It's too much trouble for you, Ms. Cao.

162
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,019
Not at all.

163
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:30,480
Mr. Cai is paying me wages higher than regular caretaker rates.

164
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,500
And these expenses are reimbursable.

165
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,819
Yun, this arrangement works well.

166
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:38,439
Think about it. Your dad gets proper care.

167
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:40,559
You can focus on school.

168
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,679
And Shuang Yan gets an income.

169
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,899
- A triple benefit. 
 - Exactly.

170
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:49,059
Don't you want me to make money?

171
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:50,799
It's not like that.

172
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,500
I can't thank you enough, Ms. Cao.

173
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,180
I should thank you for letting me make money.

174
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:04,120
Our cheerleading uniforms look awesome.

175
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,520
I'll bring yours to class tomorrow.

176
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,079
With your fashion sense?
Anything looks good to you.

177
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:13,940
It's really nice. We chose it together.

178
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:17,819
Why are you two glued together again?

179
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:22,079
A little fight brought you even closer?

180
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,000
Cherry, since you've made up with Qin Ye Yun,

181
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
can you still hang out with us?

182
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,200
Yeah, you two can argue all you want.

183
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,380
- Why drag the three of us into it?
- We're not taking sides.

184
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,120
You've fought since childhood.
When did we ever interfere?

185
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,179
No matter how bad you fight,
you can't cut us loose.

186
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:39,760
Who wants to hang out with you?

187
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,999
It's all your fault...

188
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,860
How's it my fault?

189
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,816
Because you're ugly.

190
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:52,259
That's why you cut us loose?

191
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:56,039
Why didn't you tell us about your dad?

192
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:58,760
Qin Ye Yun, you've gone too far.

193
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,500
I'm also upset.

194
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,279
- Me too.
- Me too.

195
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,340
You're really pushing your luck now.

196
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,719
Go home and sleep.

197
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:12,659
Stop walking us out. Go back there.

198
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,000
We'll watch you go.

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,220
Tell us if anything happens.

200
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:30,319
We must be more observant from now on.

201
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:31,480
Why?

202
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,020
Don't you know Qin Ye Yun?

203
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,159
She always keeps things to herself.

204
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,899
Since she won't tell us, we need to be observant.

205
00:13:58,528 --> 00:14:00,679
Be careful.

206
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:03,239
Come on, gather up.

207
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,459
The sports meet starts tomorrow.

208
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:11,100
I have full confidence in your performance.

209
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,179
The only thing left to do now

210
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:16,640
is to rest well and maintain your energy.

211
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,659
Looking forward to your performances.

212
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:21,448
- Dismissed.
- Okay.

213
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,759
- Yu Qiao.
- Yu Qiao.

214
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:34,168
Cherry.

215
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,520
I have major news to share.

216
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,779
Good news.

217
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,999
What is it?

218
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,960
 

219
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,016
 

220
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:48,019
Qingbei professors are coming
to meet the Olympiad contestants.

221
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:50,559
So Jiang Qiao Xi
will surely come to school tomorrow.

222
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,459
He really knows how to pick his timing.

223
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,059
Cherry, he will get to see
your amazing performance.

224
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,640
Thank you for your hard work, dear Ms. Juan.

225
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,299
Thank you for making the lotus root sandwiches
and date steamed buns for me.

226
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:18,240
Enough, your classmates are so peculiar,

227
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,679
craving lotus root sandwiches and date buns.

228
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,539
Yeah, these are my top recommendations.

229
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:30,119
Make other stuff, later.

230
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:34,436
Some sugar.

231
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:35,419
That's enough.

232
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:37,120
- This is too much.
- It's far from enough.

233
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,039
No, it's too sweet for Jiang Qiao Xi...

234
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,740
I knew it.

235
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,260
You could've told me in the first place.

236
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,460
I wouldn't say no.

237
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,939
Why are you getting shy?

238
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:10,419
- Yun.
- Mr. Jiang.

239
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:13,279
- I'm heading to see your dad.
- Thank you.

240
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,496
I was away on business.

241
00:16:14,496 --> 00:16:17,059
I just returned and heard
your father was hospitalized again.

242
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,760
So I came straight here.

243
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,700
Thank you, Uncle. Sorry to trouble you.

244
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,879
No trouble at all.

245
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:24,140
How's your dad feeling?

246
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,779
Let me know if you need anything.

247
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:28,620
Don't hesitate, okay?

248
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,420
He's been fine.

249
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,990
Yun, take this.

250
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,370
Take this.
- No need. This is too much.

251
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,640
- Just take it.
- No need.

252
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,416
Take it.

253
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:53,080
Mr. Jiang, won't the factory
cover my dad's medical expenses this time?

254
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,760
Yun, your dad got injured over a decade ago.

255
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,180
It's a complicated matter
to assess his current condition.

256
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,539
So the fee is not covered.

257
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,900
Don't worry.

258
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,519
We will figure something out

259
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,220
and help you get through this.

260
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,199
Young lady.

261
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:23,820
What's wrong, Uncle?

262
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,499
Your dad hasn't come out
of the bathroom for a long time.

263
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:29,600
I don't know what happened.

264
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,419
He won't answer, no matter how I knock.

265
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:37,780
Dad, open the door. Dad.

266
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:42,130
What are you doing here?

267
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,930
Go back home.

268
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,439
I'll come out soon.

269
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:48,599
I'll be right out.

270
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,740
I'll get help.

271
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,880
Young lady, don't go.

272
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,639
Stay here. I'll get help.

273
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,539
Dad, open the door.

274
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:05,439
Yun, I...
- Uncle, maybe you should go back.

275
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,899
I don't think my dad is in the mood.

276
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,700
Nurse!

277
00:19:35,012 --> 00:19:39,520
 

278
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:06,220
 University tuition: 2,000-3,000 per year
for arts and sciences. 

279
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,600
 5,000 per year for art students. 

280
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,000
 Living expenses: 2,000 per month. 

281
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,019
 About 80,000 for four years. 

282
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:20,460
 We need at least 150,000 for university. 

283
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,340
 Dowry: 300,000 for a car. 

284
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,000
 500,000 for a house. 

285
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,700
 The eastern development zone
has good prospects and Feng Shui. 

286
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:37,720
 Yun suggested we stock Cardcaptor Sakura cards. 

287
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,652
 Many of her classmates like them. 

288
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,240
 Yun's 10th birthday wish: 

289
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,080
To have her own pomegranate tree.

290
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,519
We're here.

291
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,260
Yun, come on.

292
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,059
Share with your friends.

293
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:04,059
- We have plenty.
- Thank you.

294
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:06,399
Let me get you some more.

295
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:09,288
- Is it good?
- Yeah, it's sweet.

296
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,900
 Yun's 13th birthday wish: 

297
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,800
 To perform with a female celebrity. 

298
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,100
 I asked the neighborhood committee
to organize a show for Yun to perform. 

299
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,119
Yun.

300
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:28,559
 The committee lady just laughed
and didn't assign me the venue. 

301
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:33,150
 I gave Yun an album.  

302
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,720
 I wonder if she likes it. 

303
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:51,976
 â™« A little straw hat Hitting the road with me â™« 

304
00:21:59,392 --> 00:22:03,250
My waist...

305
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:22,640
Qin Ye Yun, why are you sleeping here?

306
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:27,379
Get up. Time to change and do makeup.

307
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,000
You were taking care of your dad last night?

308
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,400
I barely slept.

309
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,200
I'm fine now.

310
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,600
You got this?

311
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,350
Will you make it?

312
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah.

313
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:16,620
I'll take you back to the training camp
after meeting with the Qingbei professors.

314
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,200
Don't linger there.

315
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,000
The winter camp is starting soon. Focus on that.

316
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,872
Do you understand?

317
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,700
Yeah, I got it.

318
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,100
I'll come with you to the meeting.

319
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,459
No need. I got this.

320
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,100
Parents aren't needed for this meeting.

321
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,720
Can't I just chat with Ms. He?

322
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,319
It's the sports meet today.

323
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:59,580
I bet your schoolmates will get carried away.

324
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:04,679
I'm worried you'll get carried away too.

325
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,600
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

326
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,800
- What's the rush?
- Take some bad photos of them.

327
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,500
Qin Ye Yun has been on the cheer team.

328
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,000
The uniforms look similar. They'll look the same.

329
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:28,059
Lin Cherry.

330
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:31,879
Oh no.

331
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:37,420
Today, I finally realized that Cherry is a girl.

332
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,300
Yu Qiao, Cai Fang Yuan.

333
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,300
What are you doing? We should gather up.

334
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,400
Lin Qi Le.

335
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,180
Surprising, huh? That's Lin Qi Le.

336
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,480
Not at all.

337
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,779
Lin Qi Le has always been beautiful in my eyes.

338
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,200
Class Monitor, gossip can be dangerous.

339
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,179
Keep the nonsense to yourself.

340
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:10,300
 
It's not nonsense. It's true.

341
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,500
Stop looking. Jiang Qiao Xi
is probably in the principal's office.

342
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,900
Come on, final rehearsal before going on stage.

343
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,600
Maintain your energy.

344
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,080
Remember. You're the most beautiful.

345
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,519
Also, don't rush to change after the performance.

346
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:29,340
We will go to the principal's office for a photo with the Qingbei professors.

347
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:34,799
He can't come find you, but you can go to him in this outfit.

348
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,060
 â™« Everything feels like â™« 

349
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,580
 â™« So in the end You're my theme song â™« 

350
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,500
 â™« What are you saying â™« 

351
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,312
 â™« I'll remember even after hearing it once â™« 

352
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:48,224
 â™« Hear it twice and it burns â™« 

353
00:25:48,224 --> 00:25:49,984
 â™« What am I doing â™« 

354
00:25:49,984 --> 00:25:52,128
 â™« Everything feels like â™« 

355
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,588
 â™« The whole city plays The theme song of love â™« 

356
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:57,512
 â™« But the lead is you â™« 

357
00:25:57,512 --> 00:26:01,288
 â™« You've knocked me off balance â™« 

358
00:26:01,288 --> 00:26:04,412
 â™« And then I constantly think of you â™« 

359
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,599
You okay?

360
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,800
Are you alright, Qin Ye Yun?

361
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,000
Are you hurt?

362
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,279
Let her catch her breath.

363
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,619
Don't stand up yet.

364
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:17,960
Qin Ye Yun, how could you make such a mistake?

365
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:23,120
Coach, I just mixed up the moves.

366
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,600
It won't happen again.

367
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,800
Alright, rest for a bit.

368
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,979
Let her sit over there.

369
00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:32,000
- The rest of you, take a break. 
 - Take it slow.

370
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,100
We'll go through it again.

371
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
- Are you okay? Could it be low blood sugar? 
 - Qin Ye Yun,

372
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:41,319
Qin Ye Yun, you stayed up all night. Can you handle this?

373
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You didn't sleep?

374
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,200
What happened?

375
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,460
Coach, I'm just a bit nervous and couldn't sleep.

376
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,500
But what just happened was an accident. I'm fine.

377
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,200
Your safety matters more than the performance.

378
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,519
What if you fall forward when you should've fallen backward?

379
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:08,299
You'll get seriously injured.

380
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,760
Coach, I...
- Safety comes first.

381
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,600
Qin Ye Yun, you can't perform like this.

382
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,300
Coach.

383
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,800
I know it's my fault. I'll take responsibility.

384
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,200
I can sit out this time.

385
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,460
But the other three group members shouldn't pay for my mistake.

386
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,300
They can't lift someone else.

387
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,000
Can you assign them some new moves?

388
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,220
Yeah, Coach.

389
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,900
We've practiced so long for this.

390
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,000
Getting benched right before the show
would ruin everything.

391
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,180
But missing a member will disrupt the team's overall coordination.

392
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:52,719
It's okay.

393
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:55,139
Why don't you all sit out?

394
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:58,000
The rest of us will rearrange the formations.

395
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,900
The performance comes first.

396
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,400
Stop holding everyone back
and affecting team morale.

397
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,200
Do as Xiao Man says. Let's go, everyone.

398
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,140
Come on, gather up.

399
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,340
Move quickly. Hurry up.

400
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,400
Come on.

401
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,500
- It's okay.
- First formation.

402
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:29,892
- You, come to the front.
- It's fine.

403
00:28:29,892 --> 00:28:34,120
Come on, back row. You, fill in here.

404
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,128
I'll get the bags.

405
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,100
Come over here.

406
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,800
Back there.

407
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,700
- Here.
- It's okay.

408
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,999
Alright, third formation.

409
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:07,492
I'm sorry.

410
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,119
Qin Ye Yun, what's the point of apologizing?

411
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,579
We've practiced for so long.

412
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:17,519
Because of you, we can't even perform now.

413
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,340
How is this fair?

414
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,620
Wu Shuang, I know you're upset.

415
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,959
But it wasn't Qin Ye Yun's fault.

416
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:27,670
She's been having

417
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,970
a hard time.

418
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,799
She didn't want this to happen.

419
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,500
Lin Qi Le, why are you still defending her?

420
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,900
You know how hard you've trained

421
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,359
to get where you are now.

422
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,959
But you've lost your chance
to perform because of her.

423
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,479
Aren't you upset at all?

424
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:51,420
Why are you defending her?

425
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:56,180
Between Qin Ye Yun matters more
than performing on stage.

426
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:20,960
S-Sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

427
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,300
I just spoke without thinking.

428
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,759
I know you're upset that we can't perform.

429
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:34,620
I'm not upset because we
lost the chance to perform.

430
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:40,319
It's because no one's ever
said anything like this to me.

431
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,499
Wu Shuang, if you're sad about Cen Xiao Man,

432
00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:47,640
you might as well be mad at me.

433
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,400
Actually, you two...

434
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,240
Actually what?

435
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,700
We were never really friends, huh?

436
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,959
That's not what I meant.

437
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,560
Actually, I've always known

438
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:09,099
that Cen Xiao Man would never

439
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:14,599
stop to wait for me if my shoelace came undone.

440
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:22,339
She kept me around
to show everyone that she's popular.

441
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:29,759
I stayed with her to be in the popular group.

442
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:31,979
So you've figured it all out.

443
00:31:31,979 --> 00:31:33,720
Then why are you upset?

444
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,080
But if I were her,

445
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,719
and I wanted to sabotage
someone's performance because I dislike her,

446
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:42,100
I wouldn't drag my friend into it.

447
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,560
I'd consider her feelings.

448
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:49,060
That's exactly why you shouldn't feel upset.

449
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,620
You took her seriously.

450
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:56,080
It'd be her loss if she didn't value you.

451
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,120
She should be upset.

452
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:09,436
Thank you.

453
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:20,140
There might still be a way.

454
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,679
Maybe we can still perform.

455
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,400
Everyone, listen up.

456
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,339
Memorize the new formation. Don't mix them up.

457
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:32,388
- Coach, wait.
- Relax, just do your best.

458
00:32:32,388 --> 00:32:35,960
Coach, changing formations now isn't wise.

459
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,219
These moves may look simple,

460
00:32:38,219 --> 00:32:41,060
but one mistake could ruin everything.

461
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,520
Wu Shuang.

462
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,580
Coach, the rehearsal went perfectly well.

463
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,100
We're going to lift someone else.

464
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,120
We've practiced a lot. We got this.

465
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,119
Trust me. Nothing will go wrong.

466
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:54,360
Wu Shuang, are you ready
with such last-minute prep?

467
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,239
Coach, even if our group doesn't perform well,

468
00:32:57,239 --> 00:33:00,200
at worst, there'd be an error in the final move.

469
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,480
But if we're excluded--

470
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,700
Wu Shuang, don't be so reckless.

471
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,380
Take responsibility for your safety.

472
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,880
We've been rehearsing.

473
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,219
What if someone else gets hurt

474
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:09,820
because you join us now?

475
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,776
Enough.

476
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,410
You four,

477
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,740
fall back in line.

478
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,480
- Thank you, Coach.
- Thank you, Coach.

479
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,348
Thank you, Coach.

480
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:30,459
Girls, after all these years coaching,

481
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:34,120
I know all about your little dramas.

482
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,380
It's just a performance.

483
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,620
No matter how good or bad it is,
people will forget by tomorrow.

484
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,919
Because it doesn't matter to them.

485
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:46,360
But this performance matters to you.

486
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,759
As long as you give your all and leave no regrets,

487
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:51,999
then it'll be perfect.

488
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:54,600
- Understand?
- Understood.

489
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,060
Come on, everyone.

490
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,639
Let's pump ourselves up.

491
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,560
Three, two, one.

492
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,720
Let's go!

493
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,520
Take this bracelet. I don't need it anymore.

494
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,700
You don't want it, but plenty of others do.

495
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,752
Just don't regret it.

496
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,960
Since Qiao Xi is coming back to school today,

497
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,000
I thought I'd visit you.

498
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,500
You've worked hard, Ms. He.

499
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,099
Don't mention it.

500
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:35,220
It's such a pleasure
to have an outstanding student

501
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,880
like Jiang Qiao Xi.

502
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,608
This way.

503
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,776
Let's go!

504
00:34:50,224 --> 00:34:52,436
 

505

506
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,820
May I use the restroom?

507
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,604
Go ahead.

508
00:35:36,672 --> 00:35:39,259
Come on!

509
00:36:02,212 --> 00:36:05,268
- Xiao Man.
- Lin Qi Le.

510
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,776
 â™« What am I singing â™« 

511
00:36:15,776 --> 00:36:17,832
 â™« Everything feels like â™« 

512
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:19,200
 â™« So in the end â™« 

513
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,416
 â™« You're my theme song â™« 

514
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:24,204
 â™« What are you saying â™« 

515
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,959
Xiao Man!

516
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:30,868
Lin Qi Le!

517
00:36:30,868 --> 00:36:32,936
 â™« Everything feels like â™« 

518
00:36:32,936 --> 00:36:34,688
 â™« The whole city plays â™« 

519
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,456
 â™« The theme song of love â™« 

520
00:36:36,456 --> 00:36:38,440
 â™« But the lead is you â™« 

521
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,088
 â™« You've knocked me off balance â™« 

522
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:42,944
 â™« And then â™« 

523
00:36:42,944 --> 00:36:47,072
 â™« I constantly think of you â™« 

524
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:00,772
 â™« What am I singing â™« 

525
00:37:00,772 --> 00:37:02,628
 â™« Everything feels like â™« 

526
00:37:02,628 --> 00:37:04,224
 â™« So in the end â™« 

527
00:37:04,224 --> 00:37:06,432
 â™« You're my theme song â™« 

528
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,224
 â™« What are you saying â™« 

529
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:11,936
 â™« I'll remember even after hearing it once â™« 

530
00:37:11,936 --> 00:37:14,072
 â™« Hear it twice and it burns â™« 

531
00:37:14,072 --> 00:37:16,904
 â™« What am I doing â™« 

532
00:37:38,788 --> 00:37:42,268
 â™« Memories drift in my pupils â™« 

533
00:37:42,268 --> 00:37:45,052
 â™« Through the window of time â™« 

534
00:37:45,052 --> 00:37:48,016
 â™« Summer cherries are a bit cool â™« 

535
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,688
 â™« I gaze from afar â™« 

536
00:37:50,688 --> 00:37:54,060
 â™« The unspoken wishes of that year â™« 

537
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,740
Qiao Xi, there's a seat here.

538
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,580
Scoot over.

539
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:02,076
Scoot over.

540
00:38:02,076 --> 00:38:06,176
 â™« The world is spinning â™« 

541
00:38:07,836 --> 00:38:11,488
 â™« The breeze is shouting â™« 

542
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:17,208
 â™« The scenery in amber â™« 

543
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:20,604
 â™« Clear as yesterday â™« 

544
00:38:20,604 --> 00:38:22,044
 â™« Reality is in front of me â™« 

545
00:38:22,044 --> 00:38:26,332
 â™« The future folds in the palm â™« 

546
00:38:26,332 --> 00:38:31,804
 â™« You're the key to who I am â™« 

547
00:38:31,804 --> 00:38:37,132
 â™« Accompany me to become myself â™« 

548
00:38:37,132 --> 00:38:40,188
 â™« The night is long â™« 

549
00:38:40,188 --> 00:38:43,012
 â™« My stubbornness grows wildly â™« 

550
00:38:43,012 --> 00:38:45,288
 â™« I can't stop running â™« 

551
00:38:45,288 --> 00:38:48,504
 â™« The silent call of the dream â™« 

552
00:38:48,504 --> 00:38:54,268
 â™« You're the key to all I dream â™« 

553
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:59,452
 â™« Accompany you to become yourself â™« 

554
00:38:59,452 --> 00:39:01,760
 â™« The story sprouts â™« 

555
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,720
 â™« Loneliness melts in an embrace â™« 

556
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:10,720
 â™« I've always been here â™« 

557
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:17,500
Stop fidgeting. Stand straight.

558
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,679
You look good today.

559
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:22,840
When don't I look good?

560
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,772
Come on.

561
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:37,300
- Ms. Liang.
- Xiao Man.

562
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,900
This is our cheer team.

563
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,956
The kids practiced a lot.

564
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,739
That was Ms. Liang, Jiang Qiao Xi's mom.

565
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:51,619
Isn't she beautiful and elegant?

566
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:54,579
Xiao Man, you're quite close
to Jiang Qiao Xi's mom?

567
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:56,919
I didn't know you were so close.

568
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:02,539
Lin Qi Le, didn't you also
study in Qun Shan with Jiang Qiao Xi?

569
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:06,239
You must know Jiang Qiao Xi's mom too, right?

570
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:11,460
I guess so. We've spoken before.

571
00:40:31,919 --> 00:40:34,839
Jiang Qiao Xi is staring at you.

572
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:38,280
It's because I'm good-looking.

573
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,648
I dare you to say it louder.

574
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:52,139
Alright, let's take photos with the professors.

575
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:54,399
Keep smiling.

576
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,456
Cheer up. Smile.

577
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,519
Leaders.

578
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:15,164
This way.

579
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:19,059
Qiao Xi, come here.

580
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,019
Stand here.

581
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,700
Principal, I'll block others.

582
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,159
Stand in the middle.

583
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:24,959
Stand next to the professors.

584
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:26,619
Excuse me, could you stand--

585
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:30,319
Everyone, stand closer.

586
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,519
We can't see the second row.

587
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:33,504
First row, squat.

588
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:36,416
Okay.

589
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,899
Lin Qi Le, move left a bit.

590
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,450
You stepped on me.

591
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:45,030
Sorry.

592
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:48,200
Everyone, straighten your clothes.

593
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,800
Check if your collars are flipped up.

594
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,280
Professors, smile. Be happy.

595
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,480
Why are you staring at me?

596
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,480
No, I'm not.

597
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,440
Yes, you are. I see it
out of the corner of my eye.

598
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,679
No, I'm not.

599
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:03,000
Ready. Smile.

600
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,339
Three, two, one.

601
00:42:11,852 --> 00:42:13,180
Okay.

602
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:21,760
Qiao Xi, you should visit Qingbei University
after the winter camp.

603
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,239
Hurry up.

604
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:25,880
- Hurry.
- Chill.

605
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,000
Jiang Qiao Xi, I've collected
all your study materials.

606
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,340
- I'll bring them to you.
- Okay.

607
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,999
- I'll head back first.
- Ms. Liang.

608
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:35,959
I'll bring his assignments. 
- Thank you, Xiao Man.

609
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:37,439
- See you at Qingbei.

610
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:40,659
- Alright.
-Principal, I'm leaving.

611
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:41,700
What a nice kid.

612
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,100
- This way.
- Let's go.

613
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:57,840
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 The âœ¨ Fans for Fans âœ¨ Team @ Viki.com 

614
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,599
What should we do?

615
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:07,359
I did see him, but I haven't given him the food.

616
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,820
There were so many things
I wanted to say but didn't get to.

617
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,584
Jiang Qiao Xi.

618
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,159
- Hello, Ms. Liang.
- Xiao Man.

619
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:20,710
Here are your study materials.

620
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,480
Thank you.

621
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,039
Okay, let's go.

622
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:26,179
Alright, goodbye.

623
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:28,579
- Bye.
- Bye.

624
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:31,700
There might be a way.

625
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,540
What is it?
