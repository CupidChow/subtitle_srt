00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,196
   

3
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:38,308
   

4
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:44,480
 Lin Qi Le, 
 what were you dreaming about in class? 

5
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:19,619
 Cherry, wipe the drool off your desk. 

6
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,219
 Lin Qi Le! Lin Qi Le! 

7
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:27,600
Lin Qi Le, wake up!

8
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,440
- What's wrong? 
 - Teacher Wang wants you in the office.

9
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,560
Your mom is here.

10
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,299
 Lin Qi Le's mom, you must watch over her. 

11
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:49,000
 She is a promising young talent. 

12
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,219
 Why can't she focus on her studies? 

13
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:54,099
 She is a first-year-high school student. 
 School has already started for several days. 

14
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:58,099
 College entrance exams are near, 
 yet she is still writing letters in class. 

15
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,219
 Several teachers reported this to me. 

16
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:03,939
 Children at this stage 
 lack the motivation to learn. 

17
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:05,740
 As parents, you should take the initiative. 

18
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,499
 Teacher, you are right. 

19
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:10,219
 Please try harder in the future. 

20
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:11,339
 I'm leaving then. 

21
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:15,140
 Fine. We will be in touch. 

22
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,019
 - Teacher Wang, there's no need to see me off. 
 - All right. 

23
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:18,980
 Thank you. 

24
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,659
Let's go.

25
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:50,659
Cherry, if you still want to write those letters, 
 do it at home.

26
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:53,619
Mom, there's nothing wrong 
 with writing those letters.

27
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:58,520
Still, if it's done during class, 
 it affects classroom discipline.

28
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,960
Mom,

29
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,360
am I a very… strange child?

30
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,220
I always make you and Dad worry.

31
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,079
I'm sorry, dear. 
 You should be with your friends,

32
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,640
but now you're all alone in Qunshan.

33
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,940
What are you talking about? Me alone?

34
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,619
I have you and Dad! 
 I have the whole Qunshan!

35
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:35,648
I can't be without you even for a moment!

36
00:04:35,648 --> 00:04:38,679
I want to be Qunshan's last guardian!

37
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:39,739
Really?

38
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:41,239
Really.

39
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:52,050
Cherry,

40
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,570
you're growing up.

41
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:57,279
Growing up is a process 
 of breaking out of one's shell.

42
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:02,700
If you keep dwelling on the past, 
 you'll suffocate.

43
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,419
People and emotions are both fluctuating.

44
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,700
If you keep dwelling on the past 
 and past events,

45
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,479
it's natural to feel unhappy.

46
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:24,340
Does letting go of the past completely,

47
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,619
as if nothing had ever happened,

48
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:33,720
mean that someone is doing well now?

49
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,060
I don't know how others are doing,

50
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,059
but I know you're not doing well.

51
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,099
Letters only exist as letters 
 when they're sent.

52
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:06,419
The ones kept with you are only knots.

53
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:20,099
 Jiang Qiao Xi, the construction site 
 is almost complete. 

54
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:24,440
 The three water cooling towers 
 no longer shine at night. 

55
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,500
 Sometimes I wonder, 
 if you come back to Qunshan at night 

56
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,480
 and can't see their lights, will you get lost? 

57
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:38,759
 Jiang Qiao Xi, salvia is so sweet-flavored. 

58
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,099
 I've always wanted to save some for you. 

59
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:46,000
 If we meet one day in the summer, 

60
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,160
 I'll come see you with a bunch of salvias. 

61
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:53,380
 Jiang Qiao Xi, 
 it's been five years since we met. 

62
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,460
 How are you? 

63
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,260
 Chun Lu died a few days ago. 

64
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,979
 Back then, we had agreed 
 that she was your daughter, 

65
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:08,179
 so I think I should write to let you know. 

66
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:12,000
 I buried her on the mountaintop 
 where we watched the sunset together. 

67
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,900
 You are those vibrant sunsets. 

68
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,959
 This way, she can always be with her father. 

69
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:02,659
Hello.

70
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:03,999
 Lin Cherry, it's me. 

71
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:06,979
Qin Ye Yun, 
 why are you calling me so early?

72
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:11,820
Lin Cherry, did you write a huge letter 
 to Jiang Qiao Xi?

73
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,900
How did you know?

74
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,660
Didn't I tell you not to contact him again?

75
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,900
Why?

76
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,659
Does he still not have time 
 to read my letter?

77
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:28,439
Who cares if he's busy? You two are different!

78
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,219
Don't ever think about this person again. 
 Don't mention him at all.

79
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,180
- Tell her the truth! She can't… 
 - What truth?

80
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,539
Qin Ye Yun, what is going on? 
 Did something happen?

81
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,860
Don't ask! 
 In any case, don't contact him again!

82
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,660
You're not allowed to!

83
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,330
Wait! You…

84
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,480
 Jiang Qiao Xi! 

85
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,899
 Jiang Qiao Xi! Jiang Qiao Xi! 

86
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:59,459
 You must write to me! You must write to me! 

87
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:03,179
 Cherry, I'll be back after the winter break! 

88
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:07,000
 Cherry, I'll be back after the winter break! 

89
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,380
 I know that no matter how brave I am, 

90
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,236
 I can't grow wings. 

91
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:17,695
♫  Memories drift within my gaze  ♫

92
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:20,525
♫  Like a window through time  ♫

93
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:23,404
♫  Summer cherries are tender and cool  ♫

94
00:10:23,404 --> 00:10:26,101
♫  I gaze intently from afar  ♫

95
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:28,444
♫  Unspoken wishes of that year  ♫

96
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:31,671
♫  Your familiar shadow stretches further  ♫

97
00:10:31,671 --> 00:10:34,855
♫  Beyond my sight  ♫ 
 ♫  Your silhouette appears so gentle  ♫

98
00:10:34,855 --> 00:10:37,579
 Girl! Girl! 

99
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:41,939
Do you get car sick? Orange peel can help.

100
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:43,232
Thank you.

101
00:10:43,232 --> 00:10:47,375
♫  The gentle breeze carries my shouts away  ♫

102
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:52,652
    

103
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,098
♫  The amber scenery  ♫ 
 ♫  Appears as clear as yesterday  ♫

104
00:10:56,098 --> 00:10:58,700
♫  Reality unfolds before me  ♫

105
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,379
♫  As I grasp the future in my hands  ♫

106
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:11,619
What kind of place is this?

107
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:20,292
   

108
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,399
 Did you hear the news? 
 Jiang Qiao Xi went to Qunshan. 

109
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,750
 I heard he attended 
 an elementary school in Hong Kong. 

110
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,479
 How did it turn into Qunshan? 

111
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:47,959
 - Anyway, I'm not really sure. 
 - They said a girl sent him a letter. 

112
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:52,500
 Aren't you afraid you will anger Jiang Qiao Xi 
 by sharing the letter? 

113
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,940
 Who knows? 

114
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,450
 Yu Qiao and Fei Lin Ge 
 just snatched it right out of class. 

115
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,360
Are they too bored?

116
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,220
 I heard Jiang Qiao Xi 
 was transferred from Hong Kong 

117
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,480
 to the First Experimental High School 
 in the first grade. 

118
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,530
 Fei Lin Ge and Cen Xiao Man 
 were his classmates. 

119
00:12:20,424 --> 00:12:24,648
   

120
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:52,319
Yu Qiao!

121
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:03,579
What's wrong?

122
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:07,020
I just heard someone calling for Yu Qiao.

123
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,830
- Who? 
 - It was a girl.

124
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,120
- It sounded like Cherry's voice. 
 - Cherry?

125
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,540
You must have heard wrong. 
 How could Cherry be here?

126
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,159
The bus is here! Let's go now!

127
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,200
Student, why aren't you wearing 
 our school's uniform?

128
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,819
You don't seem to be from our school.

129
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:30,819
I'm from No. 11 High School.

130
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:32,579
No. 11 High School?

131
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,720
I'm here to find my friend.

132
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,320
Are you here to find Jiang Qiao Xi?

133
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,340
So you're that Cherry?

134
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,240
What is your relationship with Jiang Qiao Xi?

135
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,110
Did you really write that letter?

136
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,760
Forget about the letter you wrote. 
 Why did you come to his school?

137
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,100
Oh, my! If she's here, 
 then she really knows Jiang Qiao Xi.

138
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,080
 Jiang Qiao Xi! 

139
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,180
Jiang Qiao Xi is here. So is Cen Xiao Man.

140
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,920
Jiang Qiao Xi! Jiang Qiao Xi!

141
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:10,800
She really came to find you.

142
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,639
Doesn't she know 
 she's causing him trouble?

143
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,710
It's none of your business.

144
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,539
Don't bother. 
 I don't need you to resolve this.

145
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:20,139
But she…

146
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:08,280
I don't know her.

147
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:13,120
Then, who is she?

148
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,480
He doesn't know her.

149
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,939
He probably doesn't want 
 to get involved with her.

150
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:19,680
If Jiang Qiao Xi says he doesn't know her, 
 then he doesn't.

151
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,279
He is not the type to lie.

152
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,979
Really?

153
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:05,860
Girl, don't!

154
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,000
Come down! What are you doing?

155
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,800
If you jump off, it'll be serious!

156
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,760
Girl!

157
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:18,220
Did you do poorly in your exam, 
 or did you fight with your family?

158
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,279
Come down now, child.

159
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,860
Hurry! I'll catch you.

160
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,560
Come down! Come down now!

161
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,910
Why are you so stubborn? 
 Come down, it's high up there!

162
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,530
Hurry!

163
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,380
- Be careful. 
 - I didn't intend to jump off.

164
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,079
- Hurry. 
 - I didn't intend to…

165
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,179
Be careful! Look how high it is!

166
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:43,819
- I'm really fine. 
 - How can you be so bold?

167
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:47,939
Where are your family members? 
 Come here!

168
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,759
Soft drinks are cold. Drink some hot water.

169
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:57,359
- Thank you. 
 - Dry yourself.

170
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,020
Watch my TV. This is a good show.

171
00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:22,659
Where can I find such a good man?

172
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:09,519
Auntie, I'm leaving. Thank you.

173
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,350
 Girl, don't leave! 

174
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,960
 I'll take you to a nice place! 

175
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,470
Here.

176
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,376
♫  You locked up your heart  ♫

177
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:32,992
♫  The key is in the clouds  ♫

178
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:36,544
♫  Drifting through dreams  ♫

179
00:18:36,544 --> 00:18:40,196
♫  Without leaving any traces  ♫

180
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:43,676
♫  When we were young  ♫

181
00:18:43,676 --> 00:18:46,844
♫  We couldn't fly beyond our fingertips  ♫

182
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:48,868
♫  Yet I am willing  ♫

183
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:54,604
♫  To hold up a dim light for you like a star  ♫

184
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:57,184
♫  Under the gentle night sky  ♫

185
00:18:57,184 --> 00:18:59,108
♫  You pretend to walk far away  ♫

186
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:00,920
♫  The palms of my hands are still cold  ♫

187
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,190
♫  My breath still lingers  ♫

188
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,236
♫  We ebb and flow like ocean tides  ♫

189
00:19:06,236 --> 00:19:08,532
♫  A pattern repeated until the end  ♫

190
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:11,676
♫  I will follow you  ♫

191
00:19:11,676 --> 00:19:15,417
♫  You are the reason I still burn  ♫

192
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:20,872
♫  Memories are invading  ♫ 
 ♫  An unknown, forbidden land  ♫

193
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:25,408
♫  I turned around and fell  ♫ 
 ♫  Into your unspoken love  ♫

194
00:19:25,408 --> 00:19:29,116
♫  You are the reason I still shine  ♫

195
00:19:29,116 --> 00:19:31,132
♫  I miss you  ♫

196
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:34,652
♫  Thoughts crushed the light of dawn  ♫

197
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:39,300
♫  They turned into a page in a dream  ♫

198
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,720
♫  Filled with you  ♫

199
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,280
Jiang Qiao Xi, your mom called me.

200
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,739
She is on her way to pick you up 
 and take you home.

201
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:49,609
Have you been following me?

202
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:52,560
I sensed you weren't in a good mood. I…

203
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,770
I won't tell your mom.

204
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:08,280
 Girl, let's go! 

205
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,340
Let's see something nice.

206
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,140
Wait.

207
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,700
Be careful!

208
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:07,600
Cherry! Cherry!

209
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,120
How did you end up like this?

210
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,640
Who are you?

211
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,040
I…

212
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,339
Take a look at your injury. 
 Can you still make jokes?

213
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:30,440
How did you hurt your foot? Is it serious?

214
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,099
I'm fine. 
 My shoelace was loose, and I tripped.

215
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:37,279
You're already an adult. I'll carry you!

216
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:40,119
If you keep walking, it will hurt more.

217
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:43,859
I'm an adult. Why should you carry me?

218
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:45,480
Why are you so polite with me?

219
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,759
One of your feet is 24.65 in. (62.61 cm), 
 and the other is 24.8 in. (62.99 cm).

220
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:49,200
I feel bad seeing you walk like this.

221
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,600
Then, close your eyes. Don't look.

222
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,480
Lin Cherry, you have snot on your face!

223
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,159
Who says so?

224
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:06,519
Remember the heart-shaped liqueur chocolates 
 at Uncle Tan and Aunt Pei's wedding?

225
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:07,960
You watched Du Shang and me finish ours,

226
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,319
then insisted on showing off 
 your piece of chocolate.

227
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,019
In the end, it fell into the ditch.

228
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:14,859
You cried for a long time 
 and the snot dried on your face. You…

229
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:17,480
Stop it! Keep quiet! Don't make fun of me!

230
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,320
You and Cai Fang Yuan are cowards!

231
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,440
In your childhood, you climbed that tall locust tree 
 and didn't dare come down!

232
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,660
Wei Yong passed by, 
 and you both called out…

233
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:29,100
Stop talking about it! Be careful!

234
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,959
- Come here. 
 - What are you doing?

235
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:47,499
Put me down, I…

236
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,119
- Let's go! 
 - I can walk on my own.

237
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,119
- Stop it. 
 - Enough! I can't see!

238
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,200
Let go! Let go!

239
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,880
I can walk by myself. 
 I don't need you to carry me.

240
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,519
We've known each other 
 since we were young.

241
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:00,359
We're only a few years older now.

242
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:02,400
Still using the trick of keeping a distance 
 between males and females.

243
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,539
No means no. Especially for you.

244
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:07,019
Why?

245
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,980
Because someone will be sad.

246
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:12,539
It's your actions that upset others.

247
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,439
What's wrong with me?

248
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,859
When your eyes cry like that, 
 who could be sadder than you?

249
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,040
Buy some water and tissues for me. Thanks.

250
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,159
What are you doing?

251
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,530
It's just tissues and water. 
 Do I need your money for that?

252
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,090
Take it.

253
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,540
Here.

254
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:21,099
Drink some water.

255
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,820
Slow down.

256
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,039
Why don't you ask me 
 why I came to the provincial city?

257
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,440
Later, we'll go to my place. 
 What would you like to eat?

258
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,420
Today I went to your school

259
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,690
and heard a lot of rumors about me.

260
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,380
Shouldn't you have said something to me

261
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,859
about Jiang Qiao Xi?

262
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,750
Cherry,

263
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,010
stop thinking about Jiang Qiao Xi.

264
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:08,680
He is no longer the person we knew 
 when we were young.

265
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:12,259
Then who is he?

266
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,700
Ever since he came here, 
 he has kept his distance from us.

267
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,819
As if we never knew each other!

268
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:24,359
Cherry, from now on, 
 let's also pretend not to know him.

269
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:35,080
Why didn't he contact me all these years?

270
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,319
Whenever I asked you about him, 
 you always said he was busy studying.

271
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,300
It's Qin Ye Yun.

272
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,420
She said girls would be upset

273
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,860
and wouldn't allow us to talk about it.

274
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,419
What about that letter? 
 What's going on with it?

275
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,000
Why does everyone know about it?

276
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,630
It was Fei Lin Ge who shared the letter.

277
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,060
He is Jiang Qiao Xi's friend now.

278
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,159
- Today, because of this, I— 
 - Did Jiang Qiao Xi tell him to do that?

279
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,559
Even if Jiang Qiao Xi didn't do so, 
 he silently agreed to it.

280
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,150
I saw Jiang Qiao Xi today.

281
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,190
He has grown much taller.

282
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:30,019
I could still recognize him at first glance,

283
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:35,780
but in front of everyone, 
 he said that he didn't know me.

284
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,360
Why did he become like this?

285
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:47,019
Cherry, didn't you always say 
 the provincial city ruins people?

286
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:53,020
Just consider the Jiang Qiao Xi we knew 
 was ruined by the provincial city.

287
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,880
That's right.

288
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,370
He was completely ruined.

289
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,640
My parents would be thrilled 
 if they knew you were here.

290
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,200
Of course.

291
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,830
Uncle Yu and Aunt Zhang Ping liked me the most 
 while they were in Qunshan.

292
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,720
Yes! My mom always said

293
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,300
she wanted to steal you away from your family 
 and make you her daughter.

294
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,780
- What's wrong? 
 - That's Jiang Qiao Xi's family car.

295
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,910
The building in front 
 is the organization's headquarters.

296
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,130
   

297
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,459
Aunt Liang, I won't go up. 
 I'll take a taxi back.

298
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,459
Xiao Man, 
 I'll call your parents to pick you up.

299
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:58,360
There is no need, Aunt Liang.

300
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,880
Please don't tell my parents about this.

301
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,200
I'm so disappointed with you 
 over today's matter.

302
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,179
At your age, 
 you should focus on your studies.

303
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:11,619
How could you be with him?

304
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:13,519
I understand, Aunt Liang

305
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,910
but I hope you don't blame Jiang Qiao Xi.

306
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,110
We definitely won't do this again.

307
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:24,820
Where do you think they went?

308
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:29,319
Who knows? 
 That girl's name is Cen Xiao Man.

309
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:33,400
They say she's the class beauty. 
 Her grades are also good.

310
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,819
Jiang Qiao Xi is first in the class. 
 She's second.

311
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,440
Are they very close?

312
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,939
Well, I don't know.

313
00:28:48,939 --> 00:28:51,450
Jiang Qiao Xi hasn't talked to us 
 in a long time.

314
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,110
He only hangs out with the good students.

315
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,540
Like that girl?

316
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,719
There are others, too. 
 Also, there's a boy who's quite annoying.

317
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,880
I heard someone wrote him a love letter. 
 It caused quite a stir.

318
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,920
Many have written love letters to him,

319
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,610
but he ignores them all.

320
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,260
-  I'll take you back. 
 - There is no need. Really, Aunt Liang.

321
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,759
Go back and get some rest.

322
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,880
All right. Take care.

323
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,380
All right.

324
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,720
Are you saying that… Jiang Qiao Xi 
 allowed my letter to be shared,

325
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,719
because of that girl?

326
00:29:54,979 --> 00:29:59,119
That's out of my league. 
 I don't know anything about it.

327
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,919
Let's go back.

328
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:10,019
- They are here. 
  - Yu Qiao. 

329
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,600
 On my way! 

330
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:14,709
 - Lin Cherry. 
 - You… 

331
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:16,840
- Cherry! 
 - Cherry!

332
00:30:19,739 --> 00:30:23,340
You two arrived too late. She's already gone.

333
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,140
She's gone?

334
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,759
Fine. We're leaving too.

335
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,580
You two!

336
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,959
Lin Cherry!

337
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,739
Cherry!

338
00:30:36,739 --> 00:30:40,179
Do you think we didn't recognize you 
 when you changed your vest?

339
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:44,159
I knew you wouldn't leave 
 until you had seen us.

340
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,280
You two find people more easily now

341
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,659
than when we used to play hide-and-seek.

342
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:49,699
All right.

343
00:30:49,699 --> 00:30:52,980
Here is the change of clothes 
 Qin Ye Yun told me to bring you.

344
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,292
She is helping her father sort out the goods 
 and won't be here.

345
00:30:56,964 --> 00:30:59,380
How is Uncle Qin's leg?

346
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,340
He is reluctant to spend money on hospital visits 
 and continues to practice qigong.

347
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,259
Does it help?

348
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:07,179
Only Uncle Qin believes it's helpful. 
 Perhaps it's psychological.

349
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:10,060
He said he has gotten much better.

350
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,860
Let's eat.

351
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,219
Be careful.

352
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:16,779
All right, I've got it.

353
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:19,870
Cherry, tell us about Qunshan.

354
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,179
I really miss the old times.

355
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:25,140
Has my house been demolished?

356
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,440
Almost everything has been demolished.

357
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:36,899
Are you lonely in Qunshan?

358
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:43,860
Did you know

359
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,359
that the Strawberry Field 
 still bears strawberries every year?

360
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,419
The sunflowers are blooming too.

361
00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:55,580
That big locust tree is so full of spring blossoms 
  that I can't eat them all.

362
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,100
I'm now the only one who can eat 
 the steamed locust flower rice my mom cooks.

363
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,100
That's wonderful.

364
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:03,739
Enough of that. How about you? 
 How have you been?

365
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:06,119
Cherry, your parents are here!

366
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,419
Welcome.

367
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:09,100
Sister Ping. Cherry!

368
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,999
- Dad. 
 - You're strangling me!

369
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:14,380
You can't get lost! See? What did I say?

370
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,499
No matter where you are,  
 we can always find you. Don't you agree?

371
00:32:17,499 --> 00:32:19,900
- You scared us to death. 
 - Everything's fine.

372
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,240
- It's all right. 
 - She is here. Where else could she go?

373
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,259
- Yes. Isn't she at Old Yu's house? 
 - She couldn't have gotten lost. Could she?

374
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:26,519
- Take a seat, Hai Feng! Sit down! 
 - Take a seat!

375
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:28,259
- Take a seat! 
 - Put your bags down!

376
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:29,759
I'm sorry to make you worry.

377
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:31,820
Let us know next time.

378
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,319
- I've decided on this! 
 - What did you decide?

379
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,820
Cherry, next semester, 
 you'll transfer to Experimental High School.

380
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,499
Cherry, you should listen to me. 
 Don't stay in Qunshan with your parents.

381
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,780
Transfer here and attend the same school 
 as Yu Qiao and the others. Isn't that great?

382
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,419
Old Lin, listen to my advice.

383
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:48,340
In any case, our project 
 will be finished in a year.

384
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,219
That's right! Hai Feng, you know

385
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:55,620
how Cherry likes a lively atmosphere 
 and being around people.

386
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,300
I don't think she can be happy 
 being alone in Qunshan.

387
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,620
I can be happy anywhere, Aunt Zhang.

388
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,780
- Cherry, you shouldn't be so understanding. 
 - That's right.

389
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,830
We've watched you grow up 
 since you were little.

390
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,440
Your parents may not talk about it, 
 but we've arranged for you to attend school.

391
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,759
That's right.

392
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,580
It would be great if Manager Jiang 
 was also here today.

393
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,380
He could help speed up your house matters.

394
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,499
It's not urgent.

395
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,780
He knew you were coming 
 and wanted to see you,

396
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,499
but something happened.

397
00:33:26,499 --> 00:33:30,720
Qiao Xi ran off with a girl from his class.

398
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,900
Liang Hong Fei caught them 
 and brought them back.

399
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,700
It's nothing.

400
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,260
Slow down.

401
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,620
Where are you taking me?

402
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,780
Du Shang, can you speed up?

403
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,019
Yu Qiao, slow down. 
 Du Shang is carrying Cherry.

404
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:50,219
Yes, I'm carrying someone. 
 You two, slow down!

405
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:53,599
Lin Cherry, aren't you a little too heavy?

406
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,400
Am I heavy? You're light! 
 Let Du Shang carry you!

407
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,760
What are you doing? Breaking into the park 
 in the middle of the night?

408
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,900
Quickly. Come inside and you'll find out.

409
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,739
- Let's go. 
 - Come on, Heroine.

410
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:14,380
- Hurry! 
 - What are you up to?

411
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,860
I can climb up by myself.

412
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,860
Be careful.

413
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:24,619
Not bad! You're quite flexible!

414
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:26,380
Wait for me!

415
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,080
Be careful.

416
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,760
 Hurry! 

417
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,260
 It's so far. 

418
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,579
Cherry, remember how that cliff blocked us 
 when we were little?

419
00:34:58,579 --> 00:34:59,910
After such a long hike,

420
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,099
we still didn't get to see the big white goose 
 you longed to see.

421
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:05,220
 Today, you'll get to see swans! 

422
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,580
 Consider them as big white geese! 

423
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:12,139
Cherry, look! That swan is the bravest 
 and loves showing off the most.

424
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:15,059
We think it looks like you 
 when you were young.

425
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:17,539
That's right. Doesn't it look like her?

426
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,619
Be mindful of your words.

427
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:31,780
What?

428
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,499
The provincial city didn't ruin you all.

429
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:38,499
Cherry, join us in the provincial city!

430
00:35:38,499 --> 00:35:42,039
It's not you who needs us. 
 We need you instead!

431
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:45,120
No. Stop being so cheesy when you talk.

432
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,239
Ignore him. 
 He's been this way since he was little.

433
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:51,459
I hate you guys!

434
00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:56,019
Cherry, we've already decided. 
 Are you coming or not?

435
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,239
I hate you guys!

436
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:08,599
Cherry, stop crying.

437
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,160
Quick, look behind you! 
 It seems like someone is there.

438
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,540
Darn!

439
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,599
Be careful!

440
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,900
I hate you guys! Cai Fang Yuan.

441
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,060
The last one, watch your back!

442
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,040
I…

443
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:30,199
Slow down!

444
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:32,059
- Yu Qiao is the last one. 
 - Yu Qiao, you're last.

445
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:35,139
- I'm on my way. 
 - Slow down! Take it slow!

446
00:37:04,459 --> 00:37:06,059
Cherry!

447
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,459
Why are you here?

448
00:37:18,459 --> 00:37:23,160
Qin Ye Yun told me you were here. 
 I came to find you.

449
00:37:25,539 --> 00:37:27,539
Do we know each other?

450
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,060
I'm sorry, Cherry.

451
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,999
Why did you say you didn't know me?

452
00:37:56,499 --> 00:37:59,470
At the time, 
 I couldn't think of a better solution.

453
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:03,220
I thought it was the best option.

454
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,320
The best option?

455
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:11,139
Did you think that 
 if you said you didn't know me,

456
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:14,280
it wouldn't put me in the spotlight

457
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,100
or let others hurt me?

458
00:38:19,879 --> 00:38:22,939
Even so, you had many other options.

459
00:38:22,939 --> 00:38:27,419
You could tell them we were friends once.

460
00:38:27,419 --> 00:38:31,319
That letter wasn't a love letter. 
 Chun Lu was a rabbit.

461
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:42,739
At that time, 
 I couldn't say anything like that.

462
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:49,339
Was it inconvenient 
 because others were present?

463
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,980
Let's take a different path.

464
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,502
   

465
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:49,099
 That girl's name is Cen Xiao Man. 

466
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:53,099
 They say she's the class beauty. 
 Her grades are also good. 

467
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,900
 Jiang Qiao Xi is first in the class. 
 She's second. 

468
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,300
 Jiang Qiao Xi hasn't talked to us 
 in a long time. 

469
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,680
 He only hangs out with the good students. 

470
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:08,459
 At that time, 
 I couldn't say anything like that. 

471
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:12,759
 Was it inconvenient 
 because others were present? 

472
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,199
 Qiao Xi ran off with a girl from his class. 

473
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:23,580
 Liang Hong Fei caught them 
 and brought them back.

 ~ Song of the Sunflower ~ 
 Shang Shang - Zhou Zhao Yan 

476
00:42:53,116 --> 00:42:59,028
♫  The warm sunlight caresses her gently  ♫

477
00:42:59,028 --> 00:43:05,025
♫  When I open my eyes  ♫ 
 ♫  The little prince is riding a white horse  ♫

478
00:43:05,025 --> 00:43:10,945
♫  I gaze up at the sky  ♫ 
 ♫  Silently watching the distant clouds  ♫

479
00:43:10,945 --> 00:43:17,034
♫  Quietly spinning, waiting for his reply  ♫

480
00:43:17,034 --> 00:43:23,011
♫  A ray of moonlight  ♫ 
 ♫  Brushes gently against her cheek  ♫

481
00:43:23,011 --> 00:43:29,093
♫  She shyly hides behind the clouds  ♫

482
00:43:29,093 --> 00:43:35,122
♫  Under the blue sky  ♫ 
 ♫  I softly murmur as I rest on the grass  ♫

483
00:43:35,122 --> 00:43:41,971
♫  A dragonfly, unintentionally  ♫ 
 ♫  Lands on the tip of my nose  ♫

484
00:43:53,701 --> 00:43:59,701
♫  The sunflower bows its head  ♫ 
 ♫  In a gentle goodbye  ♫

485
00:44:05,797 --> 00:44:11,789
♫  I set off on the road  ♫ 
 ♫  Wearing a little straw hat  ♫

486
00:44:11,826 --> 00:44:17,753
♫  Time has blurred memories of my past  ♫

487
00:44:17,753 --> 00:44:23,833
♫  Holding a pen  ♫ 
 ♫  I sketch a little wooden house on paper  ♫

488
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:29,733
♫  Humming a tune  ♫ 
 ♫  Singing joyfully with you on the hillside  ♫

489
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:35,645
♫  Tears filled our eyes with no warning  ♫

490
00:44:35,645 --> 00:44:37,893
♫  At the hillside behind the small town  ♫

491
00:44:37,893 --> 00:44:42,789
♫  You hold my hand  ♫ 
 ♫  As we ran to the mountaintop  ♫

492
00:44:42,789 --> 00:44:47,767
♫  The setting sun dispels all our worries  ♫ 
 ♫  With its red glow  ♫

493
00:44:47,775 --> 00:44:51,199
♫  I am looking at you  ♫ 
 ♫  I see your reflection in my eyes  ♫

494
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:54,776
♫  Before I knew it  ♫ 
 ♫  You were all that I could see  ♫

495
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:57,645
♫  Only at that moment did I finally realize  ♫

496
00:44:57,669 --> 00:45:02,742
♫  What peace and freedom meant  ♫
