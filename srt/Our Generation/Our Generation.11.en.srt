00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,160
OUR GENERATION

2
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,180
EPISODE 11

3
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,460
Auntie Liang.

4
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,720
The medical expenses for Jiang Qiaoxi.

5
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,860
Anything else you want to tell me?

6
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,920
Auntie Liang.

7
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,620
Jiang Qiaoxi and I are classmates

8
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,780
and I want to be friends with him.

9
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,140
Be friends?

10
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,960
Don't you have anything
more important in your life?

11
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,500
Is making friends

12
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,240
your focus for life?

13
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,740
My daily life is my focus.

14
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,480
Friends, family, studies,
they're all core chapters of my life.

15
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,600
But Jiang Qiaoxi's focus
is on the Olympiad math.

16
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,760
He's chosen by mathematics,

17
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,100
destined for the
international competition stage.

18
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,780
Will it affect

19
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,260
my friendship with him?

20
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,920
It'll ruin our mother-son bond.

21
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,280
Back when you were little,

22
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,740
you tricked me to your backyard

23
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,500
and asked me to "Love Jiang Qiaoxi more".

24
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,200
Then can you promise me this?

25
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,800
If Jiang Qiaoxi goes back
to the provincial city with you,

26
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,420
will you love him more?

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,660
He doesn't really like black.

28
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,660
His favorite color is red.

29
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,860
His favorite animal is rabbits.

30
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,060
And his favorite food is jujube buns.

31
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,400
If you make them for him,
remember to add a little milk.

32
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,560
It'll make them softer and tastier.

33
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,260
I found it utterly absurd

34
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,760
coming from a child.

35
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,740
When I gave birth to Jiang Qiaoxi,

36
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,220
I hemorrhaged badly,

37
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,360
36 blood bags transfused.

38
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,540
This child was born
through every last drop of my blood.

39
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,480
No one could possibly
love him more than I do.

40
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,540
Like his brother before him,

41
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,060
Qiaoxi showed extraordinary
mathematical talent

42
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,280
from little.

43
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,600
My duty became clear.

44
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,000
To clear his path
to the International Olympiad stage,

45
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,280
to remove every obstacle

46
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,459
and ensure he reaches that finish line.

47
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,640
But you…

48
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,820
are the one who's steering him off course.

49
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,500
I have never affected
his academic performance.

50
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,440
For you,

51
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,640
he keeps defying me at all costs.

52
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,100
Yingtao, if you truly care about him,

53
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,200
if you want what's best for him,

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,900
please stay away from him, okay?

55
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,380
Otherwise, because of you,

56
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,240
he might never reach
the stage he's destined for.

57
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,100
More importantly,

58
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,860
you'll ruin our relationship.

59
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
When that happens,

60
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,880
I'll lose my son

61
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,420
and Jiang Qiaoxi…

62
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,500
will lose his mother.

63
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,560
I…

64
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,060
I won't…

65
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,760
I won't…

66
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,640
Exactly!

67
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,380
Yingtao.

68
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,580
You wouldn't.

69
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,640
You've always been a sensible child.

70
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,780
Even as a little girl,

71
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,940
you made the right choice.

72
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,360
Now, you know better than anyone
what needs to be done,

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,840
don't you?

74
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,280
<i>More importantly,</i>

75
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,740
<i>you'll ruin our relationship.</i>

76
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,080
<i>When that happens,</i>

77
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,560
<i>I'll lose my son</i>

78
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,700
<i>and Jiang Qiaoxi…</i>

79
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,900
<i>will lose his mother.</i>

80
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,800
Hello.

81
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,200
Hello, Yingtao.

82
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,320
Jiang Qiaoxi?

83
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,000
You…

84
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,880
You're allowed to phone me?

85
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,700
They are not at home.

86
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,620
How is your wound? Does it hurt?

87
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,860
Yingtao.

88
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,460
I've been recovering at home these days,

89
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,100
so I don't need to
attend the training camp.

90
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,240
After school tomorrow…

91
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,040
could you…bring me some
jujube buns and stuffed lotus roots?

92
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,920
I…

93
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,000
I…

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,560
I'll see… how it goes tomorrow.

95
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,840
You should rest early,
get some sleep and recover well.

96
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,060
I'm heading to bed too.

97
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,940
Goodnight.

98
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,420
- Go for it, Yu Qiao!
- Yu Qiao!

99
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,660
- Go for it, Yu Qiao!
- Yu Qiao!

100
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,520
- Go for it, Yu Qiao!
- Go for it, Yu Qiao!

101
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,500
- Yu Qiao!
- Yu Qiao!

102
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,500
Go!

103
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,820
- Go for it, Yu Qiao!
- Come on!

104
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,760
- Yu Qiao!
- Go for it!

105
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,120
- Go for it, Yu Qiao!
- Keep it up!

106
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,080
Go for it, Yu Qiao!

107
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,140
- Yu Qiao!
- Yu Qiao!

108
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,300
- Yu Qiao!
- Yu Qiao!

109
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,240
- Yu Qiao!
- Yeah!

110
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,480
Yingtao, what's wrong? Yu Qiao won!

111
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,440
Nothing. I'm happy too.

112
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,820
Lin Yingtao, what's going on?

113
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,740
You're acting strange.

114
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,780
No, I'm not!

115
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,420
Hello, Aunt Shuangyan.

116
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,980
Well done!

117
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,000
Nice!

118
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,300
What's the matter?

119
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,340
Qin Yeyun!

120
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,720
Congratulations, Yu Qiao.

121
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,120
Gotta run, stuff to do at home.

122
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,340
I'll go with her.

123
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,740
Why does Qin Yeyun look so pale?

124
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,419
Is Uncle Qin Okay?

125
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,000
Probably.

126
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,840
Aunt Shuangyan just called.

127
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,520
Then let's hurry over there.

128
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,600
Don't worry, Yu Qiao. My mom's there.

129
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,380
Qin Yeyun probably won't be happy

130
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,860
if we are all tagged along.

131
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,400
You're right.

132
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,860
Even though the school's
pretty lax during Sports Day,

133
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,240
we should stay
and cover for Yingtao and Yeyun.

134
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,400
Brother Qin,

135
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,780
we agreed you'd just

136
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,940
rest in bed at home.

137
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,040
If you keep moving around like this,

138
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,900
your leg will get worse, then what?

139
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,840
I'm fine.

140
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,720
It won't get worse.

141
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,440
Don't listen to those doctors' nonsense.

142
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,720
I know my own body best.

143
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,560
This old leg problem?

144
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,260
It is what it is.

145
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,400
Wasting money on treatment

146
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,660
won't help.

147
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,740
My Yun's growing up fast.

148
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
I can't afford to lose
even a single day's work.

149
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,000
Every day, the expenses just pile up.

150
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,260
Sit down quickly!

151
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,720
Why are you back?

152
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,140
You should be in school.

153
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,140
Go back to school.

154
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,500
- Go back to school.
- I can't stop you.

155
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,140
I can only tell Yun.

156
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,180
When she heard you were discharged,
she panicked

157
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,100
and rushed straight home.

158
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,300
Dad's well now.

159
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,200
Go back to school.

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,840
Go back to the hospital with me,
or I ask an ambulance to pick you up?

161
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,860
This kid!

162
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,580
Talking nonsense! An ambulance?

163
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,660
That'd be wasting medical resources.

164
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,960
Dad's really fine now.

165
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,420
No pain at all. Look.

166
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,760
Dad!

167
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,340
Minor setback.

168
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,920
Alright.

169
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,440
I…

170
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,600
Dad, I will drop out of school.

171
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,440
What did you say?

172
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,980
Say it again.

173
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,380
- I'll look for a job tomorrow.
- What?

174
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,540
- I can support myself.
- Yun, what are you doing?

175
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,960
Yun, you…

176
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,840
Yun, what are you doing?

177
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,000
Stop!

178
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,500
- You can't do this.
- I'm sick of it.

179
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,900
Sick of watching you kill yourself for me.

180
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't need it.

181
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,880
What are you doing?

182
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,300
Don't read those pages.

183
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,320
Leave it alone!

184
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,240
Stop it, Yun.

185
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,700
- Just stop!
- From now on, let it be mine.

186
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,920
I promise you.
I'll achieve them all on my own.

187
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,340
Qin Yeyun, you're still so young!

188
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,180
I'm your father.

189
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,360
Shouldn't I be doing these things for you?

190
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,200
But I'm your daughter too.

191
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,920
I don't need you to shoulder all this,

192
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,820
not when your leg's this bad.

193
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,020
It's my turn to step up for our family.

194
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,460
Dad.

195
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,920
I want you to rest and recover properly.

196
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,660
You deserve some good life, too.

197
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,020
So what if I'm a cripple?

198
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,160
Every other kid gets it,
my daughter will too.

199
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,700
<i>I want you to be just like them.</i>

200
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,900
- Yingtao.
<i>- I don't need…</i>

201
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,160
<i>you to do all that for me.</i>

202
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,040
It's okay. Let's go.

203
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,400
<i>You are my dad, too!</i>

204
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,120
Let them say it all out and fight it out.

205
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,740
Love needs to be heard.

206
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,720
Let's go.

207
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,320
Mom.

208
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,120
Did you and Dad

209
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,500
ever have expectations for me?

210
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,900
For what kind of person I'd grow up to be?

211
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,840
Lin Qile,

212
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,040
'Qile' means joyful harmony.

213
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,940
Just like your dad always hoped

214
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,900
you'd be someone who stays truly happy.

215
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,540
- Is that all?
- Yes.

216
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,360
What if I fail to fulfill this mission?

217
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,420
No one can be happy all their life.

218
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,800
Do you think that if you're unhappy,

219
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,340
we'll stop having you as daughter?

220
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,000
But…

221
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,580
the only remarkable thing I've ever done

222
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,500
was getting into Class 18
of experimental high school.

223
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,500
Beyond that, I'm really nothing special.

224
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,500
You and Dad truly aren't disappointed?

225
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,920
You know

226
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,700
what my greatest achievement is?

227
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,420
What…

228
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,280
It is you.

229
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,920
You chose me to be your mom.

230
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,520
Thank you for being my mother.

231
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,420
Okay, get off me. I'm cooking.

232
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,120
I get it.

233
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,560
What did you get?

234
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,180
I really get it.

235
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,920
I get it

236
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,940
no matter who I become,

237
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,800
I'll never lose you or Dad.

238
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,820
Auntie Liang.

239
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,100
Here are the stuffed lotus roots

240
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,260
and jujube buns for Jiang Qiaoxi,
you and Uncle Jiang.

241
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,180
Do you know what you are doing?

242
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,660
If it is possible,

243
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,800
even the slightest chance in this world

244
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,380
for Jiang Qiaoxi to
lose his mother's love,

245
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,140
then all the more reason
I must stand firmly by his side.

246
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,520
HERO

247
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,580
HERO

248
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,520
Still giving Uncle Qin the cold shoulder?

249
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,360
After that huge blowup,

250
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,620
you two haven't made up yet?

251
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,940
How do you know?

252
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,940
I asked Du Shang.

253
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,640
Du Shang asked Aunt Shuangyan.

254
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,700
Why are you unhappy?

255
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,680
Who says I'm unhappy?

256
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,700
I'm…

257
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,180
running 3,000 meters tomorrow,

258
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,540
kinda freaking out about it.

259
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,920
I know what makes you unhappy.

260
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,640
For what?

261
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,260
Because of…

262
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,440
Jiang Qiaoxi.

263
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,960
Why am I unhappy…

264
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,600
because of Jiang Qiaoxi?

265
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,740
Because of Ling Yingtao.

266
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,900
I don't have any feelings for Lin Yingtao.

267
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,680
Stop making things up.

268
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,560
Feelings?

269
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,320
I never said you liked her.

270
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,860
Way to confess without being asked.

271
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,700
Confess what?

272
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,220
Qin Yeyun.

273
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,220
How the hell did you even find out?

274
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,400
Yu Qiao.

275
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,620
If you want to
make this easier on yourself,

276
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,120
try shifting your perspective.

277
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,340
First, see Jiang Qiaoxi as your friend,

278
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,980
then as the guy Yingtao likes.

279
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,100
Qin Yeyun!

280
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,020
Don't worry.

281
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,020
I'll keep it a secret for you.

282
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,480
No.

283
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,700
I just want to ask you,

284
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,700
if it were you,

285
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,080
could you do it?

286
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,000
I made it.

287
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,520
Mom, would you like to have some?

288
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,280
I will skip it.

289
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,260
I won't stop you

290
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,900
from making friends.

291
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,620
But in ten years,

292
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,620
twenty, maybe,

293
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,820
you'll realize you've grown apart.

294
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,140
Even their whereabouts become unknown.

295
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,540
That's when you'll understand.

296
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,300
Mom,

297
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,940
Lin Yingtao and I, and the others,

298
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,940
even in ten or twenty years,

299
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,840
we'll still be friends.

300
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,780
When I was your age,
I thought exactly the same.

301
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,860
I believed my friendships
would last forever.

302
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,900
But after graduation?

303
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,400
We all quietly let go.

304
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,880
Now…

305
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,180
Now I only have you.

306
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,520
Mom,

307
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,800
those were

308
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,180
just classmates.

309
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,680
Real friends don't drift apart like that.

310
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,620
You're getting wiser,

311
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,700
more capable too.

312
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,480
I don't care about classmates or friends.

313
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,640
This winter camp,
you will make the national team.

314
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,820
That's my only requirement.

315
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,180
Can you do it?

316
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,900
What if

317
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,620
I can't make it?

318
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,900
Drop that throught.

319
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,700
Mom.

320
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,860
I'll give you…

321
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,880
what you want.

322
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,660
That national team spot for the Olympiad,

323
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,260
Consider it done.

324
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,060
BUILDING POWER COMMUNITY TOGETHER,
CREATING A BRIGHTER FUTURE

325
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,420
How many steps can you jump at once?

326
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,880
That's easy.

327
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,760
Easy?

328
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,020
- I don't believe it.
- Where is Yu Qiao?

329
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,500
- Morning, Yingtao.
- Hey, Yingtao.

330
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,420
He left for school at dawn to warm up.

331
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,560
Today's the 3,000-meter race.

332
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,160
He's like Forrest Gump,

333
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,400
training every single day.

334
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
First place is his already.

335
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,020
How is Qin Yeyun doing?

336
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,180
You asked me?

337
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,720
Didn't you three go to see her last night?

338
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,660
Heartless.

339
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,460
My goodness, Lin Yingtao.

340
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,540
Don't go accusing us right off the bat.

341
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,900
We actually went yesterday,

342
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,840
got chewed out the second we showed up.

343
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,540
She was firing indiscriminately!

344
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,320
Well, at least letting her vent
counts as your contribution.

345
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,320
Are you ready? Now,

346
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,860
follow my tactical command.

347
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,900
We're breaching her iron defenses.

348
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,940
Move out!

349
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,560
- Uncle Qin.
- Uncle Qin.

350
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,980
Uncle Qin.

351
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
Uncle Qin, got milk in stock today?

352
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,020
Yes.

353
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,200
Yun, get the milk.

354
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,760
Uncle Qin, you got
any spicy strips in stock?

355
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,940
Any of drumstick bread?

356
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Any pickled chicken feet?

357
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,920
Of course.

358
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,160
Come on, you know exactly
what I've got in here.

359
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,700
Yun, get them.

360
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,240
All of them.

361
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,980
No need.

362
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,340
We don't want any of these.

363
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,680
What…

364
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,580
- What does it mean?
- Mom made me promise.

365
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,520
We can't buy anything here

366
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,120
until Uncle Qin fully recovers.

367
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,220
Same at our house.

368
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,300
No trade, no hurt.

369
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,360
What are you talking about?

370
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,920
If you don't buy my goods,
that is real hurt.

371
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,540
Sorry, Uncle Qin.

372
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,440
We're just following orders.

373
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,000
Auntie and Uncle are truly so thoughtful.

374
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,760
Laugh all you want now, Qin Yeyun.

375
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,580
Just wait till you regret skipping class!

376
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,700
Haven't you heard the saying?

377
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,600
"No child left in need.

378
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,740
No school left behind."

379
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,960
Exactly.

380
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,780
"Play hard as it maybe

381
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,020
but never take studies lightly."

382
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,540
It's the final day of the Sports Day.

383
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,020
You can stay home for today.

384
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,400
But classes tomorrow?

385
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,480
You'll be left behind!

386
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,820
High school waits for no one.

387
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,360
One class missed,
you're three chapters behind.

388
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,060
Stop lecturing her.

389
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,200
You think Qin Yeyun doesn't want to go?

390
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,500
Of course she does!

391
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,020
But Uncle Qin won't listen.

392
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,960
Still, filial piety comes first.

393
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,120
Just like Mulan
took her father's place in the army,

394
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,140
now we have Yeyun
guards her father's shop.

395
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,320
It's not like she has a choice.

396
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,340
Right?

397
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:02,120
Today's Yu Qiao's 3000m race,
you're really not going to cheer for him?

398
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,240
I'm gonna go to school.

399
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,280
- Goodbye, Uncle Qin.
- Goodbye, Uncle Qin.

400
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,300
- Goodbye, Uncle Qin.
- Bye.

401
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,500
Later when Jiang Qiaoxi comes back,

402
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,000
will he go to school with us?

403
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,620
How could we just let him

404
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,980
waltz back to class with us?

405
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,260
You might've forgiven him,
but I sure haven't.

406
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,220
What do you mean, Cai Fangyuan?

407
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,380
When he cut contact with you,

408
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,100
he ghosted us too.

409
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,400
Now he's making amends to you, fine.

410
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,940
But to us?

411
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,620
Where's our amends?

412
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,240
What are you doing?

413
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,980
I've already made up with him,
but you still can't?

414
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,020
What, is Jiang Qiaoxi
your personal accessory?

415
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,920
We're supposed to drop him when you do,

416
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,800
and pick him back up
when you feel like it?

417
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,420
You.

418
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,400
Fair point.

419
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,620
I'm with Cai Fangyuan this time.

420
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,620
We did treat him
as a real friend all those years.

421
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,800
These years without contact? It hurt.

422
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,240
It froze me out.

423
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,140
Let him figure out how to break the ice.

424
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,120
What are you doing?

425
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,260
Saturday night, at the beach.

426
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,700
Let's see if he can move us.

427
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,700
Brother Qin.

428
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,880
This stubbornness of yours,

429
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,940
you're hurting yourself
and holding Yeyun back.

430
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,620
Right, of course.

431
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,940
<i>I've come around,</i>

432
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,340
<i>no more stubbornness.</i>

433
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,580
<i>Truth is, this damn leg's useless.</i>

434
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,040
<i>Even the slightest move</i>
<i>brings unbearable pain.</i>

435
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,220
<i>I… I was wrong.</i>

436
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,620
<i>Now that you finally admit it,</i>

437
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,740
<i>fix it.</i>

438
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,660
<i>This was your mistake to begin with.</i>

439
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,640
<i>Are you waiting for her apology first?</i>

440
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,680
<i>Wouldn't dream of it!</i>

441
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,340
<i>I'll change.</i>

442
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,320
Right now!

443
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,520
I'm working on fixing things.

444
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,860
Actually, here's an idea.

445
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,720
<i>Shuangyan,</i>

446
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,760
<i>you're still running</i>
<i>that street stall, right?</i>

447
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,880
<i>Listen,</i>

448
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,660
quit the roadside grind.

449
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,980
Come work at my shop instead.

450
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,040
I'll pay you monthly wages,

451
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,400
<i>more than the street stalls.</i>

452
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,220
<i>No more baking in the sun</i>
<i>or freezing in the rain.</i>

453
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,160
Brother Qin, this won't work.

454
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,260
Your shop's profits are slim as it is!

455
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,960
Paying me a salary?
You'd barely break even.

456
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,620
I am faking it.

457
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,640
Fake?

458
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,880
No but she works here too.

459
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,020
Okay, fine.

460
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,540
Tell you what,

461
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,180
move your skewer stall
right next to my shop.

462
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,280
<i>You'll draw customers to me.</i>

463
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,400
<i>You can sell your skewers as normal.</i>

464
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,860
<i>I'll pay you for shop-minding.</i>

465
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,740
Everybody wins.

466
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,940
Sure.

467
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,260
- Sure.
<i>- Done deal, Shuangyan!</i>

468
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,000
<i>A handshake seals it, no take backs.</i>

469
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,960
Hi, Aunt Shuangyan.

470
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,060
Where… are you going?

471
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,360
Go to school.

472
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,180
Qin Yeyun.

473
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,000
Could you check

474
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,440
if your family's store
carries plates with this pattern?

475
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,180
BE SAFE

476
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,280
We do have them,

477
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,280
but right now, there's something
far more important than plates.

478
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,180
- What do you mean?
- Yu Qiao's running the 3000-meter today.

479
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,940
We're all going to cheer.

480
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,460
You in?

481
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,460
<i>In this 3000-meter odyssey,</i>

482
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,100
<i>you are the master warrior</i>

483
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,280
<i>- embarking on an epic quest.</i>
- Yu Qiao, go for it!

484
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,180
<i>- Every stride channels your inner energy,</i>
- Come on!

485
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,480
<i>each breath condenses your vital essence.</i>

486
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,760
Feng Letian's broadcasting.

487
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,780
He is truly a <i>Wuxia</i> novelist. Turning
the game into some chivalrous epic?

488
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,940
Absolutely.

489
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,480
- Come on!
- I see huge potential in

490
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,860
- Feng's writings.
- Go for it, Yu Qiao!

491
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,740
- I am…
- Come on!

492
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,060
- CEO of the site,
- Yu Qiao!

493
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,600
- and part-time CFO,
- Come on!

494
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,560
I've decided to go back with him
and offer some notes.

495
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,540
- Less of this endless leveling up.
- Come on!

496
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,480
- Write some reunions between old friends.
- Keep it up!

497
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,460
- Turning swords into plowshares.
- Stop it.

498
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,920
We humans crave
emotional stakes, you know?

499
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,360
Stop talking and cheer him on quickly!

500
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,920
- Yu Qiao, go for it!
- Go for it!

501
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,740
- Yu Qiao, keep it up!
- Yu Qiao, keep it up!

502
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,440
- Yu Qiao, go for it!
- Yu Qiao!

503
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,880
- Come on!
- Come on, Yu Qiao!

504
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,700
- Come on!
- Go!

505
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,580
Hi!

506
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,500
Where is Yu Qiao?

507
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,940
Why are you here?

508
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,180
- Just here for the vibes!
- Yu Qiao!

509
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,260
- Let me check the wound.
- Yu Qiao, go for it!

510
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,520
- Are you okay?
- Come on!

511
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,680
- Small wound.
- Yu Qiao, go for it!

512
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,280
- Does it hurt?
- No.

513
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,440
- Where's Yu Qiao?
- There!

514
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,220
Jiang Qiaoxi at least
show some respect for me.

515
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,920
Yu Qiao, go for it!

516
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,760
- Yu Qiao!
- Yu Qiao, go for it!

517
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,240
Yu Qiao, go for it!

518
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,460
Yu Qiao, go for it!

519
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,300
Go for it!

520
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,920
Jiang Qiaoxi's here for you.

521
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,920
- Yu Qiao, go for it!
- Go for it!

522
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,520
- Yu Qiao, go for it!
- Go for it!

523
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,520
Yu Qiao!

524
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,500
- Yu Qiao, go!
- My voice is nearly gone.

525
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,179
- You shout for me.
- Yu Qiao, go for it!

526
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,380
What's wrong with Yu Qiao?

527
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,960
What?

528
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,679
- Yu Qiao!
- Let's go.

529
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,620
Cai Fangyuan!

530
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,160
Let's wait for him at the finish line.

531
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,500
- Go.
- Okay.

532
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,160
Go easy on Yu Qiao.

533
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,860
Exactly. We have Jiang Qiaoxi over there.

534
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,840
No need to rush.

535
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,780
Just get it done right.

536
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,840
Yu Qiao, go for it!

537
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,280
- Yu Qiao.
- Come on, Yu Qiao.

538
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,280
Yu Qiao, go for it!

539
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,980
Just focus ahead,

540
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,240
Be steady for every step.

541
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,740
The finish line will come.

542
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,780
Go for it, Jiang Qiaoxi!

543
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,720
No need to rush. Just focus ahead,

544
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,940
Be steady for every step.

545
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,180
The finish line will come.

546
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,120
That's exactly

547
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,440
what I told you

548
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,160
at the fourth-grade field day.

549
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,720
That's right.

550
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,400
Now it's my turn to say it to you.

551
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,620
<i>Go for it, Yu Qiao!</i>

552
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,760
Don't think by doing it,

553
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,340
<i>- Go for it, Yu Qiao!</i>
<i>- Keep up!</i>

554
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,280
I'll get you that half letter.

555
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,880
No rush.

556
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,960
- You can do it later.
<i>- Come on!</i>

557
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,260
<i>Yu Qiao!</i>

558
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,600
<i>Hang on!</i>

559
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,580
<i>Go for it!</i>

560
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,920
- Keep it up!
- Keep up!

561
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,400
- Yu Qiao, Go for it!
- Go for it!

562
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,680
<i>Go for it!</i>

563
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,460
<i>Take it slow.</i>

564
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,800
<i>Hang on!</i>

565
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,100
<i>- Hang on, Yu Qiao!</i>
<i>- Yu Qiao!</i>

566
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,800
Tenth to the line.

567
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,680
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

568
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,260
- Okay?
- Be careful.

569
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,640
- Go to the infirmary.
- Go.

570
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,540
<i>Under this blue sky,</i>

571
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,480
<i>- Their friendship shines.</i>
- Be careful.

572
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,640
- Take it easy.
<i>- On this arduous journey,</i>

573
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,140
- <i>they stood for each other,</i>
- Careful.

574
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,740
<i>with deepest sincerity.</i>

575
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:57,180
<i>In this very moment,</i>
<i>their friendship transcends into legend.</i>

576
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,680
<i>- Thank you, Ms.</i>
<i>- Be careful.</i>

577
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,860
- Alright?
- Alright.

578
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,140
Well? You're not lame, are you?

579
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,260
- Slow down.
- Qin Yeyun.

580
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,240
Could you find a nicer way to say that?

581
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,200
So, are you alright?

582
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,940
Alright.

583
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,560
Just a sprained ankle.

584
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,220
Some spray and rest,
good as new in two days.

585
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
Where is Jiang Qiaoxi?

586
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,940
He went back to study,

587
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,680
got that winter camp coming up.

588
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,120
But he only left
after making sure you were okay.

589
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,480
He shouldn't have come today at all.

590
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,900
With the Olympiad this close,

591
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,520
and that head injury?

592
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,180
He should stay home study
and take some more rest.

593
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,520
Why is he here?

594
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,620
To enjoy the show

595
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,180
that you clinched last place.

596
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,000
Running around with a busted head.

597
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,720
He is not kids anymore.

598
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,020
When will he learn to
take care of himself?

599
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,380
Are you concerned about Jiang Qiaoxi?

600
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,440
Don't be ridiculous.

601
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,800
Impossible.

602
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,140
Why on earth would I care about him?

603
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,380
Jiang Qiaoxi.

604
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,300
Jiang Qiaoxi.

605
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,540
How is your wound?
Are you feeling better now?

606
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,500
Didn't my mom tell you?

607
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,340
I'm just very worried about you.

608
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,620
We are friends.

609
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,460
You don't even understand
the meaning of friendship.

610
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,860
Real friends push each other forward.

611
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,380
They make you better,

612
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,080
never harm you,

613
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,400
and certainly don't come
between your family.

614
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,240
My friend didn't hurt me.

615
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,380
I am happy that I can do that for her.

616
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,640
And honestly,

617
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,840
I'm doing much better now.

618
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,740
Feel free to report
all this back to my mom.

619
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,040
Jiang Qiaoxi.

620
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,360
Stop being so stubborn and wake up!

621
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,500
How is Yu Qiao's foot?

622
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,800
He said it was just a mild sprain,
nothing serious.

623
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,720
He used to top
in the long-distance race every year.

624
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,380
But he came in last this year.

625
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,860
I hope he's not too upset.

626
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,660
How did you know
he won first place every year?

627
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,100
Of course I know!

628
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,760
I also know

629
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,480
Yu Qiao dreams of
becoming an air force pilot.

630
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,540
That's why he cares particularly
about his eyesight.

631
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,760
As for Du Shang,

632
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,900
he wants to study medicine,

633
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,680
so he spends all his free time
reading medical books.

634
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,700
And Cai Fangyuan,

635
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,400
he's been working on his own
literature website since Year 10.

636
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,420
So you've been secretly
keeping an eye on them all along.

637
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,420
Of course.

638
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,100
But

639
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,380
all I can do is watch them from afar.

640
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,000
You deserve real praise
for staying with Yu Qiao

641
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,780
all the way to the finish line today.

642
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,660
Tada!

643
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,740
There's nothing to praise.

644
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,340
This is just who I am.

645
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,400
I just never got the chance
to show it before.

646
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,940
Well you'll have to work hard for it.

647
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,900
Cai Fangyuan and Du Shang's hearts

648
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,520
are still ice-cold towards you.

649
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,520
Whether they'll accept you back
in Qunshan Squard,

650
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,720
it is still a question.

651
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,600
Really?

652
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,400
Really.

653
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,820
I tried to persuade them but fail.

654
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,240
Relax, Yingtao.

655
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,500
I'll make sure they come around.

656
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,120
And worst case,

657
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,460
you've got my back, right?

658
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
Ms. Lin, teach me, please.

659
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,480
You're the expert at fixing things.

660
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,800
Those two.

661
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,120
They've invited you
to the beach this Saturday.

662
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,240
Whether you can win them over
and melt their icy hearts,

663
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,100
well, that's up to you now.

664
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,220
You've only got one shot.

665
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,900
The beach?

666
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,520
Okay.

667
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,540
I'll work hard.

668
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,020
I'll prove myself.

669
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:35,940
What's so funny?

670
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,200
Oh come on, why so serious?

671
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,340
- Come on.
- You're kidding me?

672
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,620
Did you see your face just now?

673
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,800
They were totally messing with me.

674
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,960
But who do they think I am?

675
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,140
I'm way too clever

676
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,780
to fall for that.

677
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,180
That beach invitation?
It's obviously their way

678
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:01,740
to officially welcome you back
to the Qunshan Squard.

679
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,300
So it's a welcome.

680
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,240
And here I was,
all geared up to face their trials.

681
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,620
I've made up my mind. This Saturday,

682
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,960
we're going to the beach
to set off fireworks.

683
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,100
We'll make up for the ones
we missed last time.

684
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,800
My goodness.

685
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,680
How beautiful!

686
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,440
Look at this one. Looks like a butterfly.

687
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,560
- Look!
- Wow.

688
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,600
Lin Yingtao, what's wrong with you?

689
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,080
Isn't it beautiful?

690
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,080
It's good.

691
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,640
Very beautiful.

692
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,160
Why is it so beautiful?

693
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,120
It's annoying.

694
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,140
Why is it annoying?

695
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,500
Because…

696
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,220
Jiang Qiaoxi's not here.

697
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,940
Don't cry, Ling Yingtao.

698
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,360
No crying during New Year's.

699
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,140
Seven years.

700
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,140
Seven long years.

701
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,060
They are all behind us now.

702
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,520
Jiang Qiaoxi.

703
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,380
We've got so many more
seven-year chapters ahead of us.

704
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:57,980
True.

705
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,460
For the future,

706
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,060
we have many more
seven-year chapters to come.
