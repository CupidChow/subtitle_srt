1
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:39,008
 

2
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:45,539
How about this one?

3
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:57,280
Check out how I look with these.

4
00:01:59,392 --> 00:02:01,680
 

5
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,480
This one.

6
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,719
Excuse me.

7
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,719
Hello.

8
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,479
- How much is this?
- This one's 2,800.

9
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,860
2,800.

10
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,500
What about this one?

11
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
This one's 3,200.

12
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,780
3,200.

13
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,599
Right.

14
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,399
Which do you think looks better?

15
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:33,519
Jiang Qiao Xi, what's wrong?
Why aren't you talking?

16
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:40,540
Didn't you tell me I should express my feelings
and rely on you more?

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,340
Fine. What do you want then?

18
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,180
How about you pick one?
I'll get it for you. What about this pair?

19
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,099
I don't want sunglasses. I want something else.

20
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:57,400
What else do you want?

21
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,739
Alright. After buying sunglasses, we'll still
have 6-7k left. Pick whatever you want.

22
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,820
Let me buy Yu Qiao's sunglasses.
I actually want to give him a gift.

23
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,780
Why?

24
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,360
Last time Yu Qiao came to Hong Kong,
he said some things to me.

25
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:28,180
Factually speaking, he's spent more time
with you than I have.

26
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,560
Maybe he really understands you better than I do.

27
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,679
Why... why are you saying such weird things?

28
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:44,959
I just want to say thank you.
Cherry, you never gave up on me.

29
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,380
Don't talk like that anymore.

30
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:03,580
Actually, Yu Qiao considers you a friend.
He's also worried about you.

31
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,240
You know what? He's the one who found me
and gave me your Hong Kong address.

32
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,439
Without him, finding you
would've been much harder.

33
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:18,100
So I should thank him too.

34
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:26,199
You two are so similar.
Both of you want others to be happy.

35
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,900
Check this out.

36
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,960
Looks good.

37
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,600
Do you want me to go back to Hong Yang to study?

38
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,800
What do you mean?

39
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,920
Nothing. Just thinking out loud.

40
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:59,579
Want to buy something? We won big.
Shouldn't we spend some?

41
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,060
I've thought it through.
I want to buy Ruo Cheng some plants.

42
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,759
Having plants at home after discharge
will lift his mood.

43
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,500
I also want to get Ya Lin some fine wine.

44
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,120
Shouldn't we celebrate properly
when Ruo Cheng gets discharged?

45
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,579
And Rui Rui, right?

46
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:22,339
Let's buy Rui Rui some toys and new clothes.

47
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:25,019
And your uncle and aunt, I think they...

48
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:27,620
Haven't you thought
about getting something for yourself?

49
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,480
Ruo Cheng and Ya Lin told me
to shop more with you.

50
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,720
What? Buying lipstick and heels?

51
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,120
That works too.

52
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,160
I don't need lipstick. I'm pretty enough.

53
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,959
I don't need heels. I'm tall enough.

54
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,759
Let me stand here.

55
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,620
Listen, those things mean nothing to me.

56
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,059
They only matter because they're from you.

57
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,900
Cherry, you're so wonderful.
It makes me not want to let you go.

58
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,119
Your reluctance won't change anything.
I'm leaving the day after tomorrow.

59
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,639
I know.

60
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:20,899
So let's make the most of
our time shopping. Don't be upset.

61
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:23,759
Let's visit Ruo Cheng and Ya Lin tonight.

62
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,819
Okay.

63
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,619
Okay, I have something to discuss with them.

64
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,939
Ya Lin, we're here!

65
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:11,459
Come in!

66
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:12,639
Ya Lin.

67
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,819
Ya Lin, you look absolutely stunning today.

68
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,060
That's our Cherry! Thank you.

69
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,980
Let me through.

70
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,220
- Money tree!
- A money tree. Thank you.

71
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,800
Auntie, Uncle.

72
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,699
- Uncle, I got you supplements.
- Ruo Cheng.

73
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:32,319
I'll stay seated.

74
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,259
- Cheers!
- Soup for wine.

75
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,680
Cherry, thank you for the wine.

76
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,480
Thank you.

77
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,939
You really won the lottery? Over 9,000?

78
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:45,759
Yeah, never expected to actually win.

79
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,759
You were right, Cherry. People should have hope.

80
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,500
Let me say this, Qiao Xi, thank you
for your hard work these two years.

81
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,560
Thank you, and everyone's care
for me hasn't been easy.

82
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,160
Especially my wife.

83
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,279
No need to say all that.

84
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,639
It's necessary. I still have
some old debts to collect.

85
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,879
Though collecting them now won't be easy,

86
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:19,319
if I go personally,
they'll at least show some respect.

87
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:25,519
No big issue. So our family matters are settled.

88
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,839
Therefore, Qiao Xi, quit all your part-time jobs.

89
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,952
I've noticed you've always had a talent for math.

90
00:08:33,952 --> 00:08:37,559
Don't waste your chance. Study hard.

91
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:44,179
Use this time to really think
about your future plans.

92
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:49,860
Ruo Cheng, I've actually already decided.

93
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,779
Good to hear.

94
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:57,320
I want... I want to return to Hong Yang.

95
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,100
Don't you want to study at Hong Kong University?

96
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,539
I've only studied here a year.
Haven't forgotten what I've learned yet.

97
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:08,820
So going back to Hong Yang,
I could still get good grades.

98
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,880
But you're studying finance now.

99
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,799
If you enter this industry in the future,

100
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,640
having Hong Kong education background
gives you an edge, right?

101
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,940
Ruo Cheng, I understand Qiao Xi's intentions.

102
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:29,920
Think about it. If he stays here,
he'll be apart from Cherry for three more years.

103
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,320
Alright, getting Ruo Cheng home for dinner today
took me convincing the doctor endlessly.

104
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,100
We need to take him back soon.

105
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,500
Let's not discuss
Qiao Xi's crucial studies during dinner.

106
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,899
- Let's eat.
- Eat.

107
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:45,899
Let's eat first.

108
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,379
Qiao Xi, listen to me.

109
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,500
Eat.

110
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,419
I know emotions matter sometimes,

111
00:09:55,419 --> 00:10:00,139
but what's more important
than feelings is acting on them.

112
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:06,559
Don't just focus on the present.
Consider your future, right?

113
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,440
Now nothing I say matters. You won't listen.

114
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,360
No heavy talks during meals.

115
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,500
Fine. Let's eat.

116
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,380
Cherry, eat up.

117
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,120
Cheers.

118
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,700
Be happy.

119
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,799
Cheer up.

120
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:26,679
Eat whatever you like.

121
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,460
I... I can understand a little.

122
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,700
When I was little, I loved watching
The Return of the Condor Heroes with my parents.

123
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,120
I adored Little Dragon Maiden in that series.

124
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,600
Are you saying I look like her?

125
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,480
- Yes. Many say that.
- Really?

126
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,860
Lots of people think so.

127
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,620
No wonder I felt an instant connection
when I met Ya Lin.

128
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,540
Exactly. I'm so lucky to have married a fairy.

129
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:55,120
You're really planning
to retake the college entrance exam?

130
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:03,620
I've already made you wait two years.
I can't idle away another three.

131
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,539
But you're already at HKU. Why restart?

132
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:14,620
Retaking the exam will be stressful.

133
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,179
Cherry, remember what I told you
in Hong Yang after your exams?

134
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:34,179
I said I wanted to attend college, study
in libraries, and eat at cafeterias with you.

135
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:39,799
Even if you attend a college in Hong Yang,
we'd only have one year together.

136
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:44,859
That's okay. I'll take any chance, even a year.

137
00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:01,079
Your 18th birthday gift was getting kitchenware?

138
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,159
Yes. I always enjoyed cooking.

139
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,759
But I've been too busy these past two years.

140
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,379
Now that Ruo Cheng's better,

141
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:15,480
I want to revive this hobby.

142
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,120
Don't save money for me.
I've earned plenty tutoring.

143
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,059
We have contest prize money too.
You could ask for nicer things.

144
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:26,879
How about this?

145
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:32,159
You said Ya Lin thinks lipstick and heels
mark a girl's maturity.

146
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,159
Ask Ruo Cheng what marks a boy's maturity.

147
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,059
I could buy you suits or leather shoes.

148
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,320
You'd look handsome in them.

149
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,580
I don't want suits or shoes.

150
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:52,000
Real maturity for boys
is owning a full kitchenware set.

151
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,259
Seriously?

152
00:12:53,259 --> 00:13:01,559
Really. Also, you're leaving tomorrow.
I want to cook for you.

153
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,159
Alright, but what if you mess up this grand plan?

154
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:17,220
You haven't cooked in two years.

155
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,879
Underestimate me? My brain's full of recipes.

156
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,019
Why memorize recipes if you don't cook?

157
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:28,200
You wouldn't get it. They fuel my daydreams.

158
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,020
Daydream fuel?

159
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,399
Stare at recipes when hungry?

160
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,199
No.

161
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,439
You said you imagine alternate-reality versions
of me when apart.

162
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,679
Me too.

163
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:57,000
I imagine different versions of us
when you're not by my side.

164
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:06,459
In that world, we're always together.
I cook you countless meals.

165
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Well, try harder. I grew up on Ms. Juan's cooking.

166
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,939
I won't eat if it's bad.

167
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,719
Surpassing Ms. Juan's impossible.

168
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:31,439
But I'll practice until you want my cooking.

169
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:59,960
Remember what I told you?

170
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,559
Pick oranges with round, pretty navels.
They're sweeter. Got it?

171
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,359
Noted.

172
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,540
Wait. Look at this.

173
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:21,919
Cherry, doesn't it feel
like we've lived this way forever?

174
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:27,519
Obviously! We grew up together.

175
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,980
You mooched meals at my house daily.
Couldn't shoo you away.

176
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:37,519
But grocery shopping together,
planning dinner, that's new.

177
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:43,280
It just feels familiar to me.
Like we've done this countless times.

178
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,299
Jiang Qiao Xi, I never realized
you're such a quiet daydreamer.

179
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:54,200
Your mind's full of whimsical ideas.

180
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,319
But reality's better than my imagination.

181
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:01,780
I want to make all those daydreams real.

182
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,899
Get this.

183
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,699
Okay.

184
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:17,159
Cherry, I... I won't make you wait long.

185
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:22,540
Even if I stay at HKU,
I'll return to Hong Yang quickly to find you.

186
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,432
Promise me, come running back soon.

187
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,979
You really want to buy it?

188
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,300
Just buy it.

189
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,379
You think I don't know?

190
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:22,240
It's fine. I understand.

191
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,639
Are... are you serious?

192
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,760
I saw them.

193
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,839
Cigarettes on your windowsill. You smoke, right?

194
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:44,579
It's okay. My dad smoked too.

195
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:48,720
He quit for my mom using gum.

196
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,640
I don't smoke much. I can quit soon.

197
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,480
This should be good, or...?

198
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,584
 

199
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,980
Excuse me, Sir and Miss. Ready to check out?

200
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,780
Coming.

201
00:19:04,224 --> 00:19:05,936
 ♫ Spreading sunlight ♫ 

202
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:10,185
 ♫ Warmly kissing her ♫ 

203
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:12,433
 ♫ Open your eyes, little prince ♫ 

204
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:16,296
 ♫ Riding a white horse ♫ 

205
00:19:16,296 --> 00:19:18,086
 ♫ Looking up at the sky ♫ 

206
00:19:18,086 --> 00:19:22,153
 ♫ The distant clouds stay silent ♫ 

207
00:19:22,153 --> 00:19:24,442
 ♫ Quietly spinning ♫ 

208
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:28,134
 ♫ Waiting for his reply ♫ 

209
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,865
 ♫ A ray of moonlight ♫ 

210
00:19:29,865 --> 00:19:31,427
 ♫ Gently ♫ 

211
00:19:31,427 --> 00:19:34,219
 ♫ Brushes against the cheek ♫ 

212
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:35,273
 ♫ She timidly ♫ 

213
00:19:35,273 --> 00:19:40,201
 ♫ Hides into the clouds ♫ 

214
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:42,030
 ♫ The serene blue sky ♫ 

215
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,554
 ♫ Muttering ♫ 

216
00:19:43,554 --> 00:19:46,185
 ♫ Lying in the grass ♫ 

217
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,779
 ♫ Unintentionally ♫ 

218
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:48,521
 ♫ The dragonfly ♫ 

219
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:57,952
 ♫ Lands on my nose tip ♫ 

220
00:19:57,952 --> 00:20:01,184
 ♫ Aye aye oh ♫ 

221
00:20:01,184 --> 00:20:03,872
 ♫ Aye oh ♫ 

222
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:06,272
 ♫ Sunflower tiptoes ♫ 

223
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:09,954
 ♫ Shaking head and saying goodbye ♫ 

224
00:20:09,954 --> 00:20:13,287
 ♫ Aye aye oh ♫ 

225
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:15,968
 ♫ Aye oh ♫ 

226
00:20:15,968 --> 00:20:17,760
 ♫ A little straw hat ♫ 

227
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,797
 ♫ Hitting the road with me ♫ 

228
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:30,180
Are you two being this innocent
even when you're dating each other?

229
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:36,500
Do you want to grab dinner together later?

230
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,300
Sure.

231
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,000
Yin.

232
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,040
You brat! I've been good to you for nothing?
You won't even cook a meal for me?

233
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:59,039
Yin, tell me how he's been these past two years.

234
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,980
You really want to know?

235
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,240
I'm scared you'll cry.
He had it rough. No, better not.

236
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,300
I don't believe you can make me cry.
I've got a high threshold for tears. Go ahead.

237
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,940
Wait, don't fall for her act. She cries easily.

238
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,079
So are we telling it or not?

239
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,099
We're telling it.

240
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:19,599
Let me tell you how clueless
he was when he first arrived.

241
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,119
He thought everything here was super complicated.

242
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:25,099
Tried to act tough by putting on this macho front.

243
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:29,039
The scar on his head was so tiny
you needed a magnifying glass to see it.

244
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,380
Every day he'd flip his hair to show that scar,
thinking it made him look intimidating.

245
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,599
Why are you spilling everything?

246
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:37,339
He looked absolutely ridiculous doing that.

247
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,779
When I first saw you, I couldn't stand you.

248
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:43,619
Barely scraping together rent money
but acting all high and mighty.

249
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:48,880
If my dad hadn't taken a liking to you,
I'd have kicked you out on the spot.

250
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,980
See how kind Yin is?
Even when you were putting on airs back then.

251
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,079
He still took you in and treated you well.

252
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,660
I wasn't putting on airs!
Don't listen to his nonsense.

253
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,960
Cherry, I'm the landlord here.

254
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,400
Shouldn't a landlord evict tenants
who can't pay rent?

255
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,599
I helped him not because of that.

256
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:12,139
Then why?

257
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:20,119
Don't they say men can't bear to see women cry?

258
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:23,500
Actually, men can't stand
seeing other men cry even more.

259
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:28,700
One night he was watching Titanic and cried.

260
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,279
Right, Titanic's a real tearjerker.

261
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:37,299
But most people cry
when Rose sees Jack sinking. Not him.

262
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:43,599
He cried when Rose and Jack
promised each other a beautiful life together.

263
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:49,779
That's the most hopeful part,
yet he sobbed like a mess.

264
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:55,680
That's when I realized
this kid was actually pitiful.

265
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,200
So I figured I'd look after him in my free time.

266
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:13,720
Yin, I'll toast you. Thank you
for taking care of Jiang Qiao Xi these years.

267
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:16,419
No need.

268
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,619
Don't spit it out!

269
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:26,180
My reserve whiskey isn't cheap.

270
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,000
Well? How is it?

271
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,859
So hot!

272
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:32,859
Stop drinking.

273
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:35,160
- Burning up.
- It's too hot, right?

274
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,940
Bottoms up.

275
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,040
I'll add some ice.

276
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:48,180
Yin, I've tried lots of fine drinks in Hong Kong.

277
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:53,039
Had wine with Jiang Qiao Xi's sister-in-law,
and now your whiskey.

278
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,019
All top-shelf stuff, really expensive.

279
00:23:55,019 --> 00:24:00,200
But honestly, I just can't acquire
the taste. Don't like it.

280
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,819
Why do you all love alcohol so much?

281
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:06,000
Nobody's born liking alcohol.

282
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,420
I drink out of necessity.

283
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:14,079
Not everyone's like Vincent,
having a sweet girl like you to care for him.

284
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,640
I have nobody. That's why I drink.

285
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,780
Who believes that?
Jiang Qiao Xi says you're a player.

286
00:24:25,819 --> 00:24:29,099
That's just acting for
the occasion. Doesn't count.

287
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:35,839
I treat them badly, they treat me
badly too. Fair's fair.

288
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,940
Eat.

289
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,400
Don't... don't be sad.
You'll definitely meet someone...

290
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,059
Stop pitying him.
You actually believe his stories?

291
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:58,200
He owns this building and land in Lok Ma Chau.

292
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,300
He stays up all night counting property deeds.

293
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:10,380
You don't get it. Pretty clouds scatter easily,
tall buildings collapse quickly.

294
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,380
The things you can see are the least valuable.

295
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,460
They can disappear in an instant.

296
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:23,119
You've had a tough journey. Cherish each other.

297
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,379
You're the lucky ones.

298
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:50,619
Jiang Qiao Xi.

299
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:55,040
Cherry.

300
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,260
Jiang Qiao Xi.

301
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:14,559
What's wrong, Cherry? Are you a repeater?

302
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:24,359
I just realized tomorrow
I won't hear you answering me like this.

303
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:28,579
I want to keep saying your name while I can.

304
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:35,079
Cherry, do you know

305
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:44,339
what I was thinking when I heard you call my name?

306
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:57,980
You were thinking,
"How can Lin Cherry's voice be so sweet?"

307
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,839
No taste.

308
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:09,760
Cherry, all these years,

309
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,780
I've been trying to prove that I'm Jiang Qiao Xi.

310
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,420
Before, I had good grades.

311
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:25,819
Used silence to abandon math,
relinquish guaranteed admissions.

312
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:37,859
Even... even used that method
to prove I'm Jiang Qiao Xi.

313
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:42,119
But now I suddenly realize

314
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:50,539
the moment I heard you call my name,
I truly existed.

315
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,519
Hello.

316
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:56,352
Qin Ye Yun.

317
00:30:02,336 --> 00:30:07,220
I'm in Hong Kong.

318
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,720
I know.

319
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,659
 I found Jiang Qiao Xi. 

320
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:21,440
I know that. Lin Cherry, it's 3 AM right now.

321
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,540
I...

322
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:34,399
I get it. Are you feeling happy or not right now?

323
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:45,960
I don't know if I'm happy or not.

324
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,090
 Just feel... 

325
00:30:51,968 --> 00:30:55,260
different from before,

326
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,619
but somehow everything remains the same.

327
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:00,759
Then wasn't this call a waste?

328
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,559
No.

329
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:11,136
It's like

330
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:14,500
 I suddenly discovered a secret. 

331
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,980
 That kind adults seemed to share 

332
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,520
when I saw them on the street before.

333
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:26,980
They always seemed to have some shared secret.

334
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:36,240
But now I know that secret too.

335
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:43,659
It's frustrating, Lin Cherry.
How did you know this secret before me?

336
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:53,559
I told you immediately.
You should be secretly thrilled.

337
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,819
What should I do, Lin Cherry?
Now you're making me a little scared.

338
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:02,180
There's something you're afraid of?

339
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,300
I'm a girl too, you know. I get scared too.

340
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:17,039
Don't be afraid. Just make sure
to find someone you love.

341
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:25,619
Being with someone you love
makes the fear go away.

342
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:35,559
Cherry, are you sure you don't want me
to take you to the airport?

343
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:41,720
I don't want you to send me off, because I don't
want you to return alone from the airport.

344
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:47,339
I want you to pick me up at the airport,
so it'll feel like you are meeting me there.

345
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:54,300
Not seeing the airport as the place
where you said goodbye to me.

346
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:07,980
Stop it, you're making me want to cry too.

347
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,399
Should we find a place
to cry our eyes out together?

348
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:24,320
Jiang Qiao Xi, you promised to come back for me.

349
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,880
You promised. I'll really wait for you.

350
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,760
You made that promise to me. You promised.

351
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,639
We agreed. I will definitely come find you.

352
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,439
Promise me.

353
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:44,060
I promise.

354
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,204
 ♫ The unspoken wishes of that year ♫ 

355
00:34:46,204 --> 00:34:49,436
 ♫ Familiar shadows lengthen ♫ 

356
00:34:49,436 --> 00:34:51,164
 ♫ Beyond sight ♫ 

357
00:34:51,164 --> 00:34:55,424
 ♫ Your silhouette is so gentle ♫ 

358
00:34:55,424 --> 00:34:59,484
 ♫ The world is spinning ♫ 

359
00:35:01,216 --> 00:35:05,020
 ♫ The breeze is shouting ♫ 

360
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:11,239
 ♫ The scenery in amber ♫ 

361
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:16,760
 Jiang Qiao Xi, I really like you. You know that. 

362
00:35:19,612 --> 00:35:24,764
 ♫ You're the key to who I am ♫ 

363
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,839
 I know. I really like you too. 

364
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:39,860
 Beyond that, my dream is
to become an excellent teacher. 

365
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:44,920
 Whether it's kindergarten, elementary,
or middle school teacher, all good. 

366
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,800
 I want to use my abilities
to help students gain more knowledge, 

367
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,739
 help them understand and accept themselves, 

368
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:56,819
 and discover their future paths. 

369
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,019
 What about you? What do you want to do? 

370
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:17,519
 The old me wanted to abandon math
and leave my parents. 

371
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:22,860
 But after what happened with Ruo Cheng's family, 

372
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,980
 I want to work in finance. 

373
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,280
 I know finance can elevate someone, 

374
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,080
 but also easily destroy them. 

375
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:38,580
 But with you by my side, I'm not afraid. 

376
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:46,480
 I will become someone who lifts others up. 

377
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,219
 Then go do it. Do what you want to do. 

378
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:56,780
 I want you to become yourself,
and I'll become myself. 

379
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:04,339
 Though we might not be together
on our separate journeys, 

380
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:10,219
 as long as we know we love each other,
distance doesn't matter. 

381
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:13,080
 Nothing will change, right? 

382
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,860
 I've already waited two years
without hearing from you. 

383
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:25,199
 Things can't possibly get worse from here. 

384
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:27,999
 Our future will keep getting better. 

385
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:35,359
 So stay in Hong Kong and pursue your dreams. 

386
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:44,159
That's the situation. Jiang Qiao Xi said
he'll come find me immediately.

387
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,579
 You two are so good together. 

388
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:50,859
So at the end of the story, do the prince
and princess live happily ever after?

389
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:57,639
The princess is still in Hong Kong,

390
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:02,000
but her rescuing prince
is returning to Hong Yang to study.

391
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,920
No one can predict the future.

392
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,019
 It's okay. Didn't the princess say
he'll always come find her from now on? 

393
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:16,380
Besides, any princess who shares birthday wishes
can't be a bad princess.

394
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,140
Good princess stories always have happy endings.

395
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:29,320
 Yu Qiao, I'm back from Hong Kong
and brought you Ray-Ban sunglasses. 

396
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,400
 Originally, I wanted to buy them for you, 

397
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,120
 but Jiang Qiao Xi insisted on paying.
He said it's to thank you. 

398
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:41,620
 Yu Qiao, I also want to thank you. 

399
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,539
 Are you still busy? Should I deliver them to you? 

400
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:05,579
 Thanks, Cherry. I'm still preparing
for the aviation academy exam. 

401
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:09,460
 Have a Canada interview coming up. No time now. 

402
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,460
 Tell Jiang Qiao Xi one pair isn't enough. 

403
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:17,580
 When he comes to Hong Yang, have him
personally bring the glasses and bow in thanks. 

404
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:25,419
 Okay, I'll tell him. 

405
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,980
 

406
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,359
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

407
00:39:40,699 --> 00:39:43,980
You two have been busy all day. Take a break.

408
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,420
Let me see how I can help. What can I do for you?

409
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,900
No need, Ms. Cao.

410
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:52,019
I won't feel confident shipping these clothes
without personally checking every stitch.

411
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:55,539
Besides, my dad finally found
something he enjoys doing.

412
00:39:55,539 --> 00:39:57,619
If you ask him to stop,
he won't be happy about it.

413
00:39:57,619 --> 00:39:59,280
Shuang Yan.

414
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:06,260
This thing lets people chat with customers
from all over the country. It's pretty fun!

415
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,739
Cherry?

416
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:17,260
Yun, Cherry sent you a QQ message.

417
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,019
Cherry found Qiao Xi?

418
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:28,220
Yeah, Jiang Qiao Xi hid all the way in Hong Kong,
but she still tracked him down.

419
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,559
So Cherry and Qiao Xi, are they...?

420
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,859
Ms. Cao, they're exactly what you're thinking.
They just look well-behaved.

421
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:45,219
What about you?

422
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:48,260
Dad, my mind isn't on that.

423
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:52,739
Yu Qiao...

424
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:57,839
Dad, what are you talking about?
Buying a car is my top priority now.

425
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,500
Buy a car? What's that about?

426
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,339
Yes, buying a car.

427
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:07,820
Why are you thinking about that?
Cars are so expensive now.

428
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,260
You don't even have a driver's license.

429
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,559
I'll get the license. No matter how expensive
cars are, I'll work hard to buy one.

430
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:15,860
I just want to buy my dream car.

431
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:20,499
When I drive this car out, everyone will know
I'm somebody important.

432
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:24,059
I want to take the wheel of my own life.

433
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:28,559
Listen to my favorite songs,
drive long distances, and see beautiful views.

434
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:31,760
You'll ride shotgun with me, or Cherry,

435
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,739
Cai Fang Yuan, Du Shang, even Yu Qiao.

436
00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:38,239
And of course, Ms. Cao should come too!

437
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:43,200
I want to take all the people I love
to every corner of the world.

438
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,300
- I'm here! How long were you waiting?
-  Just a while. 

439
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,639
I got stopped by some juniors
in the hallway asking questions.

440
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:56,420
Did you miss me a lot today?

441
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,780
 Of course I did. 

442
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,519
I missed you too.

443
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:01,739
Jiang Qiao Xi.

444
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:02,840
 What is it, Cherry? 

445
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,440
I just really missed you.

446
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,099
When I get back, I'll take you
to the amusement park.

447
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:15,120
 Jiang Qiao Xi, I just showered.
The shower room was so crowded today. 

448
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,820
Go! Who let you in?

449
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,620
What are you doing?

450
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,079
-  Who's this? 
-  What? 

451
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,139
 Hello. 

452
00:42:30,139 --> 00:42:31,300
Hello.

453
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,340
-  What stage are you two at now? 
-  Jiang Qiao Xi. 

454
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,479
 Let's all enjoy
the beautiful dance moves together.

 ♫ Clear as yesterday ♫ 

473
00:44:26,236 --> 00:44:27,836
 ♫ Reality is in front of me ♫ 

474
00:44:27,836 --> 00:44:31,868
 ♫ The future folds in the palm ♫ 

475
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:37,468
 ♫ You're the key to who I am ♫ 

476
00:44:37,468 --> 00:44:42,364
 ♫ Accompany me to become myself ♫ 

477
00:44:42,364 --> 00:44:45,692
 ♫ The night is long ♫ 

478
00:44:45,692 --> 00:44:48,220
 ♫ My stubbornness grows wildly ♫ 

479
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,556
 ♫ I can't stop running ♫ 

480
00:44:50,556 --> 00:44:53,660
 ♫ The silent call of the dream ♫ 

481
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:59,772
 ♫ You're the sparkling of my dreams ♫ 

482
00:44:59,772 --> 00:45:04,508
 ♫ Accompany you to become yourself ♫ 

483
00:45:04,508 --> 00:45:07,292
 ♫ Boundaries dissipate ♫ 

484
00:45:07,292 --> 00:45:10,940
 ♫ Loneliness melts in an embrace ♫ 

485
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:16,604
 ♫ I've always been here ♫ 

486
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:22,780
 ♫ Rotating light in my palm ♫ 

487
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:25,756
 ♫ Illuminating your cheeks ♫ 

488
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:30,108
 ♫ A smile that ran too fast ♫ 

489
00:45:30,108 --> 00:45:36,604
 ♫ Unexpectedly preserved ♫
