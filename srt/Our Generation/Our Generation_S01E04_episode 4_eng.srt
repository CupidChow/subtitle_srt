00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,230
   

3
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,170
   

4
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:42,920
Excuse me, 
 I forgot to recharge my water card.

5
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,359
Can I borrow yours?

6
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,199
Are we that close?

7
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,859
I forgot to introduce myself earlier 
 during the English exercise.

8
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:58,500
My name is Jiang Qiao Xi. 
 It's nice to meet you.

9
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,459
I can't say the same.

10
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:05,840
Also, I don't easily lend 
 my water card to others.

11
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,739
Why is she treating Jiang Qiao Xi this way?

12
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:10,080
She has quite a temper.

13
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,999
Jiang Qiao Xi, use mine.

14
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,300
You can use mine as well.

15
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,492
There is no need. Thank you.

16
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,539
She is new here 
 and not familiar with this place.

17
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:32,959
Let's greet her with more enthusiasm.

18
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,199
Frankly, I've never seen anyone 
 treat Jiang Qiao Xi like this before.

19
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,580
That was too much!

20
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,419
Still, he always seems polite.

21
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:45,060
He wasn't offended.

22
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,840
Jiang Qiao Xi is well-mannered.

23
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:52,960
That's true. 
 But why did she treat him that way?

24
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,539
He only wanted to borrow her water card.

25
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:57,879
She reacted as if they had a feud.

26
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:02,279
Maybe that's because she didn't understand

27
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:04,860
what Jiang Qiao Xi said during English class.

28
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,159
He embarrassed her 
 when she had just joined the class.

29
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,960
Exactly! Think about it.

30
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,539
She made it to Experimental High School 
 from Qunshan.

31
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:15,159
She must have been outstanding 
 in her previous class as well,

32
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:17,159
but she came across Jiang Qiao Xi 
 right after she arrived.

33
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,580
Her self-esteem must have taken a hit.

34
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,900
Teacher He said Jiang Qiao Xi's sentences 
 were above the curriculum level.

35
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,419
Most of the students in our class 
 didn't understand them.

36
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:29,139
I don't think she's angry about this.

37
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,080
I think you're the problem.

38
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,439
Me?

39
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,240
Yes! Think about it.

40
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,980
You knew nothing about her 
 yet badmouthed her to other students.

41
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,460
You are also Jiang Qiao Xi's friend,

42
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,500
so she took it out on Jiang Qiao Xi.

43
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,192
What should I do?

44
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,479
You should apologize to Lin Qi Le,

45
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:00,240
but, honestly, it's not your fault.

46
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,959
The fault lies with the person 
 who wrote the letter to Jiang Qiao Xi.

47
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,079
I heard someone was not tactful

48
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,840
and tried to borrow your water card, 
 but you refused.

49
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:24,420
If I could, I'd even splash water on him.

50
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,219
I'll ask him about his intentions.

51
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,239
Who cares?

52
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:34,639
We don't care about him.

53
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,179
Lin Qi Le, someone is looking for you 
 at the fourth-floor stairwell.

54
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,459
Who is looking for me?

55
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:51,920
Go, and you will find out.

56
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,099
Did he say what it's about?

57
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:56,239
He said he wants to talk to you in person.

58
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:58,520
Come on, I'll go with you!

59
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,160
He is looking for Lin Qi Le.

60
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:09,752
I'll go alone.

61
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,079
Lin Qi Le, we've met before.

62
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:18,980
It was just before your transfer 
 to the Experimental High School.  Do you remember?

63
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:21,079
Yes.

64
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:24,720
You made it here 
 with a high score from Qunshan.

65
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,240
Everyone thinks you're awesome.

66
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,199
Let's support each other in our studies 
 and grow together.

67
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,139
What are you trying to say?

68
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:38,879
I'm here to apologize.

69
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,219
It's my fault. I mistook you for someone else,

70
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:44,500
and said offensive words to you.

71
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,400
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,620
Still, you shouldn't have spoken like that.

73
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,079
Do you really hate us? 
 Especially Jiang Qiao Xi?

74
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:05,399
The truth is unpleasant, 
 and I don't want to discuss it with you.

75
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,899
Lin Qi Le, it's just a misunderstanding.

76
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:12,932
You are a victim. So is Jiang Qiao Xi.

77
00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:15,699
Don't blame Jiang Qiao Xi. 
 He's outstanding.

78
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,240
- You… 
 - He is a role model in our class.

79
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,600
If you want to blame someone, 
 blame that Cherry

80
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,519
who wrote a shameless letter 
 to Jiang Qiao Xi.

81
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,860
Enough!

82
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,800
You don't know what she wrote. 
 It was disgusting!

83
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,639
"Disgusting"?

84
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,199
Stop spouting nonsense!

85
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,060
Yu Qiao, last time you started a fight, 
 I let it slide.

86
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,439
Are you pushing your luck?

87
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,439
What is going on?

88
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,540
Did you both dare to be violent toward me?

89
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,319
Just wait and see! I'll be in the office.

90
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,620
Fei Lin Ge, can't you just talk it over?

91
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,820
What's there to talk about?

92
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,060
Oh, no! Oh, no! Our class is in big trouble!

93
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,240
It's Lin Qi Le, the new student! 
 She hit someone!

94
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,040
It's true! There was a fight 
 and she hit someone.

95
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,819
Go check it out!

96
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:11,060
Fei Lin Ge has a good relationship 
 with the teachers.

97
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,759
It won't be easy for you to explain.

98
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,079
What happened?

99
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,939
It's all right, I know you well.

100
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:22,912
I'll defend you.

101
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,259
I didn't start a fight!

102
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:26,639
But you kicked him.

103
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,079
That was self-defense!

104
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,440
It was me who started the fight.

105
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,639
He was the first to start cursing.

106
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,120
Then he can only blame himself.

107
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:38,860
It's his fault. 
 He was the one who started it.

108
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,439
I believe the teachers here 
 can tell right from wrong.

109
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:43,920
We are not afraid.

110
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,899
Are you both really all right?

111
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,100
With her around, 
 black can be turned into white.

112
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,659
You can rest assured.

113
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:52,500
All right, Fei Lin Ge is mean with his words.

114
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,960
Let's be generous and not argue with him.

115
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,020
Class Monitor, you are right. Thank you.

116
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,979
What are you looking at? Go back!

117
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,459
What should I do? 
 I just arrived and already caused trouble.

118
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:12,879
It's all right, I'm here.

119
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,959
As for you,

120
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,519
not only did I cause trouble, 
 I also implicated you.

121
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,540
It makes sense. 
 We did the same thing when we were kids.

122
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,720
Jiang Qiao Xi!

123
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,960
Come with me.

124
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,620
- Where are we going? 
 - Take a seat.

125
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:46,019
Why did they hit you?

126
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:49,519
I saw Lin Qi Le didn't take you seriously,

127
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,200
even though you didn't offend her.

128
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,740
I thought maybe it was because 
 I had mistaken her for Cherry earlier.

129
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,419
She hates me and resents you, too.

130
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:58,759
I tried to apologize to her,

131
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:01,419
but their response was barbaric!

132
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:04,200
I only said a few words, 
 and then they pushed me!

133
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,300
Lin Qi Le even kicked me!

134
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,500
Did you curse Cherry 
 when you apologized to them?

135
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,179
It's all Cherry's fault!

136
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:25,039
He wrote such a disgusting letter 
 that annoyed you.

137
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,139
Without her, 
 there would be no misunderstandings.

138
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:29,819
"Disgusting"? Who said it's disgusting?

139
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,120
Isn't it?

140
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,056
You!

141
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:37,992
You called someone disgusting 
 in front of her friends.

142
00:09:37,992 --> 00:09:39,799
If they don't hit you, who will they hit?

143
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,720
Jiang Qiao Xi, why are you defending them?

144
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,512
Enough!

145
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,220
From now on, stay out of my business.

146
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,080
Especially when it involves Lin Qi Le.

147
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,800
Lin Qi Le? You and her…

148
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,000
We will… become friends.

149
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,860
Something's not right.

150
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,799
The teacher hasn't called me yet.

151
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,740
That Fei Lin Ge doesn't seem 
 to have taken any action.

152
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,720
They likely find Lynn Cherry too fierce!

153
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,779
They thought it over carefully, 
 but they still don't dare challenge you.

154
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:26,379
It's good to teach him a lesson.

155
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,080
Forget it, I'm new here.

156
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,072
It's best if I keep a low profile.

157
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,899
I'll sit here. You sit over there.

158
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:44,279
I want to watch Cai Fang Yuan's 
 multifunctional player.

159
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,659
Why didn't you tell me earlier? 
 I didn't bring it!

160
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,799
What did you bring then?

161
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,544
Let me check.

162
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,540
All right. I'll just read this.

163
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,300
Cherry, are you starting to stray?

164
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:07,480
I'm just reading.

165
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,100
Let me tell you. 
 Strategies printed in books are outdated.

166
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,820
Let me tell you how to become 
 a top expert in just three days.

167
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,100
After hearing this, I guarantee 
 you'll all be begging me to play games with you.

168
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,419
Don't brag about it.

169
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,340
Your strategy is to spend money.

170
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,120
What?

171
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,399
Cherry, let me tell you.

172
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,679
World of Warcraft is more than just a game. 
 It has profound significance.

173
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:33,160
Let me tell you about this game. Look!

174
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,960
What's on your mind? I'm sitting here. 
 Why won't you talk to me?

175
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,840
What's there to talk about?

176
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:44,220
Qin Ye Yun, look at you.

177
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,259
We are all from Qun Shan.

178
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:47,959
Why don't you hang out with us?

179
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,840
You didn't join us 
 at the arcade dance machine.

180
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,639
Lin Cherry danced really well.

181
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,999
What is so fun 
 about the arcade dance machine?

182
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:02,379
Name one. We'll have fun with you.

183
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,659
The aquarium. Will you go with me?

184
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,739
Of course, we can go with you.

185
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,380
Lin… Lin Qi Le!

186
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,559
Let's go to the aquarium this weekend.

187
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,580
The aquarium?

188
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,039
I'm not going.

189
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,059
Still, Qin Ye Yun wants to go. 
 Let's join her.

190
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,059
She is upset now. Just agree to it!

191
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,810
Okay. Yes, I'll go.

192
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,500
I will go.

193
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:50,499
Cherry, why don't you want to go 
 to the aquarium?

194
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:55,720
 Jiang Qiao Xi, look!  
The jellyfishes are so beautiful. 

195
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,820
 I really want to take a bite. 
 They must be delicious. 

196
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,739
 You can't eat them. 
 Most jellyfish are poisonous. 

197
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,620
 How could that be? They're so beautiful. 

198
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,220
 The more beautiful they are, 
 the more poisonous they are. 

199
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,059
 What are you doing? 

200
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,490
 Oh, no! Jiang Qiao Xi. 

201
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,520
 You've poisoned me! 

202
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,560
 Help! Help! 

203
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,220
 Cherry, do you want to see jellyfish? 

204
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,540
 Let's go see them together in the future. 

205
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:31,140
 But there is no aquarium in Qunshan. 

206
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,179
 There is one in the provincial city. 

207
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:35,700
 I don't like the provincial city. 

208
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,860
 Let's not go then. 

209
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,779
 If you're there, I will like it. 

210
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,944
 We will go then. 

211
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:37,679
Where are Du Shang and the others?

212
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,180
They went to the restroom.

213
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,620
I focused my attention on the fish.

214
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,000
My doll was curious.

215
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,940
Fish? Aren't they jellyfish?

216
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,630
Cherry, when you look at jellyfish,

217
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,200
It doesn't seem 
 as if you're looking at jellyfish.

218
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,279
Qin Ye Yun is really something else.

219
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,159
She wanted to visit the aquarium 
 but canceled at the last minute.

220
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,760
You two are just the same.

221
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,999
What you say and think 
 can be very confusing.

222
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,720
Treat Qin Ye Yun more nicely.

223
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,739
Am I not nice to her?

224
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:25,940
Today, she had something to do 
 and couldn't make it.

225
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,100
You should come with her next time.

226
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,239
Why don't you accompany her instead?

227
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,860
I have… too many things on my mind.

228
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,744
I have no time.

229
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,540
♫  Love is in your eyes  ♫

230
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:09,120
♫  You will see flowers blooming  ♫

231
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,972
Bye-bye!

232
00:17:09,972 --> 00:17:12,412
♫  Every minute and every second  ♫

233
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:14,779
♫  I will always be with you  ♫

234
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:16,920
- It's them again. 
 - Who?

235
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
What a small world!

236
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,652
♫  We soar across the seas  ♫

237
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,336
Don't…

238
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:27,940
What are you doing?

239
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,900
I want to hear what a busy brain sounds like.

240
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,319
Does it sound different 
 from a good watermelon?

241
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,740
That's a watermelon, not a brain.

242
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,359
Did you call me a watermelon 
 just to insult me?

243
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,200
- How could I?" That's impossible. 
 - Come here!

244
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,852
I was just joking. 
 Don't take it seriously. It was a joke.

245
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:45,900
   

246
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:55,860
Qin Ye Yun! Qin Ye Yun!

247
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,440
Qin Ye Yun from the convenience store.

248
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,860
What's with that expression?

249
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,220
What kind of expression should I have 
 while watching TV?

250
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,320
It's not me, it's the TV acting up.

251
00:18:16,499 --> 00:18:19,360
Take a good look at it. 
 I picked it just for you.

252
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,700
I'm not giving it to you.

253
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,040
Let me take a look.

254
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,548
I'll accept it.

255
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:32,939
You two are quite similar, 
 with those braided pigtails.

256
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:37,300
- It looks good, doesn't it? 
 - Cherry, you're here.

257
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,580
- Cherry. 
 - Uncle Qin.

258
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,339
Your parents told me 
 you went to the aquarium today.

259
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:45,076
Yes.

260
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:50,219
Ye Yun, since you didn't study at home,

261
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:53,380
why didn't you go out with Cherry 
 to have fun?

262
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,280
All you do is watch TV dramas all day.

263
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,739
What's so good about this?

264
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:01,080
Have you been watching TV all day?

265
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,940
Didn't you say 
 you had something to do today?

266
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,320
Isn't watching TV an activity, too?

267
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,156
Make way!

268
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,600
Qin Ye Yun, you're crazy.

269
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,659
Forget it. I'm not arguing with you.

270
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:22,119
I've watched enough TV. 
 Let's go to your house to hang out.

271
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,419
What? My house isn't a marketplace.

272
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:27,120
I'm trying to keep my dignity.

273
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,679
Dad, I'm leaving!

274
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,300
How much is your dignity worth?

275
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,900
I'm pretty! 
 Clearly, my dignity is worth a lot!

276
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,072
You're not worth much!

277
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:43,959
Where are the slippers?

278
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:46,619
- I'll play first! 
 - Go ahead!

279
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,659
- Yu Qiao! 
 - Dad!

280
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:49,999
- Hello. 
 - Uncle Yu.

281
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:53,140
Shang'er, Fang Yuan, you guys go in first.

282
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,820
You, come here!

283
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,110
Okay, take my camera.

284
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,100
Give me your bag.

285
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,339
- You're turning sixteen this year. 
 - Seventeen.

286
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:21,880
Fine! You're old enough.

287
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,320
We should talk about some things.

288
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,559
Dad, what's wrong?

289
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,539
Did something happen to our family?

290
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,116
Yu Qiao.

291
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:45,659
Do you have a crush on a girl?

292
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,360
I went through this at your age.

293
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,179
I really understand 
 how you're feeling right now.

294
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:59,360
It's normal to like a girl your own age 
 whom you grew up with.

295
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,519
Still, we must rely on our personality 
 and capabilities to impress her

296
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,580
instead of seeking answers 
 on your cell phone.

297
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,239
Besides, your main task now is to study.

298
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:12,460
You can't fall in love now.

299
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:17,160
Dad, I don't understand what you mean.

300
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,780
Are you pursuing Yun Yun?

301
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:31,940
Yun Yun? Qin Ye Yun?

302
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,580
I am pursuing Qin Ye Yun?

303
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,119
If I hadn't seen your cellphone's fee 
 is overdue by ¥200 ($1.30),

304
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:39,320
I wouldn't have known 
 that I raised a romantic son.

305
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,460
W-What?

306
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:53,159
Yu Jin, did you play 
 with my cell phone again?

307
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:55,599
 Brother, I'm asleep! 

308
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,179
What's so funny?

309
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:10,479
Isn't it funny?

310
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:14,379
Yu Jin still believes 
 those TV commercial tests.

311
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:16,219
Aren't you the same?

312
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:19,159
Back in elementary school, 
 you were obsessed with Xiao Zhao.

313
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:22,040
Qin Ye Yun is self-centered.

314
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,840
If she knew, she would be very proud.

315
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:37,160
What does this have to do with me?

316
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:40,780
Qin Ye Yun, why are you running?

317
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,120
Stop it! You just love 
 to look for a good time, don't you?

318
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,148
What's so funny?

319
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,619
As for you, your grin is the worst.

320
00:23:00,348 --> 00:23:02,159
Go away!

321
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,160
It's me.

322
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,659
So it's you, Lin Cherry. 
 I don't want to see you.

323
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:10,780
I'm on your side.

324
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,519
I just scolded them on your behalf.

325
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:14,939
Who told you to scold them?

326
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:19,560
I hate you! I hate you all!

327
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,840
It's all Yu Qiao's fault! He is a big fool,

328
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,780
and doesn't understand anything.

329
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,459
- Why don't we talk to him about this? 
 - What's there to talk about?

330
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:35,439
Just say whatever is on your mind.

331
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:37,239
At the very least, let him know.

332
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:40,699
Is there an obstacle between you two?

333
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,940
Let's go!

334
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,960
You're the obst—

335
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,100
If you tell him, I can no longer be his friend.

336
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,400
Isn't that an obstacle?

337
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:02,979
I think it's quite good now.

338
00:24:02,979 --> 00:24:05,240
I don't really expect too much.

339
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:09,980
At least we can meet every day 
 and interact like friends.

340
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,680
Oh, no! Did I look ugly just now?

341
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:40,019
You looked quite ugly. An ugly monster!

342
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:42,219
Still, I'm prettier than you.

343
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,720
Did you take these photos?

344
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,940
Aren't they nice?

345
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,420
Your photos are really nice.

346
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:14,800
Jiang Qiao Xi,

347
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:19,010
I took these photos with Cen Xiao Man 
 at the aquarium.

348
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,139
Looking at photos takes time.

349
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:25,170
Did you finish your math problems?

350
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,750
Not yet.

351
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,239
Jiang Qiao Xi, 
 I have something else to tell you,

352
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,659
but don't get angry.

353
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,239
I'm telling you this as a friend.

354
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:37,400
Go ahead!

355
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,840
At the aquarium, 
 we ran into Yu Qiao and Lin Qi Le.

356
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,259
Lin Qi Le likely came all the way from Qunshan 
 just to see Yu Qiao.

357
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:49,099
It's no wonder she was cold toward you.

358
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:51,640
Stop it! That's impossible.

359
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,832
It's true.

360
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,780
All right. I'll stop talking about this.

361
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,836
Take your time.

362
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,819
Line AD is the x-axis.

363
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,300
Line AB is the y-axis.

364
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,820
I got it.

365
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,599
Line AE is the z-axis.

366
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:37,896
Didn't you just learn that?

367
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,139
Is there a better way to solve the problem?

368
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,019
Jiang Qiao Xi, come up and solve it.

369
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:06,880
This problem requires 
 a relatively large amount of calculations.

370
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,040
Lin Qi Le will easily make miscalculations 
 because it's too difficult for her.

371
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,459
However, we can simplify it 
 by drawing auxiliary lines.

372
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:23,659
 First, take N as the midpoint of EB. 

373
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:27,519
 Connect MN, and then connect NC. 

374
00:27:28,219 --> 00:27:30,919
 Utilize the theorem of line-plane parallelism 

375
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:34,299
 and this will simplify the problem. 

376
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:39,800
 Jiang Qiao Xi is capable 
 of simplifying difficult problems. 

377
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:55,460
 Excellent! Let's examine 
 both problem-solving methods. 

378
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,780
Cai Fang Yuan! Cai Fang Yuan, let's go!

379
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,259
- Warm it up for me! 
 - Add a tea bag for me!

380
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:06,960
Water card. Water card!

381
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,632
Why are you using mine again?

382
00:28:09,632 --> 00:28:11,248
Here.

383
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,479
I am not demanding. Just fill it up!

384
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:24,939
Are you helping Cai Fang Yuan get water?

385
00:29:24,939 --> 00:29:27,480
Isn't this Yu Qiao's flask?

386
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,240
Yes. This is Jiang Qiao Xi's.

387
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,259
Did Lin Qi Le ask you 
 to get water for Jiang Qiao Xi?

388
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:39,599
She's busy! I'm helping her… 
 I'm helping all our friends fill up water.

389
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,920
It's no big deal!

390
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,140
A friend?

391
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,119
Can't you tell there's a conflict between us?

392
00:29:46,739 --> 00:29:50,419
If Lin Qi Le finds out, 
 she will be mad at you!

393
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,500
Did you fill it for me?

394
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,980
Yes, I took the initiative.

395
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,840
Lin Qi Le didn't want to fill it for you.

396
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,500
Don't get me wrong. 
 From now on, I'll fill it for you.

397
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,319
Don't bother Lin Qi Le in the future.

398
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:43,760
Did she ask you to tell me this?

399
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,840
We're all in the same class.

400
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,360
If you can't be friends,

401
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,670
it's better not to bother each other.

402
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,400
Let's play next time.

403
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,240
Lin Qi Le, thank you.

404
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,380
I'm sorry.

405
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,000
I won't meddle anymore.

406
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,919
Did you get this water?

407
00:31:56,919 --> 00:31:59,140
Don't be mad!

408
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,080
I've warned Jiang Qiao Xi.

409
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,280
He probably won't bother you anymore.

410
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,168
Thank you.

411
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,900
Today's physical test

412
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,600
is 800 meters for the girls 
 and 1,500 meters for the boys.

413
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,700
Hurry up! 
 Let's try to finish this test quickly.

414
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,140
Why do you all react like this 
 when you hear about a physical test?

415
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,560
Even seniors have to take the test. 
 Everyone has to eventually.

416
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,600
Roll call. Song Chu Yang.

417
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,400
- Are you unwell? 
 - Here.

418
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,500
- Feng Le Tian. 
 - Here.

419
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,739
It's okay.

420
00:32:43,739 --> 00:32:45,360
- Ask the teacher for leave. 
 - Jiang Si Si.

421
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,900
Sir, I'd like to take sick leave. 
 I'm not feeling well.

422
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,100
Anyone else?

423
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,810
Sir.

424
00:32:53,292 --> 00:32:54,460
Never mind.

425
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,159
If I don't run this time, 
 I'll have to run later.

426
00:32:57,159 --> 00:32:58,539
 Jiang Qiao Xi, keep it up! 

427
00:32:58,539 --> 00:32:59,899
 Keep it up! 

428
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:02,239
 Jiang Qiao Xi! Keep it up! 

429
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:04,740
 Jiang Qiao Xi! Keep it up! 

430
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,679
 Jiang Qiao Xi! Keep it up! 

431
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:08,380
 Jiang Qiao Xi! Keep it up! 

432
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,679
 Keep it up! 

433
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,940
 Jiang Qiao Xi! Keep it up! 

434
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,419
 Jiang Qiao Xi! Keep it up! 

435
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:21,439
 Jiang Qiao Xi! 

436
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:23,064
- Are you all right? 
 - I'm fine.

437
00:33:23,064 --> 00:33:25,840
 - Jiang Qiao Xi!  
 - I'm fine.

438
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,090
 Keep it up! 

439
00:33:46,788 --> 00:33:51,400
 Jiang Qiao Xi, keep it up! 

440
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:12,960
 Keep it up! 

441
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,719
 Jiang Qiao Xi! Keep it up! 

442
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,572
 Keep it up! 

443
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,519
Did you think you could outrun me?

444
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:31,200
I'm not here to compete with you.

445
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,860
I just want to tell you there is a rumor

446
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,300
that you and Lin Cherry 
 went to the aquarium.

447
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,079
I know there's nothing going on 
 between you two,

448
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,499
but those people don't know that.

449
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,500
How do you know that?

450
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,260
Do you know us that well?

451
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,860
I know Lin Cherry very well.

452
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,900
Don't call her name anymore!

453
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,200
She no longer has anything to do with you!

454
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,100
Yu Qiao, I'm telling you so you know

455
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:02,660
that it might cause trouble for Lin Cherry. 
 Do you understand?

456
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,800
You are the source of her trouble.

457
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,080
What else was in that letter?

458
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,019
Which letter are you talking about?

459
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:24,190
I know you have the second half 
 of the letter.

460
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,330
Give it back to me!

461
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:28,740
I snatched it from Fei Lin Ge.

462
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,419
If you wanted it, why didn't you take it 
 when you had the chance?

463
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:42,016
♫  I want to let you  ♫

464
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:44,160
♫  I want to let you see  ♫

465
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,479
Adjust your breathing!

466
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:47,560
Two steps inhale, two steps exhale.

467
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,900
Don't rush!

468

 ♫  I want to sing for you  ♫

00:35:54,436 --> 00:35:55,780

471
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,360
 Keep it up!

00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,280
 Keep it up!

00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,910
♫  Thinking deeply  ♫

 Keep it up, Xiao Man! 

477
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:13,879
 Xiao Man, you're still number one! 
 Keep it up!

♫  About my loneliness and confusion  ♫

481
00:36:21,836 --> 00:36:23,172
♫  I want to forget  ♫

482

♫  I want to forget  ♫

483

♫  The plain life I once had  ♫

♫  Thinking deeply  ♫

485
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,419
You're not bad, Lin Qi Le.

486
00:36:33,419 --> 00:36:35,839
You are awesome! You ran…

487
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,900
Xiao Man doesn't like to drink peanut milk. 
 She likes cola.

488
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,600
I'll buy it for her.

489
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,100
I'm not buying for her. It's for Lin Qi Le.

490
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,300
Lin Qi Le? She just fainted,

491
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,900
and was sent to the infirmary.

492
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,200
She fainted?

493
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,239
- Drink this. 
 - Thank you, Miss.

494
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:12,970
How do you feel?

495
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,079
Miss, is she all right?

496
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:16,300
Does she need to go to the hospital?

497
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,000
It's all right. Don't worry.

498
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,479
It's just a minor heatstroke. She is quite weak. 
 She'll be fine after some rest.

499
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:24,019
Everything is fine. Go back to your lessons.

500
00:37:24,019 --> 00:37:25,880
If you stay here, you'll disturb her rest.

501
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,536
Give it to me.

502
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,100
Are you feeling better?

503
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:38,380
Then, get a good rest here.

504
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,980
It's fine to sleep until the afternoon. 
 I'll get lunch for you.

505
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,160
Don't stay with me, you two.

506
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,860
Go back. Go back now.

507
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:56,939
Just go. I'm fine.

508
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,600
- Goodbye, Miss! 
 - Goodbye, Miss!

509
00:39:29,899 --> 00:39:31,639
 Jiang Qiao Xi. 

510
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:34,760
 Cherry, are you feeling better? 

511
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,400
 I want to drink peanut milk, 

512
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,680
 but Mom said I can't drink cold beverages 
 when I have a fever or a cold. 

513
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,610
 I can only drink hot water. 

514
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:47,779
 I don't want to drink hot water. 
 What should I do? 

515
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,200
 Don't be afraid! Aunt Juan went to work. 

516
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,680
 I heated up the peanut milk. Drink it! 

517
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:09,900
 Jiang Qiao Xi, you are so nice. 

518
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,300
 I hate being sick the most. 

519
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,239
 From now on, stay with me when I'm sick. 
 Do you understand? 

520
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:26,500
Jiang Qiao Xi, 
 it's so nice to have you here.

521
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,479
What's wrong? Are you feeling hot?

522
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:55,492
Why are you here?

523
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,820
I'm here to see you.

524
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,400
I don't need you to visit me.

525
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,880
Are we that close? 
 There's no need for you to be here.

526
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,399
Technically, we are currently classmates.

527
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,579
Thank you, my classmate.

528
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:12,240
I'm fine now, though.

529
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,999
Don't sit here! It'll be hard to explain 
 if the teacher checks and sees us.

530
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:17,959
- You should leave. 
 - It's fine.

531
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:21,419
I'll just say I came to see the doctor 
 and get some medicine!

532
00:41:21,419 --> 00:41:23,900
Weren't you the one 
 who said you couldn't lie?

533
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,400
I can do it if it's for you.

534
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,616
Who cares?

535
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,500
All right then. I'll shut up.

536
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,779
Leave.

537
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:50,400
Didn't you just say 
 that it's nice to have me here?

538
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,540
I didn't say that to you.

539
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,800
I remember when you were little,

540
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,099
you told me to stay with you 
 whenever you were sick.

541
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:08,600
Really? I don't remember.

542
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,500
It's fine. I'll remember these for you.

543
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,604
Jiang Qiao Xi!

544
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,000
Why do you keep repeating these words?

545
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,800
Are they the only words in your head?

546
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,608
Are you leaving or not?

547
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:29,120
If you don't, then I will.

548
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,480
I'll leave now. Get a good rest.

549
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:40,700
D-Don't say those useless words anymore.

550
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,300
I don't like it. I find it annoying.

551
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,000
All right, I got it.

552
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,420
Jiang Qiao Xi, why are you here?

553
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,239
- Miss, someone told me not to… 
 - Miss,

554
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:01,360
he is not feeling well and came to see you,

555
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,099
but you weren't here.

556
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:05,096
Where is the discomfort?

557
00:43:05,096 --> 00:43:08,059
- His head! 
 - His head?

558
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,099
Miss, I just promised someone 
 that I wouldn't lie,

559
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:16,800
so I'm telling you the truth now.

560
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,700
She and I are in the same class,

561
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,600
and I am here to check on her.

562
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,740
Miss, I'm leaving.
