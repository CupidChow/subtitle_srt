1
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:39,060
 

2
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,860
If you don't want to talk, I won't push.

3
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,500
Do you really think your current situation
could be the reason Cherry can't be with you?

4
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,060
It's the reason

5
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:01,659
I can't be with Cherry.

6
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,719
You feel trapped
in this situation with no way out.

7
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,519
That's why you can't be with Cherry.

8
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:20,820
But how long should Cherry wait?
Ten years? Twenty?

9
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,300
Until you finally think you're ready to go to her?

10
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,600
What if Cherry gets married? Has children?

11
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:41,639
Will you just watch from afar, wish her happiness,

12
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:46,660
and silently tell her in your heart
that you've always loved her?

13
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:53,699
Jiang Qiao Xi, don't you realize the script
you're writing for yourself

14
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:57,100
is arrogant and utterly boring?

15
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,219
Yu Qiao.

16
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:19,200
Sometimes I really envy you.

17
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,440
You should envy me.

18
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,979
Because, unlike you, I believe in Cherry,

19
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:29,779
and I know what kind of person she truly is.

20
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,559
Yeah.

21
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,399
Please don't tell Cherry I'm here.

22
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,759
Why would I tell her? What's in it for me?

23
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,640
Then why did you come looking for me?

24
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:05,780
I came because you're my friend
and someone Cherry loves.

25
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,479
I was worried when you disappeared without a word.

26
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,279
But seeing you're okay now gives me peace.

27
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,139
I'm sorry.

28
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,800
I'm sorry for making you worry.

29
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,259
But I... I genuinely don't know
what else I can do.

30
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,579
Your apology is accepted.

31
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:45,119
But when we return,
I'll confess my feelings to Cherry.

32
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:59,680
 ♫ You lock up your heart ♫ 

33
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,296

You know what? The patient in the next bed...

52
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,900
He was taken home by his son
after running out of money.

53
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,040
Miss, don't worry. We won't shortchange you.

54
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,879
You've misunderstood me, young man.
That's not what I meant.

55
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:25,470
 She's not doing well. 

56
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,459
 Even though she seems no different on the surface, 

57
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:33,300
 she tutors every day to save money,
working extremely hard. 

58
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,460
 She says no matter where you are,
she'll definitely find you. 

59
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,100
 Do you really think your current situation
could be the reason Cherry can't be with you? 

60
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:46,819
 How long will you make Cherry wait?
Ten years? Twenty years? 

61
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,699
 What if Cherry gets married? Has children? 

62
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:52,339
 Will you just watch from afar, wish her happiness, 

63
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:56,420
 and silently tell her in your heart
that you've always loved her? 

64
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:08,400
Qiao Xi, you must be tired. Go home and rest.

65
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,680
Is there something bothering you?

66
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,480
No.

67
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:26,920
I just think you're amazing,

68
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,160
taking care of my brother for so long.

69
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:38,939
There's nothing amazing about it.
Anyone would do this in such circumstances.

70
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,280
Haven't you been by your cousin's side too?

71
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm his brother.
It's only natural for me to do this.

72
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,459
Not all relationships depend on blood ties.
Go home and rest.

73
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:57,259
Alright.

74
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,379
Hurry home and get some rest.

75
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:04,179
I'll take my leave then.

76
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,980
Ruo Cheng, sit up. Let me feed you.

77
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,900
I made your favorite fish congee
and picked out all the bones.

78
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:22,819
No need to be so formal.

79
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:27,139
This is bad. You've been cooking
such delicious meals for me these years.

80
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:34,839
I'm afraid I won't adjust well once I recover.

81
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,120
Are you really not studying, Senior?

82
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,940
As your senior, I'm here
to supervise your studies, so study hard now.

83
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,940
I've barely seen you study these years.

84
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,859
Then why did you get the only
grad school recommendation spot in your class?

85
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,740
Do you really want to know why?

86
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,219
I'm too smart to bother studying.

87
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,939
Seriously. Why doesn't anyone believe me?

88
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,580
It's Sunday. Why hasn't our
Flight Academy hunk shown up yet?

89
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,240
Did you two have a fight?

90
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,860
Why would we fight? He's probably busy.

91
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,480
Besides, I've been busy with tutoring lately.

92
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,919
It's not like we have to meet every week.

93
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:45,600
That won't do. You need to do something.

94
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,500
Do what? It's totally fine
that we all mind our own business.

95
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,819
Oh my dear junior, what should we do with you?

96
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,120
Your last backup is slipping away.
I'm worried for you.

97
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,820
Senior, I know why you got that recommendation.

98
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,760
They ranked you by how savage your tongue is.

99
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,240
Hit a nerve, huh?
Look at you, getting all defensive.

100
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,440
Don't be mad. Here, have some coffee.

101
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,540
I'm just looking out for you.

102
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,179
Who is it?

103
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:37,820
Why are you peeking at my phone?

104
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,340
Well, a genius needs some amusement.

105
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,939
 Cherry, I'm waiting at your school's
cruise ship snack bar. Come out. 

106
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,200
Help me return this.
I need to leave for something urgent.

107
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,000
Where are you going? I'll go with you.

108
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,679
Yu Qiao.

109
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,199
Why do you look so exhausted?
Did you stay up all night?

110
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,219
Cherry, could you buy me a bottle of water?

111
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:44,840
Cherry, use my money.

112
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,920
It's just water. Why are you being so particular?

113
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,460
Wait.

114
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,260
Please buy it for me.

115
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,020
Fine. Wait here.

116
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:25,289
 

117
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:36,059
Cher...

118
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,459
Cherry, I found Jiang Qiao Xi.
I know where he is now.

119
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,759
He lives near the Fortune Building.

120
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,059
When you reach there,
take the Tsuen Wan Line towards Central,

121
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:23,559
get off at Admiralty Station, then transfer
to the Island Line heading to Chai Wan.

122
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,820
Exit at Tin Hau Station Exit A,
then go to the bus stop on King's Road.

123
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,300
Take New World Bus Route 2
to reach Fortune Building.

124
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:34,859
He lives in Unit 1501.

125
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:42,020
Of course, if you can't remember
all the routes, just take a taxi.

126
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,860
You went there?

127
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,660
Cherry.

128
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,340
I won't have time to have meals with you anymore.

129
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,799
Our Flight Academy juniors
are going to Canada soon.

130
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:01,320
I need to prepare for IELTS
and flight school interviews.

131
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,520
I won't have time to visit you anymore.

132
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,020
Take good care of yourself.

133
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:20,500
Yu Qiao! Yu Qiao!

134
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,360
Don't you want your wallet?

135
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,059
Keep it. Consider it sponsorship for your trip.

136
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:30,640
Trying to make me owe you? No way.

137
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,660
Cherry, do you know
the worst thing I've ever done?

138
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,480
What?

139
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,179
When I heard about Jiang Qiao Xi,
I didn't tell you immediately.

140
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,780
Yu Qiao.

141
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,920
Thank you.

142
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,479
Lin Cherry, have a safe trip.

143
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:55,599
When I go there, I'll buy you Ray-Ban sunglasses.

144
00:16:17,632 --> 00:16:25,399
 

145
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,819
Hey boss, it's raining. Don't catch a cold.

146
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,760
Jiang Qiao Xi.

147
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:38,479
You think acting melancholic earns you money?

148
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:54,519
Yin, I'm getting used to viewing
the city from this spot.

149
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:01,639
Right, you used to live in a Repulse Bay mansion.

150
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,680
Now you're in a place smaller than a rat's nest.

151
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,980
Don't give me that
when you're the landlord of an entire building.

152
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,359
What? You've known I own buildings for ages.

153
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,359
You've known for more than a day
that you need to pay me rent, right?

154
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:31,319
Vincent, what's the relationship
with that friend of yours last time?

155
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:33,899
Since he came, you've been acting strangely.

156
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:42,259
He's someone very similar to me.

157
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:46,099
Similar how? Both tall and handsome or something?

158
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:54,280
We share the same expectations.

159
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,000
The difference is that he still
has a chance while I don't.

160
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,780
Why would you say that?

161
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,700
What's really going on with you?

162
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:25,639
I used to think life was like a cage.

163
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,559
For my own freedom and for those I care about,

164
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,300
I've been searching for the key
to unlock the cage.

165
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:43,319
Back then, I thought I was smart enough
to open any cage.

166
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:53,780
But now I realize
that besides the visible cages in this world,

167
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,180
there are countless invisible ones too.

168
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:05,280
Facing these cages, I feel utterly helpless.

169
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:14,059
I don't want those I love
to be trapped in these cages with me.

170
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,380
You're usually so quiet,

171
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,480
and when you finally speak, it's all metaphorical.

172
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,800
I'm getting a headache listening to you.

173
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,819
Love shouldn't have cages or barriers.

174
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:38,500
With your good looks,
you don't need to make it so tragic.

175
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,440
Maybe that girl will come
looking for you tomorrow.

176
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:46,619
What? Don't you believe it?

177
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,419
It's not that I don't believe it.

178
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:56,500
I just think she shouldn't see me like this.

179
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,559
I don't want her to, either.

180
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:06,799
Relax, even when down on your luck,
handsome guys like you have a unique charm,

181
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,144
like a drenched, adorable puppy.

182
00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:16,079
There are plenty of rich women
who like your type, you know.

183
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,180
You just got your pass,
and you want to leave this afternoon?

184
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,680
In such a hurry?

185
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,200
If I don't go now,

186
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,180
he might suddenly go to California, London,
Spain, or Cambodia next.

187
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,480
I'd need to save years' worth of plane tickets.

188
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,700
At least this is closer.

189
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,780
You think you're getting a bargain, huh?

190
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:44,240
Have you heard of this emotion called anger?

191
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,940
Why should I be angry?

192
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,500
Why? He suddenly vanished without a trace,

193
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,299
making you travel all that way to find him.

194
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:57,139
You should be confronting him,
not being all excited about it.

195
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,519
Just finding him and seeing him again
makes me happy enough.

196
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:05,659
We'll deal with the rest when we meet.

197
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,019
I really don't get it.

198
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:13,180
You've got princess luck,
but insist on suffering unnecessary hardships.

199
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,640
I'm not the princess. He is.

200
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,020
Always trapped in some tower,
needing me to rescue him.

201
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:30,319
Should I admire your loyalty
or call you a glutton for punishment?

202
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,160
Let me do it. Let me.

203
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,619
Just wish me a smooth journey.

204
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:42,339
As a girl traveling to such a faraway place,
you really need to be careful.

205
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:45,660
- Got it!
- You're going there for the first time.

206
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,000
In an unfamiliar place,
make sure not to lose anything!

207
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,519
Call me anytime if anything happens, got it?

208
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,440
Alright, I got it. Don't worry about me.

209
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,319
I'm running late. Bye Sis!

210
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,079
Stay safe and come back soon.

263
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:41,819
- Hello?
- Who are you looking for?

264
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:48,440
I-I'm here to see a friend. Can I go in?

265
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,619
Thank you. Thank you.

266
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:21,940
Excuse me, is this
the Fortune Building West Tower?

267
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,420
Do you know this person?
Jiang Qiao Xi. He's in Unit 1501.

268
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,400
I need to find him.

269
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,599
I don't understand. Don't understand.

270
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,359
You can't go up. Wait here. Wait here.

271
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,819
Do you know Jiang Qiao Xi?

272
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:21,940
Miss, you can't sleep here. No sleeping allowed.

273
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,720
Young lady...

274
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,259
What are you doing? What are you doing?

275
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,380
Don't shout. Don't shout.

276
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,200
You'll attract police attention.
They'll arrest you.

277
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
I mean no harm.

278
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,519
Hey! Why did you let a girl sleep out here?

279
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:51,879
You said no visitors allowed. So I made her leave.

280
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:53,720
What?

281
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,400
Are you here to see someone?

282
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,440
Answer him! He owns this building.

283
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,720
I'm talking to you! I own this building!

284
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,319
You own this building?

285
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:14,920
Here and here. The whole building's mine.

286
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,899
No one moves in without my approval.

287
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,279
Are you looking for someone?

288
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,920
Is any of your tenants a boy named...

289
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,260
Jiang Qiao Xi?

290
00:28:38,019 --> 00:28:41,980
Yes! That's him. Jiang Qiao Xi. Do you know him?

291
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,619
I already told this gentleman.

292
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:49,140
So many girls come looking for Jiang Qiao Xi,

293
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,872
but I never let any of them in.

294
00:28:51,872 --> 00:28:54,419
No. No. No.

295
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,020
But I...

296
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,599
Want to come in?

297
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:29,119
This way.

298
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:32,680
Watch your step. Careful.

299
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,480
Thank you.

300
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,480
This unit.

301
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:01,419
I rented it to him cheaply.

302
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:12,480
Actually... I've seen you before.

303
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,680
You'll know once you go inside.

304
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,980
Thank you.

305
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,780
You're welcome.

306
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,180
Thank you.

307
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:59,900
Qing, you're going to kill someone
by leaving all this stuff lying around!

308
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,700
Okay, okay, okay.

309
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:10,400
I brought it in, Mr. Han.

310
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,660
What are you doing here so late?
I've already paid rent this month.

311
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,920
I'll pay you rent.

312
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,059
Mrs. Qing.

313
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:20,099
Mr. Han, what's going on?

314
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:21,960
I want to rent your place
for a few hours to watch a show.

315
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,760
A show?

316
00:32:12,074 --> 00:32:13,871
 

317
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:19,791
 

318
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:25,088
 

319
00:32:28,938 --> 00:32:34,752
 

320
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:37,632
 ♫ Memories drift in my pupils ♫

362
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:31,079
Vincent, you didn't chase the moon,
so the moon came looking for you.

363
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:34,280
Cut back on those late-night TV dramas, will you?

364
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:23,480
What's wrong with you? Why let her into my room?

365
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,900
Why scold me in Cantonese?
Afraid the girl would understand?

366
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,980
You little troublemaker.

367
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,880
I've shielded you from so many girls,
and not even a thank you?

368
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,380
I just let one in, and you yell at me.

369
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,679
I didn't do it casually.

370
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:40,280
I've seen tons of this girl's photos in your room.

371
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,800
Enough. Shut it.

372
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,120
Guilty conscience. Definitely guilty.

373
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,539
So the little sister's here.

374
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:52,949
Vincent, you're such a lovesick fool.

375
00:38:52,949 --> 00:38:55,619
Mr. Han, you didn't tell me.

376
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:58,300
- Shut up!
- What's it to you?

377
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,980
- He's closed up.
- He already closed.

378
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,439
He's already closed the door.

379
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,060
Jiang Qiao Xi?

380
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,839
Is that you?

381
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,339
The elevator's broken here.

382
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,560
You'll have to make do at my place tonight.

383
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,360
I'll stay at Han Yin's place.
Let's have a meal tomorrow.

384
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,160
Then, you can book a flight and go back.

385
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:55,379
I didn't come here just for a meal with you.

386
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:02,019
Okay, stay longer. I'll book you a hotel.

387
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:06,420
Disneyland, Ocean Park...
You'd probably like those places.

388
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,679
I don't want Disney or Ocean Park.

389
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:13,739
I came here because you're here.

390
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:19,280
Jiang Qiao Xi, you told me not to forget you.

391
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:27,999
I have a new life now, Cherry.

392
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:36,820
Does your "new life" mean
cutting all ties with the past?

393
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,680
Does this past include me too?

394
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,039
Yes. I'm doing just fine now.

395
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,679
I'm living my life seriously now.

396
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:52,820
You should too, Cherry.

397
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,920
Then why did you talk to me
about the future back then?

398
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,860
Why did you tell me not to forget you?

399
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,840
Then you left without a single word.

400
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,679
Because I don't need it. I don't need it, Cherry.

401
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:06,420
What don't you need?
This whole place is filled with me.

402
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,220
Jiang Qiao Xi, do you think
that's remotely convincing?

403
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,899
Why do you keep locking yourself away?

404
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:29,280
Every little problem makes you
spiral into stubbornness.

405
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,479
So stubborn and narrow-minded.

406
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,120
You always make decisions alone,
expecting everyone to follow.

407
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,580
I put in so much effort
to come here. I won't leave.

408
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,600
Jiang Qiao Xi.

409
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,140
I've had so many dreams.

410
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,300
In them, it's like different parallel worlds
with countless versions of you.

411
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:37,479
Each version of you has a different ending.

412
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:45,280
Those versions of you in the parallel worlds

413
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:53,899
probably never imagined I'd turn out like this.
