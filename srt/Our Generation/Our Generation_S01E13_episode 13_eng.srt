1
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:39,008
 

2
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,559
Did you read my journal?

3
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,820
I just accidentally glanced at it.

4
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,800
What did you see?

5
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,279
I saw you wrote

6
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,939
that I didn't write letters or call you.

7
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,179
And that you never want to get hurt
because of me again.

8
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:17,420
But now, I don't want you to get hurt
because of yourself either.

9
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,499
Cherry, did I scare you today?

10
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,140
Jiang Qiao Xi, you're...

11
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,439
You're so mean.

12
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,319
Always making me cry, right?

13
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,119
Yes.

14
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,959
But even so, I still want to tell you

15
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:12,759
that meeting you was the best thing in my life.

16
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:20,759
Jiang Qiao Xi, when I look
into your eyes, you are all I see.

17
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,119
Every time I say this name,
I only think of Qun Shan's sunsets.

18
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,420
All these things belong to you.
I gave them to you.

19
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,459
There's no way you can return them to me.

20
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:39,660
Even if you tried to return them,
I wouldn't take them back.

21
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,780
Don't worry, Cherry, I see it now.

22
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:56,040
I know what I should live for.

23
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:06,439
Okay, that's everything.

24
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,300
Great.

25
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,519
I'll get some more canola flowers.

26
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,319
Okay.

27
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,019
Coming.

28
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:15,819
Mr. Jiang.

29
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,740
Qiao Xi is inside.

30
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,480
Thank you.

31
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,280
Have a seat.

32
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,480
Sit, sit, please sit.

33
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,199
Come sit down quickly. Let's eat together.

34
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,759
Watch your hand.

35
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,600
Hello?

36
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,480
Did Cherry and Jiang Qiao Xi cry?

37
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:01,879
Look at Qin Ye Yun's face.
She's probably laughing at us.

38
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:15,519
So be it. You can laugh too if you feel like it.

39
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:32,079
From this moment on,
consider the old Jiang Qiao Xi gone.

40
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:43,040
Now you belong to Qun Shan,
and you belong to yourself.

41
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,360
No one can control you anymore,
nor can anyone confine you.

42
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,720
You'll live as Jiang Qiao Xi from now on.

43
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,279
But no matter what method you use,

44
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,939
you must never hurt yourself
or let yourself get hurt again.

45
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:18,879
I won't. Because Cherry sees me for who I am.

46
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,100
And all of Qun Shan sees me too.

47
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:31,040
Today, I'm finally free.

48
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:05,720
Starting today, I don't need any of these things.

49
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,860
I have a name. I'm Jiang Qiao Xi.

50
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,519
 He just wanted to find a place
far away from all of you. 

51
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,759
 He disappeared on a hill so close to home.
Do you really believe it's just... 

52
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,000
 You can't talk about him like that. 

53
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,900
 Then how should I talk about him? 

54
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:24,659
 Go and ask him yourselves
in front of his memorial tablet, 

55
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:26,360
 if I've ever wronged him. 

56
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,100
 Today I'm returning these to you.
From now on, I'll only be my true self. 

57
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,959
Why? Why?!

58
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,900
Is it serious? Okay, I'm on my way.

59
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,419
What's wrong?

60
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:51,539
Hai Feng, Qiao Xi's mom, Hong Fei,
was in a car accident.

61
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:52,600
I need to get there immediately.

62
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,740
Okay, I'll go with you.

63
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,540
Go quickly! Hurry!

64
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:06,979
Cherry, come out for a moment.

65
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,980
Mom, what's wrong?

66
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,440
Cherry, Qiao Xi's mother, had a car accident.

67
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,139
We are going to the hospital with Mr. Jiang.
You stay home with Qiao Xi.

68
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:29,559
What about me?

69
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,740
Don't panic. We'll be at the hospital.

70
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,540
Keep an eye on Qiao Xi.

71
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:53,339
Hong Fei...

72
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,200
The patient was very fortunate.
Her injuries aren't serious.

73
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,820
Mostly soft tissue contusions
and a minor concussion.

74
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,659
She might experience nausea
and dizziness in the coming days.

75
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:25,020
What she needs most now is rest
and emotional stability.

76
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,960
I understand that math prodigies
often have strong personalities.

77
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,820
But what you're showing now
isn't personality, but stubbornness.

78
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,279
Did you just casually give up
the Olympiad recommendation chance?

79
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:50,740
When you could have showcased
our country's talents on the world stage,

80
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,580
you refused without hesitation!

81
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,960
Do you realize what you've abandoned?

82
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,580
You have not only given up

83
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,000
an opportunity for yourself,
but a chance for First Experimental High School,

84
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,440
no, for the entire city of Jialin
to gain recognition!

85
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,139
Principal, please calm down.

86
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:08,559
Jiang Qiao Xi must have his reasons.
Let's communicate properly with him.

87
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,080
I've respected his opinions too much!
That's why he's become so arrogant!

88
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,639
Jiang Qiao Xi, you need to
value the opportunities you have.

89
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,879
The Director is right.
Decisions should be made carefully.

90
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:27,620
Jiang Qiao Xi, I've always
known you as a sensible student.

91
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,259
We understand this is
a temporary teenage rebellion.

92
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:35,659
Take your time to think it through carefully.

93
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:37,189
I don't understand.

94
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,019
With his brilliant mind,

95
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:42,799
how can he not understand something so simple?

96
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:49,360
Never mind your parents' sacrifices
or the school's investment in you.

97
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,200
Just think about yourself. You're still a minor!

98
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,539
Do you know what decisions are truly good for you?

99
00:12:56,539 --> 00:13:00,899
Do you know what decisions show responsibility?

100
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,320
Principal, I'm sorry. Here, let me...

101
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,960
Please, have a seat. My son is...

102
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,000
Lin Qi Le, what are you doing here?
Did you skip class?

103
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,940
It's noon dismissal now.
I came to deliver lunch to Ms. Liang.

104
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,940
Mr. Jiang, this is pigeon soup my mom stewed.

105
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,360
It was just finished stewing,
so it might still be hot.

106
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,139
How about snakehead fish soup tomorrow?

107
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,240
Thank you so much.
We're really troubling your family.

108
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,199
It's fine. We're neighbors.
Helping each other is what we should do.

109
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,820
Jiang Qiao Xi, my parents
want you to come home for lunch.

110
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,399
You've been pushing yourself too hard lately.

111
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,159
If we don't call you for meals,
you won't eat anything at all.

112
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:45,039
We literally have to watch you. Let's go.

113
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,500
Okay. Madam, Principal, I'll head out now.

114
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:55,679
Goodbye, Mr. Jiang, Ms. Liang. Excuse us.

115
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,319
See how obedient your son was?

116
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:16,620
Were those teachers really angry earlier?

117
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:27,359
Yes. They all want the old Jiang Qiao Xi back,
not the current version.

118
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:32,740
What should we do, Cherry?

119
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:44,280
It doesn't matter what others think.
Your opinion matters the most.

120
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:53,599
What about you? Which Jiang Qiao Xi do you prefer?

121
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,059
I think the version that makes him the happiest

122
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:14,459
and makes him love himself is the better one.

123
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,520
That's such a Cherry thing to say.

124
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,420
Have you been exhausted these past few days?

125
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:33,579
It's manageable. Nothing compared
to how tired I used to be.

126
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:41,339
Those same old lectures every day get so tedious.

127
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,459
What about now?

128
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,980
Now... it's slightly better.

129
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,019
Just slightly?

130
00:15:56,019 --> 00:16:00,460
The scenery is beautiful and the sunshine is warm,

131
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,400
yet you're still not satisfied.

132
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:14,939
True. Nothing feels warmer than this moment.

133
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:21,860
If you keep leaning like that, you'll fall.

134
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:29,359
I won't. Not with you here beside me.

135
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,479
You trust me that much?

136
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:59,300
Cherry, why have you never asked me
what I want to do in the future?

137
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:12,579
Those questions are exhausting to answer.

138
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:18,579
You've been tired for so long.
You should rest first.

139
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,259
Asking me whether Jiang Qiao Xi
will come is pointless.

140
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:31,359
Even asking him won't help.
Only Lin Qi Le would know.

141
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,200
Actually, her parents probably
know too, not just her.

142
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,640
That's nonsense. How would Lin Qi Le know
something Jiang Qiao Xi himself doesn't?

143
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,099
Cai Fang Yuan isn't lying. It's true.

144
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:43,259
Back when Jiang Qiao Xi
studied with us in Qun Shan,

145
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:45,099
after school, no one could ever find him.

146
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:47,700
The only place to look was Lin Qi Le's house.

147
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,380
He should have bought a bed
and lived at their place.

148
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,660
The rest of the time,
he might as well have been their biological son.

149
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,099
- Were they really that close?
- Lin Qi Le.

150
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:58,200
Of course.

151
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,899
When exactly is Jiang Qiao Xi returning to school?

152
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:06,099
I don't know either.

153
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:14,740
Perhaps when he wants to.

154
00:18:28,992 --> 00:18:32,284
 ♫ Once again in the night ♫ 

155
00:18:32,284 --> 00:18:36,339
 ♫ I am like dust ♫ 

156
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:40,960
Lin Qi Le, when exactly does Jiang Qiao Xi
plan to return to school?

157
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,824
When he comes back.

158
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,692

159
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:52,572
 ♫ But hear the sound ♫ 

160
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:58,140
You're just spinning in circles
and trying to fool me.

161
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,912
I genuinely don't know. And you're
the one interrogating me over and over.

162
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:06,108
 ♫ My dream ♫ 

163
00:19:06,108 --> 00:19:09,760
 ♫ I must set it free ♫ 

164
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,068
 ♫ I want ♫ 

165
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:13,084
 ♫ I want you to see ♫ 

166
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:16,540
 ♫ The shining light within me ♫ 

167
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,108
 ♫ I want to sing ♫ 

168
00:19:18,108 --> 00:19:20,092
 ♫ I want to sing for you ♫ 

169
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,420
 ♫ My loneliness and confusion ♫ 

170
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,508
 ♫ I want to forget ♫ 

171
00:19:24,508 --> 00:19:26,812
 ♫ I want to forget the past ♫ 

172
00:19:26,812 --> 00:19:30,332
 ♫ Those ordinary years of growth ♫ 

173
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:32,092
 ♫ Brewing ♫ 

174
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:33,404
 ♫ Gazing out ♫ 

175
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:37,276
 ♫ Towards the horizon ♫ 

176
00:19:51,328 --> 00:19:54,656
 ♫ Once again in the night ♫ 

177
00:19:54,656 --> 00:19:58,176
 ♫ I sing my heart out ♫ 

178
00:19:58,176 --> 00:20:01,344
 ♫ My hollow soul feels the blood ♫ 

179
00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:03,872
 ♫ Flowing ♫ 

180
00:20:04,992 --> 00:20:08,156
 ♫ Once again in my dream ♫ 

181
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:11,164
 ♫ I smell fragrance ♫ 

182
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,519
 ♫ Like white wildflowers on morning paths ♫ 

183
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:18,819
I thought it was heavier than usual.
Who allowed you to board?

184
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:21,680
Get off. Get off. Alright, be careful.

185
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,079
Kids these days have no concept of time, do they?

186
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,319
The one thing I have plenty of now is time.

187
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,819
If you're not short on time now,
when would you be?

188
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:34,119
Wandering around like a vagrant every day,
not even attending school.

189
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,220
Go work in a factory. That'd be great.

190
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,172
 ♫ The shining light within me ♫ 

191
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:40,508
 ♫ I want to sing ♫ 

192
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,380
Jiang Qiao Xi, what exactly does he want?

193
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,039
He quit the national training team,
gave up the national team,

194
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,259
gave up his guaranteed college admission,

195
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:48,608
and now, he won't even come to school.

196
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:50,660
What's his endgame?

197
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,240
It's his decision. He'll talk when he's ready.

198
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,880
As a friend, all I can do is support him.

199
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,839
If I were truly worried,

200
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,640
I'd only worry about whether
he's eating and sleeping well,

201
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,539
and whether he's truly happy.

202
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:10,000
If these questions of yours
make him unhappy, then I won't ask.

203
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,900
Lin Qi Le, don't you realize
how precarious his situation is?

204
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,940
He just wants to be himself.
I don't see the danger in that.

Cherry.

208
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,380
Qiao Xi, have some ribs.

209
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,559
Thank you, Mrs. Lin.

210
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,839
The bowls and spoons. Let me help you carry them.

211
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,240
Take the spoons and soup bowls over together.

212
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:48,579
Guess what kind of soup this is.

213
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,700
Egg drop soup?

214
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,700
You guessed right.

215
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,720
I ate that.

216
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:04,139
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

217
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:43,759
Qiao Xi, I can do it.

218
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:46,000
Nah, I can do it.

219
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,700
- Let's do it together.
- It's alright.

220
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,500
Alright.

221
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:58,899
Go ahead.

222
00:23:04,579 --> 00:23:10,359
Mr. Lin, if there's anything
you want to ask me, go ahead.

223
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:18,079
Cherry told us before not to ask anything.

224
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:24,319
I thought if you want to share, you will.
If not, that's fine too.

225
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:31,379
But given today's outcome,
saying anything now would be unnecessary.

226
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,640
It's okay, Mr. Lin. If you have
something to say, I'm ready to listen.

227
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,640
Are you sure?

228
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,900
Yeah.

229
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,539
About your abilities, your talents, so to speak.

230
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:48,639
What are your thoughts? Any plans?

231
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,640
Do you have any suggestions?

232
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,200
I think Secretary Li has a point.

233
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,359
If you waste your talent like this...

234
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:02,160
- Dad!
- It'd be a shame.

235
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,740
Stop! Even I'm tired of hearing this,
let alone Jiang Qiao Xi.

236
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,779
- Just leave this to me.
- It's fine. My hands are already wet.

237
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:10,639
Okay, I'll stop here.

238
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:16,059
But, even if many people have said it,
I still need to say it, because...

239
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:20,440
- Stop.
- What I say today is different from others.

240
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:31,579
I believe you brought your talent to this world,

241
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:33,769
not the other way around.

242
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:36,619
Don't be imprisoned, drained, or exhausted

243
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:38,500
by your talent.

244
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,880
You should use it well
to make yourself shine brightly.

245
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,839
Your happiness is what
makes your talent worthwhile.

246
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:55,240
Otherwise, what's wasted
isn't your talent, but your life.

247
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,119
Have I made myself clear?

248
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,119
I understand.

249
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:12,079
But I don't think that's what they meant.

250
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,240
I couldn't say that in front of them.

251
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,460
Now that we're alone, can't we speak freely?

252
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:23,740
That's the idea. Just for your reference.

253
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,240
Cherry, I really envy you.

254
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:39,680
In the past, everyone told me
not to waste my talent.

255
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:46,300
But no one really cares
about what these talents can do for me.

256
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:53,440
Only you, Mr. Lin, saw my existence
through these talents.

257
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,940
Wait, only I noticed?

258
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,480
No, I saw it too.

259
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,119
- And me!
- We all saw it. Everyone saw it!

260
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:11,700
Thank you all. I really needed these words.
They mean a lot to me.

261
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,599
Cherry, see? Listen to your dad more from now on.

262
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:22,480
Your dad's advice
has been certified by an actual genius.

263
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,359
I will listen to you more.

264
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:26,859
Why don't you say something to me? I'm listening.

265
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:32,759
For you? Then listen carefully
to what I'm about to say. It's important.

266
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:37,200
You can't skip eating carrots.

267
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,119
No.

268
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,500
Dad.

269
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,440
Are you feeling satisfied now?

270
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,759
I used to imagine this exact scene
to get through lonely days.

271
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:14,299
Back then, I thought actually doing it
would feel satisfying.

272
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:19,579
But now that the day has come, I just feel calm.

273
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,140
You're calm?

274
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:32,040
But our family's efforts over these years
are treated like garbage now.

275
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:49,300
Qiao Xi, I never imagined you to be so ruthless.

276
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,240
Is there truly no room left for compromise?

277
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,940
Dad, do you want to keep it as a memento?

278
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,200
Have you eaten? Let me cook for you, Dad.

279
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,760
How's your hand?

280
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,800
Fully healed.

281
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:31,200
Your mom still hasn't moved on, you know.

282
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,919
Olympiad champions can enter the national team
and get direct admission to Qingbei University.

283
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:40,440
These are all things she wanted you to achieve.

284
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,300
And you're throwing all of that away?

285
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:56,280
Dad, I'll take out the trash.

286
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,720
Mom, try this.

287
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,759
It's pretty good.

288
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:24,059
I made it myself. Does this mean
I have cooking talent too?

289
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,040
Wait, there are more dishes.

290
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:40,319
Let me pour you some tea.

291
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:53,539
You're wasting your talents and intelligence
on this nonsense. Do you want to be a cook?

292
00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:59,700
No. When I'm cooking,
I don't think about anything else.

293
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,460
You just want to destroy yourself.

294
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,980
There are thousands of ways
you could take revenge on me.

295
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,839
Why choose math?

296
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,139
Do you remember how I started learning math?

297
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:28,460
Of course, I do. You were
only four in kindergarten.

298
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:34,299
While other kids played with toys,
you focused on the abacus.

299
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:39,559
We discovered your math talent then
and sent you to Olympiad classes.

300
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:42,579
Within a year, you brought home many awards.

301
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:46,899
Everyone said I'd given birth to another genius.

302
00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:58,859
What I remember is when I was
in kindergarten, during Mother's Day,

303
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:03,399
I gave you a drawing of you smiling.

304
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:12,260
But after receiving it, you told me
that you wanted an Olympiad medal instead.

305
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,280
Later, I got that too.

306
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,740
You were genuinely happy,
smiling just like in that painting.

307
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,200
You also took me to the park.

308
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:30,339
We lay together on the boat,
watching the clouds drift across the sky.

309
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:35,760
It was the first time I felt happier
than the seagulls flying in the sky.

310
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,040
I remember. I remember all of it.

311
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:56,160
But later, I found a photo of you
and Jiang Meng Chu together.

312
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:06,839
The same park. The same boat. Even the same smile.

313
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:11,480
I truly wanted your joy to be because of me.

314
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,119
You've always tried to find
Jiang Meng Chu's shadow in my eyes.

315
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:24,200
What I've always wanted is a mother,
not mathematics.

316
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:32,899
You want me to admit
that I've failed you, don't you?

317
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,139
Don't you also want me to admit
I've wasted the talent you gave me?

318
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,519
Mom, you've been trapped
in the identity of being a genius's mother.

319
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,919
You wanted to use me to prove
Jiang Meng Chu's existence.

320
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:15,099
And I'm the same. I've been trapped
in the identity of being a genius teenager.

321
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:20,119
I want to use rebellion against you
to prove that I'm different from Jiang Meng Chu.

322
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:26,139
But Mom, our mutual resentment
is truly meaningless.

323
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,540
What exactly are you trying to say?

324
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:54,659
If we can't stop resenting each other,
then let's not stop.

325
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:01,519
Instead, let's first find ourselves.
Our complete selves.

326
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:09,519
Then maybe when we look at each other,
there'll be no more resentment.

327
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:13,500
Do you think you're so impressive?

328
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,280
You can cook for me,
lecturing me with these grand philosophies.

329
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:24,239
Let me tell you. Everything
I'm doing now is for your future.

330
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,460
You're about to face this cruel world.

331
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:32,859
Your ignorance about this world is laughable.

332
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:52,940
As for the future or the world,

333
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,104
I'm indeed clueless.

334
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,300
But the only thing I know is

335
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:02,859
that they're all in my hands,
and only in my hands.

336
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:36,960
I never expected things to go so smoothly.

337
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,780
Now my website has not only
more readers but also more authors.

338
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,880
Most importantly, you know what?

339
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,760
Someone offered 80,000 yuan recently.
Eighty thousand! To buy my website!

340
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,599
Wait. Hold on. Eighty thousand?

341
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:52,880
Cai Fang Yuan, you're
becoming an eighty-thousandaire!

342
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,420
Sell it quickly!

343
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,260
Sell? What nonsense!

344
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:00,199
I want to create a pure land
for Chinese literary creation.

345
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,720
No amount of money could buy this.
It's about passion.

346
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:06,519
A righteous businessman.

347
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:17,920
What are you eating?

348
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,780
Brain nutrition! It enhances
intelligence and memory. Here.

349
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,699
What's wrong with your brain?

350
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:27,619
Excellent memory. Quick mind.

351
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:30,599
These are basic requirements for becoming a pilot.

352
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,559
Next month, the air force recruitment will start.
My turn comes next year.

353
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:39,139
Judging by current conditions,
my physical hardware is definitely qualified.

354
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:42,200
But my software needs to catch up too,
to ensure perfection.

355
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:47,760
Qin Ye Yun, you should eat more too.
Don't you want to be in business?

356
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,460
Even an outstanding shady businessman
needs a smart mind.

357
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,159
Dr. Du, don't you agree?

358
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:57,380
You know, I've realized our little Qun Shan group

359
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,879
is versatile in both arts and sports,
covering all walks of life!

360
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,760
Lin Cherry.

361
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,639
Don't ask me. I'm still
contemplating major life decisions.

362
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:13,619
Who's asking you? I wanted to know
what Jiang Qiao Xi is thinking.

363
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:16,780
Yeah. We're not pressuring him.

364
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,280
We just want to understand his perspective.

365
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,320
Everyone's planning their futures.

366
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,960
He withdrew his guaranteed admission
and never shared his thoughts.

367
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,819
I don't know.

368
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:33,019
He didn't even tell you?
Jiang Qiao Xi is going too far.

369
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,840
I truly don't know.

370
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:42,880
Sometimes I feel like
he doesn't think about the future at all.

371
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,300
And other times,
it seems he's had it all figured out.

372
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:51,639
Cherry, why don't you ask him then?

373
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:56,559
How can I? Any question would pressure him!

374
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:02,800
Jiang Qiao Xi's always been decisive.
He must have considered it.

375
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,860
I agree. I bet he's already decided.

376
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:10,640
He's keeping it secret
to surprise you, or shock you.

377
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:18,459
That can't be. He'll tell us when he's ready.

378
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:31,260
Have you actually talked to that Lin girl yet?

379
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,679
What do you really want?

380
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,099
Not yet. How should I approach this, bro?

381
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:40,679
I've noticed that I'm quite timid around her.

382
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:41,900
What are you afraid of?

383
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,619
If I tell her,

384
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:47,960
and she asks me to stay, I'll be lost.

385
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,840
If she tells me to go, I'll be even more confused.

386
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,679
Then it's simple.

387
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:58,019
Just ask her to come with you!

388
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:02,179
No, she's very family-oriented. She won't leave.

389
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:07,199
Then you need to figure out
what you truly want, okay?

390
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:10,859
Even I can't advise you on this. Think it through.

391
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:30,940
You're back at school, genius.
You haven't quit math, right?

392
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,920
I don't like math.

393
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,280
How's that possible?

394
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,760
My dad says your math intuition
is one in a million.

395
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,000
You solve problems
like a skilled butcher dissecting an ox.

396
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,999
How can you abandon such talent
after all these years of effort?

397
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,660
I'll head back to class now.

398
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:53,059
Senior Jiang, is your dislike of math
because of Qi Le?

399
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:54,519
I heard people say

400
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:57,119
that you changed a lot
after she transferred to Experimental High.

401
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,320
- I mean...
- All my decisions are based on my considerations.

402
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,379
They have nothing to do with Lin Qi Le.

403
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,640
Hi. I'm leaving.

404
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,500
Why are you back at school?
You didn't say anything.

405
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,580
Felt like returning, so I did.

406
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:21,639
Let's grab supper after the evening study session.

407
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:24,099
You? What about us two?

408
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:26,460
Right.

409
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,820
You can go on your own.

410
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,620
You two are everywhere. Get lost!

411
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,960
Jiang Qiao Xi.

412
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,760
Qiao Xi is back.

413
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,800
Jiang Qiao Xi has returned.

414
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:41,900
You're finally back, Jiang Qiao Xi.

415
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,900
You're finally back, Jiang Qiao Xi.

416
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,539
Long time no see.

417
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:48,260
When you were away,
I copied all the math notes for you.

418
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,019
- You did? You can give it to me.
- Right, right.

419
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:51,139
We thought you weren't coming back to class.

420
00:40:51,139 --> 00:40:53,019
- Do you want it now? I'll get it for you.
- Okay, okay.

421
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:54,380
Get it for him. Didn't you say so?

422
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,280
I'll get it. Where are the problems?

423
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,780
Everyone, turn to page 58.

424
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,659
Is this appropriate?
Reading English during math class?

425
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:30,999
Is this appropriate, Jiang Qiao Xi,
the math prodigy?

426
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,960
It's outrageous, Principal.

427
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,179
Look at this troublemaker of yours.
He's been throwing tantrums for over two weeks.

428
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:45,039
Now he's having a teenage rebellion during class.

429
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:48,679
He reads English in math class,
and math in English class?

430
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:51,660
Are you sure about
his studying math during English class?

431
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:02,959
Lin Cherry, which country
is Jiang Qiao Xi going to study in?

432
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:06,239
What did you say?

433
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:08,039
You didn't know?

434
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:14,980
I... Who said he's going abroad?
Who told you that?

435
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,719
Earlier, when I went to the office
to collect homework,

436
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:22,840
Ms. Qu said Jiang Qiao Xi was reviewing
TOEFL materials during math class today.

437
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,640
He didn't tell you?

438
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:45,180
He doesn't need to tell anyone.
He's got his own plans for the future.

439
00:42:56,739 --> 00:42:58,539
Why did she leave?

440
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:13,579
 ♫ Once again in the night ♫ 

441

00:44:45,835 --> 00:44:48,779
 ♫ My dream ♫ 

471
00:44:48,779 --> 00:44:52,619
 ♫ I must set it free ♫ 

472
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:53,739
 ♫ I want ♫ 

473
00:44:53,739 --> 00:44:55,819
 ♫ I want you to see ♫ 

474
00:44:55,819 --> 00:44:58,987
 ♫ The shining light within me ♫ 

475

 ♫ I want to sing ♫ 

476
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:02,987
 ♫ I want to sing for you ♫ 

477
00:45:02,987 --> 00:45:06,155
 ♫ My loneliness and confusion ♫ 

478
00:45:06,155 --> 00:45:07,371
 ♫ I want to forget ♫ 

479
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,739
 ♫ I want to forget the past ♫ 

480
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:12,843
 ♫ Those ordinary years of growth ♫ 

481
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,243
 ♫ Brewing ♫ 

482
00:45:16,363 --> 00:45:18,987
 ♫ Gazing out ♫ 

483
00:45:20,075 --> 00:45:23,247
 ♫ Towards the horizon ♫
