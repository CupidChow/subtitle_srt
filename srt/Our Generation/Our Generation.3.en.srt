1
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,260
Just now at the park,

2
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,860
I didn't finish what I need to say.

3
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,140
I came here

4
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,820
because something

5
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,300
is between the two of us…

6
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,880
I want to speak to you alone.

7
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,560
Go ahead.

8
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,540
The journal I sent you

9
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,120
has never contained

10
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,780
the words of "I like you".

11
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,340
How could that be a love letter?

12
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,640
In fact, I only sent it to you

13
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,760
because Chunlu died.

14
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,960
Jiang Qiaoxi.

15
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,820
Would you like to take Chunlu
as your daughter?

16
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,660
It can be called Jiang Chunlu.

17
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,920
Even if you're in that
faraway provincial capital,

18
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,920
don't forget

19
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,820
you have a daughter here.

20
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,180
Jiang Chunlu.

21
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,920
You will be

22
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,300
Jiang Chunlu from now on.

23
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,700
Wait for Dad to come home.

24
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,940
<i>You are so childish, Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>

25
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,160
I was just pretending when I said

26
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,400
Chunlu could be your daughter.

27
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,440
Chunlu is my daughter.

28
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,960
She has nothing to do with you.

29
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,980
I only meant to write
an obituary at first.

30
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,820
But then I added parts about Qunshan,

31
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,080
<i>because I remembered</i>

32
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,060
<i>how you'd say, as a child,</i>

33
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,360
<i>that you liked Qunshan.</i>

34
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,660
<i>You couldn't bear to leave.</i>

35
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,160
<i>Truth is, I worry</i>

36
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,680
<i>the same way about every child</i>

37
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,900
<i>who stayed at Qunshan.</i>

38
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,500
<i>There was nothing special</i>

39
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,900
<i>about you.</i>

40
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,860
<i>Looking back now,</i>

41
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,700
we weren't even that close, really.

42
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,500
We just went to school together,

43
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,760
<i>ate at my place after class, did homework.</i>

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,780
<i>That's all.</i>

45
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,520
<i>Sure, maybe we did some special things.</i>

46
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,880
<i>Like watched a movie,</i>

47
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,280
<i>hiked a mountain.</i>

48
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,440
<i>But all my friends, Yu Qiao, Du Shang</i>
<i>and I had done</i>

49
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,100
all that stuff countless times before.

50
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,060
The only reason I remember is because…

51
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,440
childhood memories

52
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,560
stick and never leave.

53
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,540
But even if we meant nothing
to each other,

54
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,740
you had no right
to show that journal to anyone.

55
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,220
That wasn't just rude.

56
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,140
It was cruel.

57
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,399
Also,

58
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,140
I'm transferring to Jialin Experimental.

59
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,380
Not because of you.

60
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,780
I need my actual friends around me,

61
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,840
and you?

62
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,800
You don't even qualify.

63
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,840
So from now on,

64
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,580
if we meet again,

65
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,980
let's take us as strangers.

66
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,020
Pretend we never knew each other.

67
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,620
Understood.

68
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,020
Now leave.

69
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,860
<i>If we ever meet again</i>

70
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,520
<i>in summer,</i>

71
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,560
<i>I'll go meet you</i>

72
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,540
<i>with cherry sage</i>

73
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,240
Now leave.

74
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,360
I can't believe we're still

75
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,620
seeing mistakes on such

76
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,620
fundamental matters.

77
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,000
This is unacceptable.

78
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,980
You learned this

79
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,240
in middle school.

80
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,460
Open your textbooks

81
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,340
to page 52.

82
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,240
"I had better walk slowly
while chanting at ease.

83
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,340
Better than a saddle
I like sandals and cane.

84
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,240
I'd fain."

85
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,340
CLASS FIVE TEST RANKING

86
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,380
<i>Everyone,</i>

87
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,460
<i>this semester</i>

88
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,120
<i>we've witnessed Lin Qile's</i>

89
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,300
<i>remarkable growth,</i>

90
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,800
<i>under her tireless effort.</i>

91
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,380
<i>Let's all wish her continued success</i>

92
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,300
<i>as she shines even brighter</i>

93
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,100
<i>at Jialin Experimental.</i>

94
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,160
LIN QILE IS TRANSFERRING
TO JIALIN EXPERIMENTAL

95
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,420
- Thank you.
- Keep it up!

96
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,020
There are a lot more.

97
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,080
It never looks a lot,

98
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,440
but why it feels endless

99
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,620
when you actually start packing?

100
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,920
Here.

101
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,640
Yingtao, pack up everything.

102
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,180
More of your stuff down here.

103
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,420
Throw it away?

104
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,520
Yes!

105
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,660
This is my lucky sandbag.

106
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,360
So many glass bottles.

107
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,360
What are they for?

108
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,420
And this stays.

109
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,840
It's my secret musical weapon.

110
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,820
Remember?

111
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,640
You little hoarder!

112
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,840
This one's precious, that one's special.

113
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,900
Such a sentimental packrat.

114
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,980
Whose clothes is this?

115
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,000
Is this yours,

116
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,440
Yingtao?

117
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,500
Didn't I tell you?

118
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,460
I'm just going back to the

119
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,460
provincial capital for

120
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Olympiad math classes.

121
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,920
Brother Chen Minghao

122
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,180
and Sister Zhang Xiaochen,

123
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,280
they said the exact same thing
when they left.

124
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,820
I'm different from them.

125
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,940
Nothing is different.

126
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,540
The provincial capital is
like a child-eating monster.

127
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,440
Every kid who goes there

128
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,220
never returns to Qunshan.

129
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,120
What's this?

130
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,820
As collateral, to you.

131
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,660
but you have to give it back

132
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,640
when I return.

133
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,220
Isn't this the jacket

134
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,560
your cousin gave you?

135
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,420
You treasure it so much.

136
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,600
You even wear it in winter.

137
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,720
So I left it with you.

138
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,040
Jiang Qiaoxi,

139
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,460
will you really come back?

140
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,440
Yes.

141
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,220
Really really?

142
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,300
Yes, yes!

143
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,380
Throw it away.

144
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,900
It's taking up space anyway. Just toss it.

145
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,840
Toss it?

146
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,480
If you toss it

147
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,060
in the plastic bag,

148
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,160
it's gone for good.

149
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:56,580
- See you!
- See you!

150
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,960
- See you!
- See you!

151
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,100
Du Shang's place is closest,

152
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,920
- that building right there.
- There.

153
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,380
Our house and Yu's house

154
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,580
are up ahead, at the west.

155
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,180
But it's all nearby,

156
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,160
- just across the road.
- Right.

157
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,260
See that convenience store?

158
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,560
First floor, that's Yun's place.

159
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,540
- Over there.
- Now you mention it?

160
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,080
You're the one who swapped with him.

161
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,160
This ground-floor unit's

162
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,220
the closest to Central Square.

163
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,280
Only someone

164
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,500
- as kind-hearted as you…
- That's all right.

165
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,800
We're all genuinely happy
to see his business thriving.

166
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,120
Do you see this?

167
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,980
Fourth floor. We saved this unit for you.

168
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,720
It's got an extra row of

169
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,380
east-facing windows no one else has,

170
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,580
with amazing natural lighting.

171
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,540
Plus, the entryway's

172
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,120
six square meters larger.

173
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,340
Perfect.

174
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,040
Yingtao's precious books and

175
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,260
all those sentimental treasures

176
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,600
finally find a proper space.

177
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,920
The best is we get to live
with everyone again.

178
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,560
Grab available machines!

179
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,480
ARCADE

180
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,580
This one.

181
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,160
Dance machine.

182
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,040
Dance machine.
We don't have that in Qunshan Arcade.

183
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,720
It's fun. You'll definitely like it.

184
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,920
- Have a try.
- I don't know how.

185
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,520
- Try it.
- It's easy.

186
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,000
- Right.
- Yingtao.

187
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,220
Put your hand here.

188
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,460
- Put your hand here.
- Wait.

189
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,680
- Move it!
- What is this?

190
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,120
- Step on the red one.
- Left foot.

191
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,520
Upper right, upper left.

192
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,680
- Upper left.
- Upper right.

193
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,680
- Bottom right.
- Bottom right.

194
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,380
- Slow down.
- Careful.

195
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,580
Slow down.

196
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,680
Bad game. It's not fun at all.

197
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,560
Lin Yingtao, you're really bad
at this game.

198
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,760
I'm bad?

199
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,760
When have you ever

200
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,860
beaten me?

201
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,740
Sandbag toss? Hide-and-seek?

202
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,040
And now you're saying I'm bad?

203
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,520
Yingtao.

204
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,880
Let's go play sandbag toss, then?

205
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,480
We haven't played it after we came here.

206
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,400
I'll call my mom now.

207
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,880
She can make us one sandbag on the spot.

208
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,220
I'm bad at it but no way

209
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,140
I'm embarrassing myself alone.
Go, you two.

210
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,220
Here we go!

211
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,840
Slow down, Yingtao!

212
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,680
Jialin is so lively.

213
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,620
You guys have clearly been living

214
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,100
your best lives behind my back.

215
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,800
Yingtao.

216
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,900
You have no idea.

217
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,140
The first time I came here,

218
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,600
I knew you'd love this place.

219
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,480
Back then,

220
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,840
I kept thinking how much fun
we'd have if you were here.

221
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,720
Could you be any cheesier?

222
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,020
Look how hyped she is.

223
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,320
Anything could stop her?

224
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,520
Setting up a stall here is a goldmine.

225
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,760
One-yuan items are sold at ten,
still bestsellers.

226
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,760
Try quick turnover with small profits.

227
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,780
We'll be rolling in cash.

228
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,700
Thank you.

229
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,760
Can you be any louder
for they all to hear you?

230
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,260
TAKOYAKI

231
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,660
It smells great.

232
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,060
Quit sniffing around.

233
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,480
Just buy what you want to eat.

234
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,800
I'm not hungry.

235
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,380
Just breathing this in

236
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,680
is already a feast.

237
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,300
So many stars.

238
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,860
The beach at night

239
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,080
is kind of peaceful,

240
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,880
isn't it?

241
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,140
Ling Yingtao.

242
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,700
- What happened?
- Where have you been?

243
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,420
Where?

244
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,400
I…

245
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,660
We bought you some food.

246
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,440
Why didn't you tell me?

247
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,340
You scared?

248
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,360
- No.
- Yingtao.

249
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,700
- Ling Yingtao!
- Yingtao!

250
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,460
What are you doing?

251
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,040
Stand up.

252
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,980
Stand up.

253
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,080
They'll see that.

254
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,420
Ling Yingtao.

255
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,700
how the tables have turned!

256
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:24,380
Back then, you were always
the first ahead,

257
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,000
always the one to find us.

258
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,840
The time has changed.

259
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,720
Jialin's your turf now.

260
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
I might

261
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,020
need you guys to show me the way.

262
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,100
Show you the way?

263
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,480
Whenever you wanna hang out,

264
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,700
just come to me…

265
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,680
to us.

266
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,940
We will have your back.

267
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,920
Exactly.

268
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,680
You are here now. We won't be separated.

269
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,400
Like the old days.
Everywhere, all together.

270
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,260
So cheesy. You're gonna make it rain
with all this sappiness.

271
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,720
Me? Cheesy?

272
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,160
Funny thing is
when I was alone in Qunshan,

273
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,180
I never once got lost.

274
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,620
So you only get lost

275
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,780
when you've got company?

276
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,480
When I'm alone,

277
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,560
I've got street signs,

278
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,360
or I'll just ask for directions.

279
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,420
True.

280
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,340
Nothing is hard for you,

281
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,320
heroine Yingtao.

282
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,300
Actually, being alone

283
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,920
is kind of hard for me.

284
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,160
But not anymore,

285
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,160
right?

286
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,280
I just said that.

287
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,120
- Now it rains?
- It's raining.

288
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,200
I just said that.

289
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,680
Ling Yingtao!

290
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,840
Wait for us!

291
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,200
Lin Yingtao, why don't you run?

292
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,440
Yu Qiao.

293
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,620
What?

294
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,180
Ling Yingtao.

295
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,560
- Cai Fangyuan.
<i>- What?</i>

296
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,340
<i>- Let's go.</i>
- Du Shang.

297
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,780
<i>Yingtao, run!</i>

298
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,200
<i>Wait for me.</i>

299
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
Qin Yeyun!

300
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,460
<i>Yingtao, run!</i>

301
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,340
Qin Yeyun!

302
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,300
Pipe down,

303
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,540
you chaotic gremlins.

304
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,500
Jiang…

305
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,140
Yingtao.

306
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,300
<i>Ling Yingtao!</i>

307
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,140
Here I come!

308
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,480
You're literally ranked 47th

309
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,340
at Jialin Experimental.

310
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,580
What are you worried about?

311
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,820
It's not like I knew

312
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,000
which class I'll be in.

313
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,500
Take it.

314
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,840
No suspense.

315
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,460
Class 18. Science Class 18.

316
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,600
Me?

317
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,100
- Who else?
- Me.

318
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,360
- And?
- I'm in Science Class 17.

319
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,540
Qin Yeyun's in Art Class Four.

320
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,800
Yingtao, we can fetch water together
between classes.

321
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,660
- Cai…
<i>- Cai Fangyuan!</i>

322
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,760
I'm in Class 18 too.

323
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,220
- Nice!
- Wait.

324
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,580
You're this excited about that?

325
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,800
I so deserve a new computer
with a better monitor.

326
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,240
I am exceptional in my exams.

327
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,220
You spoiled kid!

328
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,820
If you were my son,
I'd trade you for that computer.

329
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,960
Time to cash in with Dad!

330
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,840
This piece of junk can barely run CS.

331
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,380
- Who else?
- What?

332
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,240
Who else is in Class 18?

333
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,900
You can see for yourself.

334
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,840
LING QILE

335
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,500
Sorry, classmate.

336
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,420
Sorry.

337
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,420
Excuse me.

338
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,960
JIANG QIAOXI

339
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,320
<i>First prize?</i>

340
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,580
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi took first prize.</i>

341
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,660
Jiang Qiaoxi made the provincial team!

342
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,800
Impressive.

343
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,680
Excuse me. Thank you.

344
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,560
It is her.

345
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,060
<i>She is Lin Qile?</i>

346
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,200
<i>Do you remember?</i>

347
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,480
I thought she was the lovesick girl

348
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,040
who wrote to Jiang Qiaoxi.

349
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Turns out she's ranked 47th.

350
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,300
To be in our class. Pretty impressive.

351
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,200
Wanna go say hi?

352
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,420
She's with that Qunshan crew.

353
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,800
They are cut from the same cloth.

354
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,760
Lin Qile!

355
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,280
It's really you.

356
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,460
Monitor Feng.

357
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,580
I just saw your name

358
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,620
on the list.

359
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,020
I thought it was someone else.

360
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,580
It is me.

361
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,020
I'm Lin Qile's class monitor
at Qunshan Middle School.

362
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,520
Now that we're all

363
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,760
Class 18 mates.

364
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,500
She's new here.

365
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,320
A bit shy,

366
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,040
so go easy on her, yeah?

367
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,740
Shy?

368
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,480
Uh, did you mix her up with anyone else?

369
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,120
Who needs looking after?

370
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,800
I don't know them.

371
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,060
We don't know her as the shy girl.

372
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,460
I almost forgot

373
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,860
you are from Qunshan too.

374
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,760
You know each other?

375
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,720
Yes.

376
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
That's great.

377
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,260
Then you can quickly

378
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,880
adapt to the new environment.

379
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,180
You are still so enthusiastic.

380
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,160
This counts as
meeting an old friend in a distant land.

381
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,280
I'm so thrilled.

382
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,040
Wait for me real quick?

383
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,040
Let's grab food then.

384
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,360
No, no need indeed.

385
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,560
You do your thing.

386
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,140
We've gotta get home anyway.

387
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,180
See you at school.

388
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,600
Don't mind her. She's a bit shy.

389
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,880
- Goodbye, Monitor.
- See you.

390
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,360
Monitor.

391
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,340
- Monitor!
- Oh.

392
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,260
Let's go.

393
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,960
WELCOME NEW STUDENTS

394
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,120
SCIENCE CLASS 18

395
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,180
LING QILE

396
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,700
LING QILE

397
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,560
GREAT NEWS: JIANG QIAOXI WON
THE PROVINCIAL FIRST PRIZE

398
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,640
You don't even need to look at it.

399
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,260
You must be the first one.

400
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,200
The post to congrats you for
making the Olympiad team.

401
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,180
Did you see it?

402
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,700
I didn't notice that.

403
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,820
Principal Sun

404
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,360
thinks highly of you.

405
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,020
They posted the announcement

406
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,060
before term even started.

407
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,120
Your homeroom teacher told me

408
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,200
she now

409
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,620
has two treasures.

410
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,500
First, that Confucius statue

411
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,460
passed down through school history,

412
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,260
and second, you.

413
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,500
Son.

414
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,720
Remember the

415
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,120
Lin family's girl,

416
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,980
Yingtao?

417
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,160
You dined at their place
when you were a kid.

418
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,820
She got into your school too.

419
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,000
She's making an effort.

420
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,320
I heard her grades are good,

421
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,340
and she chose science.

422
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,300
She'll probably be in your class.

423
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,380
We're in the same class.

424
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,000
I saw her name on that list.

425
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,460
Your mother went to Laishui.

426
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,560
I booked a private room at the restaurant.

427
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,160
I was thinking

428
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,500
let's host a dine together.

429
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,600
Celebrate your making into
the provincial team,

430
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,660
and her enrollment

431
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,900
into Jialin Experimental.

432
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,060
We could have

433
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,040
both families and

434
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,380
make it a cozy get-together.

435
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,300
Back in Qunshan,

436
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,360
they helped us a lot.

437
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,800
They've been very kind to you.

438
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,240
I think…

439
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,300
I will go.

440
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,240
Good.

441
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,380
Yingtao.

442
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,220
I was thinking, tonight's dinner.

443
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,700
Per Manager Jiang's invite.

444
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,500
If you don't want to go,

445
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,960
you don't have to. It's okay.

446
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,780
Will that make things difficult

447
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,400
for you and Dad?

448
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,280
It's okay, don't worry about it.

449
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,200
This is just

450
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,540
a favor between adults.

451
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,600
After you finish cleaning up,
just rest at home.

452
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,460
Mom!

453
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,460
I'll go.

454
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,120
I have no reason to reject.

455
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,240
- Tonight, let's have some <i>baijiu.</i>
- We…

456
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,300
Here they come.

457
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,240
Sorry, we're late.

458
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,540
- We're late.
- Sorry.

459
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,000
We got held up tidying things

460
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,920
at home.

461
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,980
Sorry to keep you waiting.

462
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,580
You're not late.

463
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,140
The dishes haven't been served yet.

464
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,180
Yingtao.

465
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,880
- Hello, Uncle Jiang.
- You are excellent.

466
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,240
Getting into Jialin Experimental

467
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,500
with such outstanding grades.

468
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,700
Keep it up and aim
for universities in Beijing or Shanghai.

469
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,500
Alright, everyone's here now.

470
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,660
Let's all take our seats.

471
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,700
- Alright.
- Come inside.

472
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,900
- Come here.
- This way.

473
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,700
Ladies sit on this side,
gentlemen over here.

474
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,240
- We sit on this side.
- Qiaoxi, come here.

475
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,240
Sit there.

476
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,640
Yingtao.

477
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,600
You sit here.

478
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,960
Yongtao, you sit here.

479
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,860
Next to Qiaoxi.

480
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,220
Today, you two are the guests of honor.

481
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,140
It's been so many years

482
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,040
since you last met.

483
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,780
Consider this a fresh start.

484
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,840
Qiaoxi, take care of Yingtao.

485
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,820
- Okay.
- Sit.

486
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,040
Have a seat.

487
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,020
Sit down.

488
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,480
Today, we're here to celebrate
for the two kids.

489
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,140
One got into Jialin Experimental,

490
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,360
and the other won first prize
in the Olympiad.

491
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,340
Thank you all for coming. Let's toast to

492
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,900
a future for all our kids to be successful

493
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,920
healthy and happy.

494
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,120
- Let's raise our glasses.
- Sure.

495
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

496
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,980
Thank you.

497
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,480
CONGRATULATE LIN YINGTAO FOR HER
OUTSTANDING GRADES AND ENROLLMENT

498
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,960
- Alright everyone, dig in.
- Sure.

499
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,260
Make yourselves at home.

500
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,160
- Dig in.
- Okay.

501
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,920
Lin, I still remember

502
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,220
back in the day,

503
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,120
our little Yingtao never liked studying.

504
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,780
She'd rather lead the kids

505
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,000
on wild adventures.

506
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,740
Every time report cards came out,

507
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,100
she'd hid up with Fangyuan

508
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,980
and other kids, avoiding
questions from the parents.

509
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,460
But look at her now.

510
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,580
It shows how clever our Yingtao really is.

511
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,700
With just a bit of effort,

512
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,600
she aced it.

513
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,860
Let's not forget Qiaoxi.

514
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,380
his Olympiad gold medal

515
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,860
isn't just about

516
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,000
hard work.

517
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,200
I remember back then

518
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,200
Yingtao and Qiaoxi

519
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,900
were like peas and carrots.

520
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,620
Either she was trailing after him,

521
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,340
or he was following her around.

522
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,160
Once,

523
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,100
Yingtao came to my house
to grab shrimp chips,

524
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,040
but she just lingered,

525
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,200
not leaving at all.

526
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,220
Finally, she said,

527
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,080
"Auntie Kang,

528
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,060
could you fry an extra portion
for Qiaoxi too?"

529
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,180
<i>- Really?</i>
<i>- Our Qiaoxi's</i>

530
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,080
<i>loved those since he was little.</i>

531
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,980
<i>- Lin, you make a toast.</i>
<i>- Come on.</i>

532
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,580
<i>- Right.</i>
<i>- We both…</i>

533
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,280
<i>Let's all have a drink together.</i>

534
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,300
<i>- Cheers!</i>
<i>- Cheers!</i>

535
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,760
<i>- Thanks.</i>
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

536
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,700
<i>- Congrats!</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

537
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,700
<i>- Great!</i>
<i>- Congrats.</i>

538
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,320
Here.

539
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,840
Yingtao, eat a crab.

540
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,860
Let me help you.

541
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,800
I can do it myself.

542
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,860
Du Shang.

543
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,380
You'll need to adjust.

544
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,780
At school,

545
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,860
we can't keep calling her Yingtao,

546
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,100
- it's Lin Qile.
- Lin Qile?

547
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,300
What are you doing?

548
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,500
It's strange.

549
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,700
I've never called you that.

550
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,260
Just call me Lin Yingtao.

551
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,460
Lin Yingtao.

552
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,500
I am Lin Yingtao.

553
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,300
Eat this one.

554
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,420
With this crab leg.

555
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,100
Well…

556
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,940
Sorry.

557
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,140
WOMEN'S ROOM, MEN'S ROOM

558
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,900
Well,

559
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,200
from now on in school,

560
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,960
you should be called Lin Qile,

561
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,880
instead of Lin Yingtao.

562
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,960
Classmate.

563
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,160
Is my name

564
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,500
has anything to do with you?

565
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,700
That's not good for you.

566
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,700
I don't care.

567
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,700
I care.

568
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,020
What did you say?

569
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,040
You said we should pretend

570
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,660
that we didn't know each other.

571
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,220
And

572
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,060
I even said it in front of everyone

573
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,260
that I don't know you.

574
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,540
Please…

575
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,820
Think about it.

576
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,260
If you say you're Lin Yingtao,

577
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,720
it'll create complications for me.

578
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,960
Right.

579
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,840
Knowing you

580
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,760
is not good

581
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,640
for me either.

582
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,020
I…

583
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,160
The restaurant we went

584
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,120
has amazing fish dishes.

585
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,980
My mom was sure you'd love it,

586
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,360
so she had me place a separate order

587
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,260
to takeaway some

588
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,820
for you and Qin Yeyun.

589
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,560
Thanks. Thank you, Yingtao.

590
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,260
I'm really sorry.

591
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,660
My legs hurt so much today

592
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,740
that I couldn't walk.

593
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,580
I couldn't attend

594
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,040
your and Qiaoxi's celebration.

595
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,180
Don't blame me.

596
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,700
What are you talking about?

597
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,300
You gave us rice, flour, grain

598
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,500
and oil for our new home.

599
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,400
My parents asked me
to thank you very much.

600
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,360
Is Qin Yeyun at home?

601
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,380
Yes.

602
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,280
We just checked the inventory.

603
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,820
Yun!

604
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,160
DAILY GOODS

605
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,120
QIN'S CONVENIENCE STORE

606
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,100
Qin Yeyun!

607
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,060
Qin Ye…

608
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,280
What is it, Lin Yingtao?

609
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,460
So beautiful,

610
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,360
Qin Yeyun.

611
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,820
Like some…

612
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,920
enchanting spirit.

613
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,960
Lin Yingtao, you used to care so much

614
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,220
about your appearance.

615
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,460
Why are you dressing like a mess?

616
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,740
That question

617
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,020
is a bit too pointed. Try a different one.

618
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,320
Then, as such a great writer,

619
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,520
what made you choose Science over Art?

620
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,620
I just prefer science subjects, okay?

621
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:20,780
- Oh please?
- Really.

622
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,159
- You like science?
- Hm.

623
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,460
But does science like you back?

624
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,120
Why does Jiang Qiaoxi get to do it,

625
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,020
but I don't?

626
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,760
Does anyone mention him here?

627
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,980
Right.

628
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,420
Please don't mention him.

629
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,679
You said it first.

630
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,699
You should've told me

631
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,719
he was like this earlier.

632
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,920
Now look what happened.

633
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,900
I was like an idiot,

634
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,780
writing such a long letter to him.

635
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,760
It's all blown up in my face.

636
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,680
I feel so stupid.

637
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,540
If you're angry,
take it out on Jiang Qiaoxi.

638
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,220
Why torment yourself?

639
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,220
I'm doing this to remind myself

640
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,660
he's not the Jiang Qiaoxi I used to know.

641
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,360
I won't treat him like I did before.

642
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
I'll never, ever forgive him.

643
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,940
You messed them up.

644
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,080
Fun, like a spring.

645
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,060
Let me curl yours.

646
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,860
Keep still. Let me play yours.

647
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,700
NEW SEMESTER

648
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,840
NEW SEMESTER, NEW GOALS

649
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,620
Most of us here

650
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,320
are from Class 21

651
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,600
and already know each other.

652
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,960
But let's welcome

653
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,200
our new classmate

654
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,540
who just transferred to

655
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,520
Jialin Experimental.

656
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,860
Hello everyone, my name is Lin Qile.

657
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,920
I come from Qunshan No. 11 Middle School.

658
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,680
It's an honor to become your classmate.

659
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,820
I look forward to getting to know you all.

660
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,860
AIM HIGH, STUDY HARD, AND THINK DEEPLY

661
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,360
Great, Lin Qile,

662
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,540
we are now deskmates.

663
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,480
If you have any questions,

664
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,780
come to me.

665
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,760
Thank you, Monitor.

666
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,200
I am still the monitor.

667
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,180
Happy to serve you.

668
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,660
Who else…

669
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,200
wants to try this dialogue practice?

670
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,980
Come on.

671
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,000
Be brave!

672
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,600
Lin Qile.

673
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,600
Is anyone willing to pair up with her

674
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,540
for the exercise?

675
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,420
Jiang Qiaoxi.

676
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,160
It's alright, Ling Qile.

677
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,140
Jiang Qiaoxi's English is indeed advanced.

678
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,360
He used many usual words that are

679
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,300
actually beyond the scope

680
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,600
of our curriculum.

681
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
You may sit down.

682
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,320
Jiang Qiaoxi.

683
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,540
In a chapter of

684
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,440
my life narrative,

685
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,200
a friend…

686
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,500
once led me to the mountain crest

687
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,000
to behold the splendor

688
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,640
of the evening's respondent hues.

689
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,240
<i>Qiáo,</i>

690
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,480
<i>in Grand Chinese Dictionary,</i>

691
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,980
<i>page 795, the 20th character in list.</i>

692
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,800
<i>It means "a peak, high and sharp".</i>

693
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,960
<i>Here, west of the highest,</i>
<i>sharpest summit in the Qunshan range.</i>

694
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,720
<i>I once saw the most</i>
<i>breathtaking sunset clouds here.</i>

695
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,380
<i>Crimson, blazing, glorious.</i>

696
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,720
<i>I think that's you.</i>

697
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,740
<i>That's what your name was meant.</i>

698
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,440
"Jiang Qiaoxi" is perfect,

699
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,100
meaningful and lovely to say.

700
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,380
Jiang Qiaoxi!

701
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:31,860
You see,

702
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,200
every time I call out Jiang Qiaoxi,

703
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,180
I will laugh.

704
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,840
Jiang Qiaoxi!

705
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,780
Jiang Qiaoxi!

706
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,920
And it was there,

707
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,560
my name

708
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,180
was poetically infused by a
insightful companion

709
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,380
with a meaning of the vibrant sunset.

710
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,060
- Ms. He
- Please.

711
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,160
Sorry.

712
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,500
I just realized that

713
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,000
I misspoke.

714
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,460
When greeting Lin Qile,

715
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,780
I should use "Nice to meet you".

716
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,500
That is for

717
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,780
first acquaintances.

718
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,600
But I said "Nice to see you" just now,

719
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,080
which normally

720
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,000
applies to reunions,

721
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,460
meaning that I'm happy

722
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,720
to see you again.

723
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,300
Good. Sit down, please.

724
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,740
What he just said was correct.

725
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,620
Superficially,

726
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,740
both phrases express

727
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,920
pleasure in meeting you,

728
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,920
but the first

729
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,620
is for formal contexts

730
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,420
while the second is informal.

731
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,660
- Now, let's open the textbook.
- It's okay, Lin Qile.

732
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,680
- To page six.
- Jiang Qiaoxi is a genius.

733
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,400
Nobody expects you to keep up with him.

734
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,060
<i>What's his deal? Why did he act like that?</i>

735
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,240
He can't forget you.

736
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,680
Or he doesn't want you to forget him.

737
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,380
Or both.

738
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,100
That's how all romance novels go.

739
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,480
I'll never talk to you again!

740
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,920
Jiang Qiaoxi.

741
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,520
The one you said the English class.
Who is it?

742
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,160
Someone very important.

743
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:42,200
Don't they make such a perfect couple?

744
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,420
Bet it burns you up.

745
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,660
That's some jealousy.

746
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,000
You are the one who burns me up.

747
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,660
That's some anger.

748
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,960
What does it have to do with me?

749
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,740
But doesn't your name

750
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,120
come from a poem?

751
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,080
"Gates and homes glow
at the west of Jiangqiao's crest."

752
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,560
Such rhythm and grandeur.

753
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,180
I don't like it.

754
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,280
Actually, I love sunsets too.

755
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,460
If you got time,

756
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,060
let's see some sunsets at the beach.

757
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,680
I may not have time.

758
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,980
Hey classmate,

759
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,540
I forgot to top up my water card.

760
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,720
Could I borrow yours?

761
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,560
Do we know each other?

762
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,780
I forgot to introduce myself

763
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,420
during our English practice.

764
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,880
I'm Jiang Qiaoxi.

765
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,260
Pleasure to meet you.

766
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,920
Not a pleasure for me.

767
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,260
Also, I don't lend my water card
to just anyone.

768
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,640
