1
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,260
Hey classmate,

2
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,880
I forgot to top up my water card.

3
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,380
Could I borrow yours?

4
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,240
Do we know each other?

5
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,120
I forgot to introduce myself

6
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,300
during our English practice.

7
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,220
I'm Jiang Qiaoxi.

8
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,800
Pleasure to meet you.

9
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,520
Not a pleasure for me.

10
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,740
Also, I don't lend my water card
to just anyone.

11
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,440
<i>What's her deal with Jiang Qiaoxi?</i>

12
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,580
She seems kind of touchy.

13
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,760
Jiang Qiaoxi, here. Use mine.

14
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,160
<i>Mine too if you want.</i>

15
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,640
It's alright. Thanks anyway.

16
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,620
<i>Our new classmate</i>
<i>is a bit slow to warm up.</i>

17
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,620
<i>Let's all try to</i>

18
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,000
<i>make her feel welcomed.</i>

19
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,460
That's the first time

20
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,000
I've seen someone brush off
Jiang Qiaoxi like that.

21
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,540
It was kind of crazy.

22
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,380
Still, he handled it really politely.

23
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,020
Didn't seem offended at all.

24
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,140
That's just how he is. Always respectful.

25
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,460
Yeah, true.

26
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,920
But

27
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,920
why'd she act like that with him?

28
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,500
It's just a water card.

29
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,320
She acted like Jiang Qiaoxi
had done something terrible to her.

30
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,640
Do you think

31
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,620
it had to do with English class earlier?

32
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,520
She didn't get what he said

33
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,460
and felt embarrassed?

34
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,500
She just transferred into our class

35
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,660
and already lost face?

36
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,080
Makes sense.

37
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,960
Think about it.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,500
If she got into Jialin Experimental
from Qunshan,

39
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,640
she had to be top

40
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,120
of her old class.

41
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,120
Then she just got here
and run into Jiang Qiaoxi.

42
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,740
She must be having
a sense of injury in pride.

43
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,960
Even Ms. He said

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,860
the sentence he said
was way beyond the curriculum.

45
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,200
Most of us didn't know what it meant.

46
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,280
I don't think she would
get that upset over it.

47
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,700
Honestly,

48
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,220
I think it's your fault.

49
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,940
Mine?

50
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,300
Yeah. Think about it.

51
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,820
You didn't know anything about her,

52
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,920
and you said to her face

53
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,060
right in front of everyone.

54
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,500
You're friends with Jiang Qiaoxi.

55
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,240
So she took it out on him.

56
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,320
What should I do then?

57
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,140
Go apologize to Lin Qile. Seriously.

58
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,860
But let's be real,

59
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,740
it's not your fault.

60
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,720
The real problem was
whoever wrote that letter to Jiang Qiaoxi.

61
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,100
Heard someone tried borrowing your card

62
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,440
and got totally shut down.

63
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,960
If I am allowed,

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
I would splash water on him.

65
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,840
I'll ask him what his problem is.

66
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,660
Whatever his problem is,

67
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,740
it certainly

68
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,800
doesn't concern us.

69
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,840
Lin Qile, someone's looking for you.

70
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,360
By the stairs. Fourth floor.

71
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,960
Who is it?

72
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,040
You'll know.

73
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,860
What is it about?

74
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,480
Said it needs to be in person.

75
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,120
Come on. I'll go with you.

76
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,500
Only Lin Qile, not you.

77
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,880
I'll go alone.

78
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,420
Lin Qile,

79
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,580
we've actually met before.

80
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,880
Before you transferred
to Jialin Experimental.

81
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,120
Do you remember?

82
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,040
Yeah. I remember.

83
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,180
To get into Jialin Experimental
from Qunshan

84
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,680
with grades like yours,

85
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,180
we all thought you were amazing.

86
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,400
Hope we can

87
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,900
help each other out with school.
Grow together, maybe.

88
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,420
So

89
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,440
what is it you really want to say?

90
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,460
I, um.

91
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,460
I came to apologize.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,300
Back then… yeah, it is my fault.

93
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,280
I mistaken you for others

94
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,120
and said something way out of line.

95
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,720
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,900
Even if you hadn't mistaken me,

97
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,580
you didn't need to speak like that.

98
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,800
Do you just hate us?

99
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,880
Or do you hate Jiang Qiaoxi?

100
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,800
The truth isn't always pleasant.

101
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,720
So I will not say it.

102
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,660
Lin Qile,

103
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,860
this whole thing really
was some misunderstanding.

104
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,980
Honestly, you and Jiang Qiaoxi
did nothing wrong.

105
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,100
You both got dragged into it.

106
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,760
- Please stop.
- Don't put this on Jiang Qiaoxi.

107
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,060
- He's a good person.
- Can you…

108
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,800
He's the top student for us to look up to.

109
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,140
If anyone's to blame,

110
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,120
it's that Yingtao.

111
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,040
She overstepped.
Writing a letter to him like that?

112
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,820
Stop talking.

113
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,480
You have no idea what was in that letter.

114
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,040
It was disgusting.

115
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,900
Disgusting?

116
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,180
Say that again.

117
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,360
Yu Qiao!

118
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,760
Last time? I let it slide

119
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,120
when you took a swing at me.

120
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,560
Now you're just asking for it.

121
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,680
What's going on?

122
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,660
You guys seriously think

123
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,040
you can throw punches now?

124
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,380
Fine.

125
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,720
We'll see each other in the office.

126
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,580
Fei Linge, why can't you just
talk like a normal person?

127
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,820
Absolutely nothing to talk about.

128
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,460
Oh man, this is bad!

129
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,080
Something serious happened in our class.

130
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,600
It's the new girl, Lin Qile.

131
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,540
She hit someone!

132
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,000
No joke. There was a fight.
She actually hit him!

133
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,000
Come on, let's go check it out.

134
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,340
Fei Linge's tight with the teachers.

135
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,260
They're not gonna

136
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,820
let this slide.

137
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,060
What exactly happened?

138
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,960
Don't worry. I know you.

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,100
I'll speak up for you.

140
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,180
I didn't hit him.

141
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,420
No, but you did kick him.

142
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,900
That was self-defense.

143
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,220
But I threw the first punch.

144
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
He talked first.

145
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,940
Then it's on him.

146
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,080
Exactly. He's the one who started it.

147
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,300
The teachers at Jialin Experimental

148
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,400
will tell right from wrong.

149
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,300
So we're not worried.

150
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,780
You two really aren't in trouble?

151
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,660
Not with her around.

152
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,980
She can make a rock look innocent.

153
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,060
We'll be fine.

154
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,620
Alright.

155
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,440
Fei Linge and his gang are all bark.

156
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,240
We're better off not giving them

157
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,320
the time of day.

158
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,460
Got it, monitor.

159
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,240
I'll take it from here.

160
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,060
What are you staring at?
Get back to class.

161
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,300
What should I do?

162
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,260
Off to a great start.

163
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,220
It's fine. You've got me.

164
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,020
And you.

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,300
I didn't just get myself in trouble.
I dragged you into it too.

166
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,680
Makes sense.

167
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,340
We were like that as kids.

168
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,740
Jiang Qiaoxi?

169
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,919
Come with me.

170
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,679
- Why… Where are we going?
- Sit down.

171
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,700
Why'd they come at you like that?

172
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,460
From what I saw,

173
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,720
Lin Qile barely even looks at you.

174
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,740
You didn't do anything to her.

175
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,180
I think it's because I mistook her

176
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,560
for Yingtao earlier.

177
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,940
She's probably still mad about that,

178
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,380
and now she's taking it out on you.

179
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,400
I figured I'd go apologize.

180
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,980
But those guys are savages.

181
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
I barely said a word
and they started pushing me.

182
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,580
And Lin Qile kicked me too.

183
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,660
Let me guess. When you apologized,

184
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,100
you insulted Yingtao?

185
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,240
Well, it's her fault, isn't it?

186
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,540
She wrote that disgusting letter.

187
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,000
Messed things up for you.

188
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,920
If it wasn't for her,

189
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
nothing would've happened.

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,180
Disgusting?

191
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,940
How was it disgusting?

192
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,040
Wasn't it?

193
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,300
Man, this is…

194
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,000
They are friends.

195
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,540
You said that to her face.

196
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,000
Of course you got kicked.

197
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,780
Jiang Qiaoxi, why are you defending them?

198
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,680
Alright.

199
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,340
From now on,

200
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,420
stay out of my business.

201
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,700
Especially if Lin Qile's involved.

202
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,580
Lin Qile?

203
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,900
You and her…

204
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,780
<i>Yeah, totally.</i>

205
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,120
‪-Is that Jiang Qiaoxi?
‪-He is so cool.

206
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,560
She and I,

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,380
we'll be friends.

208
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,820
Something's weird.

209
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,400
Teachers haven't called me in.

210
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,720
And even Fei Linge's been

211
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,640
unusually quiet too.

212
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,680
Probably saw how scary
you can be, Lin Yingtao,

213
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,580
and thought twice

214
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,780
about messing with you.

215
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,720
He needed someone to shut him up.

216
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,040
Let's not push it. I just got here.

217
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,040
Better keep my head down.

218
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,960
I'm sitting here.

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,860
You two sit over there.

220
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,120
I want to see

221
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,340
Cai Fangyuan's multimedia player.

222
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,200
Why didn't you say earlier?
I didn't bring it.

223
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,240
Then what did you bring?

224
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,900
Let me see.

225
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,740
Alright, I'll read this.

226
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,780
Yingtao,

227
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,700
are we losing you to the dark side?

228
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,320
Relax, I'm just curious.

229
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,400
Listen up.

230
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,960
Any game strategy you find in books?

231
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,980
Outdated already.

232
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,520
Let me, Cai Fangyuan,

233
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,520
show you how to become a pro
in just three days.

234
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,000
After that,

235
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,700
you'll all be begging me
to play in your team.

236
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,380
Yeah, right.

237
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,400
Isn't your whole strategy
just dropping cash?

238
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,840
Don't underestimate me.

239
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,820
Yingtao.

240
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,360
I'm serious.

241
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,240
<i>World of Warcraft</i> is

242
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,140
more than a game.

243
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,600
It's a way of life.

244
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,560
Here's how it works.

245
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Look.

246
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,380
What are you thinking about?

247
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,920
You sit next to me

248
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,400
and don't say a word?

249
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,140
What's there to talk about?

250
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,180
Qin Yeyun, seriously,

251
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,220
we're the Qunshan Gang.

252
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,120
Why don't you ever hang out with us?

253
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,700
You skipped Dance Machine last time.

254
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,720
You wouldn't believe

255
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,060
how good Lin Yingtao was.

256
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,320
What's so fun about Dance Machine?

257
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,500
Then you pick something.
We'll go with you.

258
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,260
<i>Wait, too fast. I'm lost.</i>

259
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,020
The aquarium.

260
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,040
Will you come with me?

261
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,120
Of course. We'll all go to the aquarium.

262
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,340
Lin Ying…

263
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,440
Lin Qile.

264
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,580
Let's go to the aquarium this weekend.

265
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,620
The aquarium?

266
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,820
I'm not going.

267
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,840
But Qin Yeyun wants to.

268
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,000
We should go for her.

269
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,320
Look, she's upset already.

270
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,320
Just say yes.

271
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,100
Alright, alright, fine.

272
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,140
I'll go.

273
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,820
I'll go.

274
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,220
Yingtao,

275
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,700
why not the aquarium?

276
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,500
OCEAN WORLD

277
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,840
Jiang Qiaoxi,

278
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,360
look at those jellyfish on TV.

279
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,780
They're so pretty.

280
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,180
Kinda makes me want to bite one.

281
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,200
Probably taste amazing.

282
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,060
You can't eat jellyfish.

283
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,820
Most of them are poisonous.

284
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,540
No way.

285
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,940
They're so pretty.

286
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,880
Looks pretty, stings worse.

287
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,120
What are you doing?

288
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh no.

289
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,520
Jiang Qiaoxi,

290
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,980
I think I've been poisoned by you.

291
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,420
Help. Somebody help…

292
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,820
Yingtao,

293
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,920
do you like jellyfish?

294
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,740
Let's go see them together someday.

295
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,220
But there's no aquarium in Qunshan.

296
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,300
There is in the city.

297
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,560
But I don't like the city.

298
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,740
Then we won't go.

299
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,300
If you're there,

300
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,660
I'll like it.

301
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,260
Then we're definitely going.

302
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,520
Where are they?

303
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,240
Du Shang and Fangyuan
went to the bathroom.

304
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,200
I was too focused on the fish earlier.

305
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,960
My dolls wanted to see them.

306
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,300
Fish?

307
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,120
Aren't these jellyfish?

308
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,800
Yingtao,

309
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,160
you weren't looking at them

310
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,380
like they were just jellyfish.

311
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,920
Seriously, what's with Qin Yeyun?

312
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,680
She wanted to come,

313
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,900
then bailed last minute.

314
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,360
You're both the same.

315
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,720
Whatever you say or think,

316
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,260
no one else can figure it out.

317
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
Be nicer to her.

318
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,860
I'm always nice to her, aren't I?

319
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,900
She can't make it today.

320
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,480
Come with her next time.

321
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,660
Why don't you take her?

322
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,920
I…

323
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,920
I've just had too much on my mind.

324
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,980
No time for anything else.

325
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,540
Bye-bye!

326
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,980
Them again.

327
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,880
Who?

328
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,420
What a small world.

329
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,540
Hey, don't…

330
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,900
<i>What are you doing?</i>

331
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,960
I just wanted to hear
what a busy brain sounds like.

332
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,100
Like the ripe watermelon

333
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,200
with good sounds.

334
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,200
<i>A watermelon is a watermelon.</i>
<i>A brain is a brain.</i>

335
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,760
<i>They're not even comparable.</i>

336
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,320
Wait, are you calling me a dumb melon?

337
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,160
- No! Come on, seriously?
- Get over here.

338
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,920
It was just a joke, lighten up.

339
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,800
I was kidding.

340
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,900
QIN FAMILY MART

341
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,360
Qin Yeyun.

342
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,580
Qin Yeyun.

343
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,640
Qin Yeyun from the snack stand.

344
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,620
That's your reaction?

345
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,180
Do I need any reaction for watching TV?

346
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,440
I'm not the one on screen.

347
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,980
Take a good look, then.

348
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,040
I picked this for you.

349
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,420
Never mind.

350
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,400
Let me see!

351
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,040
Alright then. I'll accept it.

352
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,440
You two kinda look alike.

353
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,320
Same braids.

354
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,360
- Cute, right?
- Yingtao's here!

355
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
- Yingtao.
- Uncle Qin.

356
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,700
- Your parents told me
- I will help you.

357
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,500
you guys went to the aquarium today?

358
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,500
Yeah.

359
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,500
Yeyun,

360
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,640
seriously,

361
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,280
sitting around at home again?
Not studying?

362
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,460
Why don't you go outside,

363
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,140
hang out with Yingtao or something?

364
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,720
All you do is watch TV.

365
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,880
You've been at it all day.

366
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,040
What's so great about that show?

367
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,480
You've been sitting here all day for it?

368
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,160
Didn't you say you had
something important to do today?

369
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,280
Watching TV is important.

370
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,340
Come on, move.

371
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,520
What's wrong with you, Qin Yeyun?

372
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,720
Whatever. Not arguing with you.

373
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,760
The episode's over.

374
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,420
I'm coming over to your place.

375
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,980
Who said you could?

376
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,280
My house isn't a convenience store.

377
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,180
I'm doing you a favor.

378
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,740
Dad, I'm heading out!

379
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,360
That favor better be worth it.

380
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,320
I'm good-looking.

381
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,360
- My presence has value.
- You're priceless, alright.

382
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,700
<i>- Where are my slippers?</i>
<i>- I'm going first!</i>

383
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,820
Fine, go.

384
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,440
Yu Qiao.

385
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,160
- Dad.
- Hey, Uncle.

386
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,060
Hey, Uncle.

387
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,060
Shang,

388
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,840
Fangyuan, you guys head inside.

389
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,060
You, come here.

390
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,000
Alright.

391
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,940
- Take my camera in for me.
- Bag too.

392
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,260
You're 16 this year.

393
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,380
17.

394
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
Good.

395
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,480
You're growing up.

396
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,280
There's some stuff

397
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,920
we should probably talk about.

398
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,320
Dad,

399
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,020
is everything okay?

400
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,520
Is something going on?

401
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,540
Yu Qiao…

402
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,540
You like someone, don't you?

403
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,680
Look,

404
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,960
I was your age once.

405
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,740
I get it.

406
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,760
I really do.

407
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,220
If you like a girl at your age,

408
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,740
someone you grew up with,

409
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,140
it is totally normal.

410
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,880
But you've got to show it by you kindness

411
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,160
by your capability and actions,

412
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,580
if you like her.

413
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,120
Not by relying on some stupid phone quiz.

414
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,720
And… And remember,

415
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,300
your top priority right now
is your studies.

416
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,620
You're not old enough to date.

417
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,180
Dad, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

418
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,060
You…

419
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,260
You're not

420
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,900
chasing after Yun, are you?

421
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,760
Yun?

422
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,900
Qin Yeyun?

423
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,740
Me? Chasing her?

424
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,080
If I didn't catch those pending

425
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,040
200-yuan phone bills,

426
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,380
I'd never have known
my son's a secret romantic.

427
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,860
Why… What are you even saying?

428
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,020
Yu Jin!

429
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,760
Who told you to sneak my phone again?

430
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,040
Yu Qiao, I was asleep!

431
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,140
SOLIDARITY, COMPASSION,
PROFESSIONALISM, DEVOTION

432
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,780
It's not even that funny, okay?

433
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,540
What, that's not funny?

434
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,440
Can't believe Yu Jin

435
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,700
really trusted those cringey
love tests from TV ads.

436
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,280
Please, like you're any better.

437
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,160
You liked Xiaozhao,
the in-game girl for elementary.

438
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,640
Qin Yeyun is proud of her appreance.

439
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,620
If she ever finds out about this,

440
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,140
she'll be over the moon.

441
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,420
What does that have to do with me?

442
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,140
Qin Yeyun! Why are you running?

443
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,000
Just drop it.

444
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,180
You love a bit of drama, don't you?

445
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,420
What's so funny?

446
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,480
And you.

447
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,920
Your laugh's horrendous.

448
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,760
Get lost!

449
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,440
It's me.

450
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,160
Exactly. Lin Yingtao.

451
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,620
I don't want to see you.

452
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,840
I'm on your side.

453
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,660
I just stuck up for you and told them off.

454
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,320
Who asked you to?

455
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,260
You annoy me.

456
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,420
I can't stand all of you.

457
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,440
This is all Yu Qiao's fault.
He's such a dope.

458
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,240
Doesn't understand anything.

459
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,220
Why don't we just

460
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,700
go talk to him?

461
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,580
Clear things up.

462
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,240
What things?

463
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,500
Just tell him whatever's on your mind.

464
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,580
He deserves to know.

465
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,680
There's nothing

466
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,960
between you two.

467
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,740
Come on.

468
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,320
You are the one between…

469
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,840
If you tell him,

470
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,700
we won't even be friends anymore.

471
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,700
That's something between us, right?

472
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,580
I think it's fine how it is.

473
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,820
I'm not asking for anything.

474
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,340
As long as I can see him every day,

475
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,440
talk to him like normal… That's enough.

476
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,640
Great. I must've looked hideous just now.

477
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,900
You did look hideous.

478
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,140
Like a gremlin.

479
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,420
Still cuter than you.

480
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,860
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO
DRIFT THROUGH LIFE, STUDY FOR LIFE.

481
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,120
You took all these?

482
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,980
Pretty good, right?

483
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,220
They're actually really nice.

484
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,420
I know, right?

485
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,160
Jiang Qiaoxi.

486
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,540
Cen Xiaoman and I took these

487
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,300
while we were at the aquarium.

488
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,600
Takes time to really
look at photos, you know.

489
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,080
Did you finish my Olympiad math questions?

490
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
Not yet.

491
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,280
Jiang Qiaoxi,

492
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,160
there's one more thing
I wanted to tell you.

493
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,720
But promise you won't get mad, okay?

494
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,680
I'm only saying it
because I consider you a friend.

495
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,020
Go ahead.

496
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,180
That day, when we were at the aquarium,

497
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,960
we ran into Yu Qiao and Lin Qile.

498
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,200
Lin Qile, honestly,

499
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,240
made it this far here, in my opinion,

500
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,860
is because of Yu Qiao.

501
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,580
So maybe that's why she was

502
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,740
- so cold to you before.
- Stop.

503
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,880
- That's not possible.
- I'm serious.

504
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,820
Also…

505
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,560
Okay, okay, I'll shut up.

506
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,100
Take your time with the problems.

507
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,180
Line AD is the x-axis.

508
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,160
Line AB is the y-axis.

509
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,880
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

510
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,660
AE is the z-axis.

511
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,900
Didn't we just learn this?

512
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,440
Is there a better way to solve it?

513
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,080
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi,</i>
<i>come do this one on the board.</i>

514
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,940
<i>This problem's got a lot of steps.</i>

515
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,020
For someone like Lin Qile,
it might be tricky.

516
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,380
Easy to slip up.

517
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,440
<i>But if we draw an extra line,</i>

518
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,800
<i>it gets simpler.</i>

519
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,720
<i>First, take point N as the midpoint of EB.</i>

520
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,860
<i>Then connect MN, and also connect NC.</i>

521
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,980
<i>From there, you apply the theorem</i>
<i>for line-plane parallelism,</i>

522
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,380
<i>and the whole thing</i>
<i>becomes easier to solve.</i>

523
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,320
See?

524
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,760
Give any tough question to Jiang Qiaoxi,

525
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,140
and he makes it look easy.

526
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,340
<i>Very good.</i>
<i>Two ways to approach the problem.</i>

527
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,800
<i>Everyone, take a look.</i>

528
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,640
KNOWLEDGE AND VISION

529
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,340
Cai Fangyuan. Cai Fangyuan!

530
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,380
Let's go.

531
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,160
- Make mine warm.
- Add a teabag.

532
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,420
Water card.

533
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,360
- Water card, please.
- Using mine again?

534
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,260
Cut it.

535
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,360
Here.

536
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,200
Nothing fancy.

537
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,700
Just water.

538
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,120
Wait, you're getting water
for Cai Fangyuan?

539
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,800
Is that Yu Qiao's cup?

540
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,960
Yep. And Jiang Qiaoxi.

541
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,440
Lin Qile

542
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,940
asked you to get water for Jiang Qiaoxi?

543
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,760
She had something to do, so I helped out.

544
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,180
Just filling her friends' cups.

545
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,780
It's no trouble.

546
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,480
Who said he's a friend?

547
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,940
You can't tell there's
something off between us?

548
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,180
If Lin Qile finds out,

549
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,700
she's gonna be pissed.

550
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,540
You filled this for me?

551
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,020
Yeah, that was me. I took it upon myself.

552
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,820
Lin Qile didn't want to.

553
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,840
Don't get the wrong idea.

554
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,460
From now on, I'll just do it.

555
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,120
- No need to bother her.
- You don't have to.

556
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,800
Wait, did she ask you to say that?

557
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,440
Look, we're in the same class.

558
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,980
If you can't be friends,

559
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,660
at least stay out of each other's way.

560
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,440
Beat you next time.

561
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,240
Off you go.

562
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,980
Lin Qile.

563
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,600
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

564
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,260
I won't stick my nose
in your business anymore.

565
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,840
So you did get all the waters?

566
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,500
Don't be mad.

567
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,680
I gave Jiang Qiaoxi a heads-up too.

568
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,060
He probably

569
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,060
won't bug you anymore.

570
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,260
Thanks.

571
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,360
Today's physical education test is

572
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,600
800 meters for girls and 1500 for boys.

573
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,460
Let's try to finish it in this class.

574
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,260
- This sucks.
- You've got to be kidding…

575
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,240
- Kill me now.
- I can't run that.

576
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,200
Why the long faces?

577
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,320
You can't escape it,

578
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,600
even in senior year.

579
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,480
Calling the roll now.

580
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,480
<i>- Song Chuyang.</i>
- You don't feel well?

581
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,120
<i>- Here.</i>
<i>- Feng Letian.</i>

582
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,340
<i>- Here.</i>
- I'm okay.

583
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,600
- Want me to ask
<i>- Jiang Sisi.</i>

584
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,420
- for leave for you?
<i>- Here.</i>

585
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,360
<i>Sir, I'd like to sit this out.</i>

586
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,380
I'm not feeling great.

587
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,040
Anyone else?

588
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,600
- Sir…
- Me, too.

589
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,820
<i>Sir, I…</i>

590
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,420
Never mind.

591
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,760
Either way, I'll have to do it.

592
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,600
<i>Go, Jiang Qiaoxi!</i>

593
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,060
<i>- Come on!</i>
<i>- Let's go!</i>

594
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,600
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi!</i>

595
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,500
<i>Come on!</i>

596
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,720
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi!</i>

597
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,620
<i>Come on!</i>

598
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,740
- Jiang Qiaoxi…
- Let's go…

599
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,440
- Keep going.
- Jiang Qiaoxi…

600
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,900
- Jiang Qiaoxi!
- Jiang Qiaoxi!

601
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,860
<i>- Jiang Qiaoxi!</i>
<i>- Jiang Qiaoxi!</i>

602
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,660
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi…</i>

603
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,980
Jiang Qiaoxi!

604
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,900
Keep going!

605
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,860
Jiang Qiaoxi!

606
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,420
- Keep going!
- Jiang Qiaoxi!

607
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,120
- You alright?
- Yeah. Yeah.

608
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,740
- I'm good.
<i>- Jiang Qiaoxi!</i>

609
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,060
Keep going!

610
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,220
<i>Keep going! Come on…</i>

611
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,880
<i>Almost there…</i>

612
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,159
<i>Push through! Come on!</i>

613
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,480
Jiang Qiaoxi, you got this!

614
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,699
You got this!

615
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,520
You think

616
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,120
you can outrun me?

617
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:31,540
I'm not here to race you.

618
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,760
I want you to know something.

619
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,820
People saw you two at the aquarium.
Now they're talking.

620
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,000
I know there's nothing between you two,

621
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,739
but people don't see it that way.

622
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,840
<i>Run faster.</i>

623
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,420
You think you know better?

624
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,780
What, you suddenly know us?

625
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,739
<i>I know Lin Yingtao.</i>

626
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,960
Don't say her name.

627
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,380
She's got nothing to do with you.

628
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,300
Yu Qiao,

629
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,360
I'm saying this for her sake.

630
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,100
For Lin Yingtao,

631
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,580
it will make things worse. Understand?

632
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,600
You're making things worse.

633
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,300
What else

634
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,880
was in that letter?

635
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,920
What letter?

636
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,120
I know

637
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,540
you've got the rest of it.

638
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,160
Hand it over.

639
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,340
I took it from Fei Linge.

640
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,360
You could've fought for it back then.

641
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,260
<i>Try to breathe.</i>

642
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,720
Inhale, two steps. Exhale, two steps.

643
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,940
Don't rush it.

644
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,860
Keep going!

645
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,500
<i>Keep going!</i>

646
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,540
<i>Come on!</i>

647
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,560
<i>Come on!</i>

648
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,840
<i>Keep going!</i>

649
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,600
<i>Come on!</i>

650
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,620
<i>Come on!</i>

651
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,200
- Push through!
- Almost there, Xiaoman!

652
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,140
<i>Xiaoman takes the lead!</i>

653
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,060
<i>Keep going!</i>

654
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,300
<i>Come on…</i>

655
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,320
<i>Almost there…</i>

656
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,640
Easy. Slow down.

657
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,160
Not bad, Lin Qile.

658
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,960
You were killing it out there…

659
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,060
Xiaoman doesn't like peanut milk.

660
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,020
She's more of a Coke girl.
I'll get it for her.

661
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,480
It's not for her.

662
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,640
It's for Lin Qile.

663
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,620
Lin Qile fainted just now.

664
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,740
They took her to the nurse's office.

665
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,040
- She fainted?
- Yes.

666
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,940
<i>Here, drink this.</i>

667
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,860
Thanks, Ms.

668
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,940
Ms.

669
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,980
Is she okay?

670
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,300
Does she need to go to a hospital?

671
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,000
She's alright. Don't worry.

672
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,220
Just a little heatstroke.

673
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,320
She wasn't in the best shape.

674
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,540
A good nap and she'll be fine.

675
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,500
Here.

676
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,080
You all should head back to class.

677
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,940
Too much noise and she can't rest.

678
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,920
I'll take this.

679
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,020
Feeling better?

680
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,440
Just stay here and sleep.

681
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,640
Sleep all afternoon if you want.

682
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,140
I'll grab lunch for you.

683
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,220
You two don't have to hang around.

684
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,740
Go back to class.

685
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,860
Go on, I'm good here.

686
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,840
See you, Ms.

687
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,800
Bye, Ms.

688
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,580
Jiang Qiaoxi…

689
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,820
Yingtao, any better?

690
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,780
I really want some peanut milk.

691
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,140
But Mom says

692
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,740
I can't have cold drinks with a fever.

693
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,640
Only warm water.

694
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,300
But I hate warm water.

695
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,880
Help me.

696
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,360
Don't worry.

697
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,060
Auntie Juan's at work.

698
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,060
I warmed up the peanut milk for you.

699
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,260
Drink up.

700
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,620
Jiang Qiaoxi,

701
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,100
you're so sweet.

702
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,640
I hate being sick.

703
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,840
When I get sick,

704
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,460
you stay with me the whole time.

705
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,540
Got it?

706
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,540
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi,</i>

707
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,740
it's just better…

708
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,600
when you're around.

709
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,940
What is it? Too hot?

710
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,560
What are you doing here?

711
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,840
Came to check on you.

712
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,360
I didn't ask you to.

713
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,560
Who even are we now?

714
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,640
I don't need your care.

715
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,500
Technically,

716
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,000
we're just

717
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,140
classmates now.

718
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,640
Thanks for the visit, then.

719
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,300
But I'm fine.

720
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,660
Don't sit here.

721
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,180
If the teacher shows up,

722
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,060
what are we gonna say?

723
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,000
You should go.

724
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,020
It's fine.

725
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,600
I'll just say I came here

726
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,840
to get some medicine.

727
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,660
Aren't you too proud to lie?

728
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,560
I can when it's about you.

729
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,600
Well, don't bother.

730
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,760
Alright, I won't say anything.

731
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,540
Then leave.

732
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,920
Didn't you just say

733
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,600
it's better when I'm around?

734
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,320
I wasn't talking about you.

735
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,880
I'm pretty sure

736
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,820
you used to say

737
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,520
I had to stay with you

738
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,800
whenever you got sick.

739
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,240
Did I?

740
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,120
I don't remember.

741
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,620
That's okay.

742
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,780
I remember for both of us.

743
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,680
Jiang Qiaoxi…

744
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,980
Why do you keep saying the same things

745
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,000
over and over?

746
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,500
Don't you have anything new to say?

747
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,940
Are you going or not?

748
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:28,960
You won't? I will.

749
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,520
I'll go.

750
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,680
Get some rest.

751
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
Can you…

752
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,680
Can you stop saying stuff like that?

753
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,580
I don't like it. It's exhausting.

754
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,240
Okay.

755
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,200
I hear you.

756
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,400
Jiang Qiaoxi, what are you doing here?

757
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,840
Ms.

758
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,960
- She told me not to say anything…
- Ms,

759
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,480
he came looking for you because

760
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,420
he wasn't feeling well,

761
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,580
but you weren't in.

762
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,320
<i>Where isn't he feeling well?</i>

763
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:06,940
His brain, he says.

764
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,240
<i>His brain?</i>

765
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,460
Ms,

766
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,040
I just promised someone I wouldn't lie.

767
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,660
So here's the truth.

768
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,700
We're classmates.

769
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,680
And

770
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,420
I came here just to check on her.

771
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,620
I'll go now, Ms.

772
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,080
