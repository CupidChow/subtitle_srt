1
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:39,008
 

2
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,919
Jiang Qiao Xi.

3
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,280
Hello? Cherry.

4
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,699
Where are you? Why weren't you there?

5
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:40,179
 I'm sorry. Something came up
and I forgot to tell you. 

6
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,939
Next time, could you inform me in advance?
I was really worried.

7
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:58,980
 What? Were you afraid I'd disappear again? 

8
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,459
You have a track record. How can you say that?

9
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:17,639
If you're busy, let's video call tomorrow instead.

10
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,080
 Wait, no. I'm just walking. I can talk. 

11
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,039
 How's your school internship preparation going? 

12
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:33,599
Not bad. Remember I mentioned
I'd be teaching first graders?

13
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,539
They're still at that fairy tale-loving age.

14
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:43,840
So I read fairy tale collections
from different countries,

15
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,719
looking for fresh, interesting stories to share.

16
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,560
 Did you find anything fun today? 

17
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,319
 Can you tell this grown-up first? 

18
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:56,540
A grown-up wanting fairy tales?

19
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,060
I found one called The Fox's Window.

20
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,024
If you shape your hands like a fox window,

21
00:04:05,024 --> 00:04:10,919
you can see anything you desire through it.

22
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:16,879
 Anything I desire? How do I make it? 

23
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,220
It's a little complex.

24
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,220
Put the back of your left hand
and the palm of your right hand toward yourself,

25
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,600
with your right middle finger and ring finger
pressing your left index finger.

26
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,819
Sounds like a tongue twister.

27
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:32,860
Overlap your fingers to create a window.

28
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,920
 It is complex. 

29
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,240
I'll show you in person next time.

30
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,279
 Okay. Can this really show what I desire? 

31
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:47,579
Of course! Don't you trust Miss Lin?

32
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:52,180
 I do. What do you want to see most? 

33
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,360
Need you ask? Jiang Qiao Xi.

34
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,300
 Jiang Qiao Xi? 

35
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,300
Come to the balcony with your fox window.

36
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,499
Maybe you'll see what you desire.

37
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:24,416
 ♫ Memories drift in my pupils ♫ 

38
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,772
 ♫ Through the window of time ♫ 

39
00:05:27,772 --> 00:05:30,332
 ♫ Summer cherries are a bit cool ♫ 

40
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:33,404
 ♫ I gaze from afar ♫ 

41
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:35,548
 ♫ The unspoken wishes of that year ♫ 

42
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:38,780
 ♫ Familiar shadows lengthen ♫ 

43
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,508
 ♫ Beyond sight ♫ 

44
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:44,768
 ♫ Your silhouette is so gentle ♫ 

45
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:48,828
 ♫ The world is spinning ♫ 

46
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,364
 ♫ The breeze is shouting ♫ 

47
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,936
 ♫ The scenery in amber ♫ 

48
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:03,324
 ♫ Clear as yesterday ♫ 

49
00:06:03,324 --> 00:06:04,924
 ♫ Reality is in front of me ♫ 

50
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:08,956
 ♫ The future folds in the palm ♫ 

51
00:06:08,956 --> 00:06:14,556
 ♫ You're the key to who I am ♫ 

52
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:19,452
 ♫ Accompany me to become myself ♫ 

53
00:06:19,452 --> 00:06:22,780
 ♫ The night is long ♫ 

54
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,308
 ♫ My stubbornness grows wildly ♫ 

55
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:27,644
 ♫ I can't stop running ♫ 

56
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:30,748
 ♫ The silent call of the dream ♫ 

57
00:06:30,748 --> 00:06:36,636
 ♫ You're the sparkling of my dreams ♫ 

58
00:06:38,112 --> 00:06:41,596
 

59
00:06:41,596 --> 00:06:44,380
 ♫ Boundaries dissipate ♫ 

60
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,028
 ♫ Loneliness melts in an embrace ♫ 

61
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:53,692
 ♫ I've always been here ♫ 

62
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:16,119
Jiang Qiao Xi.

63
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:20,660
You startled me. You're up so early.

64
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,220
I smelled something good.

65
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,560
Have you lost weight? You feel lighter.

66
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,100
- Really?
- Yes.

67
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,259
Then you haven't been feeding me well enough.

68
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,339
Not feeding you well? Look at all these dishes!

69
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:34,368
Try this new recipe.

70
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,560
Well?

71
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,819
Okay, dig in. I need to go to the office.

72
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,060
Work again?

73
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,620
Market's hot now, so our boss
wants to make more investments.

74
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,340
I'm meeting a startup this morning.

75
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,399
When did you sleep last night?

76
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,939
4:30 a.m.

77
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:05,619
It's 8:30 now. You only slept for four hours...

78
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,420
I read the emails. I'm up to speed.

79
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,840
Alright, I'll be there soon. Got it.

80
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:26,579
If they're college founders,

81
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:28,699
keep it casual. Hear them out.

82
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:31,399
Hear them out.

83
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,899
Cherry, I'm leaving.

84
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:39,859
Wait! You just graduated yourself.

85
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,679
When will you be back?

86
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,940
Evening. I'll try to hurry.

87
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,740
Evening?

88
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,120
Bye.

89
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,620
Qin Ye Yun.

90
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:11,559
Lin Cherry! Shouting names at 25?

91
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,700
It's your wedding venue with Jiang Qiao Xi,

92
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,770
but he's not here.

93
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,760
What am I doing here?

94
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:26,820
Tell me about it. He says the investment
market is booming. His firm keeps summoning him.

95
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,600
He's like a wound-up clock in finance mode.

96
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,760
No time for this.

97
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:35,899
How can he not care about his own wedding?

98
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:41,759
He's always working... Could there be someone?

99
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,359
What?

100
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,760
Oh, right. Our first call was four years ago.

101
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:55,159
Four years. It's about time.

102
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,440
What are you talking about, Qin Ye Yun?

103
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,480
Telling the truth! Men are all the same.

104
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,480
Thanks a lot! You've known him since childhood!

105
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,279
No matter how late he works overtime, he always
rushes back in the morning to make me breakfast.

106
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,340
Sometimes he's already gone
to work before I even wake up.

107
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,479
But the food in the pot is always warm.

108
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,199
What does that prove?
That Jiang Qiao Xi loves cooking?

109
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:23,100
If he makes you breakfast, who gets his dinner?

110
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,539
Enough is enough. I'll throw you down.

111
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:28,639
I can't believe it either.
You actually entered the gaming industry.

112
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,500
I know this financing poses
significant risks for our company.

113
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,919
But if I succeed,

114
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,860
I can turn every "impossible"
in my mind into reality.

115
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,420
If we fail, I'll be left with nothing.

116
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,399
Did you thoroughly review Mr. Liang's contract?

117
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:53,519
To be honest, I don't really understand contracts.
My colleagues handle ours.

118
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,040
But they mentioned adding
a supplementary agreement.

119
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,419
Are you saying we should
sign a Drawer Agreement with them,

120
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:05,519
offering us discounts
to lower their offering price?

121
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,059
In exchange, the company
will increase their investment.

122
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:14,639
If we proceed this way, their original
shareholders' equity will be severely diluted.

123
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,700
That's their concern.
I value their core technology as a small company.

124
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,419
They are in the emerging gaming industry
with great publicity potential.

125
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:27,699
We can buy low and sell high in the future.

126
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,980
These companies approach us
with hopes for better future development.

127
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,639
Wouldn't this be unfair if we actually do it?

128
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,340
Achieving the best outcome at any cost.

129
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,700
As a financier, this is the most basic rule.

130
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:50,679
Vincent, understanding priorities early
benefits us both.

131
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,919
Can you believe he actually forgot
our important venue selection?

132
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,120
He went to work overtime today.

133
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,440
 How could Jiang Qiao Xi be so inconsiderate? 

134
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,860
 Don't worry, Cherry. I'll give him
a proper scolding when I see him. 

135
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,639
Alright. Please do talk sense into him.

136
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,080
Cherry, I'm home.

137
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,940
Come here. I'm video chatting with Mr. Jiang.

138
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,419
Hurry! What are you putting down?
Come here quickly.

139
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:17,580
I bought groceries.

140
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,419
I'm actually video chatting with your dad.

141
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:22,340
- Dad...
- Are you back from overtime work?

142
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,140
Yes, I just got off work.

143
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:28,859
Say something.

144
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,000
Dad, are you doing all right in Africa?

145
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,580
I'm fine. Everything's fine.
You're doing okay too?

146
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,380
I'm managing.

147
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,279
Dad, I should start cooking now.

148
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:50,679
 Alright. Make something delicious for Cherry. 

149
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,740
 Take care of yourself. 

150
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,540
Alright. I will.

151
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,520
Why rush to cook? I'm not even hungry.

152
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,620
Hello. Your flowers have arrived.

153
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,379
I didn't order flowers.

154
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:29,339
To my favorite Ms. Cherry.

155
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:50,420
These flowers are for you.
Don't be upset. I know what today is.

156
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,300
Today marks 6,000 days since we met.

157
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,540
It's been 16 years.

158
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,900
Let's eat.

159
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:13,160
Cherry, what's really bothering you?

160
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,559
Actually, I'm not in a hurry to get married.

161
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:27,720
You kept saying Ms. Juan's date buns recipe
only goes to family members.

162
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,220
And that you need to call Ms. Juan
"Mom" to become family.

163
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,860
You pushed me to get the certificate
when I became of age, and then rushed the wedding.

164
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,660
Yet when the time comes,
you're the one who forgot.

165
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,100
I'm sorry. I forgot that today
was our venue selection day.

166
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,820
I genuinely forgot. I've been too busy lately.

167
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,139
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I remember now.

168
00:14:56,139 --> 00:15:00,500
I promise I'll never forget such things again.

169
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,000
Whenever I have time,
I'll come home to arrange flowers with you.

170
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,360
If you keep coming home for flower arranging,
how will you work?

171
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,020
I'm thoroughly reflecting on my mistakes.

172
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,860
- Good morning, Miss Lin.
- Good morning.

173
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,980
- Hello, Miss Lin.
- Hello, everyone.

174
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,960
Walk slowly now.

175
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,120
Hello, Miss Lin.

176
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,920
Good morning.

177
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,299
Good morning, Ms. Cherry.

178
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:30,099
Good morning, Ms. Cherry.

179
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,059
Time to prepare for class.

180
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:35,220
- Good morning, Miss Lin.
- Good morning.

181
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,679
- Hi, Miss Lin.
- Hi.

182
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,759
Ms. Lin, what did you do this weekend?
I ate hamburgers.

183
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,799
I visited my best friend over the weekend.

184
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,580
Miss Lin, is it true you're getting married?

185
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,820
Miss Lin, look at my new pencil case
from my mom. Isn't it pretty?

186
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,659
- It's beautiful!
- Miss Lin, I brought...

187
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,780
Miss...

188
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:58,660
Alright, everyone, hurry and prepare for class.

189
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,579
Hao Lei, what are you doing sitting here?

190
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,599
Shall I sit here with you? Would you tell me then?

191
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,799
Do you want the little chair to protect you?

192
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:33,860
But see? Your classmates are here,
and there's sunshine.

193
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:39,400
I'll start the lesson soon.
Do you want to come out for storytime?

194
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,940
Did everyone note their homework?
Don't forget your textbooks tomorrow.

195
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,480
Goodbye, Miss Lin.

196
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,720
Bye-bye!

197
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,520
Lin Qi Le.

198
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,980
Cen Xiao Man, are you here to pick up a child?

199
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,680
No, no. I'm picking up my boss's child.

200
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,119
I work at a magazine now
after returning from studying abroad.

201
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,680
That's wonderful. It suits you.

202
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,900
I didn't expect to see you here either.

203
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,279
What's your boss's child's name?
I'll help find them.

204
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,299
Xu Hao Lei from Class 1-1.

205
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:24,740
He's in my class.
Lei, she's here to pick you up. Let's go.

206
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,399
Lei, let's go. School's out.

207
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:33,400
To be honest, I haven't met Lei many times,
but he's always been like this whenever I see him.

208
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,940
My boss is a career-driven woman.

209
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,700
She's rarely around to be with her child,
so it's natural he's introverted.

210
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,299
He might not just be introverted.
I think he's quite sensitive.

211
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:52,740
Also, he has a vivid imagination. Sometimes,
he pretends to be a little mushroom in the corner.

212
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:59,619
Maybe you could pretend to be
a mushroom too and chat with him more.

213
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,740
Is this how you managed to win over Jiang Qiao Xi?

214
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,059
If those things didn't happen back then,

215
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:18,040
I think we'd be good friends in high school.

216
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,900
Come on, Lei! I will buy you candy.

217
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,400
- Say goodbye to Miss Lin.
- Bye!

218
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,579
- See you tomorrow!
- Bye!

219
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:45,039
 Check the news quickly!
Something happened to Yu Qiao. 

220
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,119
 A black kite crashed into his plane's engine. 

221
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,919
Yu Qiao.

222
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:56,660
 
 A flight encountered a bird strike. 

223
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,980
Within seconds, the warning lights
lit up in the cockpit.

224
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,119
- Yu Qiao.
- Qin Ye Yun, sit down.

225
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:05,119
You scared us to death!
Why didn't you explain properly?

226
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:07,259
Why are you running? I won't bite you.

227
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:08,619
- You're late.
- Stop right there.

228
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:09,859
- I'm fine.
- Drink a penalty shot!

229
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:11,579
- I drove here.
- All my limbs are intact.

230
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:12,660
Really, I'm fine. Completely fine.

231
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,000
Then stop and let me check.

232
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,079
Stop dodging.

233
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,220
I'm fine. I'm really fine.

234
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,659
Couldn't you explain properly? Why be so dramatic?

235
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,839
I'm back safely, aren't I?
Have some water and calm down.

236
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:26,440
You should find another career while you're young.

237
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,079
Qin Ye Yun, let's not have this negative talk now.

238
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,140
Look at it differently...

239
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,519
I gained invaluable flight experience
from this emergency.

240
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:37,180
How many pilots
get such hands-on crisis experience?

241
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:43,379
Besides, the aviation industry would lose out
if an awarded pilot like me quits.

242
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:49,159
True. Once you decide something,
nothing can change your mind.

243
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:56,839
I heard from Qin Ye Yun that your cancer drug
contained carcinogens?

244
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:58,940
How are things going lately? Any progress?

245
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,000
Same old. I knew becoming a doctor
would be tough from day one.

246
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,039
Especially now,
with this cancer drug research path.

247
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,839
If I weren't facing challenges,
that'd be worrying.

248
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,279
Besides, Yu Qiao fought for his life in the skies.

249
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,480
If I can't overcome this minor issue,
I'd be so pathetic. Right, Yu Qiao?

250
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,119
Exactly. That's how positive role models work.

251
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,900
My heroic story
elevated this dinner's significance.

252
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,920
Oh, you're such a hero.

253
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,619
- Here's to our role model!
- Cheers!

254
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:28,019
- Come on!
- Let's toast the hero!

255
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,099
To our role model! To the hero!

256
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:32,980
We finally gathered here together today.

257
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,900
Remember that thing we've been putting off?

258
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,559
I think today's the perfect time.

259
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,359
What is it?

260
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,720
- Everything's here.
- Hurry up!

261
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,980
Come and help quickly!

262
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,780
Got it!

263
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:54,859
So many?

264
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:56,659
Yep.

265
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,559
I suddenly feel like I bought this car
just for this moment.

266
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,619
Alright, let's go. Get in!

267
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:07,759
Qin Ye Yun, you're driving?

268
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:08,900
Of course!

269
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,040
Fine. I'll ride shotgun as your navigator.

270
00:21:14,688 --> 00:21:18,299
 ♫ Flying over that sea ♫ 

271
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:21,319
 I want to keep the steering wheel in my own hands. 

272
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:26,019
 I'll play my favorite songs,
drive long distances to see beautiful views. 

273
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:30,900
 My passenger seat should have Cherry,
Cai Fang Yuan, Du Shang, 

274
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,000
 and occasionally Yu Qiao. 

275
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,848
 ♫ Maybe the world's a bit harsh ♫ 

276
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:39,693
 ♫ Always extinguishing hope ♫ 

277
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,688
 ♫ But dear friend ♫ 

278
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:44,928
 ♫ You are all I need ♫ 

279
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,819
 ♫ You are my matchstick ♫ 

280
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:48,160
Qun Shan Squad.

281
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,216
Pilot taking off!

282
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:52,952
 ♫ You're always humming a song softly ♫ 

283
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:57,393
 ♫ Facing the sunset ♫ 

284
00:21:58,272 --> 00:22:02,400
 ♫ Waving hard ♫ 

285
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,444
 ♫ Don't forget about tomorrow ♫ 

286
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,229
We're getting married next year.
Isn't giving red envelopes now too early?

287
00:22:14,229 --> 00:22:16,320
This isn't wedding money.

288
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,299
It's the other half of that letter

289
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,469
from Cherry in freshman year

290
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:22,839
 that I snatched away. 

291
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,888
 The probation period's over. 

292
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:27,420
You feel assured?

293
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:32,519
You've already got certified.
It's not my right to judge that anymore.

294
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,200
I've kept this letter for years,
always wanting to read it.

295
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:44,680
But I never opened it. What a test of willpower!

296
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,180
Now I can finally toss this grenade back to you.

297
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,220
Thanks.

298
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,299
Cherry, what else do you want to play?

299
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,280
I want to try that one.

300
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,839
All done?

301
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:10,639
Yep.

302
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,000
Yu Qiao.

303
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,900
There's something I thought I'd never tell you.

304
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:31,140
But after your accident,
I feared I'd regret keeping silent.

305
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,079
I don't want to live with regrets.

306
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,760
Go ahead.

307
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:53,599
I never know which flight
you're piloting each day.

308
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:59,099
But whenever I look up
and see a plane passing by...

309
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:04,460
I always imagine it's you.

310
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,992
Okay,

311
00:24:16,992 --> 00:24:23,019
 then when I'm up in the sky,
I'll look down at the ground 

312
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:27,339
 and imagine you looking up at me too. 

313
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:39,720
That's all I wanted to say.
Let's go set off fireworks.

314
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,799
Let's go.

315
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:42,799
Run!

316
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,039
- Hurry up!
- Hurry up, Jiang Qiao Xi.

317
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,839
Let's go.

318
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,559
It's so beautiful.

319
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,539
 Today, Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets
experienced significant corrections. 

320
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:07,539
 Major stock indices see notable declines
with increased market volatility. 

321
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:13,579
 Regulators state they'll continue monitoring
market trends to ensure stable operations. 

322
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:18,500
- Hello, Miss Lin.
- The index plummeted to 3,000 points at opening.

323
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:23,619
I thought I was seeing things.
How does this make any sense?

324
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:29,619
My husband and I had agreed
to invest our apartment savings...

325
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:32,059
What's wrong with Miss Sun?

326
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:36,359
You don't trade stocks?
Thousands of stocks hit the limit down today.

327
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,079
The market went down, straight
to 3,000 points. 40% wiped out.

328
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,879
Lin Qi Le.

329
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,740
What are you doing here?

330
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,180
Have you contacted Jiang Qiao Xi?

331
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,279
No, why?

332
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,440
Fei Lin Ge told me his boss
was taken for investigation.

333
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,420
Jiang Qiao Xi warned him about the problematic
Drawer Agreement with this PE firm.

334
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,559
There's a risk of them being trapped
while the investor cashes out.

335
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,519
Fei terminated the cooperation
after learning this.

336
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,359
With today's crash and his boss detained,

337
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,559
Fei couldn't reach him by phone.

338
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,879
It's urgent, so I came straight to you.

339
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:13,500
I'll try calling him first.

340
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,180
I'll go check our place.

341
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,980
Go quickly.

342
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,359
Thank you.

343
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,940
Stop talking and go!

344
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,880
 Jiang Qiao Xi, I've said so much,
yet forgot to ask: 

345
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,000
 Do you remember Chun Lu? That you're her father? 

346
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,460
 Do... you remember me? 

347
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:06,300
 I've never forgotten you.
You remind me of our childhood. 

348
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,640
 Time flew so fast then. 

349
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,200
 So fast that the ice cream melted
before we could eat it. 

350
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,900
 So fast that I just reached
the peak for the sunset glow, 

351
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:27,940
 and night fell in a blink, so I had to descend. 

352
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,640
 ♫ She timidly ♫ 

353
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,960
 But these five years without you
and my friends dragged endlessly, 

354
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,380
 like an interminable afternoon nap. 

355
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:45,359
 What about you? Does time fly or crawl? 

356
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,720
 Is it because you met new friends 

357
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,680
 that you prefer who make time pass faster? 

358
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:59,900
 If so, I'd be a little sad, just a tiny bit. 

359
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,940
 Your happiness would make me happy. 

360
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:09,160
 But tell your new friends
that your name is Jiang Qiao Xi. 

361
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,579
 It means the most beautiful
sunset glow in Qun Shan. 

362
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:20,259
 Writing this took all my courage, Jiang Qiao Xi. 

363
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:22,759
 I fear you've forgotten me. 

364
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:27,900
 Yet I believe if it's you, you wouldn't. 

365
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,140
 Can you give me your answer? 

366
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:34,059
 I know you're busy solving endless math problems. 

367
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:39,919
 But when you're free,
could you return to Qun Shan? 

368
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,599
 I want to watch that mountaintop
sunset glow with you again. 

369
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,579
 I want to hear how these five years
have treated you. 

370
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:55,140
 Was your time passing fast or slow? 

371
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:03,020
 Sincerely, Lin Cherry
who wants to share sunset glow with you. 

372
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:07,028
Jiang Qiao Xi.

373
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:08,424
 ♫ You held my hand ♫ 

374
00:29:08,424 --> 00:29:11,647
 ♫ Running towards the mountain top ♫ 

375
00:29:11,647 --> 00:29:13,802
 ♫ The sunset dissipates ♫ 

376
00:29:13,802 --> 00:29:16,910
 ♫ All the worries ♫ 

377
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,934
 ♫ You are in my eyes ♫ 

378
00:29:18,934 --> 00:29:20,478
 ♫ I look at you ♫ 

379
00:29:20,478 --> 00:29:21,900
 ♫ Without noticing ♫ 

380
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,599
It's okay, Jiang Qiao Xi.

381
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:25,559
 ♫ At this moment ♫ 

382
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:30,419
It's okay, it's okay.
As long as you're safe, that's all that matters.

383
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,779
Why are you saying that?

384
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,480
Cen Xiao Man came and told me everything.

385
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,800
She said your company's boss
was taken for investigation.

386
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,440
You didn't do anything wrong, right?

387
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,859
Relax, sit down.

388
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,240
I resigned before crossing any lines.

389
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,039
Then why the tears? The stock market?

390
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,420
No.

391
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,019
It really doesn't matter.
Money can be earned back.

392
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:11,000
As long as you're safe, Jiang Qiao Xi.
Nothing else matters.

393
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,799
It's not the stocks. I already sold everything.

394
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:20,599
You sold them? Why didn't you tell me?

395
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,700
Quitting your job, selling stocks,
no word about any of it!

396
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,659
You never share anything with me!

397
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,160
What?

398
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,420
Come here.

399
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,220
What?

400
00:30:56,859 --> 00:31:01,240
You didn't use the stock money
for a ring, did you?

401
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,019
Jiang Qiao Xi, what are you doing?

402
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:10,579
Don't worry. It's covered.

403
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:18,139
Cherry, this might seem unnecessary, but...

404
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:27,220
Let me ask again.
Will you spend your life with me?

405
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,460
Aren't I already doing that?

406
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,319
It's not the same. Will you?

407
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,839
Hurry up.

408
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,980
It's blinding me! So sparkly!

409
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,480
Alright, stop showing off.
This ring is way too shiny.

410
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,440
No, it's literally dazzling.

411
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:28,500
Qiao Xi, how long are you two
planning to stay this time?

412
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,379
We'll just stay through the weekend.
I need to rush back for school.

413
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:43,740
Alright. You must have work
in Hong Yang. It's fine.

414
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,099
They've both grown up
and have their own careers now.

415
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:51,540
If they can stay for a couple of days,
let them enjoy it.

416
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,019
Qiao Xi, I'll make extra date buns
and lotus root sandwiches for you this time.

417
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:59,500
You two can take them back and freeze them.

418
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,119
No need to trouble yourself, Miss Juan.
You can teach me instead.

419
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:05,240
When we return to Hong Yang,
I'll make them for Cherry.

420
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,000
That won't do. You should teach me.

421
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,460
He does all the cooking now.
What if he gets tired of it and starts acting up?

422
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,880
I'll have a secret weapon.

423
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,980
Oh, you're so clever.

424
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,980
Honestly.

425
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:23,000
Sir, Ma'am, there's something I want to mention.

426
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,180
Although Cherry and I haven't had our wedding yet,

427
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:31,139
I wonder if I could start
calling you Mom and Dad from today.

428
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:40,200
Call us whatever you want.
We've seen you as our son since childhood.

429
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,879
Well, that depends on your performance.

430
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,980
Dad.

431
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,100
Mom.

432
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,939
Good.

433
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:38,420
Now that Jiang Qiao Xi's calling you Dad and Mom,
can we skip the red envelope for the title change?

434
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:42,019
Of course not. Proper etiquette must be observed.

435
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:44,579
But we've already done it now.
Does that mean we skip it at the wedding?

436
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:46,579
You little miser. Honestly.

437
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:52,219
Cherry, from now on,
you'll be living with Qiao Xi. You two are family.

438
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:55,119
You should plan more for your new family.

439
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,579
No way! Even with my own family,
I'll always love Mom and Dad most.

440
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:03,139
That's not right.
Your future days are for you two to share.

441
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:05,959
Take good care of each other.

442
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,660
Remember to call me if anything happens.

443
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,900
What's with the 'Uh-huh'?
Let me explain so you understand.

444
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,380
What my dad means is, you better not bully me.

445
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,760
If you do, I'll call my dad.

446
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,219
And he'll come beat you up.

447
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:26,280
You actually reached out. Don't hurt him.

448
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,059
- I'm okay.
- Do you feel bad?

449
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,859
Yeah.

450
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:32,039
You poked through it.

451
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:34,080
I really did.

452
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,500
Let me see. It's good. Really nice.

453
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,320
My pleats aren't as pretty as yours.

454
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,719
They look fine. You'll get better with practice.

455
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:47,519
Okay.

456
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:56,060
Cherry, does Qiao Xi
still keep in touch with his parents?

457
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,920
Same as before. You know his family situation.

458
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,360
He exchanges a few words with Mr. Jiang now,
but it's still lukewarm.

459
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:13,280
Ms. Liang sometimes calls to check in.

460
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,339
But the calls never last more than a minute.

461
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:25,659
There's something his mom
made me promise not to tell you.

462
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:31,760
But now that you're married,
I think you should know.

463
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,560
What is it?

464
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,579
Two years ago, after returning from Nigeria,
his mother came to our house.

465
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:43,379
Do you know why she came?

466
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,380
Why?

467
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,439
She did the same thing you're doing now.

468
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:21,699
 When I saw her then, I suddenly understood her. 

469
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:27,100
No one could endure that kind of tragedy.
Anyone would break.

470
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,420
I'll talk to Jiang Qiao Xi about this.

471
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,979
Thinking of you getting married...
I can't bear to let go.

472
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:50,380
There, there.

473
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,439
Cherry, you're the best daughter in the world.

474
00:37:55,659 --> 00:37:58,960
And you're the best mom in the world.

475
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,820
So good I don't want to share you
with Jiang Qiao Xi.

476
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,760
What? Not sharing with me?

477
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,320
 Dear 16-year-old Lin Cherry,
I'm the 25-year-old Jiang Qiao Xi. 

478
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:25,159
 Sorry that this reply comes nine years late,
but I still hope you could receive it. 

479
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:28,019
 The delay might be fortunate. 

480
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:31,819
 Now I can tell you about our lives
over the past nine years. 

481
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:37,900
 Do you want to hear the ending first?
It's a happy one. 

482
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,980
 We're getting married soon. 

483
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:44,780
 Now we share the same parents,
live in the same house, 

484
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,319
 eat the same meals, and use the same shower gel. 

485
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,080
 Do you think you'd enjoy this life? 

486
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:59,100
 But the 16-year-old you
probably wouldn't overthink it. 

487
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,179
 During these nine years, in my loneliest moments, 

488
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:08,519
 I survived by imagining we were still together 

489
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:13,559
 and picturing us watching
Qun Shan's sunset glows got me through. 

490
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:17,900
 I imagined us experiencing everything together. 

491
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,979
 That's how I kept believing in a brighter future. 

492
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:34,159
 When I first left Qun Shan and couldn't reach you,
I pretended I was still by your side. 

493
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:39,440
 I'd save chocolates from the teacher for you,
bring your favorite peanut milk, 

494
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,280
 and watch sunsets with you and Chun Lu. 

495
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:58,619
Cherry, remember sitting here
watching Harry Potter as kids?

496
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:03,860
That's not true! You never watched it back then.

497
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,119
I always had to tell you the stories.

498
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:10,820
And we never watched it on a mountaintop.
Are you misremembering?

499
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,720
We definitely did. You just didn't realize.

500
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,360
 In middle school,
I fantasized that we never parted. 

501
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:26,019
 That we were attending school together
and reading Harry Potter. 

502
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:34,059
 But Cherry, now I don't need fantasies. 

503
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:37,419
 Right now, you're truly here with me. 

504
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,000
 Today's sunset is beautiful. 

505
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,760
 I wish I could give it to you to carry around, 

506
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,620
 like how you gave me the amber you always wore. 

507
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,460
 But how? Cherry, I can't give you sunsets. 

508
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:04,039
 And I'm greedier.
I want to have date buns made by you. 

509
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:09,980
 Do you think the nine-years-later you
will make them for me? 

510
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:15,560
 I think she'll agree. 

511
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:21,200
 Sincerely, Jiang Qiao Xi,
while watching the sunset with you. 

512
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:05,260
You've grown so much.
Today, you're becoming a bride.

513
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:19,519
Yes, I'm getting married.
Is this how you imagined it?

514
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,579
I never pictured myself in a wedding dress.

515
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:26,320
I never really thought about growing up either.

516
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,080
Are you happy with how you turned out?

517
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,860
Are you still fearless like before?

518
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,920
Of course.

519
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:44,320
Though sometimes adults
need to pretend to be cautious.

520
00:42:45,659 --> 00:42:49,180
Do you love the person you're marrying?

521
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:55,879
I couldn't love him more.

522
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,899
It's exactly who you're thinking of.

523
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,420
Well? Am I handsome?

524
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,319
Are you really me?

525
00:43:16,179 --> 00:43:18,199
Why can't I be you?

526
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:19,880
You laugh a lot now.

527
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,379
The real you loves to laugh.

528
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:29,039
The real you has been awakened.

529
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,519
Was it Cherry who woke you up?

530
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:38,139
Who else could it be?

531
00:43:38,139 --> 00:43:42,560
In fairytales, the ending is always
that the princess marries her prince

532
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,479
and lives happily ever after.

533
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:51,479
Then, the story ends, but is it true?

534
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,840
Will they stay happy forever after?

535
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:03,100
Are you asking whether Jiang Qiao Xi
and I will stay like this?

536
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:11,459
Long-lasting happiness was never easy to maintain.

537
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:18,159
We'll definitely face challenges ahead.

538
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:22,339
There'll be stormy days with wind and rain.

539
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:28,319
But as long as we're together,

540
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:33,419
I'm not afraid of anything.

541
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:41,600
What I want most now is to stay by her side

542
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:49,320
and to keep Cherry as Cherry.

543
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,240
Then you must keep striving.

544
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,320
Don't worry. I will.

545
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,260
Then I'm pleased. Very pleased.

546
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,720
I like the grown-up you who fears nothing.

547
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,136

548

00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:20,899
Jiang Qiao Xi, look.

550
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,120
Why these shoes? Red shoes with a white dress?
Doesn't that mean you'll jump into a...

551
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,119
I want to jump!
