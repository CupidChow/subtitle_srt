1
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,560
Your phone.

2
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,400
Qin Yeyun?

3
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,600
Hello?

4
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,560
Are you sure?

5
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,660
- What is it?
- What does she want?

6
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,340
Qin Yeyun asked me

7
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,300
to help out with Yingtao and Jiang Qiaoxi.

8
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,460
This is probably

9
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,880
gonna be tricky.

10
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,000
Come on, we'll go with you.

11
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,039
If you can't handle it,
we've got your back.

12
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,660
Aren't you gonna ask what it's about?

13
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,860
If Yingtao and Jiang Qiaoxi need help,

14
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,160
it's obviously got to do with his mom.
What else could it be?

15
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Nailed it.

16
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,020
But honestly,

17
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,720
this isn't something
you two can help with.

18
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,700
Says who?

19
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,000
Strength in numbers.

20
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,420
Let's go. Stop wasting time.

21
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,620
You're really going, Yu Qiao?

22
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,500
Why wouldn't I?

23
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,840
Yingtao grew up with us.

24
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,120
Of course I'm going. Come on.

25
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,560
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi!</i>

26
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,980
JIALIN NO. 1 EXPERIMENTAL HIGH SCHOOL

27
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,460
Hi, Auntie Liang.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,840
So

29
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,340
Ms. He said there's something

30
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,500
she needs to pass to Qiaoxi.

31
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,300
Did she say what it was?

32
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,300
Just…

33
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,360
some study materials, I think.

34
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,800
Materials for what?

35
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,580
Materials for…

36
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,480
for…

37
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,140
the competition?

38
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,360
- Something like that.
- Let me call and check.

39
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,780
Hello.

40
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,140
You must be kidding.

41
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,020
I'm on my way.

42
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,220
Zhang, go with him to get the materials.

43
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,340
Then take him to the camp.

44
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,440
Got it.

45
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,860
<i>Go with what I said earlier.</i>

46
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,240
- You're not coming with us?
- Use the…

47
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,440
Use the ratio I mentioned.

48
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,880
Let's go.

49
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,700
NO LITTERING, NO YELLING

50
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
Good news is, Jiang Qiaoxi's mom left.

51
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,300
Bad news is,
she left her driver to keep watch.

52
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,640
What…

53
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,680
So we need a new plan.

54
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,940
It's fine.

55
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,260
I'll distract him.

56
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,260
When I give the signal,
hand Jiang Qiaoxi the stuff.

57
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,840
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi,</i>

58
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,620
I thought you already left with your mom.

59
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,180
Right. Ms. He,

60
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,600
I think I forgot some materials.

61
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,900
Cen Xiaoman already
packed everything for you.

62
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,380
<i>Really thorough.</i>

63
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,260
<i>There's nothing else.</i>

64
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,800
<i>That's a bit of an extreme take,</i>
<i>don't you think, Ms. He?</i>

65
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,980
Maybe something slipped through.

66
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,880
What are you going on about?

67
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
I helped Cen Xiaoman pack it all too.

68
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,020
Qiaoxi,

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,860
you have class later, right?

70
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,160
<i>Your mom asked me</i>

71
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,320
<i>to drop you off on time.</i>

72
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,460
<i>- Right.</i>
<i>- Cai Fangyuan,</i>

73
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,840
what's with the winking?

74
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,560
Ms. He, he's just worried

75
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,960
something got left behind.

76
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,000
Well, if nothing is missing,

77
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,200
- I'll head out then.
- Alright.

78
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,400
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>

79
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,420
Good luck with the competition.

80
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,780
Thanks, Ms. He.

81
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,860
Come on.

82
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,120
Jiang Qiaoxi?

83
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,140
Thought he had left with Auntie Liang.

84
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,360
Who's that with him now?

85
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,460
The Qunshan kids.

86
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,040
Aren't they supposed to
eat in the canteen?

87
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,920
What are they doing?

88
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,060
Qiaoxi,

89
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
I'm grabbing some noodles
across the street.

90
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,540
<i>You can wait in or out of the car.</i>

91
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,440
<i>I'll be back in half an hour tops.</i>

92
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,320
<i>Keep track of the time.</i>

93
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,000
<i>Thanks, Uncle.</i>

94
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,560
Like it?

95
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,760
Try some too.

96
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,720
No, it's all yours.

97
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,260
I just wanna eat with you.

98
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,940
Then I'll have a bite.

99
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,680
Jiang Qiaoxi,

100
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,540
do you ever feel lonely

101
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,540
when you're by yourself?

102
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,220
No.

103
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,900
Being alone doesn't make me

104
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,800
feel lonely.

105
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,900
Then what does?

106
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,180
Meeting you.

107
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,500
Me?

108
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,200
Before I was ten,

109
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,120
I was always alone.

110
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,280
But I had math.
As long as I solved problems,

111
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,500
I didn't feel it.

112
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,360
Then I met you.

113
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,280
Even math couldn't help

114
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,480
with loneliness anymore.

115
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,720
Then maybe

116
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,920
your problems weren't hard enough.

117
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,280
Exactly.

118
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,360
I need one that's tougher than you

119
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,880
to really challenge me.

120
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,320
What do you mean?

121
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,660
So

122
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,160
how's everything going at school?

123
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,120
I'm doing okay with most stuff.

124
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,340
But

125
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,880
physics is killing me.

126
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,320
Why are you so good at solving problems?

127
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,060
That's nothing.

128
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,360
I just plug in the formulas.

129
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,300
You're the amazing one.

130
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,740
You don't even need formulas
to crack the hardest questions.

131
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,760
You think I'm amazing?

132
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,420
Hey,

133
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,160
if I'm so amazing,
why wouldn't you look at me

134
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,300
back in the office?

135
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,760
You didn't look at me either.

136
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,460
That's because…

137
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,440
Because what?

138
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,640
You first. Why didn't you look?

139
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,880
Because…

140
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,280
today you looked like a grown woman.

141
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,940
Want some water?

142
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,460
Nah, I'm good.

143
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,480
Took me years

144
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,140
and so much effort

145
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,120
to sit down for a meal

146
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,100
with Lin Yingtao. I'm taking my chances

147
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,280
and eat more.

148
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,100
We'll definitely

149
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,000
have lots more meals
together in the future.

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,340
You, me,

151
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,400
Qin Yeyun,

152
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,140
Yu Qiao, Du Shang and Cai Fangyuan.

153
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,360
We'll share plenty of meals,

154
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,720
eat our way through the whole city,

155
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,360
through every province and every region.

156
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,720
But I don't care about fancy food.

157
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,260
I just want

158
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,440
Auntie Juan's home cooking.

159
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,680
Like when we were little.

160
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,220
Then you better chip in for groceries
like you did back then.

161
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,540
Deal.

162
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,960
Let me earn it first.

163
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,740
What is it about Lin Qile?

164
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,020
Why would Jiang Qiaoxi sneak off

165
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,980
to meet her in some alley?

166
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,400
Hanging out with someone like her

167
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,300
is ruining his future.

168
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,420
It's not that deep.

169
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,420
They were close

170
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,880
when they were little.

171
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,880
Old habit sticks.

172
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,920
It doesn't mean anything.
I'm not bothered.

173
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,300
Are you saying that to me

174
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,400
or to yourself?

175
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,280
Xiaoman, stop pretending.

176
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,780
I have no idea

177
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,040
what you're talking about.

178
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,600
You know exactly what's going on.

179
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,940
Jiang Qiaoxi treats Lin Qile

180
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,280
differently than he treats us.

181
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,700
So what?

182
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,340
It's temporary.

183
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,380
He's the best, top of the class.

184
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,140
If I also keep being the best,
he'll figure it out.

185
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,540
You really think this is

186
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,000
about who is the best?

187
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,560
You're the best. He's the best.

188
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,800
So you are the best couple?

189
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,180
Even if that doesn't matter,

190
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,500
we knew Jiang Qiaoxi first.

191
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
I knew Jiang Qiaoxi first!

192
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,360
Okay, calm down.

193
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,640
I have an idea.

194
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,600
What if we tell Auntie Liang about this?

195
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,860
Didn't she ask us

196
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,420
to keep an eye on him?

197
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,860
We're helping him find his way back.

198
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,700
This is my business. I'll handle it.

199
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,360
No need to get her involved.

200
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,020
- Hand it in once you're done.
- Got it, Ms. He.

201
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,340
Hi, Ms. He.

202
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,300
Xiaoman, come here.

203
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,920
Your leading the cheer squad

204
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,240
is great today.

205
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,540
That performance is outstanding.

206
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,440
Thank you, Ms. He.

207
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,440
I still have a lot to improve.

208
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,800
Don't be so modest.

209
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,560
You've got real leadership.

210
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,900
Lin Qile knew little about dances

211
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,840
but she performed well.

212
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,040
Your coach kept praising both of you.

213
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,960
You two really made the class proud.

214
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,540
Ms. He,

215
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,880
not just cheerleading,

216
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,100
I'll keep working hard

217
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,480
in my studies. I want to bring honor

218
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,640
to our class both ways.

219
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,900
Good girl.

220
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,880
This whole cheer squad experience
brought you

221
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,000
and Lin Qile closer.

222
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,140
Help her more with school, okay?

223
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,160
She's not dumb. She works hard.

224
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,040
She just needs time to catch up.

225
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,140
Try guiding her along.

226
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,480
We can't let a kid like that

227
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,480
actually get kicked out of Class 18.

228
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,520
Don't worry, Ms. He.

229
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,520
I'll make sure to help Lin Qile.

230
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,860
- Goodbye, Ms. He.
- Take care.

231
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,980
You were right.

232
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,540
We should help Jiang Qiaoxi.

233
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,820
Make sure he finds his way back.

234
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,280
Okay, I'll call Auntie Liang now.

235
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,240
No need.

236
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,280
This

237
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,800
isn't just about her knowing.

238
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,580
Yu Qiao, why so quiet?

239
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,500
Nothing.

240
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,060
Why aren't you talking?

241
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,560
Lin Yingtao and Jiang Qiaoxi
are way too much.

242
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,760
They're off sneaking a meal.

243
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,740
Like you haven't had jujube buns before.

244
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,840
You've been training too much.
Your brain's gone mush.

245
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,920
You seriously think

246
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,780
they're just eating buns together?

247
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,340
Obviously not.

248
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,680
They also have stuffed lotus root.

249
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,280
All those teen romance novels,
and that's all you've learned?

250
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,540
Yu Qiao,

251
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,740
didn't Feng Letian say

252
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,940
he'd lend you <i>Zhu Xian</i>?

253
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,660
Huang Zhanjie took it.

254
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,280
Huang Zhanjie said you wouldn't care.

255
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,960
I wouldn't care?

256
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,380
Who told him that?

257
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,760
Okay…

258
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,280
Even if we tried getting it back,
no chance.

259
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,420
He's at the Seven Sects Tournament part.

260
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,420
It's intense. He won't put it down.

261
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,100
Do I look that generous

262
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,740
for he to just take it?

263
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,340
What happened to taking turns?

264
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,780
There's no such thing as fair turns.

265
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,360
Things that are meant for yours

266
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,260
will skip the lines and land in your lap.

267
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,780
If it's not for you,

268
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,120
you could fight all you want,

269
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,060
and still lose out.

270
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,900
Qin Yeyun,

271
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,080
say that again.

272
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,520
I'm writing that down for Feng Letian.

273
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
He needs it in his novel.

274
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,040
Out of the way.

275
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,860
Look who's here. Jia Sisi and Hu Yan.

276
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,260
Those two megaphones.
What are they doing here?

277
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,160
Their mouths leak like colanders.

278
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,080
Everything leaks out.

279
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,860
If they catch wind of…

280
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,360
You two.

281
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,340
What are you doing here?

282
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,040
What are you doing here?

283
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,920
Come on, it's a basketball court.

284
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,140
And you two?

285
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,820
Off chasing some juicy gossip again?

286
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,480
Just taking a stroll.

287
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,800
Wandering, you know.

288
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,100
Not just walking around.

289
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,380
Yu Qiao,

290
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,680
we heard what's going on.

291
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,600
Jiang Qiaoxi and Lin Qile

292
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,760
are alone there.

293
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,180
Are you serious?

294
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,200
Where did you hear that?

295
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,200
That's not important.

296
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,980
- Go play your basketball.
- Is that true?

297
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,120
Who told you? Can you trust them?

298
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,720
Can't say.

299
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,980
But the information is solid.

300
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,800
If you don't believe us,

301
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,160
come see for yourself.

302
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,540
Yu Qiao,

303
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,980
I'd think twice.

304
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,420
We're classmates. We don't want to
see you get hurt. Let's go.

305
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,060
From here

306
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,120
to the car,

307
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,900
we've got maybe one minute left.

308
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,820
What can we do for one minute?

309
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,660
We're so silly.

310
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,839
Why are we so hung up on a single minute?

311
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,160
We were lucky today.

312
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,100
I pulled off something huge.

313
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,300
And we got to

314
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,820
eat together.

315
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,760
That should be enough.

316
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,020
But it's not.

317
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,980
Yingtao,

318
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,220
don't settle either.

319
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,500
We shouldn't stop here.

320
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,020
Hello?

321
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,720
What's wrong?

322
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,680
Come here.

323
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,560
Where are you going?

324
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,140
What's going on?

325
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,660
Jia Sisi, Hu Yan,

326
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,480
you know

327
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,540
why people

328
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,800
love talking about others?

329
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,200
What are you implying?

330
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,680
Because

331
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,920
when they talk about themselves,

332
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,800
nobody listens.

333
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,420
Yu Qiao, that was unexpectedly wise.

334
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,440
Awesome.

335
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,920
Feng Letian really missed out.

336
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,720
He could've used that
for one of his novels.

337
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,080
Yu Qiao, what's with the snide remarks?

338
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,540
Why do you always talk
like you're throwing punches?

339
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,840
If you're mad at someone else,

340
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,020
don't take it out on us.

341
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,820
Relax. I never said it was about you.

342
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,800
Jia Sisi and Hu Yan are coming.

343
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,720
Jia Sisi?

344
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,900
Why climbing the wall?

345
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,300
- Just trust me.
- Okay, let me help you up.

346
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,580
Let's go.

347
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,460
Jia Sisi,

348
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,200
when will you release

349
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,600
new chapter for your comic?

350
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,420
What comic?

351
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,540
The one like <i>Boys Over Flowers</i>,

352
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,260
a bunch of boys chasing one girl.

353
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,340
Sisi, you draw that stuff?

354
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,380
How come you never told me?

355
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,640
How do you know about that?

356
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,580
Going through my stuff?

357
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,900
Please, I'm not that bored.

358
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,800
Wu Shuang from your old school

359
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,040
is on my cheer squad.

360
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,300
She let me read it after you showed her.

361
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,400
We thought it was good.

362
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,680
Interesting story.

363
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,160
Really?

364
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,440
I just

365
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,800
doodled it for fun.

366
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,620
Come on, hurry up.

367
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,720
Careful. Get up there first.

368
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,640
Hold on, I'll help you.

369
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,300
It's really high.

370
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,000
I'll go down first. Don't move.

371
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,880
Okay.

372
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,200
Even if it's just a doodle,

373
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,840
it's still your story.

374
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,860
Instead of chasing

375
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,980
someone else's drama,

376
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,240
maybe focus on your own.

377
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,120
Your story is worth telling too.

378
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,020
Alright.

379
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,640
Hey, Qin Yeyun,

380
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,600
you used to

381
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,040
look down your nose at everyone.

382
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,540
Since when did you get so good

383
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,420
with words?

384
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,140
I get it now.

385
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,300
Sisi, don't listen to them.

386
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,700
They're all from Qishan,

387
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,240
all friends with Lin Qile.

388
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,900
With how loud they're being,

389
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,780
they're clearly stalling.

390
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,660
Let's go.

391
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,540
- Come on.
- I got you.

392
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,260
Here.

393
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,640
I'm fine.

394
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,800
I can do it.

395
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,180
Dog!

396
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,060
Don't run!

397
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,940
Jiang Qiaoxi!

398
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,420
Stop! Put me down!

399
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,300
Put me down!

400
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,200
Stop running!

401
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,100
<i>Let's go down there.</i>

402
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,460
No one's here.

403
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,420
No one.

404
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,220
Stop chasing me! Please!

405
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,860
You okay?

406
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,580
Sorry. We're fine.

407
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,420
Come on, get up.

408
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,520
I'm fine.

409
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,840
- Did you get hurt?
- You okay?

410
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,660
No. You broke the fall.

411
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,380
You're alright, yeah?

412
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,000
What's wrong?

413
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,620
Blood! You're bleeding!

414
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,520
You're bleeding!

415
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,760
You're bleeding!

416
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,240
Yingtao!

417
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,900
To the hospital.

418
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,020
EMERGENCY TREATMENT

419
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:59,800
EMERGENCY IMAGING OFFICE

420
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,040
CT & X-RAY DEPT

421
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,000
Yingtao, you're not back at school yet?

422
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,700
Uncle, I'm really sorry.

423
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,840
I didn't mean to cause all this trouble.

424
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,880
- I'm really, really sorry.
- You've been apologizing nonstop.

425
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,040
He's still being examined.

426
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,180
Let's wait for the results.

427
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
<i>Zhang.</i>

428
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,220
Mr. Jiang.

429
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,880
<i>How's Qiaoxi?</i>

430
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,020
<i>Still inside.</i>

431
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,700
<i>- In the scan room?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

432
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,940
<i>- I'll go check.</i>
<i>- Alright.</i>

433
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,940
Yingtao?

434
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,660
What are you doing here?

435
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,680
Uncle Jiang,

436
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,880
I…

437
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,820
Jiang Qiaoxi, he…

438
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,800
he got hit by a scooter

439
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,800
trying to protect me.

440
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,060
It's alright.

441
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,960
Don't cry.

442
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,840
I'm sorry.

443
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,240
I'll go in and check on him. Don't worry.

444
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,020
Let your passion burn bright.

445
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,020
Let this strength

446
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,300
carry you forward.

447
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,880
<i>Every lesson</i>

448
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,780
<i>is a test of your limits.</i>

449
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,160
Yingtao.

450
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,660
- How is he?
- <i>Let youth</i>

451
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,600
<i>bloom on the 30th.</i>

452
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,300
How is Jiang Qiaoxi? Is he alright?

453
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,920
He's alright.

454
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,760
Just lost a lot of blood. Needs stitches.

455
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,920
Jia Sisi said

456
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,480
Cen Xiaoman and Fei Lingge
told her and Hu Yan

457
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,780
that you guys were in the alley.

458
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,980
I figured.

459
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,060
I'm going back to class.

460
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,920
Yingtao.

461
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,080
Cen Xiaoman is crying in class.

462
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,380
Jiang Qiaoxi got hurt,

463
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,660
and she's devastated.

464
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,300
Thinks it's all because of you.

465
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,420
Once you're back,

466
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,140
if she and the other girls come at you…

467
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,760
I'm not scared.

468
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,160
Not of that.

469
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,600
Not of them.

470
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,000
They should be scared of me.

471
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,020
Scared I'll come for them.

472
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,200
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

473
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,460
<i>Your mom already got</i>

474
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,300
the scooter driver's number from Zhang.

475
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,340
She knows exactly

476
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,640
how and where

477
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,660
the accident happened.

478
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,380
She knows everything now.

479
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,480
Qiaoxi,

480
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,580
right now,

481
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,220
you should focus on studies.

482
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,740
Dad,

483
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,740
how can you brush me off even now?

484
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,140
Please help me.

485
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,160
Or better yet…

486
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,320
help this family for once.

487
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,540
Mom said

488
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,900
if I keep seeing Lin Yingtao,

489
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,440
she'll transfer Uncle Lin
to a site in Fujian.

490
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,180
Dad,

491
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,920
you know better than anyone what it's like
for a whole family

492
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,980
to end up in a place
where everything is unfamiliar.

493
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,200
If she really goes through with it,

494
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,940
I'll fight back.

495
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,880
Fight back?

496
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,020
How?

497
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,040
I'll report her.

498
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,500
Abuse of power.

499
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,880
You're her son.

500
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,460
Why does it have to get this far?

501
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,860
Why?

502
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,780
Dad,

503
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,960
if it's come to this between me and Mom,

504
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,100
don't you think
you have some responsibility?

505
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,760
All these years,

506
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,140
every time we fought,

507
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,760
you disappeared like a ghost.

508
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,240
Ignored her feelings.

509
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,760
Ignored mine.

510
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,060
Once she gained total control

511
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,180
with victory over me,

512
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,060
you'd step in

513
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,880
with a few comments

514
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,020
and words of comfort.

515
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,080
Are you sure

516
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,320
you're part of this family?

517
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,140
All these years,

518
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,740
you never stepped into the storm.

519
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,760
The truth is,

520
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,960
I've always been in the storm.

521
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,300
And I never once got out.

522
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,320
Yes.

523
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,340
The storm you're in

524
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,680
is the non-stopped debate

525
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,580
between you two on who's fault it is
for the incident back than.

526
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,820
But what about now?

527
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm your kid too.

528
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,380
You're not some neutral bystander.

529
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,960
Do you really believe…

530
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,940
Do you really believe
what she's done to me is okay?

531
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,080
If it's not,

532
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,200
then step up.

533
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,680
Say something.

534
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,960
Do something.

535
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,840
Even just this once.

536
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,340
Cen Xiaoman

537
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,080
just got off the phone
with Jiang Qiaoxi's mom.

538
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,040
You think she made it up?

539
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,120
His mom said it herself

540
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,580
he needed stitches.

541
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,920
She was livid.

542
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,020
Seriously?

543
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,100
Is Jiang Qiaoxi trying
to throw his life away?

544
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,740
Lin Qile,

545
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,300
what did you do to Jiang Qiaoxi?

546
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,060
Qiaoxi.

547
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,200
Son.

548
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,900
Just tell me what you want.

549
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,220
Why should I tell you

550
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,900
what I did to Jiang Qiaoxi?

551
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,520
But I can tell you

552
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,600
what I am about to do to Jiang Qiaoxi.

553
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,960
I'm going to be good friends

554
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,580
with Jiang Qiaoxi.

555
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,180
I want to be good friend

556
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,980
with Lin Yingtao, open and aboveboard.

557
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,660
At school,

558
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,420
I'll eat with him

559
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,080
and the friends I choose.

560
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,780
We walk to class together.

561
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,940
We go home together.

562
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,360
Either by bus…

563
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,980
…or by bike.

564
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,880
And on weekends, if we have time…

565
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,000
We'll go hiking.

566
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,020
- Just like we used to.
- Just like we used to.

567
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,060
<i>Judging by the way she talks,</i>

568
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,360
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi and Lin Qile</i>

569
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,480
<i>must be really close.</i>

570
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,740
<i>Looks like it.</i>

571
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,940
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi got hurt, sure.</i>

572
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,100
<i>But he didn't seem to mind.</i>

573
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,120
<i>Exactly.</i>

574
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,520
Lin Qile,

575
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,300
do you even know
how much his mom hates you?

576
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,540
Yeah, I know.

577
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,320
But Jiang Qiaoxi doesn't.

578
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,900
I'm not trying to be friends with her.

579
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,460
You two aren't even in the same world.

580
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,340
Think whatever you want.

581
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,580
But just so you know,

582
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,900
your gossip

583
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,540
can't touch us anymore.

584
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,100
I really think

585
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,880
she's about to grow wings.

586
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,360
Says from the book.

587
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,520
If you try hard enough,

588
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,000
if you jump far enough,

589
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,420
wings will grow on your back.

590
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,160
And then…

591
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,860
Let me see.

592
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,440
The scan results are back.

593
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,660
No bleeding inside the skull.

594
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,300
Just a surface wound. Nothing major.

595
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,300
Does it hurt?

596
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,640
Not really.

597
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,820
You bled a lot

598
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,700
and needed stitches.

599
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,120
Of course it hurts.

600
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,960
You kids forget pain

601
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,420
as soon as it's gone.

602
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,740
But mothers never forget.
It stays with us forever.

603
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,340
Do you understand?

604
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,080
Take your meds.

605
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,440
The restrictions say

606
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,360
no fava beans, no fish,

607
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,880
nothing sour or cold for a day.

608
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,560
I know. The doctor already told me.

609
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,360
Then remember

610
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,760
restrictions are there to protect you.

611
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,700
Or you'll end up

612
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,520
with more than just a busted head.

613
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,720
This is nothing.

614
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,740
I'm fine.

615
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,540
I'm heading back to my room.

616
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,020
You're fine?

617
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,720
Then go pay the hospital bill.

618
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,980
You know what I'm talking about.

619
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,100
You are clearly aware.

620
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,260
Mom, you think I can't handle it?

621
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,020
I'm worried that you can't.

622
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,940
Let me tell you, Mom,

623
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,600
- if you do anything to the Lin…
- <i>Liang Hongfei.</i>

624
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,520
Look,

625
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,340
if you go after the Lin family,

626
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,239
I'll report you.

627
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,480
Abuse of power.

628
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,699
Jiang Zheng,

629
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,460
you've really grown
into your leadership role.

630
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,500
As a father though?
You've only gone backwards.

631
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,860
You failed to protect my Mengchu.

632
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,400
Now you're going to let Jiang Qiaoxi

633
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,840
crash and burn?

634
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,080
<i>I don't want to dig up the past.</i>

635
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,880
Right now, he just wants

636
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,159
to hang out with his friends,

637
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,199
to have a normal life.

638
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,380
<i>But in your mouth, it sounds</i>

639
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,760
<i>like he's throwing his life away.</i>

640
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,840
<i>What friends?</i>

641
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,520
Back when he was little,
he jumped off that ledge for her,

642
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,620
then limped

643
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,139
all the way back to Qunshan.

644
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,480
Now he's bleeding again

645
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,219
because of her.

646
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,560
What happens next?
You even thought about it?

647
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,120
<i>She's not a friend.</i>

648
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,300
<i>She's a walking disaster.</i>

649
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,940
<i>Liang Hongfei.</i>

650
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,660
<i>He ended up like this</i>
<i>because you pushed him too far.</i>

651
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,560
If we're talking about disasters,

652
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,060
it's you and me. We're the problem.

653
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,180
You don't deserve
to be the father of my kids.

654
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,720
If you and your dad
aren't willing to send the Lins away,

655
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
then I'll send you

656
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,100
to an international school

657
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,980
far away.

658
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,360
I'll go with you. We'll move.

659
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,540
I know getting me into a new school
is easy for you.

660
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,500
But

661
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,540
the Olympiad winter camp
is about to start.

662
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,660
If I transfer now,

663
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,440
it might mess with my studies.

664
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,860
Do you even realize what you're saying?

665
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,820
You're saying that for a girl?

666
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,420
You were chosen for Olympiad math.

667
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,780
No matter what happens,

668
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,540
your choice should
always be math, not her.

669
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,060
This isn't about choosing her.

670
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,120
If I had to choose,

671
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,620
I'd still choose myself.

672
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,140
My life. What I want.

673
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,480
And why do you

674
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,820
get to choose so freely,

675
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,940
but I don't?

676
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,380
What about my life?

677
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,460
Mom…

678
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,700
Why does your life

679
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,340
have to be built on mine?

680
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,960
I'm sorry, Mom.

681
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,460
But I'm going to

682
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,560
win that trophy for Jiang Mengchu.

683
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,080
Can I study now?

684
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,140
So now you're using your brother
to push me?

685
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,260
No.

686
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,400
It is you who used him to push me

687
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,780
this whole time.

688
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,220
- Mrs. Liang, have some water.
- No need.

689
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,800
I came without warning

690
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,940
and I'm sorry to disturb you.

691
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,700
But as a mother,

692
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,820
I hope you can understand.

693
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,840
Did something happen, Mrs. Liang?

694
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,660
I was in a meeting this afternoon

695
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,700
when my driver called.

696
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,500
Jiang Qiaoxi got hit by a scooter.

697
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,220
He hit his head.

698
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,600
Got several stitches.

699
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,580
Is Qiaoxi okay now?

700
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,300
Yingtao.

701
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,620
I heard you were with him
when it happened.

702
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,660
As his mother,

703
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,760
with his injuries,

704
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,700
I think I deserve to know

705
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,720
what really happened.

706
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,480
Yingtao, just tell us.

707
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,820
Let us know

708
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,180
what happened exactly.

709
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,120
I'm sorry, Auntie Liang.

710
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,920
Jiang Qiaoxi got hurt
trying to protect me.

711
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,160
Yingtao.

712
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,280
Mrs. Liang, we're truly sorry.

713
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,140
We'll cover the medical expenses.

714
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,140
If there's anything else we need to do…

715
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,700
It's not about the money.

716
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,200
I just want to understand
the whole situation.

717
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,420
Yingtao,

718
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,480
my driver was supposed to

719
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,240
take Qiaoxi to Olympiad training camp

720
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,460
this afternoon.

721
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,980
Why was he with you instead?

722
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,400
Why did he get hurt protecting you?

723
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,660
Say something.

724
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,620
We were in an alley.

725
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,920
I brought him food.

726
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,560
Some classmates were about to come,

727
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,560
so we hid.

728
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,800
That's when the accident happened.

729
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,200
Why were you hiding from them?

730
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,180
- Didn't want them to get the wrong idea.
- What kind of idea?

731
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,160
Auntie Liang,

732
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,800
Jiang Qiaoxi and I

733
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,620
weren't doing anything wrong.

734
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,940
We're just friends.

735
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,020
Yingtao,

736
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
relax.

737
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,940
I'm not blaming you.

738
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,220
You're still young. You don't know better.

739
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,380
Shengjuan,

740
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,560
last time things got messy.

741
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,940
And now

742
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,840
another accident?

743
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,800
Mrs. Liang,

744
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,560
I'm sorry we caused trouble.

745
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,600
I'm not worried about Jiang Qiaoxi.

746
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,280
He's a boy.

747
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,780
At school,

748
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,500
he is popular with the girls.

749
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,780
I get that Yingtao might want

750
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,080
to spend time with him.

751
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,360
But she's a girl.

752
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,620
And I don't want people talking about her

753
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,260
behind her back just because of him.

754
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,900
Auntie Liang,

755
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,380
it has nothing to do with gender.

756
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,780
And me being friends with him has nothing

757
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,300
to do with how popular he is.

758
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,440
Yingtao.

759
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,580
She's a bit too blunt.

760
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,300
Kids are kids.

761
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,680
It's fine.

762
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,720
I'll head out now.

763
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,760
Sorry again, Mrs. Liang.

764
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,680
Shengjuan…

765
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,940
They're still young.

766
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,000
They don't know the boundaries.

767
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,840
But as parents,

768
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,240
we need to help them see it.

769
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,600
Otherwise all the gossip

770
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,560
won't just land on them.

771
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,760
<i>It'll land on us too.</i>

772
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,400
Sound fine

773
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,540
if it was called spoiling.

774
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,940
But instigation

775
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,140
is another.

776
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,960
Take care, Mrs. Liang.

777
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,560
She can't talk down
to you and Dad like that.

778
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,860
It's fine.

779
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,860
Qiaoxi got hurt,

780
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,760
and she just panicked.

781
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,260
That's why she said those things.

782
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,200
