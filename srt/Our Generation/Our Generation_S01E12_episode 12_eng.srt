4
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:48,219
Thank you, Madam. Goodbye, Madam.

5
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,520
Congratulations, Lin Cherry.

6
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,579
You used to be the last one kept after class.

7
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:57,120
This time you're the second-to-last one out.

8
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,799
Your progress is a quantum leap!

9
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,060
Your improvement is making me nervous.

10
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,640
If you become third-to-last next time, does that count as my regression?

11
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,859
Those big eyes of yours are wasted!

12
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:09,439
Didn't you see when I handed in my paper?

13
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,900
I wasn't late. I was asking the teacher questions.

14
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,259
What's that look for?

15
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:18,360
What? Finally understood physics?

16
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,379
Jiang Qiao Xi taught me a method.

17
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,379
He said when solving problems,
if you don't know the answer,

18
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,680
ask why the question is phrased that way.

19
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,199
Using this approach,

20
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,680
I suddenly realized all physics problems
are fundamentally similar.

21
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,879
Lin Cherry, you've unlocked your meridians!

22
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,439
This is making me nervous to hear.

23
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,679
Forget surpassing Cai Fang Yuan,
you'll overtake me.

24
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:43,039
Are you aiming for the physics Olympiad team now?

25
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,999
Not really. She's already 17.

26
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,659
Too old for genius programs.

27
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:49,539
Cherry, don't feel bad about it.

28
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:52,060
Stop teasing me. You two never say anything nice.

29
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,719
Let's hurry. Today's a big day
for our Qun Shan squad.

30
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:59,439
Wonder if Qin Ye Yun and Du Shang
got the fireworks.

31
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,420
- Slow down! Careful!
- I'm fine, Dad.

32
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,859
- Yun.
- Watch your back!

33
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,240
Shuang Yan,

34
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,690
they're completely serious about this.

35
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:14,740
Listen, I've thought this through.

36
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,900
Having you here would really help me.

37
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,919
- Mr. Qin...
- Yun has discussed this with Du Shang.

38
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,740
Du Shang fully supports this idea.

39
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,080
He's a filial boy.

40
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,379
He doesn't want his mom working outdoors,
chased by city officers.

41
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,940
You can run your business safely here.

42
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,159
Mr. Qin, how about this?

43
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,340
I'll give you 20% of my fried skewer earnings

44
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,800
as stall rent, is that okay?

45
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,099
No.

46
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,819
Do you know current shop rental prices?

47
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:50,139
20% is already too low.

48
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:53,190
Let's do this.

49
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,260
There is something
called job probation periods.

50
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,319
You try selling here for one month first.

51
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,120
We'll discuss terms after that.

52
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,500
Alright then.

53
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:10,839
Yun, Du Shang.

54
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:13,680
Do you want to have
a nice dinner tonight? Let's eat out.

55
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,279
To celebrate our joint business venture.

56
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,139
No need to spend money outside.
Let's eat at home. I'll cook.

57
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:23,479
Mom, we're going to the beach tonight.
Let's do it another day.

58
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:26,120
Looks like we'll get to enjoy
Ms. Cao's cooking often now.

59
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,560
Ms. Cao, that sour-spicy fern root noodles
you made last time were amazing.

60
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,679
Can you make it again tomorrow?

61
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:31,960
No problem.

62
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,499
Qin Ye Yun, I'm entrusting you with first dibs
on menu choices in our house from now on.

63
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,000
Let go.

64
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:48,180
Mr. Qin, give me a pack of Zhonghua cigarettes
and a Want Want snack bundle.

65
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,699
Don't just stand there. I want
soft-pack Zhonghua. Keep the change.

66
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,539
Shuang Yan.

67
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,040
Son.

68
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,000
Cao Shuang Yan, what do you mean by this?

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,220
How could you do this?

70
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,319
I've been exhausted in working
and finally came back.

71
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,759
- The pork knuckles aren't even tenderized!
- Enough.

72
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,119
You deliberately don't want me to come back.

73
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:51,299
Hello? Cherry.

74
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:55,760
Jiang Qiao Xi, we need to cancel tonight's plans.

75

76
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:11,939
How is it?

77
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,980
- Du Shang.
- Open the door!

78
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,899
- Du Shang! Open the door already!
- Du Shang!

79
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:23,499
Who is it?

80
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,480
You kids... What's going on, Cherry?

81
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:38,200
We're here to see Du Shang.

82
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,339
- Coming.
- Cherry.

83
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:40,640
You're here.

84
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,340
Are you okay?

85
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,079
I'm fine. Just cooking with my dad, see?

86
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,919
Son. Cherry, perfect timing. You're all here.

87
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,820
Ms. Cao and I made a whole table of dishes.

88
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,580
You haven't eaten yet, right?
Come on in, let's eat together.

89
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,719
- No need.
- No thanks.

90
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,279
We've already eaten.

91
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,800
No need to be polite with me.

92
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,959
I feel Mr. Du has changed a lot,
even his personality.

93
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,879
Seems like it. That means Du Shang
probably won't get beaten anymore.

94
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,360
Wait for me.

95
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,580
How are you? Really nothing's wrong?

96
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,679
Everything's fine. I bought fireworks.
You can go to the beach.

97
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:35,339
It's okay. We'll go together when you're free.

98
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:38,319
Just have dinner with your parents tonight.

99
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,519
Aren't you attending that winter camp?

100
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,679
When we return, the weather will be
even colder. How will we go then?

101
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:45,579
It's not like we'll only experience one winter.

102
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:49,700
Besides, I've prepared more
than just fireworks for everyone.

103
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,339
Go ahead.

104
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,700
Well, I'm going.

105
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,519
- You chap.
- Bye.

106
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,319
Bye.

107
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,320
Alright, stop worrying. Let's go.

108
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,920
Let's go.

109
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:29,020
 ♫ Love is in your eyes ♫

 ♫ Flying over that sea ♫ 

115
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,940
- Good morning!
- Morning.

116
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,020
- Morning.
- Where's Jiang Qiao Xi?

117
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,460
He hasn't arrived yet.

118
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,680
Morning, I'm here!

119
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,959
- Morning.
- Jiang Qiao Xi, slow down!

120
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,519
Sorry to keep you waiting.

121
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,740
Aren't you supposed to compete?
Why are you coming to school with us?

122
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,000
You even specially reminded us to bike together.

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,900
Before the competition, what I want most
is to go to school with you guys.

124
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,220
What's that you're holding?

125
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:23,700
Cherry told me if I want to officially rejoin
the Qun Shan squad,

126
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,720
I have to warm your hearts a bit.

127
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,140
So you chose the simplest method, gifts.

128
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,259
Exactly.

129
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:33,740
I've prepared gifts.
Not sure if you'll dare accept them.

130
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,344
After saying that, how could we dare
not accept what you dare give?

131
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,959
One scarf each that I knitted.
Qiao Xi Brand scarves.

132
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,700
- You knitted this yourself?
- Of course.

133
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,940
You can even knit scarves? Impressive!

134
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,900
It's not hard. Just applying
some mathematical formulas.

135
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,559
I spent extra time knitting patterns into yours.

136
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:01,640
Never mind. Jiang Qiao Xi sees math in everything.

137
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,000
The image of Jiang Qiao Xi
knitting scarves feels so surreal.

138
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,224
Stop! Now I can't unsee it.

139
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:11,480

 ♫ I gaze at the sea ♫ 

141

 ♫ But hear the sound Of the surging dreams ♫ 

142
00:10:21,408 --> 00:10:24,376
 ♫ Breaking through the darkness ♫ 

143

00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,412

 ♫ I want you to see ♫ 

148
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:42,460
 ♫ The shining light within me ♫ 

149
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:47,200
Actually, I get pretty bored
when I can't hang out with you.

150
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,179
Have to find things to do by myself.

151
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:51,759
Not just scarves, I could knit sweaters too.

152
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:54,510
Jiang Qiao Xi, let's skip sweaters.

153
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,710
These scarves are trouble enough.

154
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,019
Why are the scarves red?

155
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:01,680
I like red.

156
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,759
We all thought you liked black the most.

157
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,639
Black wasn't my choice, but red is.

158
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,500
But this is way too red, like a traffic light.

159
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,619
I've never worn anything this red before.

160
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:19,059
You're all complaining, but red's perfectly fine!

161
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:21,639
Red symbolizes the sun, hope and warmth.

162
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,600
I actually like it. I'll keep it.

163
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,159
Thank you, Jiang Qiao Xi.

164
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,399
Keep it if you want. I don't deserve this.

165
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,919
Jiang Qiao Xi, you're so stylish.
How did you knit such a lame scarf?

166
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,516
Who's lame? You're lame! Put it on!

167
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:40,640
 ♫ Like white wildflowers on morning paths ♫ 

168
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,959
 ♫ Fragrance ♫ 

169
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:43,888
Du Shang, hurry up!

170
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:46,740
 ♫ Breaking through the darkness ♫ 

171
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,680
 ♫ Extraordinary power ♫ 

172
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,776
 ♫ My dream ♫ 

173
00:11:53,776 --> 00:11:57,528
 ♫ I must set it free ♫ 

174
00:11:57,528 --> 00:11:58,736
 ♫ I want ♫ 

175
00:11:58,736 --> 00:12:01,620
 ♫ I want you to see ♫ 

176
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,020
- That's... 
 - Jiang Qiao Xi?

177
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,879
Why is he here?

178
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,000
Ms. He.

179
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,399
Other competitors left already.
Why come to school today?

180
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,100
I just wanted to attend more classes here.

181
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,239
I've informed Olympiad Ms. Peng.
I'll go take the exam directly tomorrow.

182
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:22,200
Why are you all wearing red scarves?

183
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,659
Ms. He, we're wearing red for good luck
on Jiang Qiao Xi's exam.

184
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:28,159
Yeah, Madam.

185
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,039
Alright, get to class now.

186
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,780
Okay, we are leaving.

187
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,200
- Goodbye, Madam.
- Goodbye, Madam.

188
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,800
Goodbye, Madam.

189
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,299
Shouldn't Jiang Qiao Xi be preparing
for the competition?

190
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:08,640
Why's he hanging with them doing childish stuff?

191
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,679
That's not Jiang Qiao Xi.

192
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:31,380
Isn't that Jiang Qiao Xi?

193
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:35,300
Who else could it be with that height?

194
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,780
I told you, that's not Jiang Qiao Xi.

195
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,059
He's never smiled that brightly before.

196
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,559
How dare he smile so happily?

197
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,659
These chicken legs are amazing today. So good!

198
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:57,400
Cherry,

199
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,770
can you grace me
with some stuffed lotus root?

200
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,200
You still have room?

201
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,260
Not now. For the winter camp trip.

202
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,530
text

203
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,860
Fine. I'll ask my mom to fry some tonight.

204
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,520
I want pig trotters.

205
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,420
I want date buns.

206
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,500
Not happening.

207
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,300
- Why, Lin Cherry?
- Yeah, why is that?

208
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,840
- It's been a while.
- Yeah.

209
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,520
They have to be made one by one.

210
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,919
If she finishes all in one night,
my mom will be exhausted.

211
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,720
Exactly! Her mom can't handle it all.
We should queue.

212
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,019
Jiang Qiao Xi.

213
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:31,619
- So my stuffed lotus root is first. 
 - Mine is the second.

214
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:33,120
- Mine, the third.
- Guess mine is the fourth then.

215
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,920
Jiang Qiao Xi.

216
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,199
- Qiao Xi's mom. 
 - Hong Fei!

217
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:40,220
Speak properly now.

218
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,120
Jiang Qiao Xi.

219
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,959
He requested leave himself
to skip the Olympiad opening ceremony?

220
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,779
He did mention it to me.
But who gave him the right to decide?

221
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:03,499
This kid... I thought he went to the ceremony.

222
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:06,799
Ms. He informed me, so I knew he's here.

223
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,720
Don't worry.

224
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,150
It'll end soon.

225
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:48,519
I've booked tonight's ticket.
He must attend that opening ceremony.

226
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,940
Sir, we're leaving now.

227
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,230
Okay.

228
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,059
 
Remember.

229
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,279
First, stay calm, clear distractions.

230
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:41,030
Focus on the questions.

231
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:45,100
Prioritize high-score ones first.

232
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,739
Genius Jiang, soon it'll be the exam.
How about you?

233
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,159
You are?

234
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,759
Knew a genius wouldn't know me. I'm Qi Le.

235
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,720
A first-year student at our school.

236
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,759
During prelims, I luckily guessed
the approach for the final question.

237
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:08,159
That's how I snuck into nationals.
Just here for participation anyway.

238
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,559
Hello. I'm Jiang Qiao Xi.

239
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:19,919
Genius! You don't need introductions.
We all know you!

240
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,819
My dad leads our province's Math Olympiad team.

241
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:28,940
That's him. Mr. Qi.

242
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,040
He keeps chanting your name at home.

243
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,640
Says you have supernatural math intuition.
One in ten thousand.

244
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,300
He wishes you were his son instead.

245
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:45,259
If you can't focus normally, fine.
But why bother others now?

246
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:48,140
See? Told you you're his real son.

247
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,800
Keep spouting nonsense
and I'll deal with you at home.

248
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:57,980
What's wrong? Unwell?

249
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,659
Fine. Just a slight fever.

250
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,800
Getting sick now? Did you take medicine?

251
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,140
Don't take meds!

252
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,360
Meds make you drowsy.
Can't think straight when drowsy.

253
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,259
Absolutely no meds.

254
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:17,159
Genius, did someone ask
to borrow your eraser before the exam?

255
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:19,559
- Eraser? 
 - There's a legend in Chinese Math Olympiad.

256
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:22,420
Before the exam, if someone borrow
half an eraser from the top student,

257
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,579
all his good luck will be drained away.

258
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:27,259
Genius, someone wants to sabotage you.

259
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:28,880
Nonsense!

260
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,079
You study math too! How can you
be so superstitious? Have some dignity!

261
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,059
Dad, advanced math is basically metaphysics.

262
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:38,299
And let's be real, someone like me
making it to nationals?

263
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:39,549
That's pure luck.

264
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:43,480
It's such a critical time. Don't mess with me.

265
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,300
Look at Wang Shu Ran
performing her ritual over there.

266
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:54,799
Ritual? What do those characters in her palm mean?

267
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,519
According to that Qi Le guy,
there's some superstition.

268
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:03,519
Writing "win" 16 times in your left hand

269
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:08,519
and "excel" 16 times in your right hand
changes exam fortune.

270
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:12,260
Really? Did you try that?

271
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,940
Why would I? I don't need luck.

272
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,620
True.

273
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,900
Jiang Qiao Xi.

274
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,150
You sound off.

275
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,500
Are you sick?

276
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,779
Fine now. Just had a slight fever earlier.

277
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:32,419
Nothing to worry about.

278
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:34,819
You're sick?

279
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:38,559
Can you handle the competition alone like this?

280
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,940
Getting sick before finals? Such terrible luck!

281
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,339
Heaven help us. At least it's the last day.

282
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:47,799
Don't let this affect your performance.

283
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:50,750
I don't need heaven's blessing.

284
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,470
Just need

285
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,540
Cherry's support.

286
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:00,380
My support? How can you joke at a time like this!

287
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,119
Relax. None of this matters.

288
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,919
Won't affect me.

289
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:18,619
Cherry, I... I need this to end.

290
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:27,440
I will end this. Nothing will stop me.

291
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,720
Why do you keep saying "end"? End what exactly?

292
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,579
Be patient. You'll know soon.

293
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:43,759
Alright.

294
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,559
Bye.

295
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:15,319
Are you okay, young man?

296
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:20,960
Do you need help?

297
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,759
Just resting. Organizing my thoughts.

298
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,220
You're absolutely sure you're alright?

299
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,020
I'm fine.

300
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:55,299
Given Sn and An, how to solve for An?

301
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:57,099
This formula...

302
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:07,640
Enough laughing!

303
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,599
Lin Qi Le! What was I explaining?

304
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:22,140
To derive An from Sn and An...

305
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,599
50.

306
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:25,200
- 50.
- 50.

307
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,680
52. Put me down for that.

308
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,720
Me, 50 plus breakfast.

309
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
Right.

310
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,540
50 plus breakfast.

311
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,619
What are you doing?

312
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:38,079
Vote.

313
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,180
Vote for what?

314
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,859
The Olympiad, of course. It's starting soon.

315
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:43,980
Are you voting on whether
Jiang Qiao Xi will win the award?

316
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,039
No, I won't.

317
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,140
Not voting? That's not like you, Cherry.

318
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,519
Even Yu Qiao went all out
to support Jiang Qiao Xi.

319
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:01,799
I'm not doing this to support Jiang Qiao Xi.

320
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:05,559
I just saw a rare chance
to take advantage of his situation.

321
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,740
Hurry up.

322
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,680
Class is about to start.

323
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,259
 
They're guessing who'll make the national team.

324
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:18,380
 
Did you participate?

325
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,200
Of course not.

326
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,380
You're unwell. I didn't
want to join their nonsense.

327
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,660
But if I weren't sick,
you would've participated, right?

328
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,200
Do you think I'll be selected?

329
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,160
Of course I think you'll be selected.

330
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,099
But I still won't mess around with them.

331
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:42,940
I think they're just seeking
psychological satisfaction.

332
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,859
But I don't want to joke about your competition.

333
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:50,279
Do you know my risk-reward ratio?

334
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,299
What's a risk-reward ratio?

335
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:58,140
Risk-reward ratio?
Isn't that a financial term, genius?

336
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,940
Why are you talking about this?

337
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:06,259
My bad for not explaining clearly.
Even Cherry's confused now.

338
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:10,920
Never mind. My risk-reward ratio
is probably low anyway.

339
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,140
There's no loss if you don't participate.

340
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:18,539
Besides, I'm coming back soon. It's almost over.

341
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,819
Jiang Qiao Xi, what exactly is ending?

342
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:25,599
I've been thinking all day
and still can't figure it out.

343
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,039
Are you talking about the competition ending?

344
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:33,139
Everything is coming to an end.

345
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:44,160
Anyway, I wish you a triumphant victory.

346
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,500
Triumphant victory, I like that phrase.

347
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,299
I really need that. Thank you, Cherry.

348
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:57,919
Why so formal? So when exactly
are you coming back?

349
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,940
Starting today, I'll return on the fourth day.

350
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,200
Okay.

351
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,119
Genius, aren't you coming in?

352
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,519
Jiang Qiao Xi?

353
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,460
Cherry, will you come to pick me up when I return?

354
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,720
Yes, I'll come to get you.

355
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,619
Congratulations to these students.

356
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,000
 
Today, you've gloriously won Olympiad gold.

357
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,359
Genius, you had a fever this time,
you underperformed.

358
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:05,839
Otherwise, you would've dominated
the entire competition.

359
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:10,259
But even through regular college entrance exams,

360
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:15,500
you're destined to be the city,
no, province, top scorer.

361
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:22,039
Thank you, but I don't think I need it.

362
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:27,920
In this competition, there was one contestant
who truly showcased exceptional skill.

363
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,200
He achieved a perfect score
in the Chinese Mathematical Olympiad.

364
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:38,579
Let's give a round of applause to Jiang Qiao Xi
from Jialin First High School.

365
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:41,480
Genius, you've been hiding
your true self pretty well.

366
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:48,819
I always said the real deal stays the real deal.

367
00:26:51,936 --> 00:26:55,680
 

368
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,220
Not only did Jiang Qiao Xi earn a perfect score,

369
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,159
but he also got selected
for the national training team.

370
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:14,000
Moreover, he secured direct admission
to Qingbei University.

371
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,519
Look, that's Cherry over there.

372
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:46,319
- So this is what she looks like.
- Jiang Qiao Xi!

373
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:49,680
Jiang Xiao Xi spent all four days
of the trip making phone calls.

374
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,599
At least half an hour every single day.

375
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,200
How can they say he's aloof?
He's such a chatterbox!

376
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,000
Yet he still got a perfect score
and made the national team.

377
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,020
No amount of phone time matters.

378
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,920
Come on, everyone, gather over here quickly.

379
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,040
Assemble over there.

380
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,940
Are you feeling better?

381
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,279
Much better, almost back to normal.

382
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,119
Have you eaten yet?

383
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,859
Not yet.

384
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:24,859
How can you recover properly without eating?

385
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:27,140
We left in too much hurry.

386
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,339
Let's go eat later then.

387
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:30,339
Sure, that works.

388
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:31,759
We want breakfast too.

389
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:33,559
Let's go together.

390
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,720
I need chili sauce.

391
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,079
Here.

392
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:45,460
- Thanks.
- Here.

393
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,260
Thank you.

394
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:53,900
My senior, I'm Qi Le.

395
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,720
You're Qi Le? I'm Lin Qi Le.

396
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,059
Then your nickname must be Rong Rong?

397
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:05,279
Rong Rong? Harmony and joy?

398
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,500
Yes, exactly.

399
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,780
Are you reading The Monkey King Chronicles?

400
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,520
Jiang Qiao Xi loved reading
Journey to the West as a kid.

401
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:24,832
Miss Lin, you really knew Mr. Jiang
since childhood?

402
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:31,279
Yes. I read this book in middle school too.

403
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,579
Seriously, I absolutely love this book.

404
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:39,059
I want the sky to no longer blind me.
I want the earth to no longer bury my heart.

405
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:44,780
Let all beings understand my will.
Let all deities vanish into smoke.

406
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,312
Let me see.

407
00:29:49,312 --> 00:29:51,456
 

408
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:56,700
Good thing this photo covers the scar
on your forehead.

409
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,640
It's fine. See? It's almost healed now.

410
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,800
Still noticeable though.

411
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,440
I don't see much difference.

412
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,272
I should read it too.

413
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:11,136
 

414
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,619
Will you have to take exams again later?

415
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:17,920
No. I don't need to take it.

416
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,200
I don't need to take it either. I was eliminated.

417
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,220
If I want to try again,
I'll have to wait until next year.

418
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,460
But the reason Genius Jiang doesn't need
to take it is because he got a perfect score.

419
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,740
He directly qualified
for the Olympiad world championships.

420
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,940
What does this mean?

421
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,000
It means Jiang Qiao Xi was directly selected
for the national training team.

422
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,940
He should compete internationally afterwards.

423
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,020
For international competitions? He'll go abroad?

424
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,859
- I'll pay.
- So Mr. Jiang won't need to attend school.

425
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:47,940
Being on the national team guarantees
admission to Qingbei University.

426
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:00,059
Let's go.

427
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,299
- Thanks, genius.
- No problem.

428
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:03,099
Thank you, my senior.

429
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,240
 

430
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,220
Jiang Qiao Xi, won't you be going
to school on Monday anymore?

431
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:17,339
I'm going to school.

432
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,839
All of this

433
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:26,119
is over.

434
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:31,659
Mr. Jiang, so you're not joining
the national team?

435
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,480
I'm quitting Olympiad math.
I'm returning to regular school.

436
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,280
Not studying Olympiad math?

437
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,960
Mr. Jiang's kid is giving up guaranteed admission
to Qingbei. Who knows what's wrong?

438
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,779
Not going? He's rejecting Qingbei?

439
00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:00,880
Yeah.

440
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:07,720
Mom, these are all the Olympiad materials
I've organized since childhood.

441
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,019
I've categorized them all.

442
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:12,500
If you want, you can tear them up in order.

443
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,300
What do you mean?

444
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:21,619
I figured you'd forgotten.

445
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,720
When I was in first grade,
just back from Hong Kong, China,

446
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:33,559
I neglected the math homework you assigned
because I was fooling around.

447
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:37,559
You tore up my Olympiad books.

448
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,359
You told me Olympiad math was my only path.

449
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:46,740
Told me to figure it out myself. And I did.

450
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,119
I'm rejecting that path now.

451
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:54,319
What's this act about?

452
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:57,619
Revenge is best served cold?

453
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:00,899
No.

454
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:08,700
These ten years were my answer to your question.

455
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,180
I don't want this math genius future.

456
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,980
I'm giving it up.

457
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:19,640
I truly made you too clever.

458
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,720
You know exactly how to hurt me worst.

459
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,460
You waited until now,

460
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,940
having achieved everything, to destroy it all.

461
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:36,339
You just want me to know
I wasted all these years, don't you?

462
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:49,040
Mom, I waited until today because only today

463
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,240
would you be willing to hear
what I truly want to say.

464
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,200
Only now would you see what I really want to do.

465
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,960
I'm not Jiang Meng Chu. I'm not anyone's shadow.

466
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,940
I'm Jiang Qiao Xi. I have my own name, Mom.

467
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,859
The last thing you should mention is his name.

468
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:12,059
He's different from you.
He knew how hard I struggled.

469
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:17,679
Meng Chu told me at age four
he wanted to go to Qingbei.

470
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,879
He wanted to become
the world's greatest mathematician.

471
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,399
If he were alive, how envious he'd be of you!

472
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:38,100
I'm sorry, Mom. But I'm the one alive now.

473
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,720
What does Jiang Meng Chu's unfinished
genius life have to do with me?

474
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,300
Liang Hong Fei, how could you...?

475
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,379
He's practically an adult now.
How can you still hit him?

476
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:04,500
Are you okay?

477
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,340
I'm fine.

478
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,140
Sit.

479
00:35:14,784 --> 00:35:17,460
 

480
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,360
Qiao Xi's such a good kid, obedient and sensible.

481
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,460
Yet Mr. Liang still pressures him.
This isn't right.

482
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,539
 
I've never understood Mr. Liang's attitude.

483
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:30,500
Qiao Xi's already so obedient.

484
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,940
 
Remember when he studied at our house as a kid?

485
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,760
He'd do stack after stack of test papers.

486
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,860
Like he was glued to the chair.

487
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,139
Then look at our Cherry.

488
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:43,260
Bathroom breaks every three minutes,
water every five.

489
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,340
Can't sit still.

490
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,680
Like there's nails on her chair.

491
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,919
Manager Cai.

492
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,819
Okay. We're coming. Alright.

493
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:09,179
Qiao Xi, I know you're exhausted
physically and mentally.

494
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:12,260
How about this? Let's take a trip together.

495
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:16,340
We'll relax properly.
Didn't you want to visit Tibet?

496
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,679
Huangshan, Taishan, any famous site you want.

497
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:23,520
If not with me, invite your friends
and you form a group.

498
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,659
We'll cover all expenses.

499
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:28,000
Go anywhere, even abroad if you want.

500
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,039
I'm not here to beg for a vacation or act spoiled.

501
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:36,860
I just want to say, from today,
I'm rejecting all this.

502
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,900
From this moment on, I have a name, Jiang Qiao Xi.

503
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,619
Qiao Xi, I was wrong. I'm begging you.

504
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,840
I apologize. I shouldn't have torn your books.

505
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,019
Please don't give up. You can't abandon Qingbei.

506
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:53,500
You've worked so hard.
You're meant to be world champion!

507
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,500
Mom, after all I've said,
you still don't understand what I want?

508
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,300
What do you want?

509
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,239
That girl from Qun Shan?

510
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,519
Because of her? Is that it?

511
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,180
I see.

512
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:21,159
In your heart, this is the only accusation
you can pin on me, right?

513
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:26,059
But when you were little,
you were so well-behaved and listened to me.

514
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:32,539
Ever since going to Qun Shan
and meeting those people, everything changed.

515
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:37,420
Over all these years,
your dad and I have given so much for you.

516
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,320
How dare you just give up like this?

517
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,920
Mom, think about it yourself.

518
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:47,280
Were all these things you've done for me
since childhood really just for my sake?

519
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,660
Isn't it fear that makes you and Dad
control me so strictly?

520
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,800
When I was little and you got drunk,
you looked at me and said,

521
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,479
"Jiang Meng Chu, it's my fault.

522
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,800
I should have picked you up.
I shouldn't have asked your dad to go.

523
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,179
He was always late."

524
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:15,360
Later, I realized Jiang Meng Chu
skipped Olympiad class.

525
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,239
You didn't pick him up, so he...

526
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:19,039
Jiang Qiao Xi, stop talking!

527
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,400
As I grew older, I understood you wanted him
to be an Olympiad prodigy.

528
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,199
But him? He just wanted somewhere
far away from you.

529
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:34,000
At 13, he disappeared on a hill so close to home.

530
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,019
Do you really believe it was just...?

531
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:36,739
You can't mention him like this!

532
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:41,079
Jiang Qiao Xi, do you think this honors
your brother? Your dead brother?

533
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:44,599
How did I fail him? Who truly failed him?

534
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:46,039
What are you saying?

535
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:49,420
Meng Chu had your eyes and shared your blood.

536
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,656
He wouldn't think this way.

537
00:38:50,656 --> 00:38:55,260
Yes, Jiang Meng Chu shared my blood and my eyes.

538
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,639
My skin, my bones, my flesh.

539
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,500
Everything about me was given by you.

540
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,059
These certificates, these achievements,
you gave them all!

541
00:39:02,059 --> 00:39:05,280
If you want them, I'll return everything!

542
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,659
I'll just be Jiang Qiao Xi!

543
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:08,459
Jiang Qiao Xi.

544
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:24,839
Jiang Qiao Xi.

545
00:39:26,176 --> 00:39:27,888
 ♫ Spreading sunlight ♫ 

546
00:39:27,888 --> 00:39:32,137
 ♫ Warmly kissing her ♫ 

547
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:34,385
 ♫ Open your eyes, little prince ♫ 

548
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:36,440
 ♫ Riding a white horse ♫ 

549
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:44,360
Our family's having hotpot
tonight. Will you join us?

550
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,000
You know I'm not great at eating hotpot.

551
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,140
But if you're there fighting me for food,

552
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,171
I could eat a lot more.

553
00:39:56,171 --> 00:39:57,225
 ♫ She timidly ♫ 

554
00:39:57,225 --> 00:40:02,153
 ♫ Hides into the clouds ♫ 

555
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:03,982
 ♫ The serene blue sky ♫ 

556
00:40:03,982 --> 00:40:05,506
 ♫ Muttering ♫ 

557
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:07,099
 ♫ Lying in the grass ♫ 

558
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:08,137
Let's go.

559
00:40:08,137 --> 00:40:09,719
 ♫ Unintentionally ♫ 

560
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:10,944
Jiang Qiao Xi.

561
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:19,657
 ♫ Lands on my nose tip ♫ 

562
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:24,639
 ♫ Aye aye oh ♫ 

563
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,688
Let's go.

564
00:40:26,688 --> 00:40:29,088
 ♫ Sunflower tiptoes ♫ 

565
00:40:29,088 --> 00:40:32,770
 ♫ Shaking head and saying goodbye ♫ 

566
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:36,103
 ♫ Aye aye oh ♫ 

567
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:38,784
 ♫ Aye oh ♫ 

568
00:40:38,784 --> 00:40:40,576
 ♫ A little straw hat ♫ 

569
00:40:40,576 --> 00:40:45,613
 ♫ Hitting the road with me ♫ 

570
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,660
Sit here.

571
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,220
Wait a moment.

572
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,440
Your wound needs disinfection.
I'll get the iodine.

573
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,480
We can't have hot pot
until your wound's disinfected.

574
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,199
My mom also made fried pork floss.
You better eat a lot of it.

575
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:22,400
That way I can eat more too.

576
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,179
 ♫ On the hillside ♫ 

577
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:28,179
How about this? Count to ten.

578
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:30,959
I'll definitely be back after ten counts.

579
00:41:32,876 --> 00:41:34,924
 ♫ At the back slope of the small town ♫ 

580
00:41:34,924 --> 00:41:36,320
 ♫ You held my hand ♫ 

581
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,543
 ♫ Running towards the mountain top ♫ 

582
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:41,698
 ♫ The sunset dissipates ♫ 

583
00:41:41,698 --> 00:41:44,806
 ♫ All the worries ♫ 

584
00:41:44,806 --> 00:41:46,830
 ♫ You are in my eyes ♫ 

585
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,374
 ♫ I look at you ♫ 

586
00:41:48,374 --> 00:41:49,907
 ♫ Without noticing ♫ 

587
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,845
 ♫ It's all you ♫ 

588
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:52,876
 ♫ At this moment ♫ 

589
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:54,700
 ♫ I finally understand ♫ 

590
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,873
 ♫ Stability and freedom ♫ 

591
00:41:59,873 --> 00:42:02,966
 ♫ Is the story coming to an end ♫ 

592
00:42:02,966 --> 00:42:05,886
 ♫ We'll meet again, right ♫ 

593
00:42:05,886 --> 00:42:11,999
 ♫ Maybe there'll be regrets ♫ 

594
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:14,945
 ♫ Aye aye oh ♫ 

595
00:42:14,945 --> 00:42:18,019
 ♫ Aye oh ♫ 

596
00:42:18,019 --> 00:42:20,200
 Jiang Qiao Xi has left. 

597
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,140
 Jiang Qiao Xi doesn't write letters or call me. 

598
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,780
 I'll never think about Jiang Qiao Xi again. 

599
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,819
 I'll never get hurt because of him again. 

600
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:53,682
 ♫ Once again in the night ♫ 

601
00:42:53,682 --> 00:42:57,362
 ♫ I am like dust ♫ 

602
00:42:57,362 --> 00:42:59,762
 ♫ Blown away by the wind ♫ 

603
00:42:59,762 --> 00:43:02,546
 ♫ Unable to find a place to land ♫ 

604

605
00:43:07,474 --> 00:43:11,090

00:44:49,842 --> 00:44:52,946
 ♫ Those ordinary years of growth ♫ 

641
00:44:52,946 --> 00:44:55,346
 ♫ Brewing ♫ 

642
00:44:56,466 --> 00:44:59,090
 ♫ Gazing out ♫ 

643
00:45:00,178 --> 00:45:03,350
 ♫ Towards the horizon ♫
