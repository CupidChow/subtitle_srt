[man humming "Bridal Chorus"]

00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,635
We're getting married today!

5
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:54,596
Oh!

6
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,681
- Hey. How are you?
- [man 1] Hi, everyone!

7
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,849
- Hello!
- [man 1] You made it!

00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,143
- Congrats!
- [man 1] Hi. Hello.

[acoustic guitar music playing]

10
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,899
HAPPY THAT YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED?
HAPPY THAT YOU'RE A FAMILY OF THREE?

11
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,026
WELCOME TO THE WEDDING
OF KI-DAE AND YUN-SU

12
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,319
[indistinct chattering]

13
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,570
Closer. Closer.

14
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,822
Ah, what's up, y'all?

15
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,909
- Hello!
- Congratulations!

16
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,453
[man 1] Aw, thank you. [laughs]

17
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,998
All right, now let's go see the bride,
shall we?

18
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,374
- Oh!
- [man 1] Hey, you made it!

19
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,293
- Oh, hi, Ki-dae.
- Oh, hey.

20
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,170
[Ki-dae] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

21
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,964
- [girls] Hello!
- [Ki-dae] Okay. Hi there! Thank you.

22
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,175
[acoustic guitar music continues]

23
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,803
[Ki-dae] And now, the star of the day.

24
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,429
Oh! Why are you filming this?

25
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,723
Hey! Stop that! Enough snooping around!

26
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,809
- [Ki-dae] But I need to film this.
- She's not ready.

27
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,144
- [Ki-dae] Wait, wait, wait, no!
- Stop it. Out!

28
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,688
- You gotta take it from him.
- [Ki-dae] What are you doing?

29
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,107
Leave me alone.

30
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,275
- Don't let him get away with it!
- [Ki-dae laughing]

31
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,195
[guests cheering]

32
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,864
- [woman 3] So pretty, Ms. An.
- [emcee] All right! Settle down.

33
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,035
The bride and groom
will now exchange rings!

00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,789
[indistinct chattering]

36
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,167
- [woman] There's nothing there.
- It's okay, baby.

37
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,545
[man 3] What's happening? Oh my goodness!

38
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,879
Ta-da!

[guests clapping, cheering]

40
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,341
Love that so much!

41
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,634
[man 4] Yeah!

42
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,344
WEDDING VOWS

43
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:20,014
[all] "…will you be the kind of couple
who always argue,

44
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:24,102
and then comes together
in the moments that truly matter?"

45
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,019
[both] Yes!

46
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,021
[all] "Do you promise

47
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,024
to take good care of sweet baby Sop

48
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,776
so she never feels lonely?"

49
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,902
[both] Yeah!

50
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,698
[all] "The three of you
shall now be a family

51
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,325

[Ki-dae] She's about to throw the bouquet!

[phone ringing]

69
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,210
[dispatcher] <i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

70
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,670
[Yun-su nervously] My… my husband, he's…

71
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,590
he's losing so much blood.

72
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,091
<i>Can you tell us what happened?</i>

73
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,470
[splutters] He got stabbed in the neck.
Please help us.

74
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,597
- [tense music playing]
<i>- What's your address, ma'am?</i>

75
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,351
[sobs] In Paju. It's 30… 32 Jungri-eup.

76
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,727
It's the old paint shop.

77
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,437
<i>Is your husband still conscious?</i>

78
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,231
He's breathing,

79
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,650
but he won't open his eyes.

80
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,777
<i>So he's breathing,</i>
<i>but his eyes won't open?</i>

81
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,278
[sobs] Please, hurry!

82
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,614
<i>Another dispatcher is sending</i>
<i>an ambulance right now.</i>

83
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,907
<i>Don't hang up, ma'am.</i>

84
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,200
I'm here.

85
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,619
Stay with me, Ki-dae. Open your eyes.

86
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,537
[Yun-su sobbing]

87
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:10,291
No, please, stay with me.
Don't close your eyes, Ki-dae. Come on.

88
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,252
Please open your eyes.

89
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,087
[shouts] Help us! I'm begging you!

90
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,588
[crying hysterically]

[music fades]

93
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:30,019
[officiant] Now's the time
to say goodbye to our dearly departed.

94
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,731
THE LATE LEE KI-DAE

95
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,742
[sobs gently]

96
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,540
[inhales deeply]

97
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,762
[indistinct chattering]

98
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,932
[woman 2] Ms. An! Ms. An!

99
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,976
[man 1 scoffs]

100
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,060
[Yun-su] Hello.

101
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,646
- [woman 3] Ms. An!
- [woman 4] Ms. An!

102
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,731
[Yun-su] Oh!

103
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,607
Thanks so much for coming.

104
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,900
[man 2] Of course.

105
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,403
[Yun-su] You didn't have to come this far.

106
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,031
A FEW DAYS LATER

107
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,867
I'm sorry we had to call you in so soon.
You probably needed more time.

108
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,286
It's fine. I knew that I had to come.

109
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,914
[detective] Hmm.

110
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,502
About your husband's phone,

111
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,797
not a single one of the passwords
you supplied to us was correct.

112
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,009
I gave you every password that I had.

113
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,262
Is that so?
iPhones are such a pain to crack.

114
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,892
Oh, wait.
Would you like something to drink?

115
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,561
Some coffee. Not too strong, please.

116
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,645
[detective] Sure.

117
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,024
It's instant coffee. Do you mind?

118
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,902
- Ah, sure. That would be all right.
- [chuckles] I'll be right back.

119
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,487
[door opens]

120
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,197
[door closes]

121
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,491
In cases like this,
we start with the relatives.

122
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,700
It's just standard procedure.

123
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,037
I wanna get you off the list of suspects
as soon as possible.

124
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,582
- [garbled] Can I say something?
- Oh, sure. I'm listening. Go ahead.

125
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,125
It's nothing important,

126
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,128
but it's just like
those American TV shows.

127
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,506
The cops always start with the family.

128
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,551
Never watched <i>CSI</i>?

129
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,679
[laughing]

130
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,473
Once again.

131
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,850
You saw her smile, right?

132
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,978
What if she just smiles a lot?

133
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,814
After all this?

134
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,690
Expect me to buy that?

135
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,859
- [detective] Uh…
- Look at the way she's dressed.

136
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,028
- Are you ready to continue?
- I am.

137
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,490
So any other family we should know about?

138
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,200
No.

139
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,035
Ki-dae was an only child.

140
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,538
He lost his parents
when he was in high school.

141
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,790
And I've been an orphan my whole life.

142
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,126
[detective] Oh, I see.

143
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,169
Is there anyone else?

144
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,047
Sop, Ki-dae, and I,

145
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,049
all we needed was each other.

146
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,804
It was just us three.

147
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,306
How come you never say "my husband"?

148
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,517
I feel like you always call him "Ki-dae."

149
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,186
Yes. I'm just used to it.

150
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,022
Because we knew each other from school
before we tied the knot.

151
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,733
Oh, ah, I understand. [laughs]

152
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,280
There was an issue
with your dashcam's SD card,

153
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,323
so nothing got recorded.

154
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,452
But you did see someone
come out of his studio

155
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,704
while you were parking. Is that right?

156
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,746
Yeah.

157
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,877
Didn't you think it was pretty odd

158
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,337
that someone would come up there
dressed like that?

159
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,257
They were all underclassmen,
the ones who came to his studio.

160
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,800
Most of them dress like that usually.

161
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,720
Well, I guess not all artists
are the same.

162
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,806
It all depends on which major they choose

163
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,726
and their nature and their taste as well.

164
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,359
Personally, I dress to impress.

165
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,278
[detective] Oh.

166
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,030
I can see that.

167
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,617
We spoke to the underclassmen
who visited your husband's studio.

168
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,036
They all mentioned
that he told the class in advance

169
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,622
he was gonna be
on a date with you that day.

170
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,249
He also said
not to even think about dropping by.

171
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,584
You knew about that?

172
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,046
[scribbling]

173
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,508
That night,
we were gonna try again, you know.

174
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,928
Sop was also conceived in his studio.

175
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,474
We were gonna drink the same wine,
on the same couch, in the same studio

176
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,019
so we could conceive another child.

177
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,863
[detective] We found this
under the couch in the studio.

178
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,909
Is this yours, Ms. An?

179
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,327
[mysterious music playing]

180
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,453
It's not.

181
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,038
That night,

182
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,083
someone did come by.

183
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,543
A student named Oh Seo-won.

184
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,922
She really looked up to Ki-dae.

185
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,388
Is that her? Is that who you drew?

186
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,598
Oh, no.

187
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,768
With that rain, I wasn't able to see.

188
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,397
It's not like that.

189
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,695
[mysterious music continues]

190
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,032
[uneasy music playing]

191
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,660
[Yun-su grunts]

192
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,161
[Yun-su screams]

193
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,496
What happened to your wrist?

194
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,831
[uneasy music continue]

195
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,045
I bruise pretty easily,
and they don't fade quickly.

196
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,174
[music swells]

197
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,593
[music fades]

198
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,635
[door closes]

199
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,720
[detective sighs]

200
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,430
[camera beeps]

201
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,434
[sighs]

202
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:05,271
Just checking up on these questions
we asked you earlier.

203
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:06,981
Oh.

204
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,567
I, uh…

205
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,447
I've already described
what happened to Detective Ryu.

206
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,992
[detective] Since you're a key witness
in this investigation,

207
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,703
we need to make sure
your statement is accurate, ma'am.

208
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,081
On the night of April 15th,
you did go to your husband's studio.

209
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,834
I did.

210
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,836
[detective] At what time, exactly?

211
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,465
It was around 8:00 p.m., give or take.

212
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,552
You said that his underclassman,
Ms. Oh Seo-won was present as well?

213
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,391
I believe she was. Yes.

214
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,562
[detective] And how long did you stay
in your vehicle after you got there?

215
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,272
Ten minutes?

216
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,737
[exhales sharply]

217
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,325
[captain] Look, this woman
just lost her husband.

218
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,036
Keeping her without cause
is against the law.

219
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,205
So what? Set her free?

220
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,208
Or do we have a reason
to hold her any longer?

221
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,835
Cat got your tongue?

222
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,547
Team 3 got a visit
from Baek Dong-hun today.

223
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,174
[groans] Oh!

224
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,176
Oh, please. Not that guy.

225
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,928
I find him unsettling.

226
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,722
It's like rules
don't apply to him or something.

227
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,392
And an ex-cop turned prosecutor?
Give me a break.

228
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,144
It might be true,

229
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,271
but he gets the job done.

230
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,860
[phone buzzing]

231
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,658
[Dong-hun] Yes?

232
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,541
You're still interviewing the witness?

233
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,043
[distant siren wailing]

234
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,839
Sure, I can be there.

235
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,432
[door closes]

236
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,934
[Detective Ryu] Hey.

237
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,894
Uh, she just went to the restroom.

238
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,107
[Dong-hun] Let me look at the file first.

239
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,318
<i>I mean, it's nothing important,</i>

240
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,739
<i>but it's just like</i>
<i>those American TV shows.</i>

241
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,199
<i>The cops always start with the family.</i>

242
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,827
[Detective Ryu] A lot of what she says
just doesn't add up.

243
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,039
As the wife of the victim,
her behavior comes off as highly unusual.

244
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,839
Whoever did it
poured some etching solution

245
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,133
on every spot where traces might remain.

246
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,388
Including that wine bottle here.

247
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,849
We haven't recovered anything from it yet.

248
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,727
It's taking a while
as there were so many broken pieces.

249
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,482
That's the carving knife
with the victim's blood on it.

250
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,525
None of the etching product touched it.

251
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,944
No trace of An Yun-su on it either.

252
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,946
You're positive it wasn't touched?

253
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,072
Yes.

254
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:04,784
[chuckles]

255
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,835
[intriguing piano music playing]

256
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,133
[man 1] Hey.

257
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,260
Hold it steady.

258
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,347
[man 2] Stairs! The stairs!

259
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,849
[indistinct chattering]

260
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,351
[man 3] Move!

261
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,729
[man 4] I'm sorry, sir!

262
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,317
- [distant siren wailing]
- [chattering continues]

263

264

[cigarette sizzling]

265
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,211
[Detective Ryu] What should we do?

266
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,921
[door opens]

267
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:04,927
[door closes]

268
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,012
[intriguing music continues]

269
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,198
I have to get back home now.

270
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,872
My daughter is waiting for me.

271
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,373
I gotta get home.

272
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,166
Anybody?

273
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,501
[Yun-su knocks on glass]

274
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,420
[Yun-su exhales sharply]

275
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,008
[mysterious music playing]

276
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,478
Ms. An Yun-su?

277
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,273
Questioning is over,
and you're free to go.

278
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,150
[Yun-su sighs]

279
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,526
[Detective Ryu] Did we

280
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,362
make the right decision?

281
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,949
Without proof, she's free to go.

282
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,576
Let her get to her daughter.

283
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,789
[mysterious music continues]

284
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,255
Ah! I just wanted to thank you
for everything.

285
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,965
Means a lot to me.

286
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,842
[detective] Thank you.

287
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:27,968
[sighs]

288
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,310
I want this one.

289
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,605
I'm gonna tell the boss
I'm taking over this case.

290
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,194
[sizzling]

291
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,405
You're gonna eat it like this,
or you want me to mix it?

292
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,615
Mix, please.

293
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,492
Okay.

294
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,587
Will you hold the bow for me?

295
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,009
You know how to put on your socks, right?

296
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,221
Sop, you want grape or apple juice?

297
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,390
- Grape juice.
- You got it!

298
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,491
- Hi, good morning.
- Hi, how are you?

299
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,743
[student 1] How is everybody doing today?

300
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,120
[Yun-su] Hello.

301
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,040
- [student 2] What about that English test?
- [student 3] That stuff was hard.

302
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,583
[student 2] I know, right?

303
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,588
- [Yun-su] Hello.
- [woman] Good morning, everyone!

304
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,215
Ah, Ms. An.

305
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,510
How are you?

306
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,738
- [Yun-su] I'll just have a little.
- [woman 2] Is that okay?

307
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,322
[Yun-su] Yeah, I gotta drive home.

308
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,617
- [woman 2] You drove here? What a shame.
- [Yun-su] I know. I'm sorry.

309
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,912
- Wow, it smells good.
- [woman 2] It's an excellent wine.

310
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,874
- How about a sip?
- [woman 2] Ah, no, no. No way.

311
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,500
Come back when you have more time.

312
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,877
- I'll have it ready for you.
- Mmm.

313
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,421
- [woman 2] Smell a few others.
- They do have a lot in common.

314
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,715
[woman 2] It's not far
from the one you usually have.

Bye!

00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,116

Is that how she mourns her husband?

348
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,820
Or she's erasing him.

349

00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,415
You've already got this huge mountain
of paperwork to keep you busy.

353
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,253
I know you're about to stay up all night.
That's why you missed the party.

354
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,420
Feel free to go home.

355
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,547
All right.

356
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,800
See you tomorrow.

357
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,762

[door opens]

359
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,060
[boy 1] What are you doing?

360
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,313
[boy 2] Stop it, you idiot.

361
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,357
[boy 3] Are you out of your mind?

362
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,319
[laughter]

363
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,696
[girl 1] Is she really asleep?

364
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,489
[boy 1] You think she died or something?

365
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,825
[boy 3] She was snoring earlier.

366
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,744
[girl 2] I should have known
when she volunteered to be the model.

367
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,665
I did ask you to raise your hand
if you wanted to do it.

368
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:35,043
- You all refused, so stop complaining.
- Oh, she heard me.

369
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,336
- Hey, let's be real.
- [laughter]

370
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,047
You would have made us do
some weird pose if we agreed to do it.

371
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:44,261
Guys, it's not about how the model looks
on the outside. Okay?

372
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,556
What you're drawing is an impression.

373
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,684
You can't just make some pale copy

374
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,519
of what's in front of you.

375
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,688

[laughter]

377
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,108
[boy 4] No way, man.

381
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,035
- Yeah.
- Good morning.

382
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,704
We just got a call from An Yun-su.

383
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:14,291
<i>She wants to stop by her husband's studio</i>
<i>to pick something up.</i>

384
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,586
I told her she couldn't
since it's still an active crime scene.

385
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,338
Yeah, that's smart.

386
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,715
Okay.

387
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:26,553

So good.

390
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,323
You made my hair into a waterfall.

391
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:48,825

[Yun-su] Did you catch him?

One moment, please.

407
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,923
Hi, can I help you?

408
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,134
I'm, uh…

409
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,387
Are you here for your kid?

410
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,932
Sorry, it's a mistake.
I got the wrong class.

411
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,559
- Ah.
- Yeah.

412
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,602
[Dong-hun] Excuse me.

413
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,271
Are you sure it was her?

414
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,192
[sobs gently]

415
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,279
[detective] So you admit you were
having an affair with the victim?

416
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,615
He was an upperclassman I liked,

417
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,909
but nothing happened.

418
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:58,205
That upperclassman was a married man,
so cut the bull. All right?

419
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,540
- [sobs]
- [detective] You were having an affair.

420
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,876
I didn't do anything!

421
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,171
It wasn't me. I swear.

422
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,883
The blood found on the carving knife
didn't belong to the victim,

423
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,384
and it turned out

424
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,345
it was Oh Seo-won's.

425
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,347
What's her explanation?

426
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,225
[Ji-su] She says she cut herself
while working on a piece.

427
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,351
[Dong-hun] And her alibi?

428
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,937
According to her,
she left the studio around 5:00,

429
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,105
then took a cab home by herself.

430
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,484
And obviously, she paid in cash,
which can't be verified.

431
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,028
Do you always carry cash around? Huh?

432
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,155
[Dong-hun sighs]

433
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,824
How did An Yun-su take it?

434
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,244
Much better than I expected.

435
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:41,623
She wants to speak to Oh Seo-won,
but I can't allow that just yet.

436
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,083
I feel like you should.

437
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,000
What?

438
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,129
- You don't think it's too soon to--
- I feel like you should.

439

[Seo-won breathing shakily]

440
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,426
I had nothing to do with it.

441
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,015
It wasn't me.

442
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,897
Why didn't you attend the funeral?

443
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,401
[sobs] It's because I was scared.

444
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:15,782
That night, I was the only one
who went to the studio.

445
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,744
Then I heard he died.

446
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,330
Exactly.

447
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,710
Nobody else came by that night.

448
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,338
But you went there,
even though he told you not to.

449
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,883
Please, I am telling you. [sobs]

450
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,512
I could never do something like that.

00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,739

we located the taxi that took Oh Seo-won.

497
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,775
Her alibi has been confirmed.

498
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,071
But… but wait. So then, who…

499
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,656
who killed Ki-dae?

500
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,075
[scoffs] You gotta be kidding me.

I cooperated! Wait! It wasn't me!

He's the father of my child!

Let me go, please!

516

Why would you do this
in front of the kids?

Hey, if you have a problem,
go over there and file a complaint, okay?

518
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,697
- Otherwise, get out of my way.
- I'm not letting this happen.

raided the school.

They took your laptop, the drawings.
The bastards seized everything.

00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,400
You're making jokes now?

528
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:28,363
My husband's bugging me,
saying you need a lawyer right now!

529
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,865
No, I don't want a lawyer.

530
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,408
It costs too much money.

531
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:36,120
Forget about the money.
How long are you gonna stay in there?

532
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:40,333
They can't hold me without evidence
for more than ten days.

533
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,168
Who told you that?

534
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,712
Grissom said so.

535
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,757
<i>CSI.</i>

536
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,759
[chuckles]

537
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,011
[exhales]

538
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,888
Those cops gotta be dumb.

539
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,016
Why would they arrest someone like you?

540
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,977
They're listening. Be careful.

541
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,437
Well, I got something to say

542
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,690
to those assholes.

543
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:07,944
You're the best.

544
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,572
Watch my baby, okay?

545
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,705
So tomorrow, you have an interview
for the fraud case,

546
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,081
and the chief knows the witness.

547
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,126
<i>He wanted to make sure</i>
<i>that you'd treat them well. </i>[laughs]

548
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,627
Yeah, I heard.

549
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,922
Oh, and we just got those belongings
from that teacher.

550
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,924
There was a bunch of videos
on her USB drive.

551
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,926
<i>Looks like they were filming themselves.</i>

552
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,680
<i>The police said there's no need for us</i>
<i>to go through them.</i>

553
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,598
Got it.

554
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,393
[Ki-dae] <i>Honey, look at me.</i>

555
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,436
<i>Stop it.</i>

556
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,521
<i>I told you I'm not in the mood.</i>

557
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,274
[Ki-dae] <i>It's not that I don't want to.</i>

558
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,276
<i>I just feel like</i>
<i>I need a more steady income.</i>

559
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,402
<i>Maybe wait a couple years?</i>

560
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:52,030
[Yun-su] <i>If we keep putting it off,</i>
<i>Sop is gonna grow up alone.</i>

561
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:55,283
<i>If something were to happen to us,</i>
<i>she'd be all by herself.</i>

562
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,619
[Ki-dae] <i>Why would you say such a thing?</i>
<i>That's never gonna happen.</i>

563
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,829
[Yun-su] <i>You don't know that.</i>

564
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,582
<i>Look at you or me.</i>

565
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,460
<i>We didn't choose to grow up like that.</i>

566
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,628
[sighs] <i>Go away.</i>

567
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,757
<i>It doesn't have to be like that. Hmm?</i>

568
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,301
<i>I told you, just leave me alone!</i>

569
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,095
[pensive music playing]

570
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,180
[Yun-su] <i>Go away.</i>

[pensive music continues]

573

[music fades]

574
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,588
Did you tell her that
she has the right to an attorney?

575
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,674
[Mr. Hwang] I did,
but she said she didn't want one.

576
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,722
It was you the other day

577
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,933
at my school.

578
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,351
[door closes]

579
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,895
I'm Baek Dong-hun, the prosecutor.

580
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,441
Would you perhaps like
to wait for an attorney?

581
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,111
I don't. I have nothing to hide.

582
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,946
You can go ahead.

583
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,282
- [keyboard clacks]
- [chuckles]

584
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,326
On April 15th,

585
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,870
you, Ms. An Yun-su,

586
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,289
did go to your husband
Lee Ki-dae's studio.

587
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:29,627
Now, I would like to go over everything
that happened in detail.

588
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,963
- [rain pattering]
- [tense music playing]

589
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,632
[Yun-su] God, it's freezing.

590
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,509
[thunder rumbling]

591
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,117
[tense music rising]

592
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,162
[Yun-su] <i>No.</i>

593
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,998
I didn't know Ki-dae
and Seo-won were involved.

594
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:10,084
I thought she was just an underclassman
who looked up to him.

595
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:11,794
[Ki-dae sighs]

596
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,302
[thunderclap]

597
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,727

[tense music swells]

601
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,286
- It's the same wine I purchased.
- [music fades]

602
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,331
I dropped it when I discovered
my husband on the floor.

603
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:53,044
<i>So yeah, my fingerprints are gonna be</i>
<i>all over the bottle, of course.</i>

607

[Yun-su] Let go! Let go of me!

608
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,182
- Why won't you let go?
- [gasps]

[Yun-su] Oh God!

618
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,248
- [music subsides]
- You can't be serious.

619
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,833
[sobs] How could you even think…

00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,086
- [liquid splashing]

621
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,129
[tense music playing]

622
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,177
I already told you.

623
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,265
I bought the etching solution,
but it was for my class.

624
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,768
I had to come to his studio
because the school has no etching room.

625
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,812
[dramatic organ music playing]

626
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,361
[music intensifies]

- [dramatic organ music playing]
- [thunderclap]

630
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,304
I… I can tell you're not listening!

631
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,063
There was a toolbox
where I found this carving knife

632
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,857
damaged by the etching solution.

633
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,861
It's a perfect match for the stab wound
on your husband's neck.

634
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,781
You called Sergeant Ryu a couple days ago

635
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,325
to stop by the studio.

636
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,827
- I wanted to get my students drawing--
- That's a lie.

637
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,371
You wanted the knife gone.

638
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,667
And then, Oh Seo-won would become
the perfect killer.

639
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,170
I didn't want her to become a suspect.

640
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,883
Then how would you explain this sketch?

641
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,304
I drew what I saw.
What do you want me to say?

642
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,306
The truth, okay?

643
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,518
There's no surveillance footage,
no witness who can back you up here.

644
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,562
You just made it up.

645
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,649
You made up all of that,
including that hooded suspect.

646
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,943
[scoffs]

647
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,655
[Dong-hun] This morning,

648
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,992
your students sent a letter about you
to my office.

649
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,914
"We find it impossible to think
our teacher would hurt anyone," I quote.

650
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,916
"She's not that kind of person."

651
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,796
It goes on to say
that you've never resorted to violence

652
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,923
as a form of punishment.

653
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,508
[Yun-su sniffles]

654
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:51,847
Now, what I'm looking at
is the file I pulled from the orphanage.

655
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,684
When you were 12,
you pushed a friend down the stairs,

656
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,436
which left her with a broken leg.

657
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,479
[stirring music playing]

658
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,106
Looking at your reasoning here,

659
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,358
it appears you did it

660
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,069
because her face
was on the milk cartons at school.

661
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,322
"That big smile of hers
was driving me crazy."

662
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,782
"I had to push her down."

663
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,784
That's what you said.

664
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,831
Ms. An Yun-su,

665
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,251
which one is the real you?

666
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,257
[scoffs]

667
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,095
Nothing I said was gonna change anything.
I see it now.

668
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,764
You already made up your mind,
and I'm just…

669
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,851
We'll meet again.

Turn to your left.

Keep the sign facing this way.

681
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,901
Remove everything but your underwear.

682
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,986
Make it quick.

683
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:20,955
[guard 3] Raise both hands.

684
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,041
Turn around.

685
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,096
You've got a lot of tattoos
for a schoolteacher.

686
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,515
Anywhere else?

687
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,766
That's all of them.

688
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,643
[guard 2] Step onto the body scanner.

689
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,604
Lower your underwear.

690
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,319
Now squat like you're on the toilet.

695
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,976
Let's see how the new screwups look like!

00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,449
2784.

701
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,164
[music stops]

702
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:47,958
[fence rattles]

703
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,214
Killing a spouse,
how long do you get for that?

704
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,050
Twenty years or more?

705
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,220
What if you deny the charges
until the end?

706
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,724
[inmate 2] That would mean you're showing
no remorse. That's a life sentence.

707
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,935
If the husband was a sick prick,
they might be a little more lenient.

708
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:07,853
Right.

709
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,272
So it might work out for y'all. [laughs]

710
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,440
- Wow!
- Damn, girl!

711
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:15,319
Even if he's an absolute piece of shit,
how can you kill your baby's father?

712
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,404
You'd have to be a monster. [laughs]

713
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,823
Hey! You shitty-ass hoe.

714
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,618
You'd better keep your mouth shut,
or I'll cut you down.

715
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,577
[laughter]

716
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,372
Don't you fuckin' start crying again,
you cunt.

717
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,332
- Do it and see what happens.
- [inmate 4] Got it.

718
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:31,126
The second I hear a goddamn whimper,
I'm gonna tear you apart, bitch.

719
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,711
[inmate 4] I think that's enough.

720
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,089
[inmate 3] Be quiet.
You don't wanna test me, bitch.

721
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,298
Don't you fucking test me.

722
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,883
[groans]

723
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,718
You caught yourself another one.

724
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,053
- Is that it?
- [chuckles]

725
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,555
Still going for that,
"I'm not like the other prosecutors

726
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,517
who just read reports
and file indictments" shtick?

727
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,352
I get it.

728
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,314
That's great.

729
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,235
Although others may find it ridiculous.

730
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:00,698
I mean, it's quite obvious
you used to be a cop.

731
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:01,699
Hmm?

732
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,576
Nothing wrong with that if you ask me.

733
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,580
About that schoolteacher case.

734
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,874
I wanna make it big.

735
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,460
A little crime reenactment?

736
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,131
Is this because of the fraud case?

737
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,091
[laughing]

738
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,093
Some higher-ups asked me

739
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,179
to make sure the media people

740
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:28,809
wouldn't catch wind of any of this
and make 'em look like absolute fools.

741
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,687
I'm not trying to frame anyone here.

742
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,480
Just distract them a little.

743
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,281
Mmm.

744
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,658
[sighs]

745
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,576
[clears throat]

746
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,996
[Yun-su] Are you really sleeping?

747
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,539
THIS IS THE ORIGINAL UNALTERED VIDEO

748
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,791
- [Ki-dae] What's up? [groans]
- [phone chimes]

749
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,294
[Yun-su] Do you realize
we haven't done it this month?

750
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:56,712
[Ki-dae moans]

751
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,631
Sorry, babe. I've been so tired.

752
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,635
I see you've been keeping track, huh?

753
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,680
[Yun-su] I just want Sop
to have a sibling. All right?

754
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,140
[Ki-dae sighs]

755
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,435
[Ki-dae groans] Let's just sleep.

756
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,022
- [Ki-dae moans]
- [phone chimes]

757
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,067
[Yun-su sighs]

758
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,819
Pay attention, okay?

759
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,989
[Yun-su] I could kill you right now.

760
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,116
Everyone, you heard that?

761
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,701
DIGGING DEEPER WITH JOURNALIST HONG

762
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:32,289
This video is an actual look
inside a very disturbing case,

763
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:35,834
which saw a schoolteacher
assassinate her husband.

764
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:39,963
How mesmerizing to see her evil intention

765
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,965
in full display for the camera,

766
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,884
not knowing she's being filmed.

767
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,512
The anger inside her is actually palpable.

768
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,055
It's about to blow.

769
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,139
That poor husband.

770
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,099
Ah, he's about to get it.

771
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,144
Just because
he refused to have sex. [scoffs]

772

[sobs] Why are you doing this to me?
I don't deserve that.

793
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:58,917
That can't be true.

794
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,961
Calm down. We need--

795
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,881
Don't tell me to calm down
or stay quiet anymore!

796
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,925
Why can't you believe me?
Is that so difficult?

797
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,220
You're my lawyer.
Aren't you supposed to be on my side?

798
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:14,766
By the way, do you have any idea
who leaked the video?

799
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,853
- I put it out.
- [Mr. Hwang] What?

800
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,481
Mm, the evidence was solid.

801
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,941
So why bother?

802
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,192
I thought we could

803
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,445
give her a chance to reflect.

804
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:29,698
[lawyer] Ms. An.

805
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:33,493
Could you put that down, please?
Let's not get worked up.

806
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,954
What do you want me to do?

807

[breathes shakily]

808
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,584
You should think about your daughter.

809
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,712
[lawyer] You should think about
your little girl.

[clattering]

811
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,016

- [Yun-su] Bye!

812
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,559
- [student 2] Hi, ma'am!
- [Yun-su] Hey.

813
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,687
This morning,
she just stormed out of the house.

814
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,273
She was so excited for that sleepover.

815
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,860
[Ki-dae] <i>But she's never slept out before.</i>
<i>Do you think she's gonna be okay?</i>

816
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,820
<i>What if she cries at night?</i>

817
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,822
Don't worry. She'll be cool.

818
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,241
You should be prepping
for tonight instead.

819
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,661
[woman] <i>Hey, what do you want me</i>
<i>to do with this?</i>

820

821
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,039
Someone's there. I can tell.

822
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,209
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>
<i>She just dropped by to finish a piece.</i>

823
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,710
Oh Seo-won's there again?

824
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,630
What did I say? I don't want anybody
in there today. Why did she have to--

825
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,466
<i>Relax, it's just for a bit.</i>
<i>She'll be leaving soon enough.</i>

826
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:30,634
Hurry up.

827
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,135
Get rid of her. Okay?

828
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,888
- It wasn't easy to make this time for us.
<i>- I know.</i>

829

833
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:47,901
[woman] Yes.

834
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,028
- How many bottles did he get?
- He only got one.

835
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,280

- Let me take another.

836
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,240
[woman] All right.

00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,533
