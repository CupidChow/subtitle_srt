The ensemble you hear is our music majors.

8
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,922
Thank you for coming.

9
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,466
This is Jin Young-in.
His donation is over there.

10
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,009
[woman] We'll have to take a look.

11
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,474
Oh, hello. [chuckles]

12
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,481
[Young-in] Darling.

13
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,690
Hey, babe.

14
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,776
I'm late, aren't I? So sorry.

15
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,153
Director Kim. This is my wife.

16
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,656
Hello, I'm Choi Su-yeon.
It's so nice to meet you.

17
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,867
Oh, your reputation precedes you.
You're the cellist.

18
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,119
[laughs]

19
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,122
Thank you very much for donating
such a valuable painting.

20
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,414
Thanks to your donation…

21
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,042
Come on. Let's get it over with.

22
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,295
- Director Kim. Hello.
- [Mr. Kim] Glad you could make it.

23
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,048
- [Seo-won] Congratulations.
- [Mr. Kim] I'm glad you're here, Mr. Lee.

24
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,634
I'd like to introduce Jin Young-in,
a lawyer.

25
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:18,721
He was just recently appointed
as a professor here at our law school.

26
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,516
Jin Young-in has probably handled
more criminal cases

27
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,976
than any lawyer in Korea.

28
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,811
[chuckles] Nice to meet you.

29
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,771
[Ki-dae] A pleasure. Nice to meet you.

30
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,398
[Mr. Kim] Here, Mr. Lee. Come over here.

31
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,860
This is the artist, Lee Ki-dae.

32
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,822
I do everything I can to get him
to join the faculty here too.

33
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,366
But he's a stubborn one. [chuckles]

34
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,161
Oh, that's right. Come over here.

35
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,915
This African artist's getting
a lot of recognition lately.

36
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,375
Are you familiar?

37
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:48,877
Yeah.

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,589
I hear Chairman Hwang of H Group
also collects Sokoboako's work as well.

39
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,133
And his taste is unmatched.

40
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:58,720
So what does it feel like seeing it
in person? What do you think, Mr. Lee?

41
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:06,352
Uh, for most, it was the painter's
seeming originality that captured them,

42
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,438
but it turns out

43
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,232
they plagiarized an apprentice's work,

44
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:16,487
so sadly, they've been spending more time
in court than on art as a result.

45
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,947
[mysterious music playing]

46
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,073
[Mr. Kim chuckles]

47
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,409
Is that so?

48
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:26,372
You've shown how expert evaluations
prove so valuable.

49
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,770
[water running]

50
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,232
The director is always asking me
to evaluate the paintings

51
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,400
whenever someone donates one.

52
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,862
All the same,
no matter how many times I've done it,

53
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,239
makes me uncomfortable.

54
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,824
I don't wanna disrespect the artists,

55
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,535
but I had to
so that he'd stop asking for them.

56
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,469
[music fades]

57
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,428
Hey, babe.

58
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,431
I'm just leaving the campus now,
so I'll head straight to the kindergarten.

59
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,475
But I might be a little late.

60
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,435
Would you mind letting
Sop's teachers know?

61
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,438
No, no. I'll be there soon.
I called a cab already, so--

62
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,440
Mr. Lee. Hello.

63
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,485
Oh, uh, hello?

64
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,529
Sorry, where do I know…

65
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,284
Uh, I'm from the law school.
Jin Young-in the professor.

66
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,370
We were introduced by Director Kim
at the opening of the gallery.

67
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,538
The, uh, Sokoboako.

68
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,039
You evaluated it, remember?

69
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,874
Ah. Oh, yeah.

70
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,711
Thing is, I've been trying
to come and see you.

71
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,880
I think that Director Kim
may have misunderstood something.

72
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,675
What you said about Sokoboako that day
is what's worrying me.

73
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,761
Ah, I'm sorry, but I don't have time.
I'm running late. Excuse me.

74
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,389
- But--
- [Ki-dae] Yeah, no. The cab's here.

75
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:22,030
You owe me an apology, Mr. Lee.
Listen to me.

76
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,156
The plagiarism ruling.

77
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,949
The courts confirm
that you were incorrect.

78
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,701
- So naturally, you should apologize.
<i>- Look.</i>

79
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,703
The director's impression of me
has been degraded

80
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,788
by your inappropriate statements.

81
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,416
Come on. Is this something really worth
all these calls and visits?

82
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:37,879
What do you expect? Whether I call
or text, you keep on ignoring me.

83
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,214
Don't you think that's rude?
I expect an apology.

84
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,383
<i>No. And don't contact me again.</i>

85
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,344
- [disconnect tone]
- What? Are you there?

I just need an apology, that's--

Mr. Baek.

104
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,176
I think this is Ko Dong-uk's phone. Look.

105
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,387
There are his texts with Ko Se-hun,
and these are an exact match

106
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,347
for the photos Ms. An sent us.

107
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,433
[Dong-hun] All right, sir.

108
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,727
Is anything missing?

109
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,812
Nothing's been stolen.

110
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,482
[Jeong-gu] It was Young-in.

111
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,650
He was blatantly provoking Ko Dong-uk.

112
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,528
Yeah, he must've seen Ko's anger
outside the courthouse after Mo's trial.

113
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,072
[crowd murmuring]

114
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,700
[camera shutters clicking]

115
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,912
[Jeong-gu] He didn't ask any questions
after receiving these photos.

116
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,497
Wouldn't he wanna know

117
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,500
who sent these and why?
Who's behind all this?

118
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,335
I'm sure he was confused.

119
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,629
So then he

120
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,299
probably started fixating
on what he could see.

121
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,639
[music fades]

122
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,850
Ko Dong-uk's been transferred
to the hospital.

123
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,144
Okay, now we need
to find Mr. Jin Young-in.

124
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,939
And An Yun-su
almost likely will be nearby.

125
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,649
Yeah, I'm on it, sir.

126
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:49,362
Detective Nam, run the plates on his car
and see if we can pinpoint his location.

127
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:53,032
Detective Bae, find his home address.
Actually, go there in person.

128
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,200
Affirmative.

129
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,792
The Ko Se-hun case.

130
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,336
I lied. There is no evidence.

131
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,173
You must've known
it wouldn't hold up for long.

132
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,050
Why lie?

133
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,678
I used it as bait.

134
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,640
I think I know who the killer is,
and I need help to catch them.

135
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,104
You mean my lawyer?

136
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,815
[stirring music playing]

137
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,483
He pretended to be me

138
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,653
and sent threatening messages
to your phone

139
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,530
<i>on the day he visited me</i>

140
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,824
<i>at the detention center.</i>

141
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,827
Wait, you didn't send them?

142
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,956
If I had a phone, then I probably
would've said the same thing.

143
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,794
To make sure you'd go through with it
and kill him without a second thought.

144
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,340
I don't think he's alone in this.

145
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,636
His wife's always by his side.

146
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,765
[Eun] <i>So why did you step up to defend me?</i>

147
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,892
[Young-in] My wife suggested it.

148
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,812
She said your confession
gave an innocent person

149
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,731
a chance to clear her name.

150
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,484
And I agreed with her.

151
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,990
There's a boy who saw it all.

152
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,285
He was a witness.

153
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,829
The boy saw Ko Se-hun die.

154
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,832
I went to see him before I came to you.

155
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:25,833
And who is it?

156
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,461
And what… what did…

157
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,046
How much did he see?

158
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,633
[tense music playing]

159
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,968
Hey, what the fuck are you doing? [grunts]

160
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,179
Don't kill me. Please don't kill…

00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,361
[Eun] Ko Se-hun…

167
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,821
Who's his killer?

168
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,909
You already know.

169
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,827
Who?

170
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,456
That art teacher who killed her husband.

I was too fucking freaked out.

that's Mr. Jin, then?

This was Se-hun's phone.

How would he have known
to send them to this phone?

190

Have you…

191
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,458
by chance, met this person before?

192
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,422
He paid a visit to my house.

193
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:40,050
It was not long after
An Yun-su's visit and yours.

194
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:41,969
He came to talk.

What was the gist of the conversation?

196
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,182
[Dong-uk] He said he came to say sorry.

197
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,769
That he owed me an apology
as that woman's lawyer.

198
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:55,107
That if he'd known about their scheme,
the deal between them,

199
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,778
that Ko Se-hun wouldn't have died.

200
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,324
And?

202
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,536
[Dong-uk] This woman, she's

00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,039
familiar.

204
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,417
[Su-yeon] You must be waiting
for your grandchild.

they'll always be your little baby.

206

if they could grow up more slowly.

[Dong-uk] What are you trying to say?

208
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,945
So it's that couple

209
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,781
that killed my grandson?

210
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,534
- It's more that--
- Yes.

211
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,913
That is our suspicion.

212
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,002
[Dong-uk] That witch said something
along the same lines.

213
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,631
That An Yun-su didn't do it.

214
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,136

Now can you tell me where you are?

It's a video taken the day
that Ko Se-hun was killed.

[judge] Counsel.

Make your case.

433
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,617
How did something so wrong happen at all?

434
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,496
On April 15th, 2022,

435
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,209
the defendant's husband,
Lee Ki-dae, was killed in his studio.

436
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,212
Ms. An arrived at the scene where

437
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,965
she found her husband
bleeding to death and called emergency,

438
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,550
begging for assistance.

439
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,470
That's the moment
this tragedy was set in motion.

440
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,015
In prison, she made a deal.

441
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,643
An awful deal with a murderer.

442
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,063
She knew how very wrong
and how terrible that deal was,

443
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,689
but she made it anyway.

444
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,735
That's because she knew then
that it was her only choice.

445
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,239
And indeed, if she hadn't taken it,

446
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,783
then none of us
would be here now in this room.

447
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,496
My client, An Yun-su,

448
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,957
is not only a victim,

449
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,834
but also a survivor.

450
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:40,088
She needed to reclaim her life
for herself and for her daughter.

451
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,799
So she survived
by taking the only path available.

452
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,467
Now…

453
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,387
let me ask you again.

454
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,473
How could something
so wrong happen at all?

455
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,726
And if we find a way to right that wrong,

456
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,146
would her life ever go back
to the way it was before?

457
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,983
[pensive music playing]

458
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,694
All that being said,

459
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,447
I continue to hope that in time, it will.

460
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,284
Nothing further, Your Honor.

461
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,122
[judge] In the matter
of the consolidated charges

462
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:18,459
against the defendant, Ms. An Yun-su,
the Court delivers the following judgment.

463
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,296
Defendant, An Yun-su,

464
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,966
in the principal charge
of murdering Lee Ki-dae,

465
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,427
the Court finds the defendant not guilty.

466
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,511
[murmuring]

467
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,933
[judge] The Court will now address
the remaining consolidated charges.

468
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:38,104
Under Article 25 of the Criminal Act,
attempted murder, guilty.

469
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,356
Under Article 255,

470
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,610
preparation and conspiracy
to commit murder, guilty.

471
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:48,948
And under Article 276,
unlawful confinement, guilty.

472
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,742
Now for the sentencing.

473
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,703
The court hereby sentences An Yun-su

474
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:57,373
to two years of imprisonment,
suspended for three years.

475
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,210
The reasoning behind this sentence,
especially regarding the charges

476
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,005
of attempted murder
and unlawful confinement.

477
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:08,051
The decision to reduce the sentence
was deeply impacted by a petition

478
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,928
submitted by the victim's family.

479
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,138
The Court would like to note this.

480
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,939
[Dong-uk] It's a petition.

481
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,777

[music fades]

483

…Se-hun had admitted what he did wrong

484
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,618
and was given the proper punishment?

485
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,789
How would that have changed things?

486
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,458
If that had been the case,

487
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,379
I suppose a lot would be different…

488
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,132
if he had done that.

[gentle piano music playing]

490
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,846
Throughout my time on the case…

491
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,018
there were moments
the thought crossed my mind

492
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,771
that Ms. An Yun-su
might not be the killer.

493
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,774
Each time, I would push it out.

494
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:09,028
Using the victims' deaths
to vindicate my actions

495
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,698
and using my desire for justice

496
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,574
to label her a murderer.

497
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,955
So I just kept believing
in only the things clear to me.

498
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,918
I should've hesitated…

499
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,338
but I was obsessed.

500
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,301
That's why even though I knew

501
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,637
how poisonous your rage would be
after they died…

502
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,266
I did nothing about it…

503

It has a fingerprint on it.

516
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,518
Fingerprint?

517
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,020
Yes. It was printed
after the artist's passing.

518
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,939
It seemed to convey
a certain meaning in itself,

519
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,650
so we used the original plate as is.

520
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,361
Good to know.

521
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,030
It's an original. There is only one print.

A mono edition,
quite unusual in etching, actually.

523

Don't worry.

no additional prints will be made.
