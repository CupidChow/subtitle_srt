you'll never get to see
your daughter again.

What if your actions were in self-defense?

17
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,069
An unintentional killing
in the heat of the moment.

18
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:54,823
That could be a mitigating factor,
reducing your sentence to eight years.

19
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,991
On good behavior, maybe even five.

20
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,868
It'll save you from moral backlash.

21
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,286
And when the time comes,

22
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:05,458
your daughter will understand
why you were forced to make that decision.

[judge] Ms. An.

50
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:46,893
Anyone wrongly accused would normally
refuse to a crime scene reenactment.

51
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:50,563
So why did you agree to do it,
only to deny it partway through?

52
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,814
Because I didn't do it.

53

Excuse me, what are your thoughts
on today's verdict, sir?

66

It was the natural outcome,
reached through a lawful process, and…

67
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,898
rather than celebrating the win,

68
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,818
what matters is that justice was served.

I worked as a dental assistant

like gnarled branches.

180
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,476
<i>Both of their bodies</i>

181
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,355
writhed around and around repeatedly.

182
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,815
Slowly,

183
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:32,900
<i>little by little…</i>

184
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,405
they died.

185
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,324
[music intensifies]

186
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,751
[Dr. Lee] Ms. Mo Eun,

187
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,795
about that couple.

188
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,631
You said you worked with them for a year.

189
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,050
How do you imagine they felt,

190
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,261
dying in front of you?

191
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:07,268
I imagine, like, their hearts
were being shredded and set on fire.

192
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,521
Must've been in agony.

193
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,733
All the while, probably regretting
what they'd put me through.

194
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,158
Do you like cats?

195
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,784
[music fades]

196
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,662
[sniffles] I used to have one.

197
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,582
Mm. Oh, did you play with it often?

198
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,792
I didn't.

199
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:36,172
Hmm. Did you ever hit it
or hurt it in any way?

200
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,342
You shouldn't do that kind of thing.

201
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,096
Not to animals who can't speak,
no matter what they did.

202
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,308
Then why would you go
that far with the couple?

203
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,644
No matter what they put you through,
they were people.

204
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,355
You shouldn't do that to people. Right?

205
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,942
That's exactly why I did it.

206
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,909
[rustling]

207
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,957
Okay.

208
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,295
Can you point to the person who's crying
because they're sad?

209
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,552
Are we doing psychopath testing?

210
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,929
[eerie music playing]

211
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,264
Doctor,

212
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,060
do I look like a psychopath to you?

213
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,773
[eerie music intensifies]

214
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,609
[Detective Bae] Sir, let us through!
Hey, someone's gonna get hurt!

215
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,028
Hey, come on! Hey! Stairs! The stairs!

216
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,239
[Detective Bae] Come on. Move. Move!

217
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,324
[reporter 3] Do you believe
in the justice system?

218
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,118
Someone's gonna get hurt!
We'll do this later! Later!

219
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,621
- Yeah! Don't push!
- [reporter 4] Say something! A few words!

220
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,915
[reporter 5] Just one. Excuse me.
Let me ask one question!

221
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,250
Just one! The victims had a son!

222
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:59,296
Please! Do you have anything at all
to say to the boy who you left an orphan?

223
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,841
- [camera shutters clicking]
- [tense music playing]

224
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:09,265
[Eun] As I'm sure you know, little boy,
your mom and dad weren't such good people.

225
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,726
Your crime is being their child…

226
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,231
and now you're paying for it too.

227
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,858
[reporter 6] What made you do it?

228
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,943
[reporters clamoring]

229
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,698
[tense music continues]

230
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,916

231
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,337
Inmate 2784.

232
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,048
Inmate 2784, An Yun-su.

233
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,551
Go to Visiting Room 4.

234
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,220
[inmate 1] Thanks for coming.

235
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,306
[indistinct chattering]

236
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,104
Why did you do it?

237
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,648
Why did you go through
with the reenactment?

238
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,234
And how'd Ki-dae end up as a villain?

239
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,653
What exactly happened between you two?

240
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,866
Yun-su.

241
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,329
I'm on your side no matter what,
so just tell me everything.

242
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,706
Tell you what?

243
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,085
Whether I killed Ki-dae or not?

244
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,088
Is that what you wanna ask?

245
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,799
You know I'm not asking you that.

246
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,638
I said everything I had to say.

247
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,182
[Yun-su sniffles, sighs]

248
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,100
How's Sop doing?

249
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,646
I miss her, but she can't visit. Right?

250
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,318
What?

251
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,113
Something happen to Sop?

252
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,618
Yun-su, I…

253
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,371
[woman breathes deeply]

254
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,914
- [boy] Mom.
- Hmm?

255
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,875
A friend told me
that Sop's mom killed her dad.

256
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,253
[melancholy piano music playing]

257

[woman] <i>Jun-u found out.</i>

258
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,344
He's been avoiding Sop.

259
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,263
I know it can't be true,

260
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,517
but I don't think I can keep doing this.

261
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,643
[woman sobs]

262
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,646
No, no, Mun-jun.

263
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,898
What about Sop?

264
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,694
What is she supposed to do all alone?

265
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,949
Mun-jun. Mun-jun, I can get out of here.

266
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,411
I didn't kill Ki-dae. You know that!

267
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,081
Us knowing the truth
won't change anything.

268
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:43,252
No matter how loud we scream,
it's not true. No one listens.

269
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,255
[Mun-jun breathing shakily]

270
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,841
Listen, I found a good place for Sop.

271
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,385
The people there are very kind.

272
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,471
- I'll visit her every weekend.
- [buzzer plays]

273

- [guard 1] <i>Visiting time is over.</i>
- [Mun-jun] I'm sorry.

274
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,645
I'll make sure Sop's well taken care of.

275
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,563
I'm sorry.

280
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,508
[inmate 2] How long you think she'll last?

281
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,303
I bet my special meals
she hangs herself in a month.

282
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,599
You stupid cunt!

283
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:43,062
Ah! I was trying to concentrate
and could finally poop! You fucking bitch!

284

Stupid fucking bitch!
What, what? What are you crying about?

285
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,107
Fucking bitch. What are you crying about?

286
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,735
Your fuckin' kid won't see you anymore?
That's it? Fuck's sake!

287
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,280
She never wants to see you again!
You're a murderer who killed her dad!

288
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:57,367
Yeah, no shit. Can you fucking blame her?
You worthless bitch. Fuck.

289
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,786
Hey, you dumb fuck.

290
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,330
Try thinking about it
with your stupid little head!

291
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,500
How's she supposed to call the bitch
who killed her dad "Mom"?

292
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,335
You listen to me, you bag of shit!

293
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,296
From now on, for the rest of your days,

294
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,549
your child is gonna think of you
as a goddamn bitch, you fucking moron!

You fucking bitch!

The hell are you looking at, cunt?

- Be quiet!

Walk.

[inmate 6 and 7]
Hey, hey, hey, hey! You, come here!

327
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,976
Get against the wall.

328
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,103
- Against the wall!
- [inmate 8] Did she hurt herself?

329
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,898
[inmate 9] No, she got in a fight
with that Wal-sun in Cell 5.

That's why she ended up like that. Damn.

338
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,345
[inmate 12] Apparently, she got her head
slammed into the wall,

339
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,305

I bet you're probably thinking,

"You think that matters to a person
who wants to die?" Right?

348
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,798
I hear that.

they usually do it
by smashing their heads into rocks.

351
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,430
[Wal-sun] Hey, she…

352
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,056
- Hey, stop her!
- Hey, what are you doing?

353
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,474
- Hurry up! Go!
- Stop that!

354
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,727
- Hey, stop that! Stop!
- [Yun-su screams]

355
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,981
[inmate 5] Have you gone mad?
Are you actually insane? Stop, you… Stop!

356
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,024
- Oh shit.
- Over here!

357
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,817
I swear this bitch has gone mad. Stop!

358
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,861
[inmate 5] What are you doing?
Are you crazy? Stop!

359
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,364
[doctor] But you know,
even animals won't kill themselves

360
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,158
if they have young ones to take care of.

361
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,995
I heard you have a little girl
on the outside.

362
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,372
You don't wanna be
less than an animal, do you?

363
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,542
I'll take her back
if the treatment's done.

364
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,755
Whoa, ma'am.
Don't lift your head. Just lie back down.

365
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,006
Mmm.

366
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,718
- You're taking her to solitary, right?
- [woman] Yes.

367
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,345
She really should stay here right now.

368
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,722
Things can turn critical
because it's a head injury.

369
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,475
Uh, let's let her eat here,

370
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,810
and I'll monitor her
for dizziness and nausea.

371
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,982
Please don't engage in
any unnecessary conversation.

372
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,069
[scoffs] Yes, ma'am.

373
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,160
Meal time.

374
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,662
Hey.

375
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,414
[inmate 14] I'm hungry. Come on.

376
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,583
[inmate 15] Give us a decent portion
like the others.

377
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,086
- You're getting plenty.
- [inmate 14] Ugh, just pass it along.

378
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,007
- Mmm.
- [sighs]

379
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,350
Oh, we forgot to haze her
before sitting down to eat.

380
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:17,396
Sis. Food always comes first, right?

381
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,898
Even Mount Kumgang
must be seen after a meal.

382
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,316
What should we do?

383
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,985
Hazing can wait,
but if we're going to eat together,

384
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,321
we should at least
learn each other's names.

385
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,951
So, hon, what are you in for?

386
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,911
Scamming rich guys?

387
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,496
Drugs?

388
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,166
Murder.

389
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,712
[laughing]

390
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,755
Hey.

391
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,718
You murdered someone
with that face and those chopstick arms?

392
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,012
So how'd you do it?

393
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,390
My arms are skinny,

394
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,226
but they're strong enough
to poison their food.

395
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:00,397
They were writhing,
their organs burning from the inside out.

396
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,857
That's how I killed them.

397
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:08,363
[sighs] Oh shit. Listen to this newbie,
spouting complete horseshit.

398
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,740
It's not horseshit.

399
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,617
Do you want me to show it to you?

400
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,872
I could whip it up right now
with a few pills from around here.

401
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,498
You're smiling?

402
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,545
I'm going to fucking kill you,
you fucking bitch!

403
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,881
- You little piece of shit!
- [inmate 2] Oh my God!

404
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,716
- [inmate 1] Goddamn bitch!
- [both exclaim]

405
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,093
[inmate 1] Smile again,
you fucking cunt! Yeah!

406
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,263
Come on! Smile again!
I dare you, you little fucker!

407
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,431
Bring it on!

408
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,224
Fuckin' bitch!

409
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,059
Get up, you fucking cunt.

410
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,479
Let's give you a proper initiation.
Get over there!

411
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,938
[loud clattering]

412
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,651
Who the fuck do you think you are,
disrespecting me like that

413
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,570
'cause you killed someone?

414
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,323
You fuck! Why don't you kill me too, cunt?

415
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,158
Try and kill me, you fucking whore!

416
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,826
Goddamn it!

417
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,955
[panting]

418
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,501
So much goddamn attitude
from someone who ain't fucking shit.

419
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,002
[tense music playing]

420
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,921
[grunting]

421
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,088
[inmate 3] Oh my gosh!

422
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,090
- [grunting]
- [inmates screaming]

423
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,885
This is your carotid right here.

424
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,179
The most vital part of the human body.

425
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,765
A tiny tear,
and your blood sprays everywhere.

426
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,850
There's no way
the infirmary could help you.

427
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,645
You'll bleed out
before you get to the hospital.

428
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:22,979
What?

429
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,606
Still think it's horseshit?

430
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,984
I can show you all right now.

431
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,697
What do you say?

432
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,078
- [alarm bell ringing]
- [buzzer blares]

433
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,296
[buzzer, alarm stop]

434
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,425
- [beep]

435

436
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,523
[chains clattering]

437
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,109
- [lock clicks]
- [door opens]

438
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,490
[lock clicks]

439
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,161

Hey! Hey!

[screams]

443
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,751
[guard] Why? What's the matter?

444
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,919
A spider!

445
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,922
[sighs] Inmate 407,
are you kidding me right now?

446
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,007
I have arachnophobia,

447
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,677
so even a tiny spider
can render me paralyzed. [screams]

448
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,054
- Help me! Help me! I need to get out now!
- [banging on door]

449
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,932
- [guard] Fine, come on out.
- Now! Now! I need to get out! [screams]

450
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,726
[whimpers]

[door lock clicks]

454
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,957
There aren't any cobwebs in this room,
so get in.

455
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,126
It's fine in here, yeah?

456
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,794
You checked it out?

457
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,972
[door lock clicks]

458
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,352
If you see another one,
you gotta tell me right away.

459
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,978
Don't make it a problem later.

460
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,275

[Eun in English]
You want to get out of here, don't you?

471
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,449
Who's there?

472
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,706
[Eun] I saw you on the news.

473
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,921
You were begging people
to please believe you.

474
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,508
"I didn't kill him."

475
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,553
"Please believe me."

476
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,723
"I didn't do it."

477
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,645
Never seen anyone
look so desperate before.

478
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,272
Who are you?

479
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:23,947
A witch.

480
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,783
A murderer.

481
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,370
A psychopath.

482
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,709
I could be an angel to you if you let me.

483
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,464

I'll confess to killing him.

Admitting to more murder

Hey, look who wants to talk now.

00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,198
I wanna know if there are newspapers.

520
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,451
Why would you need newspapers
while we're eating?

00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,047
Guess she likes the news, guys.

525
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,632
- [inmate 2] Newspaper?
- [Wal-sun] Yeah.

526
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,718
Should've given them to her sooner.

527
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,188

MURDER SUSPECT'S MOTIVE SPARKS DEBATE

530
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,993
SUSPECT ADMITS TO CRIME WITH BLANK FACE

531
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,581
SUSPECT WATCHED THEM DIE

532
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,332
NOTORIOUS WITCH
REMORSELESS WITCH

533
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,342
[Wal-sun sighs] Fucking bitch.
So damn noisy. Fuck.

534

537
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:43,206
You must be thinking,
"Who's she to say all this crazy stuff?"

538
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,751
You're right. It is crazy.

539
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,380
It's the kind of thing
that no one in their right mind would do.

540
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,718

543
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:03,518
[Eun] <i>…I know we'll end up doing</i>
<i>this crazy thing.</i>

544
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,895
- [guard] Get in the cell.
- Inmate 2784.

545
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,230
[gasps] What…

546
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,982
I called you, and you're not responding.

547
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,820
Your attorney sent over
a notice of withdrawal.

548
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,409
I was gonna fire him anyway.

549
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,496
You know you can't go to trial
for a murder case

550
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,164
without an attorney, right?

551
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,334
If you can't find one in time,

552
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,920
then they'll have to assign you
a public defender.

553
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,386
As I'm sure you're aware,

554
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,805
this trial isn't about
whether or not you're guilty.

555
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:45,101
You were arrested at the scene
and already admitted to everything.

556
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,520
The only thing we can argue about
is sentencing,

557
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,730
but honestly, I don't think…

558
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,402
Let's go with showing
as much remorse as possible.

559
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,988
If we highlight
the victims' wrongful deeds,

560
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,406
you'll avoid the death penalty.

561
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,200
If you're lucky,
you might get as few as 20 years.

562
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,619
How's that sound?

563
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,122
I don't care about any of that.

564
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,332
I just want help with one thing.

565
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,836
What? You want a psych evaluation
or something? [chuckles]

566
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,213
They won't allow for that.

567
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,841
And even so, that doesn't work in Korea.

568
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,721
I won't get labeled as some crazy bitch.

569
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,057
I just want a trial with a jury.

570
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,393
[laughs]

571
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,644
All right, look.

572
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,271
That route would only work

573
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:34,400
if you've got something worth appealing
to the jury members, but you don't.

574
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,777
Isn't that better for you as well?

575
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:41,574
'Cause with a jury trial,
you get a verdict in a day.

576
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:44,994
Or do you wanna keep dealing
with someone like me?

Criminal Panel Trial Number 415.

the trial of defendant Mo Eun

613
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,181
who stands accused for the murder
of Ko Byeong-su and Lee Ye-rim.

[murmuring subsides]

617
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,957
On June 2nd, 2022,
at approximately 4:00 p.m.,

618
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,210
the defendant, Mo Eun,

619
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:42,046
murdered the couple,
Ko Byeong-su and Lee Ye-rim,

620
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,340
at their home in Ilsan,

621
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,050
Gyeonggi Province,

622
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:50,388
by lacing their food
with a pre-prepared poison, aconitine.

623
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,352
Furthermore, Ms. Mo Eun stood by
and watched the victims suffer in agony

624
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,897
for about 20 minutes as they died,
taking no action to help them.

625
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,316
An act both grotesque and disturbing.

626
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,818
[ticking]

627
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,070
Your Honor, I would like

628
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,989
to address you
and the members of the jury.

629
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,867
Through this case,
we have witnessed the sheer brutality

630
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,661
of the defendant's crimes.

631
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,664
This was not merely a crime
rooted in personal conflict.

632
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,833
It was a direct affront
to society in general.

633
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:23,379
Therefore, I ask the court to impose
the maximum penalty permitted by law.

634
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:26,715
Life imprisonment for the defendant,
Mo Eun.

635

00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,851
- Counsel.
- Yes?

638
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,812
You've been rather quiet today.

639
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,731
Will you be making a closing argument?

640
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,526
No, Your Honor.

641

642
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,696
All right.

643
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,824
Members of the jury,

644
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:56,078
this trial is not about determining
guilt or innocence.

645
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:59,748
Your responsibility today is to deliberate
upon the appropriate sentence

646
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,208
for the defendant.

647
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:05,296
Deciding on another person's sentence
is a very challenging task.

648
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,756
Ms. Mo.

649
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,051
Would you please rise?

650
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,976
Any last remarks
you'd like to say to the jury?

651
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:22,021
If you would,
you can address the jury directly.

652
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,863
[sighs]

653
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,449
Well, Your Honor…

654
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:40,331
there's another murder
that I'm responsible for.

- [chilling music playing]

00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,378

Ms. Mo.

660
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:57,973
Can you… Would you repeat that?
Did you say another murder?

661
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,017
Yes.

662
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,103
Ms. Mo, the…

663
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,814
the court is a solemn place.

664
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,318
Everything you say here must be truthful.

665
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,028
I suggest

666
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,614
you think carefully before you answer.

667

[chilling music continues]

668
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,412
I am confessing that there is…

669
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,292
there's someone else I murdered.
