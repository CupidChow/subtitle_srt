put the sentry gun there.

Why?

00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,922
No, I'll take the downstairs.
You cover me from up here.

Fucking watch your back!

That's the worst location
for the sentry. God!

Take out that shit first.

They're coming in force.

Come on, get up there! They're inside.

Look, I don't think
that I would prepare these

72
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,254
for just anyone,
but since it's you, Mr. Jin,

73
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,923
what are you planning to do with them?

74
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,090
Well, you see,

75
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,010
didn't they find
two wine bottles at the scene?

76
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,345
Yeah.

77
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,431
So then, wouldn't it be possible
the bottle with An Yun-su's fingerprints

78
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,016
wasn't the weapon after all?

79
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,351
[sighs]

80
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,645
[Jeong-gu] Did you confirm
that the bottle with her prints

81
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,522
was the same one with the victim's blood?

82
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,439
No.

83
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,483
Why wouldn't you?

84
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,443
Well, it was never requested
by the prosecution.

85
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,153
Perhaps we can make a request, then?

86
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,864
The murderer has made their confession.
Why would you come to me now?

87
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,616
Is she reliable?

88
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,744
She's emotionally unstable,

89
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,539
so I need hard evidence that can clear
my client of the murder charges.

90
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,333
Your course of action should be
to request it from the authorities.

91
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,627
Aw, come on.
You know the prosecution would reject it.

92
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,712
Then I suppose
that's all the help I can offer.

93
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,965
- Whoa.
- [Jeong-gu] Hey, Mr. Jin.

94
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,927
Are you free for dinner this evening?
It'll be my treat.

95
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,557
The court has granted you
some leniency for now.

96
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:18,975
I appreciate it.

97
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,352
Well, I, uh…

98
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,688
- Oh, thank you so much.
- I'm not the one to thank.

99
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,440
There are conditions.
There will be no further leniency.

100
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,985
If you're found to have broken the law
one more time,

101
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,487
your bail status will be fully revoked.

102
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,823
There are no exceptions to this condition

103
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,825
under any circumstances.
Do you understand?

104
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,454
Just… have a look.

105
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,707
Do you know what this is?

106
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,501
I don't.

107
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,961
This is a log of your location.

108
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:51,882
Your movements are being tracked
and recorded every hour of every day.

109
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,136
If anything were to happen
at any location listed on this log,

110
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,471
you would become suspect number one.

111
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,682
I don't think I need to explain
why that would be bad.

[high-pitched tone]

114
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,608
[Sun-deok] Above all else, it's imperative
that you not get yourself involved

115
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,443
in any kind of trouble.

116
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,029
Even if a crime is committed
right in front of you,

117
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,323
you should ignore it and walk away.

118
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,158
Pay no attention to it, okay?

119
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,119
And, uh, you must call us right away

120
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,204
if you find yourself
in an unavoidable situation.

121
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,248
That's the only way
we'll be able to protect you.

122
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,542
Okay.

123
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,002
Let's begin the session.

124
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,714
How have you been? How's it going?

125
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,425
Aside from just taking Sop to school,

126
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,636
it seems like you're keeping busy
during the day.

[suspenseful music continues]

128
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,390
I think maybe today,
I'd prefer not to talk.

129
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,852
I don't really have much to say.

130
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,066
If it's okay with you,
but I have to report this to the court.

131
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,025
Is that fine?

132
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,277
Yeah.

133
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,825
I'm afraid I can't let you leave
until 5:00 though.

134

[Sun-deok sighs]

135
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,964
Do you wanna listen to the radio?

136
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,008
Better than awkward silence anyway.

[Young-in] Yeah.

00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,191
Okay. [groans]

143
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,611
When you asked for an introduction,
I wasn't expecting this.

144
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,155
Let me offer you
my appreciation and respect.

145

146
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,911
Well, you have my respect too, Mr. Jang.

Come on. [chuckles]

148
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,707
You've got grit. I mean it.

149
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,084
I appreciate it.

150
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,171
I wanted to ask.
How was Ms. An during the trial?

151
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,506
Any particular behaviors?

152
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,632
What do you mean?

153
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,136
Well, Mo Eun seemed to hint at suicide.
You know, not much time left.

154
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,640
I mean, she seemed
pretty racked with anxiety.

155
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,935
So much that she couldn't even focus
on the trial.

156
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:13,149
What about Mo Eun?
What does Ms. An think of her?

157
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,859
Well, what do you mean?

158
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,319
I mean, she's the one
who murdered her husband,

159
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,572
but she's also the one
who cleared her name.

160
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,116
Good question.

161
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,994
But honestly,
I'm not sure what Ms. An thinks of her.

162
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,579
I can't say for sure,

163
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:30,708
but Mo Eun definitely
has a way of making her anxious.

164

00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,949
Hey, stop! You're gonna kill her!
She's gonna kill her!

355
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,326
- Shit, what the fuck are you doing?
- Inmate 407.

356
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,869
- Get off her!
- Stop, Inmate 407.

357
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,579
- Stop her! Stop!
- Get off!

358
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,331
Stop! Get off! [grunts]

359
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,044
[thumping echoes]

360
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,641

361
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:03,478
[all breathing heavily]

362
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,034
[gasps]

363
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,744
[Pudgy] Hey, hey!

364
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,788
She's awake!

365
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,541
She's waking up!

366
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:30,547
I told Ms. Eom everything.
I told her you did it to try and save me.

367
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:35,468
The doctor said that if it wasn't for you,
I really would have been killed.

368
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,848
[sobs] Thank you. I really owe you!

369
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,266
[Pudgy crying]

370
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,605
Do you mind getting off me now?

371
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:49,983
Oh.

372
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,361
[groans]

373
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,989
[handcuffs rattle]

374
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,199
I couldn't see clearly what was happening.

375
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,994
I saw someone on the floor
and you hitting them, so…

376
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:03,163
And it was exactly the right call.

377
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,668
See, she's got a thick layer
of subcutaneous fat.

378
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,588
That would effectively render
standard chest compressions useless.

379
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,797
Look straight ahead.

380
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,595
Any dizziness or disorientation?

381
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,513
Do I have to be handcuffed?

382
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,017
I don't have that authority.

383
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,814
I can't.

384
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,400
[radio beeps]

385
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,653
[guard] <i>Ms. Eom, HQ is calling for you.</i>

386
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,739
Can I, um, take these two back, then?

387
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,074
[doctor] You can take her back.

388
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:42,577
But as for her, it was a head injury,
so I'll keep her for observation.

389
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,087
These should help for nausea and pain.

390
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,554
I'll just take this.

391
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,187
Oh.

392
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,815
May I ask what your job was
on the outside?

393
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:17,070
See, when you were trying
to save her, well…

394
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,239
Chest compressions,
skipping mouth-to-mouth.

395
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,281
How'd you know that?

396
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,034
Those are the latest recommendations
from the Cardiology Society.

397
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,246
And you picked those painkillers
based on the shape just now, right?

398
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,749
I bet you worked
in the field in some capacity.

399
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,209
Were you a nurse?

400
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,336
Or a med student, maybe?

401
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,090
You don't get scared?

402
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,550
Huh?

403
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,301
Have you

404
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,804
always been this talkative?

405
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:43,972
[chuckles]

406
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,101
I mean, I used to get scared,

407
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,311
but this job changed that about me,
I guess.

408
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,523
And yes, I'm definitely a talker.

409
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,066
[laughs, sighs]

410
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,488
[mysterious music playing]

411
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,174
[sighs]

412
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:06,262
Well, you found something
the investigators must've missed.

413
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,432
It looks like a woman's watch to me.

414
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,686
Am I wrong?
Mo Eun wears a watch like this.

415
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,857
I remember thinking it looked
out of place on her in the courtroom.

416
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,360
<i>And if she wore it to court,</i>
<i>then we can assume</i>

417
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,736
she's pretty attached to it.

418
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,240
I think it's possible

419
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,993
we just found the lead we're looking for.

420
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,789
[music fades]

421
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,460
[phone buzzing]

422
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,837
[Young-in] Yes, hello, Mr. Jang.

423
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,673
Oh, what special favors
are you asking for now?

424
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,133
I've still got a stiff back
from the last one.

425
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:46,761
Yeah?

426
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,057
And you're sure about that?

427
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,143
Ms. Eom must feel bad
about the head injury.

428
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,145
She let me bring coffee in
from the outside.

429
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,319
Are you going to drink that?

430
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,989
[chuckles] It's yours.

431
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:16,791
What?

432
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,419
It doesn't suit me?

433
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:20,712
That's not it, but…

434
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,965
I guess that watch is special.

435
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,425
Yeah.

436
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,428
Earlier today,

437
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,430
I was talking with Ms. An's attorney.

438
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,140
He gave me a phone call.

439
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,892
He asked if I could, um,

440
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,852
bring your watch with me.

441
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,815
There were stains
found at the crime scene,

442
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,568
and one of them had a mark
like a watch was resting there.

443
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,034
So I guess they're looking
to compare it to mine and see?

444
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,913
Yun-su's

445
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,000
pretty active since she made it out.

446
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,714
[mysterious music playing]

447
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,760
They would need a proper warrant
to take it. Wouldn't they?

448
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,553
True, if they're following procedure.

449
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,138
Can they get one issued, then?

450
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,182
That's exactly why he called.

451
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,059
He wanted me to talk to you.

452
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,771
[Eun] <i>Just so you know,</i>

453
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,566
should maybe you or your lawyer
find any evidence

454
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,445
that can prove I'm not the killer,
you'll be right back in trouble again.

455
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:32,033
Everyone will believe that I was the one
who killed your husband.

456
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:35,370
But if something is revealed
that compromises my confession…

457
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,085
then everyone will know the truth,
that you are just

458
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,463
someone who made a deal
with a psycho killer.

459
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,385
[Yun-su] So what if

460
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:56,057
Mo Eun's DNA isn't found at the scene
and the watch doesn't belong to her?

461
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,310
Oh, why would that concern you?

462
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,855
How could it not be her watch
if Mo Eun's the killer?

463
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,567
[phone chimes]

464
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,992
I LET YOU OUT,
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING?

465
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,371
NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO INVESTIGATE
WITH YOUR LAWYER.

466
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:26,212
I WARNED YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE TIME.
DON'T GET ANY FUNNY IDEAS.

467
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,297
[music intensifies]

468
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,009
SHOULD I JUST EXPOSE EVERYTHING?

469
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:34,053
WHAT KIND OF DEAL WE MADE,
AND HOW TOXIC WE ARE TO THE WORLD?

470
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,390
[music swells]

471
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,732
[music subsides]

472
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,901
[tense mysterious music playing]

473
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:52,447
[Yun-su] <i>If Mo Eun…</i>
<i>If she retracts her confession, then what?</i>

474
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,158
I know you're under a lot of pressure--

475
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,701
Of course I am!

476
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,036
[music fades]

477
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,622
My whole life depends on this.
She might retract her confession.

478
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,333
- Where does that leave us?
- Listen, I'm trying to tell you.

479
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,169
We have a new lead now.

480
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,838
Even if Mo Eun
makes the choice to pull her confession,

481
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,757
we push hard and win the trial.

482
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,592
Right?

483
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,803
We don't have any real evidence.

484
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,306
Outside of her confession,
nothing proves she's the murderer.

485
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,350
So I'm afraid if my client moves
to withdraw that statement,

486
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,187
well, I can't make any guarantees.

487
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,188
Oh, come on, Mr. Jin.

488
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:28,399
I'm sorry. You have to understand,
I'm Mo Eun's attorney after all.

489
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,986
Unless the watch or DNA
can be proven to be hers,

490
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,571
I have to argue for her innocence.

491
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,364
[Jeong-gu] If she withdraws
her confession?

492
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,241
Do we expect anyone
will actually believe it?

493
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,410
I doubt the public would go along,
but the judge might.

494
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,454
It was her confession
that started the whole trial.

495
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,164
[Jeong-gu] What is it you're saying?

496
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,374
It's complicated. I know that.

[uneasy music playing]

498
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,421
When we met yesterday,
things seemed different somehow.

499
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,757
And you know,
she's always been unpredictable--

500
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,217
What did she tell you?

501
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,469
Please, I need to know everything.

Mo Eun said

563
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,558

So I understand you found her?

575
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,463
[Pudgy] Yeah.

576
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:04,258
Was it you who bought her the new clothes?
Oh, and the headband too?

577
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,344
Here, let me give you my card.

578
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,596
- Let us pay you back.
- No.

579
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,349
I was told just to hang out with her.
That's all.

580
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,686
You were told to hang out with her?

[Yun-su] Please, that's enough.

584
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,362
I appreciate her finding Sop
and bringing her here.

585
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,905
So please let her go.

586
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,700
You don't think it's a bit strange
that she was told?

587
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,203
Who told you to hang out
with that little girl?

588
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,329
Hey, wait a second!

589
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,707
- You'll talk when the police get here.
- [Yun-su] No, not the police.

590
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,627
Don't call anyone.

591
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,630
I want to avoid all the attention.

592
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,423
I'm tired of people talking about me.

593
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,383
Yeah, but…

594
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:47,927
I appreciate it, really.

595
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,638

You can go now. Thank you.
