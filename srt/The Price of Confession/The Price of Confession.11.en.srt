There's major abdominal bleeding.

[doctor] Get an OR prepped
and talk to anesthesiology.

188
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,674

- What… What about him?
- I thought you were working with him.

222
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:26,063
He walked out of the station with us,

There is no dashcam footage from that day.

An Yun-su was lying.

227
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,452
By the way,

228
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,789
I got rid of the footage
from the day I met her at the gallery.

229
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,207
Oh, hi.

230
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,294
But she went back there alone,
it turns out.

00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,004
<i>Are you looking at the footage?</i>

232
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,382

He's probably gonna act in our favor,
don't you think?

00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,665

He never felt suspicious to you?

00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,343
Not at all.

247
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,555
He seemed like a good person.

248
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,057
He came to the NFS with me

249
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,102
and made sure that Mo Eun
and Ms. An could communicate.

250
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,107
In that case, he was able to keep an eye

251
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,485
on everything Mo Eun
or An Yun-su were up to.

252
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,949
Actually, An Yun-su came to my office.

[Sun-deok] I don't know
if it was the right thing to do,

263
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,671
but I did it because I've also had
so many questions

264
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,923
about this case, you know?

265
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,887
This is the sketch.

266
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,640
[Jeong-gu] Oh?

267
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,685
That woman?

268

You've seen her before?

269
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,064
She's Jin's spouse.

270
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,070
I don't want to intrude, but, Mr. Jang,

271
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,738
- Sop has gone missing.
- [Jeong-gu] What?

272
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,825
[Sun-deok] They're saying
she's been kidnapped.

273
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,451
A kid saw it happen.

274
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:31,123

Ms. An went public,

talking about how the police
had all this evidence,

276
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,128
was just a scheme to lure him in?

277
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,631
[Detective Bae] Sir!

278
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,592

282
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,391
[Detective Bae] I'll tell Baek.

283

I…

284
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,646
I stabbed her.

You can't lie to me, all right?

286
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,526
Now look at me, will you?

00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,573
What was that all about?

288
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,325
You know what she's up to.

Tell them that I kept you alive

[Ms. Eom] Stop lying!

296
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,508
[Eun] Tell them I just tried to kill you,
and that's why you stabbed me.

297
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,719
Then you'll be fine.

298

I suggest you start telling the truth.

367
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,911
That night, you were with him.

368
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,580
That's what I know.

369
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,790

370
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:15,253
I'll just find them
and make sure I kill them too.

371
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,175

[Eun] What Se-hun got
was divine punishment.

401
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,042
Sometimes people commit an act so vile,

402

You got scared today, huh? I'm sorry.

There's one more thing
Mommy needs to take care of.

That doesn't really make any sense.

If the cops ever track you down,

477
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,680
just say we threatened you
and made you do it.

478
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,682
[Pudgy] What?

479
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,477

Is Mo Eun even your real name?

Kang So-hae.

487
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,466
That's my real name.

488
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,970

00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:55,132
<i>I was just drifting, completely aimless,</i>
<i>when I met you in Thailand.</i>

537
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,677
<i>The two years we shared</i>

538
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,140
<i>were the happiest of my life.</i>

539
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,353
<i>It was the first time</i>

540
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:12,775
<i>that I realized</i>
<i>I could be loved by someone too.</i>

541
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,235
[lighter lid closes]

542
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,030
<i>You've given me so much, So-hae.</i>

543
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,784
<i>I wish I could give you</i>
<i>something in return…</i>

544
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,788
<i>but I don't have much to offer.</i>

545
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,668
<i>So if using me gets you closer</i>
<i>to your revenge,</i>

546
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,461
<i>then please do so.</i>

547
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,728
The last words she ever spoke to me.

548
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,026
[music fades]

549
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,907
But why did you help me?
I didn't kill Ko Se-hun.

550
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,412
Now that you mention it…

551
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,456
I wonder.

552
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,214
[stirring music playing]

553
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:22,136
[Eun] <i>You confessed</i>
<i>to killing your husband.</i>

554
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:26,181
<i>How will you disprove that</i>
<i>without any evidence?</i>

555
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,184
[Yun-su] <i>I know there's evidence</i>

556
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,186
<i>out there somewhere.</i>

557
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,313
<i>And we're on our way to find it.</i>

558
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,485
[stirring music intensifies]

559
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,337
[stirring music continues]

560
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,239
[music fades]

561
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,033
[dramatic string music playing]

562
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,520
[music fades]

563
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,273
[string music playing]

564
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,603
[percussive string music playing]

565
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,033
[music fades]
