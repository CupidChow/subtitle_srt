00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,255
Mr. Jin did me a favor
and set up the meeting.

191
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,674
I wanted to speak with Mo Eun…

192
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:07,388
to find out why she tried to kill herself
right before taking the stand.

193
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,557
And then

194
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,810
I saw you there in a doctor's coat,
running off in a panic.

195
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,990
[Jeong-gu] <i>I thought to myself,</i>
<i>"What's she doing here?"</i>

196
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,616
<i>And what's with the doctor's coat?</i>

197
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,369

The dead kid. You went to his place.

200
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,420
Why? How did you even know?

201
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,840
Is it because you had something
to do with it, Ms. An?

202
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,801
Don't tell me you made
some kind of arrangement with Mo Eun?

203
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,597
I'm expected to be your lawyer, aren't I?

204
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,432
I'm doing the most that I can here.

205
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,893
Just say something
so that I can trust you!

206
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,946
There's something I've always wanted
to ask you, but never have.

207
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,533
Why'd you choose to hire me

208
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,161
to be your lawyer?

209
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,580
It's time for you to go.

Huh? It's you, Yun-su.

You're even thinner

Were you the one who did it?

I'm not sure what you--

230
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,720
You killed him 'cause Mo Eun asked you to.

231
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,014
I didn't kill anyone.

00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,099

you're not really close with her.

My parents own this place. If I scream,

244
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,533
everyone will come running and find you.

245
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,785
But that's not what I was told to do.

246
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,288
Mo Eun told me just to watch you.

247
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,582
I assume she has something on you too.

248
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,709
Assume?

249
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,963
Yeah, you assume, don't you?

250
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,257
Mo Eun, she's…

251
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,676
she's a good person.

252
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,136
How can you believe her?

253
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,266
Because she saved my life,
and because she was…

254
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,353
and because she was the only one
who ever gave me anything,

255
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,065
and I wasn't just some fat girl to her.

show that she moved to Germany
at 17 to study abroad,

00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,007
where she then graduated
from medical school

265

I can say that, at first,
the whole case seemed clear-cut.

274
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,000
The male student in question

275
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,586
got the female student, the victim, drunk

276
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,671
and then proceeded
to sexually assault her,

277
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,673

278
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,966
That was that.

279
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,635
The evidence was solid.

280
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,929
The accused even admitted it.

281
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,515
But then things began
to change during the trial?

282
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,310
Well, the family of the perpetrator…

283
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,313
[tuts] Let's just say they had influence.

284
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,148

Testimonies began to shift.

286
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,820
Blame was being placed on the girl again,
practically nullifying the case.

Things like, "it wasn't rape,"

288
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,825
or she drank with him willingly,
or she was all over him.

289

that she had worked as an escort.

Well, the rumors were one thing.

293

While the case was on trial,
the perpetrator, he…

294
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,512
he sent the video
to all the people that she knew.

295
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:07,933
What he did was basically send it
to every person in her phone contacts.

You show no emotion at that,

like you don't know what I'm saying.

339
00:24:56,786 --> 00:25:00,916
So if he sent it to every person
on that contact list, well, then,

340
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,251
I suppose her father must've seen it

341

and her older sister too.

00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,089
She must've been devastated.

343
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,675
That's a reason to commit suicide.

344
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,929
And because he wasn't able
to protect his daughter,

345
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,431
the father made the same decision.

346
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,142
Her sister died around then as well.

347
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,645

because she needed to plot the kill.

520
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,459
An Yun-su's log

521
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,295
on that day.

522
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,172
Can you confirm it?

523
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,841
Uh, ah…

524
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,969
Well, she called me at, uh, 7:00 p.m.
with a complaint

525
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,680
that her ankle monitor
had broken in a fall,

526
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:26,058
so I went to her place
about an hour later to replace it.

527
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,312
Wait. So,

528
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,315
you didn't think to tell us?

529
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,733
Well, I thought it's not possible.

530
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,611
I mean, it was raining heavily,
and considering the travel time.

531
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,989
- I assumed she couldn't do it in an hour.
- Why would you assume something like that?

532
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:44,410
[music swells]

540
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,989
<i>Try and handle the arrest quietly.</i>

541
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,157
Affirmative.

[doorbell ringing]

543
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,334
Oh.

544
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:45,805
[Yun-su] Hi.

[Yun-su grunts]

548
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,398
You know who I am, don't you?

549
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,364
Someone sent this to me.

550
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,496
But don't be scared.

551
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,916
I just want to hear you tell me the truth.

552
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,002
[mysterious tense music playing]

553
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,047
Come in.

554
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,456
Can I offer you tea?

555
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,708
No, thank you.

556
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,294
I think I'm gonna have some.

557
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,637
[Mr. Ko] One day,

558
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,517
I was told my son
and his wife had been murdered.

559
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,729
I spent every waking day as a soldier,

560
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:22,401
and I never spoke kindly
of my son his whole life.

561
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,489
Even when he died,
I couldn't shed a single tear.

562
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,912
Yesterday, however,

563
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,958
I saw my grandson dead with my own eyes.

564
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,629
Inside a cold freezer.

565
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,845
I knew that I simply couldn't die
without knowing…

566
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,181
I couldn't die without knowing why!

567
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,016
And I intend to find out!

568
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,934
[Yun-su yells]

It's okay.

595
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,004
