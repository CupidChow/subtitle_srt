[unsettling music playing]

00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,803
There is one more thing you should know.

7
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,892
I murdered someone else.

<i>I will confess all of that at the trial.</i>

13
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,956
The judge won't dismiss it,
as I'll be under oath.

14
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:27,128
Members of the jury will have no choice

Soon enough,

17
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,259
the media is gonna treat it
like a major story.

18
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:38,223
It doesn't matter
whether people believe it or not.

19
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,683
What matters
is how much interest it stirs.

20
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,729
That's why nobody believed
the story you told.

21
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,232
Your version of the truth

22
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,985
simply wasn't entertaining enough
for them.

23
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,534
But then,
why should I take your word on that?

24
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,621
Just take my word?

25
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,873
Why would you do that?

26

You just met me.

00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,723
As for you,

00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,769

But she's… she's a psychopath.

65
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,569
I mean, the good news
is that she's already in jail.

Explain the witch, then.

00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,576
We need to figure out

That show

Without the guards stepping in,

You're here today as a person of interest
in the Schoolteacher Spousal Murder case.

132
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,782
We typically question persons of interest
without their attorney,

133
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,116
but if you'd prefer, I can--

134
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,284
My attorney

135
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,037
stepped down.

136
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,623
I know.

137
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,542
That's why I'm asking.

138
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,711
Would you make a statement
without an attorney?

139
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,673
Why would I decline to make a statement?

140
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,385
I already admitted it in court.

[recorder beeps]

142
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,934
Honestly… I was quite shocked earlier.

143
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,520
You just pounced on her
like a wild animal. I thought…

144
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,064
I really thought it was gonna get bad.

145
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,069
Okay. Hmm.

146
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,862
Where should we begin?

147
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,289
I refuse to speak
without an attorney present.

148
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:43,916

150
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,547
All we're trying to do today
is confirm a few details.

151
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,881
I said no comment.

152
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,596
[Mr. Hwang] I mean,
she suddenly froze up like a statue.

153
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,307
I offered her something to drink,
but I got nothing.

154
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,434
She wanted nothing to do with me.
I swear to God.

155
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,894

156
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,187
Uh,

157
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,356
you should go talk to…

158
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,237
You go in there.

159
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,115
Let her be for now.

160
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,619
She's not my focus today.

161
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,581
I'd rather spend more time with her.

162
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,666
[mysterious ethereal music playing]

[Dong-hun] All right. Let's hear it.

165
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,604
Ms. An's husband, Lee Ki-dae.
How did he die that day?

166
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,231
Tell me everything you did.

167
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,942
I'd like to know what you remember.

168
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,322
Do you?

<i>and came to a big door.</i>

176
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,182
Walked a few steps down the hallway

177
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,936
and found another door.

178
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,606

[Dong-hun] <i>And then? Did you get closer</i>

183
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,593
and stab the man?

184
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,346
That's not what I did.

185
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,517
- [stirring music playing]
- I hit him with a wine bottle first.

186
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,061
<i>He looked stronger than me,</i>

187
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,941
<i>so if I didn't stab right,</i>
<i>I'd be the one getting hurt.</i>

188
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,277
Go on.

189
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,364
He stumbled a little
and then just dropped to the floor.

190
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,783
<i>I thought his height might be a problem,</i>

191
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,368
<i>but once he was down,</i>

192
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,787
his neck was perfectly positioned.

193
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,707
I had a scalpel in my bag,

194
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,127
<i>but I looked around,</i>
<i>and there were so many options.</i>

195
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,880
<i>I just grabbed</i>

196
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,507
<i>the first carving knife I saw.</i>

197
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,426
[camera shutters clicking]

198
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,971
- [Mr. Hwang] Let's turn it around.
- Turn it?

199
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,558
[Eun] <i>He was down on his knees,</i>

200
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,602
<i>and I stabbed him right in the neck,</i>

201
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,062
looking straight at him.

00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,606

[Dong-hun] <i>How many times?</i>

205
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,116
Face the mannequin.

206
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,285
Stab it six times.

207
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,915
One,

208
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,042
two,

209
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,086
three, four…

210
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,548
Six.

211
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,217
I think.

212
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,764
[music fades]

213
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,641
And after that? What else?

214
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,230
I couldn't wipe down everything
for obvious reasons.

215
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,940
Time being one.

216
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,692
Then I saw the table set up with the wine.

217
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,487
Figured that someone
was gonna arrive soon enough.

218
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,614
So you concealed all of it

219
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,533
and left the studio?

220
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,785
No, I messed around a little.

221
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,038
I grabbed a different carving knife

222
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,082
and threw it next to the body.

223
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,377
[dark strings playing]

224
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,673
[stirring piano music playing]

225
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,428
What about the knife you actually used?

226
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,979
I returned the knife

227
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,106
right where I found it.

228
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,776
Then I hurried up outside.

229
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,946
And as I was making my way
through the rain,

230
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,991
I saw a car at the bottom of the stairs.

231
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,870
[thunderclap]

232
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,707
[thunder rumbling]

233
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,797
[Eun] <i>"Is someone in there?"</i>

234
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,050
"Should I kill them?"

235
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,388
I walked towards them, but then stopped.

236
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,558
"What if it's a big man?"

237
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,895
"What if there's more than one?"

238
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,024
It was dark, pouring like crazy,

239
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,026
and my face was covered.

240
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,654
<i>I figured they wouldn't</i>
<i>be able to identify me,</i>

241
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,406
<i>so I just walked away.</i>

242
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,663
Would you mind… drawing the studio for me?

243
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,168
[sighs]

244
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,169
[music fades]

245
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,379
I'm not good at drawing though.

247
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,207
[paper rustling]

248
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,806
I just remembered something.

249
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,684
I saw a tattoo on his dead body.

250
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,186
It was on his neck.

251
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,689
What was it of?

252
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,858
Someone's face, I think.

253
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,529
[gasps]

254
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,281
Five months later, and yet,

255
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,910
you can still remember
down to the last detail?

[dark pulsing music plays]

257
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,458
I have a really good memory.

[high-pitched ethereal music plays]

259
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:48,007

265
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,783
Did the media ever report
about the knife you found?

266
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:16,744
No, sir.

267
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,663
What about the tattoo
and the studio's layout?

268
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,998
[footsteps approaching]

269
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:21,957
No, sir.

270
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,253
I told you to find holes
in her story. Didn't I?

271
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:30,174
Not help that psycho prove
she was at the goddamn scene of the crime!

What was the color
of Mr. Hwang's tie today?

Blue, I think.

I was in a bit of a rush this morning.

[laughs]

280
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,924
[Dong-hun] That woman

281
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,886
perfectly described a room
she saw five months ago.

282
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,013
Everything in her statement was spot-on,

283
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,557
like she had memorized her lines.

284
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,768
[dark suspenseful music playing]

285
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,270
The one thing she never mentioned
is why she did it.

286
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,189
As you know,

287
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,692
a killer's favorite topic is their motive.

288
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,904
She's a psychopath.
Does she need a reason to kill someone?

289
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,156
There's always a motivation.

290
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,659
They select their targets for a reason.

291
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,245
They know exactly why they have to die.

292
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,831
Their actions then become justified.

293
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,624
<i>And they want the whole world to know.</i>

294
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:50,504
[Eun] As I'm sure you know, little boy,
your mom and dad weren't such good people.

295
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,674
Your crime is being their child.

296
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,761
Then why did you let it slide?
You should've pressed her.

297
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,016
Because it was too hard
to determine if she was lying.

298
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,937
Uh… actually,

299
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,440
we just got a hold
of some new information.

300
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,695
An Yun-su and Mo Eun did a little stint
at the same time in solitary.

[guard 3 breathing heavily]

Didn't expect all of you
to show up at dawn like this.

00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:42,973
Got a warrant?

[paper rustles]

312
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,852
[Mr. Hwang] Here it is.

- We're going in.

Get 'em ready.

318
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,627
[inmate 1] Oh, dear Lord.
Please get me through this ordeal.

[music fades]

322
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,598
There's no way they'd be able
to talk between cells.

323
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,558
Walls are so thick,
they would have to yell.

324
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,685
We'd hear it from over there.

325
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:40,405
What if you doze off
or leave for a minute?

326
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:45,369
Video surveillance isn't limited
to inmates in a facility like this one.

327
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,038
<i>Staff is monitored as well.</i>

328

<i>cells are checked every half hour</i>
<i>to prevent potential incidents.</i>

330
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,504
A word or two might slip by,

331
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:59,967
but there's no way they could've planned
something like that. Not on our watch.

- All right, you can start.

Anything?

00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,834
[faintly] Can you hear me or not?

00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,254
Come on, man.

00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,213
You there?

340
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,633
If you can hear me, say something.

341
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,635
Can you?

342
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,180
I know you lied
about working late last night.

343
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,850
That doctor's appointment was also a lie.

344
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,437
We know you went fishing instead
and posted about it on Instagram.

345
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,815
[Shim] I can hear you and wanna point out
that you also lied to skip work last week.

346
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,817
Loud and clear! I hear you.

347
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,193
- Mr. Baek!

348
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,196
Mr. Baek,
we can talk to each other in here.

[radio beeps]

351
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,369
Yes, I can hear you from here.
Come on out.

00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,748
Mister. [chuckles]

353
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,043
In my cell, you can hear
the next one just fine,

354
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,753
even if they're not yelling.

355
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,798
Day after day, I gotta wake up at dawn
and listen to her pray.

356
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:25,177
I'm sure she's trying
to receive some blessing or whatever,

357
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,928
but she sounds crazy!

358
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,515
[inmate 1] Really? Cut it out.
Every night you go all… [pants]

359
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,101
- [inmate 4] Fucking bitch. I'm gonna--
- [guard 3] 3216, be quiet.

360
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,146
Which cells are those?

361
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,440
Number 10 and 11.

362
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:39,941
[radio beeps]

363
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,777
[Dong-hun] Mr. Hwang, move to cell 11.

364
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,861
[door opens]

365
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,904
[Mr. Hwang] <i>Okay.</i>

[door closes]

367
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,749
Sir, can you hear me?

368
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,586
I guess not.

369
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,047
And now?

370
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,926
Seems we're gonna be
working late again, huh?

371
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,095
[intriguing music playing]

372
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:12,182
Before work today, my wife said
you and I should move in together.

373
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,225
[radio beeps]

374
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,434
I can hear you, Mr. Hwang.

375
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,560
Oh, yeah?

376
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,771
You heard that?

377
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,066
- [radio beeps]
- Try again, closer to the wall, please.

378
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,319
Mr. Baek?

379
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,533
[faintly] Uh, you realize my wife was
just kidding when she said that, right?

380
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,660
Sir?

381
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,455
[volume increases]
Please say something if you can hear me?

382
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,500
Whatever you need, just tell me.

383
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,252
You know I got your back.

384
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,753
Sir?

385
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,840
Please? Answer me?

386
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,924

387
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,570
[intriguing music continues]

388
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,167
[Mr. Hwang] Sir.

389
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,212
I don't think
there's anything wrong with this cell.

390
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,464
What should we do now?

391
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,425
Shared cells. Follow me.

392
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,934
[stirring music playing]

393
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,316

396
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,167
2784, look away.

397
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,462
Do what I tell you.

398
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,138
Let's strip-search every inmate.

399
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,057
But, sir.

400
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,644
That's a direct violation of their rights.
You can't do that.

401
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:21,603
I'll submit to it.

402
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,024
Want me to do it right here
and see for yourself?

403
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,359
An Yun-su.

404
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,862
Every inmate in cell 5
will be included in this procedure.

405
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,866
- But your warrant doesn't cover this.
- Ms. Eom Ju-young.

406
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,869
You know this can be authorized
by a supervisor.

407
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,038
Only when dealing
with a significant issue.

408
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,415
And this doesn't qualify
as significant in your book?

409
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,087
Right here, right now,
criminals are conspiring.

410
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:50,006
They're making a mockery
of our judicial system.

411
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,676
You can't prove that yet.

412
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,261
Call the warden, will you?

413
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,016
[sighs, murmurs]

00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:24,332
- Take off your underwear.
- I can't believe this fucking shit.

417
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,793
I ain't gonna stand all day,
tits out like this.

418
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,628
Gimme a fucking break, will you?

419
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,547
- Kim Yeong-sun.
- Yeah?

420
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,841
You got four years
in your first trial for assault.

421
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:33,925
Yeah.

422
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,386
This would be enough to get you one more.

423
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,264
But it isn't mine though.
I was holding it for someone else.

424
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,933
Ugh, damn it.

425
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,102
Hey, let's take it off.

426
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,021
Here, here. Take a gander.

427
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,607
- Go ahead.
- [inmate 5] Fuck this bullshit.

428
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,234
Ugh! So pervy.

429
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,320
[investigator] Keep looking forward.

430
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:57,240
Where else do you want me to look?
It's not like I got eyes on my ass. Jeez.

431
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,743
[door buzzer]

432
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,250

[groans]

434
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,216
Being a prosecutor doesn't mean
you can treat us like this.

435
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,306
Hate to break it to you,
but not all people are the same.

436
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,893
[inhales sharply]

437
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,105
You trust that woman?

438
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:33,318
'Cause you might be one thing,
but she's something else entirely.

439
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,444
I promise you that.

[exhales]

443
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:47,332
[Eun] If your husband's killer
was standing right in front of you,

444
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,501
what would you do to them?

445
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,879
I'd kill them.

446
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,924
Tear them into pieces

447
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,052
until there's nothing left.

448
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,809
If I make this confession in court,

449
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,771
I'll become the person
who took your husband's life.

450
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,108
Sooner or later,

451
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,194
you and I will meet again,

452
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,988
whether in court or in here.

453
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,532
[tense music playing]

454
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,660
When we do,

<i>come at me with everything you got.</i>

456
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:31,126
Pretend you're gonna
rip me to shreds like it's nothing.

457
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,795
Then,

458
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,841
<i>I will take it as a sign</i>
<i>that you've accepted my offer.</i>

459

That was so humiliating.

I swear those fucking bastards
all need to die!

463
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,868
Who the fuck do they think they are?
Couldn't even clean up their goddamn mess!

464
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,327
Shit! Shit!

465
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,205
Fucking sons of bitches!
Fucking asshole cocksuckers!

466
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:13,084
Hey, you! Don't ever let
that bitch-ass prosecutor intimidate you.

467
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,170
Don't let him get into your head, okay?

468
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,296
Yo. Listen!

469
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,590
Is he into you or something?

470
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,592
Why is he going after you
when you didn't do shit?

471
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,010
Guys, I'm sorry.

472
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,637
Why would you be sorry
when you did nothing?

473
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,973
What an idiot. You gotta be kidding me.

474
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,863
When I told her to "rip me to shreds…"

475
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,159
I didn't mean literally.

00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,787

Mr. Hwang,

483
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,182
I need you to apply
for a polygraph right away.

484
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,892
[Mr. Hwang] A lie detector test?

485
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,520
You can't do it without their agreement.
Can you?

486
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,063
<i>An Yun-su won't,</i>

487
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,773
but Mo Eun will approve it.

488
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,358
<i>All right, then.</i>

489
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,734
<i>By the way, did you hear?</i>

490
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,195
An Yun-su got herself an attorney.

491
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,281
<i>Since this is a high-profile case,</i>

492
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,033
<i>some big names did express interest,</i>
<i>but instead,</i>

493
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,369

I know what you're thinking.

501
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,691
But don't judge a book by its cover,
will you?

503
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,319

508
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:08,009
<i>It has to be someone unknown.</i>

509
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,136
<i>You wouldn't want their reputation</i>

511
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:18,144

Restraints aren't allowed

The prosecution
had her flagged as high-risk.

516
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,947
You did this
because a prosecutor told you?

517
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,033
That's a violation of correctional law.

518
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,577
Uncuff her.

Are you… wondering about my nose?

I wasn't any good though.

534
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:27,130
Took so many hits, and it flattened,
and got crooked. [laughs]

535
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,298
I'm sorry if I was staring.
I didn't mean to.

536
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,883
No worries.

537
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,177
Some people say it brings good luck.

538
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,429
[chuckles]

539
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,390
Um, yep.

540
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,516
Let's get started.

541
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,518
Hmm.

542
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,855
I heard about some human rights violations

543
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,357
during the prosecution's seizure
last week.

544
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,693
Could you tell me more
about what happened?

545
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,070
Can you get me out of here
before the appeal?

546
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,157
I heard I could be released on bail.

547
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:58,494
I figured we'd begin with a few jabs,
but you're going straight to the hook.

548
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,579
[chuckles]

549
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,206
Hmm.

550
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,837
If you're accused of murder,
being released on bail is impossible.

551
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,796
What about--

552
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,382
At the same time, I've never seen someone

553
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,384
come forward and claim
they're the real murderer.

554
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,429
Are you… saying there's hope, then?

555
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,098
It won't be simple.

556
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,642
I assume the prosecution
and the court won't rush

557
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,227
to admit they were wrong.

558
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,689
The prosecution
will try to stop it at all costs.

559
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,692
In the eventuality
that the bail request is denied,

560
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,986
it will be used against us at the trial.

561
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,405
I have to get out.

562
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,241
I need your help.

563
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,119
Yes, you can count on me.

564
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,372
I'll make sure
you're reunited with your daughter.

565
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,707
But for that,

566
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,461
I need you to be
completely transparent with me.

567
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,381
Okay.

568
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,844
All right. Let's, uh, start with a jab.
Are you ready?

569
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,347
[pensive music playing]

570
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,728
[clock ticking]

571
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,861
[guard] Visitation hours
will be ending shortly.

572
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,364
Attorneys and inmates
currently in consultation,

573
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,949
<i>please wrap up now.</i>

574
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,785
Uh, all right. Let's call it a day.

575
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,787
Don't forget to eat well.

576
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,413
- Thank you.
- Great.

577
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,665
[music fades]

578
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:26,916
By the way,

579
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,628
the prosecution wanted me
to take a lie detector test.

580
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,130
[Jeong-gu] I heard you declined.

581
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,924
If you ask me, it shows
that they have nothing substantial.

582
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,510
They're relying on a machine
to turn things around.

583
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,053
You did right.

584
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,932
Ah, and

585
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,184
what did she decide?

586
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,895
Uh, she agreed to it.

587
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:52,733
Not that she needed to,
but so hard to know with people like that.

588
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,026
They're unpredictable.

589
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,572
We're done here.

590
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:05,037
[examiner] <i>We'll start with questions</i>
<i>to establish your baseline.</i>

591
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,624
Please, answer
with a simple "yes" or "no."

592
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,044
<i>Is your name Mo Eun?</i>

593
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,380
Yes.

594
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:15,965
Is your social security number

595
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,802
<i>920717?</i>

596
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,679
Yes.

597

[beeping]

598
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,559
Is her baseline
supposed to look like that?

599
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:30,062
[examiner] Her reference points
are a bit above average.

600
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,648
That said, her facial expressions

601
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,483
are remarkably calm.

602
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,319
Don't be fooled by them.

603
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,820
Don't tell me how to do my job.

604
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,323
You two are not even
supposed to be in here.

605
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,533
Yes, I apologize. I will behave.

606
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,077
You're An Yun-su's lawyer.
Why are you even here?

607
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,455
It's part of the investigation.

608
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,582
I've been cleared by the examiner

609
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,876
as long as I observe and stay quiet.

610
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:52,877

611
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,337
Sh.

612
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,796
[examiner] All right. Let's begin.

613
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,592
[suspenseful music playing]

614
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,260
At the detention center,

615
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,971
did you ever meet An Yun-su?

616
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:08,643
We might've passed each other
at some point.

617
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,603
[examiner] <i>Please respond</i>
<i>with a "yes" or "no."</i>

<i>I'll rephrase the question.</i>

619
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,398

<i>did you ever come face-to-face</i>

[chuckles]

629
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,526
[examiner] Aside from the dentist couple,

630
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,444
how many people have you killed?

631
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,364
Number one, none.

632
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,741
Number two, one person.

633
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,077
Number three, two people.

634
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,036
Number four,

635
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,163
three or more.

636

[suspenseful music continues]

637
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,671
Number four.

638
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,635
Wait. Does that mean
she killed other people?

639
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:25,970
[sighs]

640
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:30,141
The waveform was even more stable
than when she confirmed her name.

641
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,232
Did you kill Lee Ki-dae,

642
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,067
<i>An Yun-su's husband?</i>

643
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,194

It's gonna be hard to use this.

- Why'd you kill him?
- What are you doing?

648
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,334
- Let me do it.
- [Jeong-gu] What are you doing?

Let me talk to her!

650
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,337
- [Jeong-gu] Stop it.
- Hey! Just tell me why.

651

- Just tell me.
- [Jeong-gu] Are you kidding me?

to take someone's life?

656
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,360
Cut the crap and give me a good reason
why you had to kill him.

- Come on. That's enough.
- Tell me now!

Look at the graph.

667

You messed it up real good,

668

<i>which means the test</i>
<i>is completely meaningless.</i>

669

"Three or more."

If I were you, that's where I would be
spending my energy.

However, using the media as cover,

709
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,974
the prosecution doubled down
on these prejudices

710
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,310
and harmful misunderstandings.

711
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,772
They wrongfully accused a mother
of killing her daughter's father,

712
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:05,856
and in doing so,

713
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,942

714

<i>Even now, after the real killer confessed,</i>

715
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,031
<i>they refuse to return An Yun-su</i>

716
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:17,576
<i>to her daughter and deny any wrongdoings.</i>

717
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,038
<i>I humbly ask all of you.</i>

718
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,166
Let us move on from this nightmare.

724
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,022
<i>It's too early, of course,</i>
<i>to conclude that Ms. An is innocent.</i>

725
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,401
<i>But we'd be remiss not to mention</i>

726
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,319
<i>that, at the very minimum,</i>

727
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,531
<i>she deserves the opportunity</i>
<i>to stand a fair trial.</i>

728
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,700
<i>And that her young daughter</i>

729
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:01,620
<i>should be able to live unburdened</i>
<i>by adult conflicts.</i>

730
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:05,416
<i>An Yun-su has filed for an appeal hearing</i>

731
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,751
