Over here!

181
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,232
I need guards, damn it!

[alarm blaring]

183
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,237
[Ms. Eom] Come on!

Hurry!

185

00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,378
Officer!

190
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:11,879
I got her!

191
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,131
Hurry! Hurry up!

192
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,760
Cut her loose! Quick, cut her loose!

[doctor, Ms. Eom grunt]

194
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,269
[Ms. Eom] Call an ambulance! Do it now!

00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,270

Please help me! It hurts!

200
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,085
[Eun] She's got a ruptured artery.

201
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,964
You have to locate it
and tie it off before it's too late.

202
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,966
Tell the hospital
to send someone here right away.

203
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,592
- [guard 2] Yes, ma'am!
- Hurry up!

204
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,388

[Hui-yeong crying]

206
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,895
How am I supposed to trust her
with her life when she tried to kill her?

207
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,440
Did you make that call?

208
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,482
How far are they?

209
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,317
We can't wait much longer.

[Hui-yeong groaning]

211
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,118
Let her out.

[door lock clicks]

214
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,294

No.

219
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,567
Not her.

220
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,738
Get away from me!

221
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,698
Tell her to leave me alone.

222
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,908
[sobs]

223
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,702
- Help me, please.
- It might be painful.

224
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,039
Can you please hold her legs?

225
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,582
- Help me.
- [Hui-yeong sobs]

226
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,210
- [Eun] Doctor, I need you to assist me.
- [doctor] Okay.

227
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,881
Open up the wound, please.

228
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,299
Should we give her a painkiller?

229
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,302
It'd make her heart rate drop.
It's too risky.

230
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,512
Let's begin.

231
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,554

[Eun] The Kelly.

[screaming continues]

235
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,490

Please help.

237
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,124

[man 1] Am I allowed to walk through?

242
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,939
- [man 2] I… I have children.
- [man 1] I really have to go.

[clears throat]

247
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,007
Oh, you're here.

248
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,137
I was happy to see
you had been transferred back.

249
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,014
Now that we're reunited,

250
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,558
I get to spend my nights
at crime scenes again. [chuckles]

251
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,143
Did you find any cameras nearby?

252
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,604
Getting footage as we speak.

253
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,984
It looks like she… got into a scuffle
with someone and left.

254
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,029
Her wallet's still here.
She must have been in a rush.

256
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,873

[ominous music sting]

258
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,355
Look at this.

The 6th.

00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,866
"Maybe he <i>should </i>be dead."

263
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,292
[detective 1] Come check this out!

264
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,587
Take these.

[mysterious music continues]

266
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,910
Well, can you recover anything?

267
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,334
Memory card's been removed,

268
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,755
and pulling any remaining data
on the device won't be easy.

This is prosecutor Baek Dong-hun speaking.

I'm gonna need a warrant.

272
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,443
ASAP. Yes, right now.

00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,248
You can move her now.

276
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,590
Um, they'll be asking questions
at the hospital.

277
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,676
I think it'll be better
if she went with you instead of me.

278
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,432
Let's go.

279
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,772

00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,894
[doctor] I'm putting her under.

285
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,649
[Eun] She was bleeding heavily
from an open femoral fracture,

286
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,734
so I realigned the femur first,

287
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,864
then located the artery and clamped it
with a Kelly to reduce the bleeding.

288
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:20,617
To prevent her heart rate from falling,
I chose not to give her aspirin.

289
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:25,164
[doctor 2] So you performed the procedure
yourself, not the medical officer?

290
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,206
Yes.

291
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,584
[doctor 2] Had you done it before?

292
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,252
Yes.

Rest up.

We're not leaving

Ah, Jesus.

305
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,597
I mean, you're clearly violating
the rights of my client.

306
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,724
Is any of this necessary?

307
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,018
I was hoping you'd tell me,

308
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,562
since you created
this whole mess in the first place.

309
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,777
You spent this whole time claiming
An Yun-su was innocent,

310
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,405
and there she was,
planning to murder Ko Se-hun.

311
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,909
Well, he's gone now.

312
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,831
An Yun-su contacted you.

313
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,500
When was that?

[tapping phone screen]

She hasn't answered
any of my calls since then.

[Dong-hun sighs]

318
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,851
And yet, you're still willing to bet
she's innocent, somehow.

319
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,813
Because I haven't heard
her side of the story yet.

320
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,274
What if she's been using you
this whole time?

321
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:19,444
Isn't that what we're here for?
Represent their best interest?

322
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,037

Who is it?

327
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,937
<i>It's An Yun-su.</i>

[stirring music playing]

329
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,777
Uh, are you calling about the rent, ma'am?

330
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:01,778
I thought

331
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,781
<i>I told you your son</i>
<i>would be covering it with his retainer.</i>

332
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,908
<i>Uh, yes, it's in the contract.</i>

333
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,870
We agreed to it last month, actually.

334
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,455
Yeah.

335
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,753
Are you all right?

336
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,883
[Yun-su] For now.

337
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,761
You don't trust me right now. I get it.

338
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,929
But I don't have anybody else, so…

339
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,601
I need you to go see Mo Eun.

340
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,687
I'm not so sure it's such a good idea
to see her right now.

341
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,648
<i>- It will look suspicious.</i>
- Mo Eun is aware that I didn't kill him.

342
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:39,566
And she knew

343
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,318
<i>Ko Se-hun was dead before I did.</i>

344
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,236
<i>I don't know how she knew,</i>

345
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,030
but I need to find out.

346
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,323
<i>Do you trust Mo Eun?</i>

347
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,202
Even if I were to go see her,
how do you know

348
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,870
<i>she'd be willing to help you?</i>

349
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:52,954
Please do it.

350
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,750
- [Jeong-gu] Ms. An, one second--
- [Ji-su] Sir.

[tense music playing]

352
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,756
Mo Eun, she was taken
to the hospital earlier tonight.

353
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,549
She wasn't the one injured though.

354
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,718
Another inmate had a serious accident,

355
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,304
and apparently,
Mo Eun did the emergency treatment,

356
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,264
and they were both taken to the hospital.

357
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,641
Wait a minute.

358
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,476
Who were you talking to?

359
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,689
My landlord.

360
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,373
- Check this number.
- [Jeong-gu] Come on.

361
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,041
- [Ji-su] Okay.
- Really?

362
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,885
[Ji-su] 031-026-5794. Can you check it?

363
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,434
It's a pay phone nearby.

364
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,991
What did An Yun-su tell you?

365
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,452
[chuckles]

366
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,455
What did she say?

367
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,841
Tell all available officers to stop
and search every passerby, taxi, or bus.

368
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,468
I want eyes everywhere.

369
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,138
[tense music continues]

370
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,572
[siren wailing]

371
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:16,932
[music fades]

372
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,601
Hi. How is she doing?

373
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,812
[Ms. Eom] She's fine. She's not hurt.

374
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,441
I would like to speak
to my client if that's okay.

375
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:28,735
In private?

376
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,279
[Young-in] Yes, if you don't mind.

377
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,782
I'll be outside if you need me.

378
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:34,866
I appreciate it.

379
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,169
If you wanted to quit,
you could have waited until morning.

380
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,922
If I'm being honest, I thought about it.

381
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,385
Why wouldn't you tell me?

382
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,056
There's a lot I kept from you.

383
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,062
An Yun-su has made a request
through her lawyer.

384
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,815
There's something
she wants you to confirm.

385
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,444
She mentioned you knew
that she didn't murder Ko Se-hun.

386
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,489
And that you also knew

387
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,284
Se-hun was dead before anyone else did.

388
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,581
Would you tell me
if you knew something we didn't?

389
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,670
Apparently, her lawyer

390
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,339
saw Ms. An at the hospital.

391
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,509
The same day Ko Se-hun's body was found.

392
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,846
You met with her?

393
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,184
If you know something, tell me.

394
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,687
If An Yun-su is innocent,

395
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,398
someone should help her.

396
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,611
Ms. Mo.

397
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,612
Mo Eun.

398
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,117
407. 407!

399
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,894
[doctor] I have an update on the patient.

400
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,646
I was thirsty.

401
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,190
Mo Eun.

402
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,608
Ms. An, I think you're mistaken.

403
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,360
Huh?

404
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,404
Just say that to her.

405
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,706
Just heard about the surgery.

406
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,417
They said the initial response
saved her life.

407
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,963
407, that's because of you.

408
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,592
Guess it wasn't her time.

409
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,263
Are you done speaking with her?

410
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:03,723
Yes.

411
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,559
[Ms. Eom] Then we should head back.

412
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,727
Uh, Ms. Eom?

413
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,815
Can I wash up first?

414
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,567
JUNGDONG GENERAL HOSPITAL

415

You're getting in the shower too?

416
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:24,703
Get in.

417
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,715
Just put them on.

[Eun] I don't know
if I should call you reckless

421
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,036
or impressive.

422
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,588
[mysterious music playing]

423
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,097
If you know something, tell me.

424
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,392
If An Yun-su is innocent,

425
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,312
someone should help her.

426
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,606

[music fades]

432
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,593
I've become a killer again.

433
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,261
Is it thanks to you?

434
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,476
You wanna know if anyone else is involved.

435
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,477
Well, no.

436
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,729
I most likely
wouldn't have left it to someone

437
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,732
as pathetically soft as you
if I'd had a choice.

438
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,777
Considering how much you care about Sop,

439
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,446
I imagined you'd have
no problem killing Se-hun.

440
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,867
Maybe killing someone
means nothing to you.

441
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,203
I'm not like that, so tell me why I'm--

442
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,496
Are you done?

443
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,166
It's just like prison all over again.

444
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,587
These tantrums are just meaningless.

445
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,011
What is it that you know?

446
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,515
You said you saw a picture.

447
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,768
Ko Se-hun was dead already,
and you knew I didn't do it.

448
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,189
Why don't you start
by telling me about that?

449
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,038
Ko Se-hun got

450
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,542
the demise that he truly deserved.

451
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:22,839
And I made sure that that image would stay
with me forever.

[intriguing music playing]

453
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,300

<i>in the right side of his neck.</i>

462
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,872
[Mr. Ko] Someone sent this to me.

463
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,421
Do you know who sent the picture?

464
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,256
I thought it was you at first.

465
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,382
However,

466
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:10,136
I soon realized
that someone was impersonating you.

467
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:14,349
The question I needed to ask
wasn't who sent that photo, but why.

468
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,977
Why did they send me that picture
as if it came from you?

469
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,228
Why were they waiting

470
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,690
for you to kill Ko Se-hun?

471
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,983
And how did they know

472
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,445
you and I were planning
to kill him in the first place?

so I guess you can get out.

480
