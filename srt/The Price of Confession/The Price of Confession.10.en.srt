it made it very difficult to identify her.

As you know,
I'm here from the Ministry of Justice.

Locating An Yun-su is our duty as well.

38

But earlier, you neglected
your duty to keep an eye on her.

Though I don't know if "fortunately"
is the right word to use.

45
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:07,270
And do we have positive identification
of the intruder at An Yun-su's residence?

46
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,149
It was Ko Dong-uk,
Ko Se-hun's grandfather.

Otherwise, the media will let us have it.

Doesn't that demonstrate
how deep the resentment is?

Deep indeed.

54
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,208
In fact, his fury is so deep,

00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,835
he won't hold the funeral
until the killer is caught.

00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,213
I have no idea what you mean.

Over there as well. Okay?

182
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,487
Did something happen?

183
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,407
[Ji-su] You said
you didn't know where she was.

184
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,909
Instead, you've given her a hideout?

185
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,204
I didn't know.
I haven't been here in over a year.

186
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,790
So then how would
An Yun-su know she could use it?

187
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,043
I mentioned it once. I guess she found it.

188
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,628
Come on up and see.

189
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,755
Come and see what she's done.

[unsettling music playing]

195
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,698
She recreated the murder scene?

196
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,534
Bragging about her crime.

197
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,536
Almost like she wants us to see it.

198
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,747
- If it was her, there's gotta be a reason.
- To what end?

199
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,167
There's no more here
than a painting of the victim dead.

200
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,753
- What if she's trying to send a message?
- Wake up, will you.

201
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,925
It's An Yun-su's phone.
Found it at the home of Ko Dong-uk.

202
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:04,927
Here.

203
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,932
THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING?

204
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,559
[Dong-hun] Is that clear enough for you?

205
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,436
I don't believe it.

00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,649

208
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,669
Is this… An Yun-su's number?

209
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,849
[Ji-su] Hold on.

210
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:55,269
Every photo here just further
implicates her as Ko's killer.

211
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,270
No.

212
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,440
Couldn't these have been sent
by someone pretending to be her?

213
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,609
Every photo was taken by somebody else.

214
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,445
We don't know who took them,
or where they came from, so--

215
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,989
So someone pretending
to be her also painted that?

216
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,908
What other explanation is there?

217
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,493
Up until now, she's begged us
to believe she wasn't a murderer.

218
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,078
The evidence is against her.

219
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,248
There's more than enough
to prove that An Yun-su is the killer.

220
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,792
[Yun-su] <i>Mo Eun is aware</i>
<i>that I didn't kill him,</i>

221
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,670
<i>and she knew</i>
<i>Ko Se-hun was dead before I did.</i>

222
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,924
I don't know how she knew that,
but I need to find out.

223
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,677
Mo Eun must know something, right?

224
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,097
- Could you let me see her, please?
- [Ji-su] You can't.

225
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,767
And I'm sure you understand
why you can't see her.

226
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,977
There's something going on here
we're not getting.

227
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,481
Why is she suddenly behaving like this?
Why would anyone do something like this?

228
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,942
Does it make any sense to you, Mr. Baek?

[music swells, fades]

230
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,923

[Jeong-gu] Is it because
you had something to do with it?

I'll be using this

Do I have your consent?

270
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,567
It has to be verbal.

Yes.

Because you're always around.

Surgery went well, they said.

284
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:02,844
However,

285
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,724
Mr. Jang and the prosecutor
appear to be questioning her now.

286
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,768
Isn't that something
you should be present for?

287
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,480
Mo Eun doesn't want me there, so…

288
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,528
I'll just follow up with Mr. Jang later.

289
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,505
Ms. An doesn't seem like
the person I know lately.

290
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,507
Must be something going on there.

291
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,927
The investigative team
thinks it's just a challenge.

292
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,847
- I'm afraid if things get worse, then--
- [Eun] Get worse?

293
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,308
How much worse can they get?

294
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,938
[Jeong-gu] We have to find her.

295
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,607
Please tell me where she might've gone.

296
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,945
But I don't know. Really.

297
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,953
Why did you do this to her?

298
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,914
Of all the people, why did you choose her?

299
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,586
Honestly, she's an easy mark.

300
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,843
That's why Prosecutor Baek

301
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,929
was also convinced that it was her.

302
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,559
She comes off as

303
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,561
transparent.

304
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,357
And that's something
people take advantage of.

305
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,236
So it was easy for you, then, I suppose.

306
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,698
- You'd exchange a confession to have--
- You think we had an arrangement.

307
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,824
Don't you?

308
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,410
Well, didn't you?

309
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,878
These were sent from the detention center.

310
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:05,384
Ms. An's unrelenting anxiety? I'm guessing
you had something to do with it.

311
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,678
There's not much time left.

312
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,098
<i>Don't try and get smart now.</i>

313
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,267
[Jeong-gu] What kind of situation
did you force her into?

314
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,228
THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING?
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME

315
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,398
She's become a shadow of herself,

316
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:23,193
but you kept pushing her to the edge,
making her come look for you. Why?

317
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,365
She said that you knew
that she didn't kill Ko Se-hun.

318
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,077
What exactly do you know?
More than you're letting on.

319
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,289
Has he told you
the photo she took looks different?

320
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,875
Or is prosecutor Baek keeping it from you?

321
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,005
[Jeong-gu] What is she talking about?

322
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,427
It's different.

323
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:49,970
You're right.

324
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,263
[mysterious music playing]

325
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:55,142
The photo recovered from her camera
doesn't match the autopsy results.

326
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,103
But the one you swallowed must have,
and so did the painting.

327
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,396
- Mr. Baek.
- All right, fine.

328
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,440
Let's pretend what you said could be true.

329
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,442
Couldn't it also be true

330
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,278
that An Yun-su purposefully sent you
that photo before coming?

331
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,866
I think she's clever enough to have
tricked you and is manipulating us.

332
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,077
An easy mark? Transparent?

333
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,037
How can you say it wasn't her… [scoffs]

334
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,875
…when there's so much evidence
to the contrary?

335
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,923
There's more to her than meets the eye.

336
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,136
How do you know? You just talked
through a wall for a few days.

337
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,724
Your bias is showing.

338
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,353
Precisely.

339
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:41,688
I'm biased.

340
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,735
And that's how it's been
since the moment I saw her.

341
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,239
But I think you can say the same,

You asked me
if I thought she was innocent.

I wanted to believe it

Maybe An Yun-su wasn't even the killer
to begin with, like she said.

You're having doubts, right?

Come on, Mr. Baek. What's your opinion?

Are you still so confident
An Yun-su is the killer?

491
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,197
Well?

492
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,743
An Yun-su mentioned evidence.
Is it legitimate?

493
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,204
If that's the case,
why would you be hiding it?

494
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,707
All due respect,

00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,377

is being truthful about this?

496
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:39,173

of her husband just to tell us this.

515
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,824
he started deepfaking pics
of girls from school to sell.

516
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,037
Videos were the next step.

517
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,581
He started filming.

518
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,752
There was a kid

519
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,129
who was his assistant.

520
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,423
The boy who visited you.

521
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,800

[Hui-yeong] <i>He would help</i>
<i>with Ko Se-hun's cats.</i>

524
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,266
He made him install
a pet cam on his phone.

525
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,978
Ko Se-hun would pay him
to deepfake pictures of girls,

526
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,064
then blackmailed him.

527
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:19,565
Made him his gopher.

528
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,195
But he said

529
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,114
he saw it.

530
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,283
Se-hun's murder.

531
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,745
[boy] <i>Listen to me, okay?</i>

532
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,247
I saw Ko Se-hun…

533
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,918
get murdered.

[music fades]

536
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,257
And who did it?

537
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,228
[suspenseful music playing]

538
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,403
