00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,299
[Yong-seok] This bail release
was granted solely

4
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,384
on the confession of the murderer

5
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,596
the world is calling
the "Witch of the Century."

6
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,639
While we respect the court's decision,

7
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,392
our official stance
is that we cannot accept it.

8
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:03,605
Are you saying you can't accept it
because it's the confession of a criminal?

9
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,565
Just because she's a criminal?

10
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:08,651
We're talking about the murderer
you called the "Witch of the Century."

11
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,696
The one you all
couldn't stop calling a psychopath.

12
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,074
[all murmuring]

13
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,660
Uh, what if, just as you believe,

14
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,748
that woman schoolteacher who was just
recently released really is the killer?

15
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:25,376
Isn't it too dangerous
to have her out there among our citizens?

16
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:29,506
You mentioned "what if,"
but that's exactly the thing

17
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,174
we're most worried about.

18
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,176
The court also acknowledged the risk

19
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,263
and ordered an electronic ankle monitor
as the minimum safeguard.

20
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,348
Let me remind you,

21
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:42,727
Ms. An was actually sentenced
to life in prison in her initial trial.

22
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,979
The trial was fairly conducted

23
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,232
and was strictly
based on admissible evidence,

24
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,234
without the slightest deviation.

25
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,445
The prosecution will do everything
in its power

26
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,240
to ensure these two criminals
never make a mockery

27
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,158
of the Korean justice system again.

28
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,785
Thank you.

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,790
[reporter 1] Will Prosecutor Baek Dong-hun
remain in charge?

30
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,459
I heard there are rumors.

31
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,878
His investigation methods
are rather heavy-handed

32
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,506
because of his background
in the police force.

33
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,468
As a prosecutor,
he has an unshakable sense of principle.

34
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:19,472
Of course, we are aware
of the public criticism he's facing.

35
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:24,435
But we'll make it absolutely clear
that our investigation was not in error.

36
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,604
[reporter 2] How do you plan
to move forward with…

37
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,523
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

38
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,152
Ah!

39
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,320
You're so damn arrogant.

40
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,740
Why are you getting ahead of yourself
when we didn't even dismiss you?

41
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,829
Just lay low in the CWCU for now.

42
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,622
It won't be easy there either.

43
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,917
Kids these days
commit the same crimes as adults.

44
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,005
And if you get some extra time,

45
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,300
you should put that relentlessness
of yours to work and keep digging.

46
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,302
On your own, that is.

47
00:02:58,928 --> 00:02:59,762
On my own?

48
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,891
What? Would you prefer I say
"just for fun?"

49
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,770
If you find something solid,
you can let me know directly.

50
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,772
That's what you wanted.

51
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,693
If you understood, take this and get out.

52
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,760

Oh, not at all.
I just helped out a little. That's all.

69
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,664
All right.

No, no, no, Sop. Don't.

- [Jeong-gu] Oh. Yes. Hello.

- Come in.
- [woman] You know what?

00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,022
This place is right by the road.
I kept missing it and going in circles.

78
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,399
- [Jeong-gu] I'm Ms. An Yun-su's attorney.
- I'm Bae Sun-deok.

79
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,151
- We spoke on the phone before.
- Right. Yeah.

80
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,569
[Sun-deok] Yeah. [giggles]

81
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,195
Goodness.

Don't worry. I'm not a scary person.

00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,786
- Huh? [chuckles]
- [Jeong-gu] Sop.

85
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,372

[chuckles]

89
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,511
Make sure to charge it
every night while you sleep.

90
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,307
Four hours of charging will give you
about 24 hours of use.

91
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,850
It's water-resistant,

92
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:55,104
but avoid soaking it in hot water
for too long, like at a public bath.

93
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,815
And since it sits
on a bony area like this,

94
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,400
it can cause some chafing.

95
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,987
Put on some lotion
right there every now and then.

Uh, could… could you

104
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,767
maybe put that somewhere less visible?

105
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,477
Well, no.

106
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,437
It's going where we can get
the clearest view

107
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,272
and can monitor you at all times.

108
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:43,778
Any signal loss or power cut,
and you're the one who will be penalized.

[Sun-deok winces]

110
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,618
[sniffles] You want me gone, don't you?

[paper rustling]

112
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,789
Still, you won't even offer me water?

113
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,374
Oh, I'm sorry.

114
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,209
I'll get you some.

115
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,882
Should we discuss the rest outside?

116
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,468
Yes.

117
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,679
[Sun-deok] Paju and Ilsan.

118
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,432
You aren't ever allowed
to leave these areas.

119
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,518
If you ever need to,
you'll have to get approval first.

120
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,812
But of course,
it's ideal not to put yourself

121
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,522
in that position at all,

122
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,025
and we actually even extended your range

123
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,653
due to your daughter's commute
to kindergarten.

124
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,071
And, uh, yeah.

125
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,948
From 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.,

126
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,701
you're not allowed
to vacate your current residence.

127
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,745
The moment you open the front door
and take a few steps,

128
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,372
the control center will get an alert.

129
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:37,915
[chuckles]

130
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,627
So basically,
I'm not allowed to do anything.

131
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:46,048
Oh, uh, a lot of people
make the mistake of thinking

132
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,510
that they're completely free
once they get out.

133
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:53,264
You're still a murder suspect, though,
so don't forget that.

134
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,767
You have to be very cautious, Ms. An.

135
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,187
And stay alert, always.

136
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,939
[door opens]

137
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,275
- Oh.
- Hey.

138
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,194
- [Yun-su] What is it?
- Sop said she's hungry.

139
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,696
Oh, um, what would you like?

140
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,573
Hmm, Chapagetti.

141
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,910
Chapagetti? I'll make it in a minute.

142
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,412
- [Sun-deok] All right. I should get going.
- Okay.

143
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,165
[Sun-deok] Okay, let's see.

144
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,459
Hey, here you go. You want some chocolate?

145
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,835
[Yun-su] Oh. [chuckles]

146
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,505
- Huh?
- [Yun-su] Uh…

147
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,548
She doesn't really like sweets.

148
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,091
Oh, I see.

149
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,176
[Yun-su] Bye.

150
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,428
- Come on.
- [Jeong-gu] Go ahead.

151
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,603
Well, I'd better get going now.

152
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,190
Uh, if it's okay, would you…

153
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,108
would you like to stay for dinner?

154
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,778
Oh, I'm fine. I've got things to do.

155
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,364
Still, though,
you probably didn't eat lunch.

156
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,408
You should enjoy
a quiet meal with Sop today.

157
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,535
See you later.

158
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,954
- See you. Goodbye!
- Good night, then.

159
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,163
- Good night.
- [Yun-su] Yeah.

160
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,123
Bye.

161
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,168

163
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,685
[Ki-dae] I told you.

164
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,020
I keep all the <i>ramyeon </i>in the corner.

[melancholy string music playing]

166
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,816
[Ki-dae] Go with Sop.

167
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,401
I'll make it.

168

00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,098
Here.

171
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,726
[Eun] Wait.

172
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,981
Well, I went to the shared cells first,
and the water cooled down.

173
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,233
Could you request meds for me?

174
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,152
What?

175
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,654

176
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:17,074
You know you have to consult
with the medical officer first. Right?

177
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,953
I haven't been able to sleep at night.

178
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,705
Right.

And could you bring a newspaper for me?

181

Here, sweetie.

197

It's great that now you're speaking
a little more formal,

198
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,653
but I liked it better before
when we were like friends.

199

You finished?

200
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,535

[Yun-su sniffles]

210
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,633
Sorry.

211
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,762
I know I have already hurt your feelings.

212
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:28,224
And, yeah, I'm apologizing
to make myself feel better too.

213

I know it won't make you feel better
all of a sudden,

218

237
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,092

[Yun-su chuckles]

239
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,097
Oh, and I took your car
to the repair shop.

240
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,182
They mentioned it needs more work
than they thought.

241
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,018

Hey, go inside. Oh.

246

- [Mun-jun] Oh God. Hold on.

247
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,408
- Hey, you should get inside now.
- It didn't have to get here so fast.

248
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,286
Hey, come on. Go inside.

249
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,747
If Sop wakes up,
and you're not there, she'll get scared.

right in front of them,

they can't help feeling
scared and curious.

Three weeks?

348
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,801
The prosecution seems to be
rushing things.

349
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,428
It seems they're not going to back down.

350
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:48,765
They're going to tear you apart
and drag your name through the mud.

Well, I won't just take it sitting down.

00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:53,437
[Jeong-gu] Hmm.

353
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,106
And I will find out who murdered
my husband, no matter what.

354

[stirring piano music playing]

355
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,402
All right, but

356
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,446
the killer confessed already.

357
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,701
[Yun-su] Uh, that woman?

358
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,831
She can't be trusted.
If she suddenly starts denying it--

359
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,125
I don't plan to rely on
just her confession alone.

360
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:19,296
I'm gonna find proof that you're innocent
and that you didn't murder your husband.

361
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,881
It was her.

362

[cup clatters]

365
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,078
Confirmed.

366
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,664
Another public defender.

367
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,793
They refused your case.
Said it was for personal reasons.

368
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,669
That's the fourth one now.

369
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,298
I just

370
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,092
thought you should know.

Their <i>yukgaejang's </i>really good.

378
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,448
Yeah, <i>yukgaejang, </i>please.

379
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,824
I'll have <i>janchi-guksu.</i>

380
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,201
[waitress] All right.

381
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,598
How's it feel to be out?

00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,057
[music fades]

383
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,356
Somehow, you look skinnier.

384

[breathes deeply]

385
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,236
I heard you transferred
to another department.

386
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,571
This, just out of curiosity?

387
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,156
[Dong-hun sighs]

388
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,075
Sure know how to make
people uncomfortable.

389
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,830
I like it when

390
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,916
people feel like that around me.

391
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,376
It makes my job easier.

392
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,422
You're quite the show-off, aren't you?

393
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,639
Ms. An Yun-su.

394
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,352
Yes, Prosecutor Baek Dong-hun.

395
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,854
You're still a primary murder suspect.

396
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,399
If you're uncomfortable, it's not me.
It's the situation.

397
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,985
What makes you so certain

398
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,403
that it was me?

399
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,739
What do you even know?

400
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,286
That's what I want to believe.

401
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,712
Thanks for the food.

402
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,307
[man chuckles] Long time no see.

403
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,561
It's been quite a while, Ms. Eom.

404
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,604
I thought you stopped taking
public defense cases

405
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,064
after becoming a professor.

406
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,525
Yeah, well, somehow,
I ended up back here again.

407
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,361
I was actually wishing
you would come back around for this one.

408
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,905
But it won't be an easy one for you.

409
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,950
Yeah, well, I kinda figured as much.

410
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:17,951
Let's go.

411
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,707
JIN YOUNG-IN, PROFESSOR/ATTORNEY

412
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,715
[Eun] I heard everyone is avoiding me.

413
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:35,218
So why did you step up to defend me?

414
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,344
[chuckles]

415
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,806
I guess I did volunteer, but

416
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,768
I don't know that "stepped up"
is the right way to put it.

417
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,896
To be honest,

418
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,149
my wife suggested it.

419
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,736
She said your confession
gave an innocent person a chance

420
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,070
to clear her name,

421
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,365
and I agreed with her.

422
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,454
[Eun] Do you…

423
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,751
think that my confession is real?

424
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,296
I should, shouldn't I?

425
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,717
Well, some people don't think it is.

426
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,803
The prosecutors don't believe it.

427
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,348
I can see why. They're prosecutors.

428
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:26,561
And there are the ones who simply
come here to boost their careers.

429
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,230
[chuckles]

430
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,941
Am I

431
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,027
being interviewed right now?

432
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,656
Or are you trying
to wear me down or something?

433
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,076
I'm not.

434
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,705
If I had some personal agenda,

435
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,416
I would've gone to Ms. An Yun-su.

436
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,337
And so we're clear,
I already have a solid career.

437
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,803
Let me ask you now.

438
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:04,265
Can I trust you, Ms. Mo Eun?

439
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,979
Can I trust you?

440
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,109
Sure.

441
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,785
[intriguing piano music playing]

442
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:26,996
Ms. Eom,

443
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,749
it looks like Inmate 407
is writing a letter.

444
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,167
Shouldn't we go check?

445
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,047
Censoring letters is against the law.
And besides, Mr. Jin would never let us.

446
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,366
[music fades]

447
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,869
Please give this to An Yun-su.

448
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,082
If it's related to the trial,
it could result in problems later.

449
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,836
Do you mind if I ask what it's about?

450
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,672
You're going to read it anyway.

451
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:19,799
What?

452
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,095
It's exercise time soon.

453
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,639
Can we wrap this up?

454
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,142
It's the only time I see the sun.

455
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,061
Yeah.

456
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,442
So you're still in solitary, aren't you?

457
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,071
I'll make arrangements
to get you in the general block.

458
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,283
It won't be immediate,
but it should be by next week, I think.

459
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,495
I wasn't expecting that.

460
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,747
I appreciate it.

[chuckles]

462
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,462
[Ms. Eom] I guess
you really liked this lawyer.

463
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,174
You talked to him for a long time.
Didn't you?

464
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,807
That's because I heard
he wrote a book recently.

465
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,226

- [Pudgy] Huh?

I told you, you weren't supposed to let
just anyone sit here, didn't I?

Oh. [sighs]
