<i>they'll send another.</i>

531
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,042
<i>Eventually, you'll end up dead.</i>

532
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,836
<i>Do you understand?</i>

533
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,092
<i>If you want to live, do as I say.</i>

534
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,267
<i>Please.</i>

535
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,685
[tense piano music playing]

536
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,361
[Yun-su] <i>No one can know you're alive.</i>

537
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,906
<i>Not your grandfather, not your friends.</i>

538
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,451
<i>You cannot be seen alive by anyone.</i>

539
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,959
[Se-hun] <i>My grandpa doesn't know</i>
<i>I come here.</i>

540
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,670
<i>He thinks I'm scared of this place.</i>

541
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,922
<i>I'll stay in the basement.</i>

542
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,799
<i>You can lock the door from outside.</i>

543
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,642
[Yun-su] <i>Give me one week.</i>

544
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,019
<i>Seven days.</i>

545
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,941
<i>Keep your head down until I come back.</i>

546
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,944
[dramatic string music playing]

547
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:55,327
[Yun-su] <i>I'll put everything back</i>
<i>the way it was.</i>

548
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,708
[music swells, subsides]

549
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,298
Don't bother, Ms. An.

550
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,467
[music fades]

551
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,512
I think our deal is void now.

552
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,391
[Yun-su breathing anxiously]

553
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,143
[uneasy music playing]

554
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:22,104
New deal.
I think I should kill you instead.

555
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,649
I wonder how you would do that

556
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,319
after you failed to kill the boy.

557
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:33,782
Do you know how to kill someone
with that thing?

558
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:42,666
You need to fill the syringe with air
before you stick it into my heart.

559
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,376
Then you push it in.

560
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,588
That will create an embolism,

561
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,381
and that'll kill me.

562
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,594
Go ahead.

563
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,105
I couldn't do it.

564
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,110
No matter how much he deserves to die,

565
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,695
I could never do it.

566
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,114
How can you kill someone?

567
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:21,080
If they deserve to die,
then it must happen.

568
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,415
He does.

569
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,459
I do too.

570
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,463
I'll tell everyone about his crimes.

571
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,298
He'll pay for everything.

572
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,634
I'll make him suffer
for the rest of his life. I swear.

573
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,719
So, please.

574
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,221
Plea…

575
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,266
[Yun-su sobs]

576
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,354
Give me another chance.

577
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,064
- Just one more.
- [music fades]

578
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,608
That kid…

579
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,446
[whispers] …is dead.

580
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,867
[stirring music playing]

581
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,916
[stirring music continues]

582
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,377
[cats meow]

583
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,404
[music intensifies]

584
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,704
