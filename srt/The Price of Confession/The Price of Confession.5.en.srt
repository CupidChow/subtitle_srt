- Ms. An Yun-su?

00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,803
- Do something! In the black hoodie!
- Ma'am, I need you to stay calm.

- Grab her!
- Wait! Over there!

Look! In the black hoodie!
Please, you gotta listen!

16
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,434
What's wrong with her?
I need you to calm down!

Sir, hi. Ryu Ji-su here.

57
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,956
I thought you'd wanna hear about this.

00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:36,442
[sighs] I see.
Uh, I'll be right there, okay?

67
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,402
Yeah.

68
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:41,030
Mr. Jang, I think you should stop by
Ms. An's house first.

69
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,534
<i>She said that Sop</i>
<i>is all by herself at home.</i>

<i>and she's afraid that Sop will be scared</i>
<i>if she sees them.</i>

72
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,966
- Uh, sir. Who are you?
- I'm An Yun-su's attorney.

73
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,427
Hold on a minute. You're her attorney?

[music fades]

75
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,725
The lights. Turn them off.
The whole neighborhood's about to wake up.

76
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,019
- [Sop] Put me down! Let go of me!
- [officer] It's okay.

77
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,062
- We're gonna go see Mommy.
- [Sop] Put me down!

78
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,522
Are you serious right now?

79
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,232
- You're gonna go see Mommy.
- Put me down!

80
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,651
- [Jeong-gu] Sop, I'm here.
- [officer] You're okay. You're…

81
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,237
- [Sop cries]
- [Jeong-gu] Everything's fine. I got her.

82
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,781
There. Sop, it's me. I'm sorry.

83
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,159
I got you.

84
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,995
Look at the CCTV from the center.

85
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,123
Mo Eun's gotta be in there.
Keep an eye out for her. Got it?

[tires squeal]

87
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,512
[Sun-deok] I heard what happened,
and I understand it was a tough situation.

88
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,222
But as protocol says,

89
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,975
probation violations
are ours to deal with.

90
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,226
Yeah, I don't think so.

91
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,022
We'll be bringing her in
for obstruction of justice

92
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,232
and assaulting a law enforcement officer.

93
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,737
Listen, this is not as easy
as you might think, all right?

94
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,198
A single report can change a lot.

95
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,288
It has the power to ruin someone's life.

96
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,331
[chuckles]

97
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,708
Is that some kind of manipulation?

98
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,919
Huh? Come on.

99
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,547
You want me to ignore a clear offense
out of compassion. Is that it?

100
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,759
What I'm saying is that you should try
to go at it differently.

101
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,803
Come to a rational decision.

102
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,638
Wow, you can't be serious.

103
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,680
[scoffs]

104
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,183
[Sun-deok] Oh.

105
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,061
I told you to watch the kid,
not bring her here!

106
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,397
Keep it down, or you'll wake her up.

107
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,111
[Yun-su] You brought Sop
all the way out here?

108
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,571
She cried the whole time
and fell asleep just now.

109
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,699
Could you please get me out of these?

110
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,203
Would you mind removing the cuffs?

111
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,248
She's not gonna run
with her child being here.

112
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,668
- And who are you?
- This is Ms. An Yun's lawyer.

113
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:01,838
Is that right?

114
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,005
[officer 1] Yes.

115
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,968
[sergeant] Take them off. Go ahead.

116
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,136
[officer 1] Yes, sir.

117
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,438
[Jeong-gu] I'll be back in a minute.

118
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,943
From now on, talk to me.

119
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,862
Yeah, understood.

120
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,702
[distant siren wailing]

121
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,039
- [Yun-su] <i>Please do something!</i>
- [sergeant] Look, you see that?

122
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,749
Her pushing and assaulting officers?

123
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,667
<i>Ms. An!</i>

124
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,461
[Yun-su] <i>Look! In the black hoodie!</i>

125
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,005
<i>- Hold her down!</i>
<i>- Ma'am, I need you to calm down!</i>

126
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,549
[Yun-su] <i>You gotta stop them!</i>
<i>Don't let them get away!</i>

127
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,592
[Sun-deok] God.

128
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,348
[sergeant] As you just saw,

129
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,809
we were simply following procedure
in making the arrest.

130
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,644
There. Plain as day.

131
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,771
[scoffs] Plain as day?

132
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,691
I mean, look at how many of you there are.

133
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,943
Why would you even consider
assaulting her?

134
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,945
That woman is coming at us
and starts grabbing.

135
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,655
What else do you wanna call that?

136
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,116
We can argue about it all you want.

137
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,368
There's one thing
I don't understand though.

138
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:18,164
Why is it that nobody ever tried
to hear my client out?

139
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:22,168
Look, the goal was to make an arrest.

140
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,337
Nobody was there to hear her out.

141
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,214
So you admit you ignored my client?

142
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:30,676
She's wearing an ankle monitor,
accused of murdering her own husband.

143
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,055
Why should we listen to someone like that?
What's the point?

144
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,521
Officer, are you willing

145
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,315
to put those exact words in your report?

146
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,236
Why do you want me to do that, huh?

147
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,905
It proves you were just out
to get my client.

148
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,992
And the last thing you needed
was a proper reason to do so.

149
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,494
[phone buzzes]

150
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,080
- [sighs] Goddamn it.
- [Jeong-gu] Hold on.

151
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,504
[sergeant] What am I looking at?

152
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,674
Just another thing you missed.

153
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,717
[suspenseful music playing]

154
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,389
[suspenseful music continues]

155
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,146
[Jeong-gu] <i>She says someone</i>
<i>was watching the house,</i>

156
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,691
<i>which is why she ran out of it</i>
<i>in the first place,</i>

157
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,859
<i>but the police refused to hear about it.</i>

158
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,281
- [Young-in] <i>So you need proof of that.</i>
- [Jeong-gu] <i>Yes.</i>

159
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,660
[Young-in] <i>I'll see what I can find,</i>
<i>but you should go to Ms. An.</i>

160
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,540
[suspenseful music continues]

161
00:09:55,678 --> 00:10:00,224
It's clear there was an intruder and that
my client went chasing after them.

162
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,059
Her altercation with the police

163
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,812
will be seen as self-defense
and not assault.

164
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,105
Agreed?

165
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,900
Or you prefer to have the police
exposed for negligence?

166
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,193
Is that how you wanna go?

167
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,988
Make it public
and see what the people think?

168
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,658
I, uh… [clears throat]

169
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,162
It's not our jurisdiction anyway,

170
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,165
so feel free to take her,
and then you can file your own report.

171
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,960
I don't know
why you're giving me that look.

172
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,213
We were honestly just there for support.

173
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,506
How sad.

174
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,802
Going through all that trouble
only to get flak for it in the end.

175
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,888
It must be weird for you.

176
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,058
All right. Good work.

177
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,312
Hey, don't forget this!

178
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,397
[sergeant] Is that ours?

179
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,821
[Yun-su] Wow.

180
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,241
That really makes my anklet look prettier.

181
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,911
Thank you, baby.

182
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,582
Here too?

183
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,334
[chuckles]

184
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,920
Thank you so much.

185
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,300
How did it go?

186
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,470
It went fine.
Rest a little, and you'll be good to go.

187
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,222
Fine? What do you mean?

188
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:26,394
Uh, tonight's incident
will be reported to the court.

189
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,229
Uh… [chuckles]

190
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,855
We'll have to wait and see if the judge

191
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,942
is willing to consider
the extenuating circumstances.

192
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,652
Well, I'm pretty sure they will

193
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,405
once they've read the report
that Sun-deok is gonna write.

194
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:38,864
That I am?

195
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,452
I'm just gonna describe what happened.

196
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,955
Just what we need, the facts. Period.

197
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,416
It should be enough, right?

198
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,668
Yeah.

199
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,424
Uh, I'll postpone next week's meeting.

200
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,176
Just come by the office
once you've been discharged

201
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,886
and are feeling better.

202
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,805
We don't need to reschedule.

203
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,641
Um, do you mind if we head home?

204
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,643
Sop, we're leaving.

205
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,020
Oh, are you okay to go?

206
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,439
Yeah, it's fine.

207
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,776

209
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,910
[Jeong-gu] Ah, really?

210
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,165
Hi there!

211
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,333
You must be Sop. [laughs]

212
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,503
You like chocolate milk? Look at that.
Wanna have some with me?

213
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,630
I told you not to follow strangers.
Remember?

214
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,973
Ms. An Yun-su.

215
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,104
MO EUN MISSING FROM DETENTION
AS OF 10:30 P.M.

216
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,689
[Dong-hun] Who were you running after?

217
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,441
[tense music playing]

218
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,785
[Dong-hun] Who was it?

219
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,705
Aren't you getting paid
to figure that out?

220
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,000
That's right, which is why I wanna know
who you thought you were pursuing.

221
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,378
Someone came into her yard
and managed to peer into the house.

222
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,672
Someone wearing a black hoodie.

223
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,382
How was she supposed to react?

224
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,929
She's clearly the victim here.
Why do you insist on being so rude to her?

225
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:27,932
Let's go, Sop.

226
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,728
- This way.

227

[tense music continues]

230
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,906
It's on the flash drive.

231
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,241
All right.

232
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,833
[Ji-su] Dashcam footage
from the police car.

233
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,546
You already knew they'd found Mo Eun.

234
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,841
So why did you do it?

235
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,511
I wanted to see how An Yun-su would react.

236
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:10,933
I wanted to know how much influence
Mo Eun has over her while she's in jail.

237
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,894
I was curious.

238
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,780
[music fades]

239
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,826
[Ms. Eom] Doctor!

240
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,962
[mysterious music playing]

241
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,925
It was an emergency.

242
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,344
She'd gone into shock from a spider bite.

243
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,931
I just gave her something
to calm her down, and she fell asleep.

244
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,558
Asleep for how long?

245
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,393
She took the meds
about three hours ago, so--

246
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,686
Not her.

247
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,897
I meant you.

248
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,565
Oh, me?

249
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,319
I just passed out a little.
I had been up all night.

250
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,654
Did I do something wrong?

251
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,535
[Young-in] <i>The guards took Mo Eun</i>
<i>to the infirmary but forgot to log it.</i>

252
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,747
They say it's a pretty common mistake.

253
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,957
Oh, another thing.

254
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,919
It appears that during the time
she was gone, all the CCTV cameras

255
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,629
<i>were coincidentally down.</i>

256
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,299
<i>It seems there was</i>
<i>a server error or something.</i>

257
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,928
Do you believe that anything
could have happened during that time?

258
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,973
Not according to Ms. Eom,
and I couldn't really press any further.

259
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,184
It felt like I would be overstepping.

260
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,728
[Jeong-gu] I see.
Thank you so much, Mr. Jin.

261
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,521
<i>You did all the work, really.</i>

262
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,733
<i>Oh, and please tell Ms. An</i>
<i>not to worry too much.</i>

263
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,693
- [Jeong-gu] I will.

Our deal comes with an expiration date.

278
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,328
You'll have to meet the requirement

279
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,874
before your appeal trial begins.

280
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,793
If you hesitate and miss the deadline,

281
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:29,298
I'll retract my confession
while I'm on the stand at your trial.

282
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,717
Then you'll end up back here,

283
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,845
crumbling under the world's harassment
all over again.

284
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,098
And your daughter will grow up alone,

absolutely anything for their child.

Hey, you seem a little small though.

342
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,047
And you want me to believe
you killed someone

344
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,639
I shouldn't have said that, right?

345
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,685
Anyway, we're gonna rub shoulders
for a bit, and that's it.

Yeah, unless you mess with me.

I don't know why you're trying
to poke a reaction out of her.

513
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,197
I assume you took her case
because of some principle

that even the worst maniacs
deserve representation.

[music fades]

523
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,285
Can you confirm
that you had nothing to do with this?

524
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,037
What?

525
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,958
That person An Yun-su said
she saw in her backyard.

526
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,627
Are you saying

527
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,005
that I somehow left this place?

528
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,215
[sighs]

529
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,759
No, I'm not. Now that I think of it.

530
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,971
Then what?

531
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,477
[laughing]

532
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,859
I didn't take you for that type.

533
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,238
But you have quite
the sense of imagination, don't you?

534
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,284
It's just that

535
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,828
Ms. An seems genuinely anxious.

536
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:00,997
Oh.

537
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:04,917
[chuckles]

538
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:11,966
[guard] Stop.

539
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,968
278, 3392, get in.

540
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:19,974
Walk.

545
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,099
Should I take you home?

546
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,143
Focus will be on the dentist couple
in today's hearings,

547
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,729
so you might wanna skip this one.

548
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,564
- I can just go on my own.
- [Yun-su] No, I…

549
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,484
I wanna see.

550
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,616
[man 1] If you're here
to observe the trial, line up over here.

551
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,077
- If you're press or involved in the trial…
- [man 2] That's it.

552
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,995
- …proceed to Courtroom 501.
- [man 2] This way.

553
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,582
[man 1] If you have a gallery pass,
head to Courtroom 502 for the video feed.

554
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,167
[man 3] Arms out, please.

555
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:31,045
[man 1] Make sure you're in
the right line. Over here. Thank you.

[handcuffs rattling]

557
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,356
Last time, your jacket was quite wrinkled.

558
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,568
I tried to pick something similar enough.

559
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,415
You don't like it?

560
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,542
No, I just

561
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,752
prefer my own.

562
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:15,590
Fine.

563
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,389
I appreciate it.

564
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,408
This way.

565
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,839
You're all right?

566
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,206
[people murmuring]

567
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,219
An Yun-su. She preferred to stay
with her lawyer in the other room.

568
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,263
There are too many reporters in here.

569
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,686
How can you tell who I'm looking for?

570
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,316
I bumped into her when I came in.

571
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,862
What about the victim's family?
Are they here?

572
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,782
Uh, only the grandfather.

573
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,492
Yeah, he's in room 2 as well.

574
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:08,577
Why?

575
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,247
You have something to tell them, Ms. Mo?

576
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,430
[reporter 1] Over here. Yeah, right here.

577
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:31,976
[reporter 2] Hello.

578
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,853
- [reporter 3] Hello.
- [reporter 4] How are you?

579
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,276
[court clerk]
The court is now in session. All rise.

580
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,918
Please be seated.

581
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,103
[judge] The defense may now make
their opening statement.

582
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,313
Thank you.

583
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,654
Not long ago,

584
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,991
I posed a question to the defendant.

585
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,410
I asked her what she wanted from me.

586
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,828
Her response was simple.

587
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,997
"Can you please sit next to me

588
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,291
until the trial is over?"

589
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:39,877
Truth is,

590
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,922
there's not a lot I can do for her.

591
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,256
I'll admit it.

592
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:48,719
The crime she committed
was incredibly brutal and grotesque.

593
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,137
That's a fact.

594
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:54,683
<i>She knew that pleading for leniency</i>
<i>would be out of the question.</i>

595
00:39:55,976 --> 00:40:00,022
However, I still decided
to stand before you today,

596
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,442
to ensure that the defendant
has the chance to reflect

597
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,070
on what she's done
for the rest of her life.

598
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,406
[eerie mysterious music playing]

599
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,950
Because there's one thing
she deserves more than death.

600
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,994
And that's the right to live.

601
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:20,793
- [whispers] <i>There's not much time left.</i>

Hold on!

608
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,661
Ms. Mo, what did you just say?

609
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,164
You mouthed something to the camera.
I saw you.

610
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,499
- Your Honor.
- What was it? What were you saying?

611
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,585
Your Honor, he's meddling
with the opening statement.

612
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,296
As you know,
speaking from the gallery is forbidden.

613
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,006
Who were you saying that to?

614
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,968
Request a review of the footage.

615
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,554
Prosecutor Baek, take your seat, now.

616
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:19,143
Your Honor,
I'm requesting a review of the footage.

There's not much time left.

- [reporter 6] Time?
- Don't try and get smart now.

[eerie tense music playing]

Who were you speaking to,
and what did you mean by it?

631
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:21,080
Objection. This matter
is not pertinent to the case.

632
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,415
The remark was made
while we were in session.

633

Whether it's relevant or not
is for me to determine.
