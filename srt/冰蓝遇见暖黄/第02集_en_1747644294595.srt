Wait for you

00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,240
Episode 4

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
are they the same?

4
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,680
OK, let's go.

5
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:19,280

7
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,560
OK

8
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,520
Your concentration needing to decide

9
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,400
is Men in Yellow clothes and womened clothes.

10
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,840
Good girl!

11
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,920
Go with men, women and women.

12
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,040
Come on.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,760
Or there can't be a doctor and the heart doesn't belong to the twist

14
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,780
Serbia

15
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,380
The yellow color

16
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,100
A strike

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,200
Wow, we should have known each other before.

18
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,860
If you feel so stupid,

19
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,320
just get on my business,

20
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,200
will you?

21
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,400
How can people run away?

22
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:36,900
Wait.

23
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,600
Do you really think I'm your bullied dad?

24
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,880
Of course not.

25
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,400
Stop.

26
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,600
It smells familiar.

27
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,160
It's a familiar style.

28
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,200
The number of marriage indexes has increased to 33.

29
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,480
Don't leave.

30
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,480
The second part will start soon.

31
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,280
It's him.

32
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,400
It's him.

33
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,640
It's him.

34
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:12,340
Kill, kill, script, mind, vision saat 으로

35
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,840
Hey, there

36
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,720
are six sixteenthnae hors.

37
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,560
How should I say it out loud?

38
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,320
It's my first time doing this.

39
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,560
I'm inexperienced.

40
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,240
He shook his watch.

41
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,520
The watch was shining.

42
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,160
It was printed on their faces.

43
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,880
He lifted his face and let go.

44
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,040
The story began

45
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
in an instant.

46
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
The story began in an instant.

47
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,280
The plot in the novel is real.

48
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,920
Shouldn't it be

49
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,480
my story?

50
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,520
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,120
It's okay.

52
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,280
He's 76.

53
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,960
He's the one who did it.

54
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
How could he have succeeded

55
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,960
before he got on the bus?

56
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,600
Travel is like a jade.

57
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,560
The day after tomorrow,

58
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,200
we can go back to the Sky Kingdom

59
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,080
and get the award.

60
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,200
What else do you have?

61
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
You have a good taste, too.

62
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,360
Then add me on WeChat.

63
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,120
Okay.

64
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,080
It's 99.

65
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,240
Heaven and earth are two worlds.

66
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,200
One hammer and one sound.

67
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,720
Brother.

68
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,800

72
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,000

73
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,680
Learn to play Lan Xin's show.

74
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,360
You...

75
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,440
Dare you take off your vest?

76
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,720
Wu Lan Xin.

77
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,520
Follow me.

78
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880

79
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,160
You smelly dog. Put it on.

80
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,320
Princess Tai Ping.

81
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,000
You...

82
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,440
It's you.

83
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,720
You're dead.

84
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,080
The number of good feelings has become one.

85
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,040
What's going on?

86
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,160
The plot has reversed

87
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,240
too suddenly.

88
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,720
Is it the arrangement of Heaven?

89
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,280
I still like her

90
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,040
so much when I see her again.

91
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,800
The Yingu tribe.

92
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,000
Good plan.

93
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,280
Act it out.

94
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Why are you acting differently?

95
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,240
Are you serious?

96
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,120
What a coincidence.

97
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,360
You've changed too.

98
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,040
You've become more friendly.

99
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,240
You still owe me an apology.

100
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,600
You're so grumpy.

101
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,280
Gather up.

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,440
You're in the wrong team.

105
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,840
You're in the wrong team.

106
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,960
It's true.

107
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,040
Blind date team.

108
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,520
I want to quit.

109
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,840
She wants to quit.

110
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,880
