1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I can't wait for you

2
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm back

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm finally back

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I finally don't have to wear a mask anymore

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Wait a minute

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Isn't the golden egg expired?

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How did we come back?

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Time's up

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Huang Zhidong is abroad

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Thank you, earth

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's round

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That old man and old lady

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Regret for a lifetime

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
When I was young

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Women don't want to stay

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Men don't want to bow down

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
As a result, I regret it for a lifetime

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Brother

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes, I tell you

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That old man and old lady

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's a pity

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
When I was young

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
When I was young

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Men don't want to bow down

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Women don't want to stay

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
As a result, I regret it for a lifetime

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hurry up

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hide the sky

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What to do

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Finally, I can go back to the sky

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Happy cooperation

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Please

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Please

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What's wrong?

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What's going on?

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Huang Zhidong's time travel

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Caused the Heermen to be chaotic

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Losing interest in the opposite sex

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Music index is down

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What's wrong?

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What's wrong?

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What's wrong?

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What's wrong?

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What's wrong?

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What's wrong?

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What's wrong?

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What's wrong?

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What's wrong?

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What's wrong?

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What's wrong?

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What's wrong?

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Zhidong

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Zhidong

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What should I do now?

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Change the female lead's character

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Four-legged Heermen split

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Artistic

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Passionate man

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Brother

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Brother

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Brother

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Brother

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Can this work?

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
rest assured

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This most of the feelings in the world

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It all started with Brother

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let Brother stimulate his Heer зар

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Go find you fun

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Find fun

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Find fun

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Go to the club

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Run two steps

77
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,800
Dad, this is the roasted sesame seed in the oven.

78
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Let's try it.

79
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,960
Let's go to the oven.

80
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,960
You go first.

81
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,040
Lao Hong, chicken is a bug.

82
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,880
Lao Hong.

83
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,880
I don't want to play anymore.

84
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,640
Let's see where Ming Tian goes tomorrow.

85
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,440
Play...

86
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,640
You want to go there?

87
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,320
Nonsense. Let's drink.

88
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,920
What?

89
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,840
Come on.

90
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,480
No.

91
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,080
You can't beat me, you coward.

92
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,720
I'm afraid of you.

93
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,240
It's a deal.

94
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,600
Whoever loses today will pay the bill.

95
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,520
Okay.

96
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't let go.

97
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,440
It's a deal.

98
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,320
Three, two, one.

99
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,280
It's working.

100
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,600
As expected.

101
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,240
The big data can't beat me.

102
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,200
Most people are close to their brothers.

103
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,720
Come on.

104
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,120
A manager?

105
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
Come on.

106
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,600
You rascal.

107
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,440
I'm a little shaken.

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,880
Can you do that?

109
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,800
You can be some power?

110
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,440
I'm a little.

111
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:43,720
I know.

112
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,520
It's true.

113
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,080
You're really...

114
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:49,960
You...

115
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,680
Bro, you can't do this.

116
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,800
You're too weak.

117
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,160
I can't do this.

118
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,920
Pay the bill.

119
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,000
Boss,

120
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,200
come and have a try.

121
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,480
You have to pay for it.

122
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,360
This...

123
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,880
feels like a brother.

124
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,560
Bro.

125
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,400
Your ten-pack waist.

126
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,760
Enjoy it.

127
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,520
Thank you, boss.

128
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,560
Call me if you need anything.

129
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,400
Here.

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,640
For you.

131
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,320
Boss, you're generous.

132
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,560
Listen to me.

133
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,160
Let's go.

134
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,680
I'm hungry.

135
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,360
How can I eat without a knife?

136
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,280
Eat it.

137
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,680
This...

138
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,040
This is a melon.

139
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,440
It's a little...

140
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,200
It's working.

141
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,720
Add another fire.

142
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:30,920
No.

143
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,040
Change the character.

144
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,960
Keep it fresh.

145
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,680
What character?

146
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,800
Sexy and sexy.

147
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,360
Try it.

148
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,320
You're old.

149
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,680
You're old.

150
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,480
You're old.

151
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
You're old.

152
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
You're old.

153
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
You're old.

154
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
You're old.

155
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,480
You're old.

156
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
You're old.

157
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
You're old.

158
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
You're old.

159
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
You're old.

160
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
You're old.

161
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
You're old.

162
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
You're old.

163
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
You're old.

164
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
You're old.

165
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
You're old.

166
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
You're old.

167
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
You're old.

168
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
You're old.

169
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
You're old.

170
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
You're old.

171
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
You're old.

172
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
You're old.

173
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
You're old.

174
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
You're old.

175
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,480
You're old.

176
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
You're old.

177
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
You're old.

178
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,480
You're old.

179
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
At this moment,

180
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,520
our smile will go back

181
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,320
to you and me.
