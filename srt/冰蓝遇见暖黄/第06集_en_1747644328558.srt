1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'll wait for you forever.

2
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,760
Get off.

3
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,880
I won't give you another chance to hit me.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,640
Really?

5
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,480
But the clue...

6
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:58,960
You...

7
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,720
Do you know what the clue is?

8
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,120
You'll be my poet.

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,080
I'll be your poet.

10
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,040
What's the clue?

11
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,720
You can have the clue.

12
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,200
The condition is

13
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,520
a painting of Huang Di Di

14
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,560
and a new poem of Lan Xin.

15
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,080
You know me?

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,640
I'm your fan.

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,120
This isn't my...

18
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,920
What right do you have to put your book on me?

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,560
I'll let you do it.

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,280
Then...

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,880
What kind of painting do you want?

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,160
What kind of poem do you want?

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,480
A poem about fate.

24
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,320
What's the thing you regret the most?

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,160
Sir Zhang Da Hai is no longer with us.

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,600
But do you still remember Warumin Grey?

27
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,880
Justin!

28
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,320
Justin!

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,900
Since your father died,

30
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,100
you are here to remember that.

31
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,060
Yin Lan系.

32
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,660
On the day you do not know,

33
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,180
I am leaving.

34
00:02:51,180 --> 00:03:02,780
You are

35
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,300
Who are you

36
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,540
You are me

37
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,380
I am you

38
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,300
You are辛苦

39
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,840
Yin Lanxin!

40
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
Yin Lanxin!

41
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,760
Where are you?

42
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,240
Yin Lanxin!

43
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,880
Yin Lanxin!

44
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,200
Yin Lanxin!

45
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,200
Yin Lanxin!

46
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,640
Yin Lanxin!

47
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
Password?

48
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,720
Try the password.

49
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,720
One, two, three, four.

50
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,400
No.

51
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Four, three, two, one.

52
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,480
You fool!

53
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,720
That day was June 14th.

54
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,400
What?

55
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,000
What's wrong?

56
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,240
What?

57
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,160
Open it.

58
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,320
How did you know the password?

59
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,640
This...

60
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,040
This is an méchanic fromни That you don't need to know.

61
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
Why is it missing a page?

62
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,840
Even if life...

63
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
Even if life is a mess,

64
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
I have to crush it.

65
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Make it into an art piece.

66
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
Perfect.

67
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
And not inferior.

68
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
Who is in your painting?

71
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
I threw the poem into the wind.

72
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,840
Who threw the poem into the corner?

73
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,840
Seeing another person go away.

74
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
Ying Lanxi!

75
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
Ying Lanxi!

76
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,840
The End

77
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
Your poem is good.

78
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
If you take two more steps forward,

79
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,840
you will find that I'm not bad either.

80
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Stop!

81
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,840
The North and South of the South.

82
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Don't you know that someone...

83
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
Hey!

84
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,840
Someone is going to buy you coffee.

85
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Ice cream is your favorite.

86
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,840
How do you know that I like ice cream?

87
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
It's hot.

88
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,840
It's my passion.

89
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
It's melting.

90
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
The violent mode has been completed.

91
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,840
Please continue to experience.

92
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,840
You can also do magic?

93
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
I...

94
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,840
You're a little less interesting than a magician.

95
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
What a wonderful experience.

96
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,840
There's music.

97
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
Let's dance.

98
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
Can I invite you to dance?

99
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
Who are you?

100
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
A major crisis.

101
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
A major crisis.

102
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
A major crisis.

103
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
No.

104
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Who is he?

105
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Could it be...

106
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
It's him!

107
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
What?

108
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,840
It's not easy to get a skill.

109
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,840
Do you think there's only one person in the world?

110
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
No.

111
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,840
It's a big mistake.

112
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
I'm sorry.

113
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840

I'm sorry.

142
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
I'm sorry.
