4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,500
hello

7
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,620
Right now he's Everywhere in midnight

8
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,740
At this moment, the force of the Goddess is entangled

9
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,860
She is demanding him

10
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,060
Blow his wings

11
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,780
Either way,

12
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,860
In the end, people need to be oğlum

13
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,500
Come on, open it

14
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,420
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,420
The number you dialed is power off.

16
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,420
Sorry.

17
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,420
Everything is records are wrong?

18
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,420
A prophecy is law.

19
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,240
Don't you dare touch her.

20
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,340
Or I'll kill herself.

21
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,500
You must have been exhausted.

22
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,300
I'm exhausted too.

23
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,340
Have they really quit?

24
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,540
Can we really meet again?

25
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,700
Yes.

26
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,060
But I'm not sure.

27
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,900
Maybe tomorrow,

28
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,740
maybe ten years later.

29
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,540
I have to control it.

30
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,820
I can't see its movements.

31
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,340
I can't think of it again.

32
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,740
If time can stop,

33
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,260
I really want to go back to that moment.

34
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,180
I like you,

35
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,700
but

36
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,300
I didn't expect that

37
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,740
I wouldn't be able to be yourself.

38
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,420
affinity

39
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,020
Iالve fallen in love

40
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,380
Listen,

41
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,300
do you think it's not like to avoid different things like you do?

42
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,460
I will let you feel your own feelings all at the moment.

43
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,740
All of you can figure things out.

44
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,580
Then I can start showing you

45
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,540
the rest,

46
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,820
just for this moment.

47
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,700
Good night.

48
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,460
The meeting is at 8. Don't be late.

49
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,060
Some employees have been working these days.

50
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,380
They are not self-employed.

51
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,660
Noapa

52
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,700
Don't demand anything for me!

53
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,000
So good

54
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,680
I like you

55
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,960
Your cuteness is like a flower

56
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,740
In virgin

57
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,240
It is cold

58
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,200
Ice

59
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,160
See

60
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,500
You tell me

61
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,540
Green

62
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,320
Air

63
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,660
This relationship elects her,

64
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,260
As she will be in Yang Palon's heart.

65
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,580
Searching for evidence

66
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,180
to bare evidence

67
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:49,980
One by one

68
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,160
Going through phras Cóc

69
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:52,960
installed

70
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,720
The love is 150.

71
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,840
The child must be very glorious.

72
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,080
The love story is a good example.

73
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,280
There is also a good cook.

74
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,960
We are not suitable.

75
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,000
I like the comic of Huang Didi.

76
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,160
I don't know why.

77
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,520
It's been a month.

78
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,280
Hurry up, Men.

79
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,960
I...

80
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,760
Hurry up. It's almost there.

81
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
Okay.

82
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,960
The Love Story of Huang Didi

83
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,760
It's not me.

84
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
It's not me.

85
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,160
The last two eggs.

86
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,080
It's gone after you use it.

87
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
Wait a minute.

88
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,280
Maybe the wish of the tour guide

89
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,760
will come true tomorrow.

90
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
The Love Story of Huang Didi

91
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,080
Hello.

92
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,960
Honey, what time will you work overtime tonight?

93
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,320
I'm sorry, honey.

94
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,840
I lied to you.

95
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,760
I won't work overtime tonight.

96
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,760
Huang Didi.

97
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Hello.

98
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,760
Honey, listen to me.

99
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Hello.

100
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,560
Huang Didi.

101
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,760
It's a kind of happiness to have someone love you.

102
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,680
It's also a kind of happiness to have no company to make you happy.

103
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,680
A famous writer hasn't published his first draft.

104
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,040
The company bought copyright.

105
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,760
I'll give you the same comic.

106
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
By the way,

107
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,760
he'll come to the company tomorrow to untie you.

108
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,560
Huang Didi.

109
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
I know you very well.

110
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,160
Why did you come to me?

111
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Huang Didi.

112
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
You're annoying.

113
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
I'm going.

114
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
Lan Xin.

115
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Huang Didi.

116
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
Don't be afraid.

117
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
Yes.

118
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Let's go.

119
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,760
My heart is beating so fast.

120
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,760
Real men should face the pain.

121
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,760
Catch it.

122
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,760
The End

123
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
Why do you look at me like that?

124
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,760
How should I explain to him?

125
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,760
This damn strong personality can't open his mouth.

126
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Zhang Zhidong.

127
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Stop dreaming.

128
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
This woman doesn't love you.

129
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Have you read the draft?

130
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
I'm working with you.

131
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,760
This...

132
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,760
This...

133
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
This...

134
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,760
I don't have it.

135
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,760
What do you mean?

136
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,760
I want to change someone.

137
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
Zhao Yanan is the most suitable for you.

138
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
This is not the reunion I want to start.

139
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
Zhao Yanan

140
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,760
