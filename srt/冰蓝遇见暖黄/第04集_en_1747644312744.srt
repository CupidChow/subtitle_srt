1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm waiting for you

2
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,280
Ridiculous

3
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,440
What's going on, Dong

4
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,440
You go first, I go first

5
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,000
I go first

6
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,120
It seems that the force is not effective

7
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,600
We have to find the proof of the problem

8
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,240
Blue gas saturation is 3.14% 15926

9
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,080
Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you

10
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,200
Isn't it just a pie if you work hard for a long time?

11
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,680
It seems that there is a chance to rebuild the character

12
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,520
Calculate the highest proportion of blue gas saturation

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,160
Okay, your grace

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,240
Abusive president

15
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,640
Row

16
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:43,540
한

17
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:45,860
Come on

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm here.

19
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,200
119.

20
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,120
According to my previous experience,

21
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,360
my right face

22
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,240
should have a lip print.

23
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,200
My right face.

24
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,320
Let's go.

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,480
Let's go.

26
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,840
Eight palm.

27
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,600
It can't delete my beauty.

28
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,600
It's 120.

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,040
You lost.

30
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,760
Hey.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,040
Please take it seriously.

32
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,560
It's more than 120.

33
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,680
You're so mean.

34
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,600
This is the bow I prepared for you.

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,640
Usually, when I'm not around,

36
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,680
she'll protect you.

37
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,200
Enough.

38
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,920
Let's go back to our search,

39
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:28,980
and blood

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:55,920
Aquarius

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,360
The 101th parliamentary statement,

42
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,560
I swear to you.

43
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,320
As luggage,

44
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,120
I'll explain it bravely!

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
There are so many competitors.

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Am I really worthy of her?

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Or

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Can only watch her from afar

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,700
Not you, even if you were Northernестor to me,

51
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:12,100
you would still be able to come out of your comfort zone As a harmony.

52
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:19,700
That's why, giving up too early in this experiment means that nobody will be able to find your feelings properly.

53
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,220
charismatic and beautiful

54
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,560
Everything can be explained right away.

55
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,820
so it's 3 million yuan month away?!

56
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,820
I'm sorry.

Our monitor didn't wear clothes

120
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,820
Monitor, Huang Shidong really saw you through

121
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,820
He saw through

122
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
Are you still crying?

123
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
I heard about your story

124
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,820
This is a big problem for you

125
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:34,820
But can we change the way we treat this?

126
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
You just left like that?

127
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820

I'm 17 years old

129
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
I left a scar

130
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,820
It's so far away

131
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,820

My biggest scar is from you

134
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
Do you still blame me?
