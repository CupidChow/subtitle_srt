1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,700
You're always the one who summer's fallen

2
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,420
Episode 12

3
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,100
Song Liancheng

4
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,500
Is that okay?

5
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,500
Don't worry.

6
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,260
The cure is coming.

7
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,260
Let's go.

8
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,940
Only one percent.

9
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,700
Didn't you say you wanted to get the cure?

10
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Don't worry.

11
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,540
Hey, beauty.

12
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,060
Drink with me.

13
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,500
Just one.

14
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,220
What?

15
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:00,900
I can drink it all.

16
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,740
What are you doing?

17
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:04,740
I...

18
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,020
I...

19
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,500
I...

20
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,300
I...

21
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,460
I...

22
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,300
I...

23
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:10,820
What are you doing?

24
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,020
Are you a thief?

25
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,340
What are you doing?

26
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,580
Do you want me to kill you?

27
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,580
You know...

28
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:20,740
Watch out!

29
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,100
I'll kill you.

30
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,660
How can you make it?

31
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,180
I think you can.

32
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,860
You can hit me 100 times with this fist.

33
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,260
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,220
Xiu Xin!

35
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,420
Qi Tuo! Qi Tuo!

36
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,740
Are you okay?

37
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,340
Qi Tuo!

38
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,540
Qi Tuo!

39
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,580
Qi Tuo, are you okay?

40
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,100
Yin Lan Xin.

41
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,860
I...

42
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,420
I won't let you cry again.

43
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,460
Long time no see.

44
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,580
Qi Tuo!

45
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,820
Qi Tuo!

46
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,540
Qi Tuo!

47
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,220
Qi Tuo!

48
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,340
I didn't expect him to still be here.

49
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,660
Do you know?

50
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,540
This sculpture

51
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,220
is the work that I like the most.

52
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,660
The past,

53
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,340
the present,

54
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,060
and the future.

55
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,060
Here.

56
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,020
I can't even make a better work.

57
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,020
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,100
At that time,

59
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,820
I hurt you.

60
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:15,780
In 2009,

61
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,500
Zha Xin Yue,

62
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,940
I made a promise

63
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,020
for the 101st love letter

64
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,700
to let you know who I am.

65
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,020
But

66
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,820
I've turned back on myself,

67
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Not because I don't like you enough,

68
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
but because I like you too much.

69
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
You have a higher goal.

70
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
I don't want to be your stepping stone.

71
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
I believe

72
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,500
one day you will be a great writer.

73
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
I'm very close to you,

74
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
but also very far.

75
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Let this letter

76
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
become the soul of the goddess.

77
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,500
It will be the most perfect work in my life.

78
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,500
We will be together forever.

79
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Huang Zhidong.

80
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Please open the file.

81
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
This is the love letter

82
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
that is not written in the 100 pages.

83
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Silly.

84
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Why

85
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
do I have this strange feeling?

86
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Are you in love?

87
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
How could it be?

88
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
How could it be her?

89
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Time will give you the answer.

90
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
What answer?

91
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Wrong answer.

92
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Change channel. Change channel.

93
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
You are quite pretentious.

94
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
If you like it,

95
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
I can keep pretending.

96
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
118.

97
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Woman.

98
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
You are leaving.

99
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
You are leaving.

100
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
I can help you.

101
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
I know.

102
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
You have been conquered by me last night.

103
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
From today on,

104
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
you are not allowed to use Chen Lin's excuse.

105
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Get off.

106
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
I won't let you pretend again.

107
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Really?

108
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
But the clue...

109
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Do you know what the clue is?

110
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
You are my poet.

111
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
I am your poet.

112
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:39,060
The

113
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
I heard that

114
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
women like to close their eyes when kissing.

115
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
So

116
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
you are hinting me.

117
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Are you crazy?

118
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
It's 130.

119
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
I...

120
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Someone lost.

121
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
How could I lose 130?

122
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
You are so ugly.

123
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
You scared me.

124
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Stay away from me.

125
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
You are so ugly.

126
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
You are so ugly.

127
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Stay away from me.

128
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
I'm so ugly.

129
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
I'm so ugly.

130
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Don't you know

131
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,500
how to attract women?

132
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
What are you going to do?

133
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
I will give you an opportunity

134
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
to make you happy.

135
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:57,500
The rain, the waves and the windows

136
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:05,500
The world is missing, and people meet at this moment

137
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Our smiles will go back, to meet you and me

138
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Our smiles will go back, to meet you and me

139
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:27,500
The rain, the waves and the windows

140
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,500
The world is missing, and people meet at this moment

141
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Our smiles will go back, to meet you and me

142
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,500
The rain, the waves and the windows

143
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:54,500
The world is missing, and people meet at this moment
