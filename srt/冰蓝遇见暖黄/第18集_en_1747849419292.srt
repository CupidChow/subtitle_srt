1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'll always be waiting for you.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The Long Ballad

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Episode 15

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Big Head! Big Head!

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Big Head! Big Head!

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Big Head! Big Head!

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So annoying!

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Big Head! Big Head!

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
A man and a woman who are far away from each other

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and a writer are having a late night date.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Is it true love or a trick?

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Huang Zhidong's draft is a tragedy.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The online public doesn't like it.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Enough.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Sister Xin, don't let these gossip affect your mood.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's not affected. It's fake.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But don't worry. I won't be beaten.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Good luck! I have faith in you.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Sister Xin, I think you should be sexy tonight.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Really?

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's see this.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Sexy?

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm not sexy.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I know you. Who are you?

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Lan Xin's top boyfriend.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm not. You're wrong.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You are.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Lan Xin's boyfriend can't be so bad.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How am I bad?

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Hello, Mr. Yue.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You finally found my work.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You used my pen name, Huang Didi.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But you have to sign the contract.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If you can't buy it, you have to change your pen name

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
to Lan Xin's boyfriend.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What? Not confident?

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The magic of love is turning.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I want to prove that I'm the real man.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But you are afraid that failure is not worth it.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You have to take the risk.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I love you...

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I sign.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I sign.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're hurt.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Sit.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Tomorrow, we will publish your comic.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And promote it.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Tomorrow?

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But there is a villain in your comic.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's not clear enough.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You have to change it.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll change it now.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll give you some hints.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Middle-aged woman.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes, flower.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
A little fat.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's good.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But it looks familiar.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This one.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Come on.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Stand up.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We will open the door tomorrow.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
OK.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Come on, brother.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Come on.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Where is Lan Xin?

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The media guests are here.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Why hasn't Lan Xin come?

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Sorry, Mr. Zhang.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Xin has an appointment today.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Let's change the day.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Right.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
When is the signing with Mr. Zhang?

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I changed it on the day after tomorrow.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Today, you should celebrate the anniversary with Huang Zhidong.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
OK.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Such a big fight.

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're playing me.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You're too much.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
One hundred.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I hope we can have a drink.

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Mr. Zhang.

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Your boyfriend is drunk.

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Please come to pick him up.

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Cheers.

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
How many times have I said?

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm not Lan Xin.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm not Lan Xin.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm Huang Zhidong.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm Huang Zhidong.

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Get up.

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Huang Zhidong.

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Lan Xin.

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Why are you here?

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Lan Xin.

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I miss you.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This.

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Huang Zhidong, wake up.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Huang Zhidong, wake up.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Who are you?

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Huang Zhidong.

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's so obvious.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't.

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Listen to me.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He drank too much because he signed the contract with me.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's the most important thing in life.

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Please forgive him.

110
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Forgive him?

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Huang Zhidong.

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Huang Zhidong.

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Huang Zhidong.

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Huang Zhidong.

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Huang Zhidong.

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Huang Zhidong.

117
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Huang Zhidong.

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Huang Zhidong.

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Huang Zhidong.

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Huang Zhidong.

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Huang Zhidong.

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Huang Zhidong.

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Huang Zhidong.

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Huang Zhidong.

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Huang Zhidong.

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I told you many times.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm not Ying Lanxin.

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm Huang Zhidong.

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm Huang Zhidong.

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Our smiles will go back.

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Meet me and you.

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Our smiles will go back.

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Meet me and you.

134
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The sun and the sea.

135
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The waves and the tide.

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Time makes people miss.

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Also make people meet.

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
At this moment, our smiles will go back.

139
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Meet me and you.
