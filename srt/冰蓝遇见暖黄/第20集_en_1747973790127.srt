00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,020
The grass recruiting office on Diocrity

5
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,660
where is it for?

6
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,000
One of my Issac strangers

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,500
Only go around

8
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,120
When I dream

9
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,120
I can't get up

10
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,300
G recursos

11
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,780

His Majesty

15
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,380
Madam

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Brother Huang, you dare to see me?

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You little bastard.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You are a bastard.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You should have seen it first.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Huang Zhidong, you are going to see me like this?

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You are too clever.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What do you know?

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is not a good way to be a fool.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You are so stupid.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You are more capable of drawing this old woman's image.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You are more clever.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You are more capable of drawing the moon.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Why is this happening?

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Huang Zhidong, you are too disappointed in me.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Girl, let's go.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Lan Xi.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Explain to me.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What do you mean?

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You hit me.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Lan Xi.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hit me.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Lan Xi.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Lan Xi.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What are you doing?

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Hit me.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I...

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hit me.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Mom.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Mom.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Mom.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Mom.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Mom, what's wrong with you?

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Mom.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Sorry, Fang Ye.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Back then, I was so arrogant.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I was so jealous.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Although I know

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
that something is not right,

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I still want to apologize to you.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Sorry.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
They broke up?

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
downstairs.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Apartments counterfeit.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What do you mean?

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Grandpa...

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You are endowed with them?

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I do not know.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,980
I do not sign anywhere,

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,560
only outside of

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
the hotels.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hong perceptions move those.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
She appears in front of hundreds and hundreds of the places

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,040
that

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
she has been towards for years.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,960
I'm going to work.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This time,

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
it depends on whether they are all ready.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
They've been breaking up for a month.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
They haven't moved.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Maybe there's no future.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Can you stop being so pessimistic?

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Love happens in a moment.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're going to be a star if you don't want to be a star.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I know where the map is.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's the map of the Yellow River Bridge.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What are you going to change?

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm going to give you a romantic surprise.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Lan Xin,

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
have you ever been in a hospital?

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll give you everything.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What's wrong?

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Didn't you say that the situation is not important?

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The person next to you is the most important.

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What's the harvest of the summer break this time?

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I thought that the red line was the result.

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But the red line is only the beginning.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The relationship of the world is full of twists and turns.

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm doing it without a doubt.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What about you?

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,600
Love is like a jade,

97
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,200
and the color is like a rainbow.

98
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,000
People's wishes are like a thousand hundred kinds.

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,600
Even if I'm the fairy,

100
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,800
I still can't be satisfied.

101
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
In addition to realizing all kinds of wishes,

102
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
I'd rather not give up hope.

103
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,000
Hope is the seed of the wish.

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It will keep people's pursuit good.

105
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Looks like you two have really grown up.

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,200
No matter how hard I try,

107
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,600
then,

108
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,800
this month's KPI...

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,400
What's going on?

110
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,200
What's going on?

111
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,800
Love in this world,

112
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,600
who can tell it clearly?

113
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Happy birthday, Lan Xi!

114
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Thank you!

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,800
Huang Zhidong! Huang Zhidong!

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Huang Zhidong!

117
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,400
I know where the map is!

118
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,800
That's the exchange of the yellow and blue.

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,800
No one is perfect.

120
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,400
But the yellow you and the blue me,

121
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,600
are still in the same level.

122
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,600
So, love is like a jade,

123
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
and the blue is like a jade,

124
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,000
and the blue is like a rainbow.

125
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,000
Hey,

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,400
Lan Xi's boyfriend,

127
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
this is a very heavy headband.

128
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,200
Do you want to wear it?

129
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,600
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

130
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,600
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

131
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

132
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

133
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

134
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

135
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

136
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

137
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,600
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

138
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,600
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

139
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,600
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

140
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,600
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

141
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

142
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

143
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

144
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

145
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

146
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

147
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,800
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

148
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,800
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

149
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,800
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

150
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,800
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

151
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,800
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

152
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,800
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

153
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

154
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

155
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,800
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

156
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,200
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

157
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,200
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

158
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,400
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

159
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,800
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

160
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,400
I'm a soft-shelled man.

161
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
You are my guardian angel.

162
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,400
I'm just a soft-shelled man.

163
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Our smile is like a meeting between us

164
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Our smile is like a meeting between us

165
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,400
The sea and the sea are long and noisy

166
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,400
The world makes people miss

167
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,400
The night makes people meet

168
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,400
At this moment, our smile is like a meeting

169
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Like a meeting between us

170
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,400
The sea and the sea are long and noisy

171
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,400
The world makes people miss

172
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
The night makes people meet

173
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,400
At this moment, our smile is like a meeting

174
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Like a meeting between us

The world makes people meet

184
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,400
At this moment, our smile is like a meeting
