1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,680
Pinocchio

2
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,840
Episode 46

3
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,660
Some of them make way for romance.

4
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,860
Some of them make way for reviews.

5
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,860
High-class.

6
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,100
But no matter which kind,

7
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,420
there is an invisible hand behind it.

8
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,140
Believe it or not,

9
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,300
it's a bait.

10
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,380
The first meeting

11
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:29,780
Report, Mr. Yue.

12
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,460
The pre-recording of the meeting is over.

13
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,380
When you meet someone,

14
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,100
you'll be in a bad mood.

15
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,980
But I like her.

16
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,740
The KPI of this month is very good.

17
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,380
There are only 300 meters left before the meeting.

18
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,820
Pick the one who makes the wish today.

19
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,580
Break up.

20
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,940
Data analysis.

21
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,300
Add five points to the city's first letter.

22
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,420
Add five points to the parents of Xiao Jing.

23
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,300
One point is granted. Please be willing to be on duty.

24
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,900
Approved wish.

25
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,580
Break up.

26
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:09,860
Break up.

27
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,820
Just break up.

28
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,260
How could this be?

29
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,380
I just want her to coax me.

30
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,980
The witch.

31
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,580
Pick the lucky wish-maker today.

32
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,860
Meeting.

33
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,100
Oh no.

34
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,460
I'm late for work again.

35
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,700
Start scoring.

36
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,940
Four and a half stars.

37
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,300
Two stars.

38
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,220
Three stars.

39
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,020
Two and a half stars.

40
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:39,820
Two stars.

41
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,500
Huang Zhidong,

42
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,940
tell us your wish.

43
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,780
God,

44
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,020
can you grant me a wish-maker?

45
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,820
The wish is granted.

46
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,260
The wish-maker is in good health.

47
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,820
15 points.

48
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,780
According to me,

49
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,980
Huang Zhidong

50
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,060
99 failures

51
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,180
have exceeded the system of the

52
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,100
Fiery-Eyes and Fiery-Eyes system.

53
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,100
This way.

54
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,660
Hurry.

55
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,260
This way.

56
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:32,940
Okay.

57
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,820
Look at you.

58
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,420
You've made the world a mess.

59
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,660
The fate is uncertain.

60
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,060
It's up to you.

61
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,780
We are all dragons.

62
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,260
We can't tell gratitude and retribution.

63
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,460
You dare to interfere in other people's work.

64
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,220
It's not satisfactory.

65
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,900
You're the one who's playing around.

66
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,540
You work, fish, drink and sleep.

67
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,340
You failed 999 times in a row.

68
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,820
That's why the fate is in a mess.

69
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,420
Enough.

70
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,220
Don't be a nuisance.

71
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,100
You can't miss their fated fate.

72
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,940
You're not allowed to go back to the Heaven.

73
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,060
Lan Xin.

74
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,740
Your aunt Wang

75
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,860
has found you a good guy.

76
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,380
Aunt Liu is also looking for you.

77
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,300
You're almost dead.

78
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,500
Don't pick it.

79
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,420
Life is short and time flies.

80
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,060
How to put it?

81
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,620
If there's a flower, it's a time-travel.

82
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,900
If there's no flower,

83
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,860
what are you waiting for?

84
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,780
Right?

85
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,140
I'm wondering

86
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,700
whether I've been raising cabbage

87
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,980
for more than 20 years.

88
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,620
Is love a meeting

89
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,540
or waiting?

90
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,700
Will I meet him

91
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,740
in my lifetime?

92
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,420
Oh my god.

93
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,980
If I'm late, I'll be tested.

94
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,500
Això eat man's staff

95
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,820
Shall we?

96
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,140
Exactly.

97
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,180
Although I' m not a dual人,

98
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,700
I'm still really being soientopied to be a dual

99
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,180
in this dark world.

100
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,420
arnosia.

101
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:50,940
Shameless.

102
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,940
What a bad poem.

103
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,940
No illness, no silver.

104
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,940
The book is worse.

105
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,940
It's all fake.

106
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,940
The comic book is too bad.

107
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,940
Even the foot is better than yours.

108
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,940
Okay, okay, okay.

109
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,940
Round 2

110
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,940
You dare to talk back?

111
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,940
Look at my face, it's all feet.

112
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,940
I'm not afraid of you.

113
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,940
Look at my big hand.

114
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,940
Are you serious?

115
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,940
Okay.

116
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,940
Donggang, come on.

117
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,940
Hit him.

118
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,940
Round 3

119
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,940
You have a heart.

120
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,940
Who would do this?

121
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,940
You're shameless.

122
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,940
You're shameless.

123
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,940
Round 4

124
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,940
You're shameless.

125
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,940
You're shameless.

126
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,940
KO

127
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,940
KO

128
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,940
What's going on?

129
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,940
Lan Xin,

130
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,940
we're old friends.

131
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,940
What's this?

132
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,940
The reward from the leader.

133
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,940
Familiar recipe.

134
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,940
Familiar taste.

135
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,940
After knowing, don't change channel.

136
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,940
Here.

137
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,940
