Come on, please draw lots.

11
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,700
The guests with the same number will form a team.

12
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,460
I don't know who can draw us.

13
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,260
I don't know.

14
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,260
Me neither.

15
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,780
Why did you go there?

16
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,580
Don't let me draw one.

17
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,780

18
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,060
Draw one.

19
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,820

20
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,260
What a bad luck today.

21
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,540
I didn't see Huang Li when I went out.

22
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,180
Okay, you have drawn your number cards.

23
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,020
I hope I can find the other half of my heart

24
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,500
in the gift.

25
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,420
Congratulations to the beautiful couple of the big men and beautiful women.

26
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,020
Everyone, raise your hand.

27
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,380
How old are you?

28
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,340
I'm 95.

29
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,180
Almost.

30
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,660
Let's add each other's WeChat.

31
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,580
Okay.

32
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,620
Why don't you raise your hand?

33
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,420
Shut up.

34
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:21,940
I...

35
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,660
As the saying goes,

36
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,980
things must be reversed.

37
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,100
Wait for me.

38
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,140
I'll let you give up on Wei Ai

39
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,740
at the end of the story.

40
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,260
Attention, everyone.

41
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,940
The first clue of Wei Ai's treasure hunt

42
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,460
is hidden in our Suo Wu's hall.

43
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,660
Let's separate and find Wei Ai's treasure.

44
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,260
I'm going to find it again.

45
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,420
Let's go.

46
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,940
Look, I don't think I've ever seen that thing.

47
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,020
Look.

48
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,860
Look at this.

49
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,340
I won't fall in love with it.

50
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,300

What?

117
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,300
You're so naughty.

118
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,300
Don't hit me.

119
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,300
What are you doing?

120
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,300
Hacking place.

121
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,300
Hacking place.

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,300
Cheers.

123
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,300
Cheers.

124
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Slow down.

125
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,300
I'm itchy.

126
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,300
What are you thinking?

127
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,300
I...

128
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,300
I'm doing the jumping and jumping.

129
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,300
There are 50 more.

130
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,300
Lan Xin, get up.

131
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,300
How can I change it, Huang Zhidong?

132
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,300
You can ask for a change

133
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,300
if you win the mystery prize.

134
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,300
Mystery prize?

135
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,300
Yes.

136
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,300
I

137
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,300
will never

138
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,300
fall in love with you.

139
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,300
I

140
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,300
will never fall in love with you.

141
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,300
Do you want to make a bet?

142
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,300
Who will be the first to win over 120 and lose first?

143
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,300
No.

144
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Fine.

145
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,300
Let's bet.

146
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,300
I'm the winner anyway.

147
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,300
You've been trying to win since you were a kid.

148
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,300
You're sick.

149
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,300
You have to change it.

150
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,300
Life is short.

151
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,300
Everything in this world

152
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,300
should be perfect.

153
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,300
A life without failure

154
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,300
is perfect.

155
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Have you ever experienced failure?

156
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,300
Have you ever experienced success?

157
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,300
Who said I haven't?

158
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,300
Payment successful.

159
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,300
Sir, your takeaway.

160
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,300
Thank you.

161
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,300
I know

162
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,300
you like ice cream.

163
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,300
It's like

164
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,300
I used to like a girl.

165
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
Your moves

166
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,300
are just like your comic.

167
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,300
You're bad.

168
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
How dare you say you're not moved?

169
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,300
Look.

170
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,300
You're 118.

171
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,300
You're just being nosy.

172
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,300
A real master

173
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,300
can control his breath

174
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,300
and heart.

175
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,300
You're so good at this.

176
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,300
You're so good at this.

177
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,300
You're so good at this.

178
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,300
You're so good at this.

179
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,300
You're so good at this.

180
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,300
Your palm.

181
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,300
119?

182
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,300
You're just being nosy.

183
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,300
You're playing with me.

184
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,300
You're going to be 120.

185
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,300
I'm a man.

186
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,300
I can't lose.

187
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,300
Not bad.

188
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,300
Your character

189
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,300
is really good.

190
