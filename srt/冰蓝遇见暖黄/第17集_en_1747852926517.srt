1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,680
I have been waiting for you

2
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,840
President Yue

3
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,980
Take a seat

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,560
Cheers.

5
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,920
Let's toast

6
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,080
to the most potential cartoonist in China.

7
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,080
Here.

8
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,120
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

9
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,040
Mr. Yu,

10
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,520
if you think my work is not perfect,

11
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,760
I can modify it.

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,680
Your work is very good.

13
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,760
But the name is not good.

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,720
Huang Di Di.

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,520
Isn't it bright enough?

16
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,040
What do you think is suitable?

17
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,000
I think

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,400
you should call it

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,880
Lan Xin's boyfriend.

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,840
Lan Xin is a very talented person.

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,560
As her boyfriend,

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,240
how much exposure will you increase?

23
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,520
Mr. Yu,

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,480
may I ask you a question?

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,080
Which of my works do you like the most?

26
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,320
Is it Black Milk,

27
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,560
Fire and Chili,

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,560
or

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,040
The Black Princess and Seven Seasons?

30
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,960
I like all of them.

31
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
I haven't heard of them.

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,440
I don't know.

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,280
So,

34
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,800
you think I have potential

35
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,520
because I'm Ying Lan Xin's boyfriend?

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,440
Of course.

37
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,040
I am me.

38
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,840
He is him.

39
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,360
I don't need this low-level strategy.

40
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,880
Low-level strategy creates high-level success.

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,720
Anyway, I have prepared the contract.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,240
If you agree to change your name,

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,920
you can find me anytime.

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,600
I don't agree.

45
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Lan Xin's boyfriend.

46
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,520
Lan Xin's boyfriend.

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
Lan Xin's boyfriend.

48
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
Lan Xin's boyfriend.

49
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,320
She fell asleep.

50
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Lan Xin's boyfriend.

51
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
Lan Xin's boyfriend.

52
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,720
What happened to her?

53
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,720
No.

54
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Dugang.

55
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,440
This soft-cooked rice

56
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
is not good.

57
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,560
You look beautiful today.

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,480
I'm going to the official announcement today.

59
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
You can do it!

60
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Come on!

61
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,520
I can do it!

62
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
I can do it!

63
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
I can do it!

64
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
I can do it!

65
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
I can do it!

66
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,620
Come here.

67
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Go there.

68
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,000
Mr. Huang,

69
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,960
I hope every one of you can be successful today.

70
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,960
Cheers.

71
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,260
I hear that

72
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,160
Lan Xin's superior boyfriend coming here.

73
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,880
He's wearing sunglasses and pretending to be cold.

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,520
Who knows him without Nanxin?

75
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,720
It's useless to just get him.

76
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,760
Who are you talking about?

77
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,960
What's going on?

78
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,600
You're making a mess.

79
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,800
I announce that

80
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,480
the best writer of this year is

81
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,760
Nanxin.

82
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,320
Thank you very much.

83
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,440
Recently,

84
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,800
I've been concerned about my personal problems online.

85
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,880
Today, I take this opportunity

86
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,520
to officially announce that

87
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
my boyfriend is

88
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,040
the cartoonist Huang Zhidong.

89
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,760
Please welcome Huang Zhidong.

90
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,520
That's amazing.

91
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,400
He's an international huge star,

92
00:04:52,640 --> 00:05:05,940
he's got norte and

93
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,120
ex- döner.

94
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,780
Why doesn't Huang Zhidong name him recommend artist

95
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,160
Oh, no, he...?

96
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,620
Yephimisou Media

97
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,060
to deceased거

98
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,060
Forget it. Let's go.

99
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,060
What's going on?

100
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,060
What's going on?

101
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,060
Let's go.

102
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,060
Come on. People don't come.

103
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,060
Let's go.

104
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,060
Sorry. The number you dialed is power off.

105
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,060
Sorry.

106
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,040
The scene of the famous writer Lan Xin's

107
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,060
public announcement of being released is very awkward.

108
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,060
Stop the noise. Stop the noise.

109
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,060
Go. Go.

110
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,060
Lan... Lan Xin.

111
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,060
Sorry. I'm late.

112
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,060
I'll send you home.

113
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,060
Do the work.

114
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,060
Okay.

115
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,060
It's impossible to break.

116
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,060
Thank you.

117
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,060
Reward.

118
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,060
I want to eat meat.

119
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,060
I'll open the door.

120
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,060
So childish.

121
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,060
Lan Xin.

122
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,060
Lan Xin.

123
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,060
Didn't I say not to let Lan Xin cook?

124
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,060
It hurts.

125
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,060
What's wrong with your neck?

126
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,060
You want to cook in the cooking team?

127
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,060
What do you want to do?

128
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,060
What did you say before and after the wedding?

129
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,060
You're so naughty.

130
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,060
What are you doing?

131
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,060
I'll hit you.

132
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,060
You're so naughty.

133
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,060
Aunt. Aunt.

134
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,060
Aunt.

135
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,060
Mom.

136
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,060
You're not the only one.

137
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,060
Why is it so hard to fall in love?

138
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,060
President Zhang.

139
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,060
Sister Xin has a party on July 10th.

140
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,060
You can arrange a signing time.

141
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,060
Okay.

142
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,060
I'll set the date.

143
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,060
President Zhang.

144
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,060
Sister Xin is very important to sign the contract.

145
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,060
Don't worry.

146
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,060
We'll arrange a grand signing ceremony

147
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,060
for the big writer Lan Xin.

148
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,060
The bigger the better.

149
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,060
I'll be the one to sign the contract.

150
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,060
The bigger the better.

151
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,060
July 10th is the 100-day anniversary of love.

152
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,060
Cooperate with me.

153
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,060
The waste is back.

154
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,060
The rain, the waves and the windows

155
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:50,060
The world is missing and the people are meeting

156
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,060
Our smiles will meet

157
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,060
You and me

158
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,060
Our smiles will meet

159
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,060
You and me

160
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,060
The rain, the waves and the windows

161
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:16,060
The world is missing and the people are meeting

162
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,060
Our smiles will meet

163
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,060
You and me

164
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,060
The rain, the waves and the windows

165
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:30,060
The world is missing and the people are meeting

166
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,060
Our smiles will meet

167
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,060
You and me
