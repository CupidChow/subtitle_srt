1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,720
J Bat the

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
rest

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:27,560
Take a much less

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,840
It's comfortable.

5
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,240
Brother Zhidong.

6
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,880
Would you like to have a drink?

7
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,640
What?

8
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,880
In your heart,

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,720
I'm not worth the two glasses of wine.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,760
Why don't you sit down?

11
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,600
Brother Zhidong.

12
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,720
Look.

13
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,120
This wine,

14
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,600
it also knows human feelings.

15
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,440
You know,

16
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,400
there are countless people who chase me.

17
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,720
But those who know me know little.

18
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,520
Drink this cup of wine,

19
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,120
you and I

20
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,040
will be in love.

21
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,400
Brother Zhidong.

22
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,720
Brother Zhidong.

23
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,240
You drank this wine.

24
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,400
We are like a pair of birds,

25
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
and we will be together forever.

26
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,520
How about it?

27
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,720
My hormones are empty.

28
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
Love has nothing to do with me.

29
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,600
I'm empty in all four directions.

30
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,320
You said you were empty in all four directions.

31
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,960
But you closed your eyes.

32
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,760
You opened your eyes and looked at me.

33
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,640
I don't believe you are empty in all four directions.

34
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,280
All four directions.

35
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,840
You dare not open your eyes and look at me.

36
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,560
What four directions?

37
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,560
Brother Zhidong.

38
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,840
You...

39
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,320
Brother Zhidong.

40
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,920
Look at me.

41
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,440
Open your eyes and look at me.

42
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,320
Brother Zhidong.

43
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,480
Brother Zhidong.

44
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,800
Look.

45
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,680
Brother Zhidong.

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,360
The number you have pointed out has increased to 100%.

47
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,640
You...

48
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,480
Huang Zhidong.

49
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,320
Intelligence.

50
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,480
The hormones are unstable.

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,040
The hormones are unstable.

52
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
Can you break the cocoon?

53
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,600
Exchange the inspiration and the soul.

54
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,200
Exchange the inspiration and the soul?

55
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,120
Your brain is pestering you.

56
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,680
You're so proud of yourself.

57
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,940
gebb mustard sauce.

58
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,960
The results are...

59
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,440
Kiss?

60
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,320
Why haven't you changed it?

61
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,600
I'm not in the mood.

62
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,080
Why?

63
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,760
Change it if you want.

64
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,920
It hurts.

65
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,160
Ouch!

66
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,680
Come on, try it.

67
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Where is the problem?

68
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,360
I'm not in a good shape.

69
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
Put me down.

70
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
I'm not in a good shape to do such a stupid move.

71
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
Put your legs down.

72
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Put them down.

73
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
This thing is very scary.

74
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Let her go.

75
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,360
I can't hold it anymore.

76
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
I'm going to the bathroom.

77
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
How do you go up?

78
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
I squat.

79
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
Stand up.

80
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Who is it?

81
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
What's going on?

82
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,360
What's going on?

83
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Stop it.

84
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
What are you doing?

85
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
You're really going to get me down.

86
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Wait, wait.

87
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
Don't touch me.

88
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
Next stop is the flower market.

89
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
Are you going together?

90
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
Or should I close the door for you?

91
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
Close the door.

92
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
Okay.

93
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
Look.

94
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
It looks like a dragon.

95
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
Yes.

96
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
It's still looking for it.

97
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Don't touch me.

98
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
Don't touch me.

99
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
The Eastern White Temple here

100
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,360
is known as the most loyal bird of love in the world.

101
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,360
There is only one husband and one wife in a lifetime.

102
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,360
Never leave.

103
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Only love one person in a lifetime.

104
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
This is the ultimate romance.

105
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
Only love one person in a lifetime.

106
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,360
For me, this is not a romantic drama.

107
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Don't be narcissistic.

108
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
Go.

109
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Go.

110
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
The Yellow River is in the sea.

111
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
The Yellow River is in the heart.

112
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Zheng Nan Qiao.

113
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
I'm going to go.

114
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
I'm going to go.

115
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
I'm going to go.

116
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
I found it.

117
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360
I found it.

118
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:00,360
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

119
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Seven, seven, eight, nine, ten.

120
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
Ten.

121
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Ten.

122
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
Ten.

123
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Ten.

124
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
Ten.

125
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
Ten.

126
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
Ten.

127
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
It's so sweet.

128
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Let's go.

129
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
I'll take you to a place.

130
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
Where?

131
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
What are you going to show me?

132
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,360
I'll give you a romantic surprise.

133
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
It's so beautiful.

134
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,360
Sometimes I really want to fly.

135
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
Okay.

136
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
I'll fly with you.

137
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
I'll fly with you.

138
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Look at this effect.

139
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
Both of them are narcissistic.

140
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

141
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

142
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

143
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

144
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

145
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

146
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

147
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

148
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

149
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

150
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

151
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

152
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

153
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

154
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

155
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

156
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

157
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

158
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

159
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

160
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

161
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,360
I'm afraid I can't fly.

162
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,360
The rain, the light and the sea

163
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,360
The waves and the tide

164
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Time is missing

165
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
Let people meet

166
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
At this moment

167
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
Our smile will be together

168
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
Meet me and you

169
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,360
The rain, the light and the sea

170
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
The waves and the tide

171
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,360
Time is missing

172
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
Let people meet

173
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
At this moment

174
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,360
Our smile will be together

175
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,360
Meet me and you
