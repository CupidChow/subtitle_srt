1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,300
I wait for you

2
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,940
Let me look at you

3
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,300
Lanoten

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I...

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Aren't you my father's property?

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I...

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll say it again!

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Get lost!

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We'll be back tomorrow.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We'll be back tomorrow.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Go!

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Are you too vicious?

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We're not too vicious.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We're too human.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We're too weak.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm a little bit heartless.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You're a fairy and a woman.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Aren't you all like that?

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There are ten more points.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Go for it!

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm here!

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm here!

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm here!

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm here!

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm here!

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Lan Xin!

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Lan Xin!

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Lan Xin!

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I feel like I've lost the whole world

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
when you left.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Can you give me another chance?

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No!

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Lan Xin!

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Lan Xin, drink some water.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I only drink ice-cream.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You have a bug on your head.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're boring.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I...

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Lan Xin, I'm sorry.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I love you.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I love you.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I love you.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Lan Xin, I'm sorry.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Lan Xin.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Lan Xin, I'm sorry.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I love you.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Lan Xin, I'm sorry.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Lan Xin, I'm sorry.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I love you.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Lan Xin, I'm sorry.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Lan Xin, I'm sorry.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I love you.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Aren't you unwilling to be my assistant?

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm trying now.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I've completely forgiven you.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I still have to see your performance.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Please give me a hint.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You only care about me.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You have to care about my mother.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Run.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Lan Xin.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Lan Xin, I love you.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Lan Xin.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You really embarrassed me.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Lan Xin.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You really embarrassed me.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Dong Gang.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What's so good about the music?

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The music is playing.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's playing.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's playing?

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Then...

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're making a hard time.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Love can be re-enact everything.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
By the way, I have a question.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What's the question?

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
How to make a woman happy?

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You're the right person.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Gift.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Buy a gift.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How much is it?

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's enough to satisfy their curiosity.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That makes sense.

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Then...

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Where's the woman?

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Woman.

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
My woman is so sick.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
My woman...

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
My woman...

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
My woman...

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This little yellow is still a bit advantageous.

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Lan Xin.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's go.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's 100 days of anniversary.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You're so good at singing.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Actually...

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The so-called body is not high.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
There are layers of water.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The water is not deep.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The private world is a little bit different.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The heart is Lan Xin.

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Look.

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Look.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay.

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll give you a chance.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Take it.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay.

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The necklace is so pretty.

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What are you going to do?

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What?

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The moment of the verification.

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Huang Dili.

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
How dare you sit in front of me?

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm not going to sit in front of you.

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm going to sit in front of you.

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm going to sit in front of you.

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm going to sit in front of you.

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm going to sit in front of you.

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm going to sit in front of you.

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm going to sit in front of you.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm going to sit in front of you.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm going to sit in front of you.

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm going to sit in front of you.

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm going to sit in front of you.

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm going to sit in front of you.

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm going to sit in front of you.

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm going to sit in front of you.

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
If the sea and the sea are long and noisy,

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
the world makes people miss it.

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If people meet again,

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
our smile will be gone.

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Like you and me.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
If the sea and the sea are long and noisy,

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
the world makes people miss it.

140
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
If people meet again,

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
our smile will be gone.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Like you and me.
