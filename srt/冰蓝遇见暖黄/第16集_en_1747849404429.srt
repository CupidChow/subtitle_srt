1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm waiting for you

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
in the rain

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The Rain of Bullets

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Episode 2

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,400
Come on.

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
How to peel this?

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,800
Use the flat one.

8
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
Do we really need to peel it?

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,400
Like this.

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,600
Put it on the top.

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
First, cut four corners.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,000
Use this.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Then, peel this.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And this.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's gone.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's in the water.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Didn't you say

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
the rain is not important?

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The people around you are the most important.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If we two

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
get the answer together,

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
it's a two-day trip.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I know where the map is.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Over there.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,020
The place where the yellow blue is

27
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,020
is like me and you.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's go and have a look.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If you catch me,

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll go with you.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The lovers are finally together.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We can go back to the Sky Hall.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Leader,

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
we've completed the task.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's worth praising.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Please check the work results.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The task is well done.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We can go back to the Sky Hall.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You're the leader.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Next,

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll arrange a new task for you.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Make sure you complete the task.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Get off the boat and break them down.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Come on.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why?

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Even if it's a good fate,

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
it will be hard.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's a test for love.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You're a traitor.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What's wrong?

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What else can I do?

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's a loss of strength.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let's break it down.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Look at my daughter.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
She's been a good student

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
since she was a kid.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Look.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There are so many books.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Stop.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Young man,

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
let me tell you.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
My daughter is excellent.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Look.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
She's got a good score.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Look.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
She's got a good score.

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't agree.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
She's a master of the school of literature.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No, no.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
She's a novelist.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't read books.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And she's a black belt in Taekwondo.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No, no.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The key is

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
my daughter is very beautiful.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let me see.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Right?

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You can copy her number

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and call her.

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay.

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You can say that she's introduced by Mrs. Zhang.

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Hello, who's this?

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Hello, I'm introduced by Mrs. Zhang.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm telling you, Mrs. Zhang.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I have a boyfriend.

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What?

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't talk nonsense.

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
See you tomorrow.

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I really have a boyfriend.

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Really?

94
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Show me tomorrow.

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What a person.

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're dating someone.

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Go away.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Mom, this is my boyfriend, Huang Zhidong.

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Hello, aunt.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I know you.

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Lan Xin's classmate.

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You can't study with that money.

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Later, I'll go.

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I've read your information.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The income is one-fourth of Lan Xin's.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The loan is four times of Lan Xin's.

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So,

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
the gap between you two is four-four-one-six.

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The cartoon is not bad.

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But you can check the comments.

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
No, mom.

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Zhidong is quite good.

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Which one is good?

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Which one is good?

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Five.

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Five seconds.

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Mao Du is familiar with it.

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Bert ran fifty meters.

120
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You haven't figured out how good you are.

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Now, do you think you're good?

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm not that good.

123
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Have a grape.

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Go away.

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Although you didn't meet my requirements,

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
but you can't marry Lan Xin.

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I won't say anything.

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Thank you, aunt.

129
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you, mom.

130
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But Lan Xin is my daughter.

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
My pearl.

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
After marriage,

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
washing clothes and cooking is your business.

134
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
My daughter's hands are precious.

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They are made of art.

136
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
They can't be stained with fire.

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Don't worry, aunt.

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm a good cook.

139
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Really?

140
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Do you remember?

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I...

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I recorded it.

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I recorded it.

144
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What's going on?

145
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hong Lang, my mom is like this.

146
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
She's a sharp-tongued, tough-hearted person.

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But she cut the knife forty meters.

148
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Within five seconds,

149
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I didn't find any advantages.

150
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No.

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I didn't find any advantages.

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I didn't find any advantages.

153
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I didn't find any advantages.

154
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No.

155
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
In my heart, you're the best.

156
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Really?

157
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yes.

158
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Then I must work hard to become the best,

159
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
the most successful cartoonist.

160
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So I can match Lan Xin.

161
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay.

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Lan Xin.

163
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I thought I was right.

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You have to be strong.

165
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Only vicious and rebellious can help us return to the sky.

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You never know who is scheming against you.

167
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Come in.

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Xin, my name is Xiaolong.

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm your fan.

170
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Can you sign my name?

171
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Xiaolong, how did you get in?

172
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Xin, I'm your fan.

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Xin, I'm your new assistant.

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You can tell me what you need to do.

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Great.

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Then we'll be good sisters.

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll sign for you.

178
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
From today on,

179
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm the vicious and rebellious.

180
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The quilt is my best play.

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The sea and the waves are like windows.

182
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Time can be missed,

183
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
but it can also be met.

184
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
At this moment,

185
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
our smiles will go back,

186
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
to meet you and me.

187
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Our smiles will go back,

188
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
to meet you and me.

189
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The sea and the waves are like windows.

190
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Time can be missed,

191
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
but it can also be met.

192
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
At this moment,

193
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
our smiles will go back,

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
to meet you and me.

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The sea and the waves are like windows.

196
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Time can be missed,

197
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
but it can also be met.

198
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
At this moment,

199
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
our smiles will go back,

200
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
to meet you and me.
