Do you want to?

00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,160
No

8
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,960
No

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,320
Mom, you...

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,880
Let me go, I can't walk anymore!

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,520
How are we gonna stand up?

12
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,040
Will you come for me?

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,480
Can I just walk?

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,400
Of course.

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,360
Look!

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,520
She's not even slightly giving me proper 71!

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,480
Everyone, look!

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,160
Are we coming now?

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,120
What are you doing?

20
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,920
Jing disability

21
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,560
I don't wear this anymore

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,680
So annoying

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:34,840
Our old

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,240
Why haven't you changed back

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,440
So annoying

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,520
But

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,560
What is your own feeling

28
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,320
Therefore

29
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,240
What about you?

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,560
You're almost there.

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,480
Gather!

32
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,560
Let's go to the end of the love!

33
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,560
Today's mission is to go to the sea.

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,000
The first team to finish the mission

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,080
will get the last clue.

36
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,280
Go through the heart and mindãƒ‘

37
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,920
Hey,

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,400
lyrics

39
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,160
I don't want to stay with you.

40
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,120
It hurts.

41
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,680
Eh...

42
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,600
Dog-tongue knife?

43
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,360
You're not smart.

44
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,280
But you're quite fit.

45
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,680
Dog-tongue knife?

46
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
What's wrong?

47
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,240
Dog-tongue knife?

48
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,040
No.

49
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,360
I feel...

50
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,520
I feel like...

51
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,360
It's been holding me for a long time.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,360
You...

53
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,320
You're not...

54
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:21,960
Oh, my God.

55
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,800
This is...

56
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,760
Blood!

57
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,720
Dog-tongue knife!

58
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,640
Dog-tongue knife!

59
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,760
Oh, no.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,760
What if it comes?

61
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,120
Slow down.

62
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,560
I'll do it myself.

63
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,760
Be careful.

64
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,600
Just tear it apart and put it on.

65
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,880
It's sticky.

66
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,840
It hurts.

67
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,760
Sticky?

68
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,040
Idiot, you put it upside down.

69
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,440
You're not considerate.

70
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,020
The Turbulence

71
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,120
What...

72
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,640
What are the blue sky

73
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,960
and the yellow river?

74
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,840
Why?

75
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,480
Why?

76
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,280
Why do I feel growl and sneeze

77
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,800
in my chest as well as legs?

78
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,120
I can't remember

79
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,720
what I'm doing.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,760
That's because...

81
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,800
Shut up!

82
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,960
I just want to cry.

83
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,160
Don't cry.

84
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,440
It's a special period.

85
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,800
Your internal temperature is not good.

86
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,600
Someone is more stupid than me.

87
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,280
Cry.

88
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,520
I'm not crying.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,440
What's wrong?

90
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,080
Are you okay?

91
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,400
I...

92
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,720
It's not easy to be a man.

93
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,600
We've done our mission.

94
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,480
Who?

95
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,600
Who?

96
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,560
Who?

97
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,200
Who is it?

98
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,960
Congratulations on your mission.

99
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,840
You've completed the mission.

100
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,120
Congratulations on the 12 heartbeats

101
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,200
of your couple.

102
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,800
You'll get a free wedding dress,

103
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,720
a free wedding banquet

104
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,560
and a free wedding dress.

105
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,400
No.

106
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,880
That's ours.

107
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,440
Sorry.

108
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,720
I didn't let you win.

109
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,320
I suddenly feel

110
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,480
that losing is not that important.

111
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,320
I always wanted to win in the past.

112
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,040
It's just that

113
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,600
no one shared the process.

114
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,440
Don't worry.

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,840
I'll take care of you in the future.

116
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,440
Aren't you worried

117
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,800
that I'll be a bad person?

118
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,440
What if we can't get back together?

119
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,440
What are you worried about?

120
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,640
I'll try to

121
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,520
be a real woman.

122
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,920
You'll try to be a real man.

123
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,720
What about then?

124
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,200
Then you'll marry me.

125
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,720
We're like

126
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,200
internal subversives, right?

127
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,160
Do you have a car?

128
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,240
Do you have a house?

129
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,160
I have a heart for you.

130
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,760
That's mine.

131
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,440
Okay.

132
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,080
Yours.

133
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,960
Yours.

134
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,080
I...

135
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,320
We're back together.

136
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,480
We're back together.

137
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,840
We're back together.

138
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,960
But,

139
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,920
I know

140
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,360
you can win a drink.

141
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,520
Happy!

142
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,840
Happy!

143
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,200
Happy!

144
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,200
Means

145
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,160
that the contractor

146
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,320
should increase to its full capacity

147
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,160
and become stable.

148
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,520
They finally realize

149
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,000
the ground they're on

150
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,760
in their spirit and throes.

151
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,960
That means

152
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,920
we can finally go back to Celestial Terrace.

153
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,080
The rain, the waves and the windows

154
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,080
The world is missing, and people meet at this moment

155
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,080
Our smiles will go back, to meet you and me

156
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,080
Our smiles will go back, to meet you and me

157
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:01,080
The rain, the waves and the windows

158
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:09,080
The world is missing, and people meet at this moment

159
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,080
The rain, the waves and the windows

160
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,080
The world is missing, and people meet at this moment

161
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,080
Meet you and me
