gun

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:57,180
Red 보여�

3
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,360
Can you turn einfach and weak

4
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,120
Red inheritance

5
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,080
I'll go back and forth.

6
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,280
You're so easy.

7
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,360
If it weren't for the jade...

8
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,600
If it weren't for the jade,

9
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,800
I wouldn't have bought it for you.

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,880
One move back to the liberation.

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,200
I'm sad.

12
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,720
Let's just let it go.

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Is there any way

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,160
to help them solve the misunderstanding?

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,880
Well,

16
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,800
I'll have to drink some wine

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,200
to get some inspiration?

18
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,640
You're...

19
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,440
I'm really senseless.

20
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,440
Episode 2

21
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,440
He is really looking forward to getting off work.

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,440
He doesn't want to stay with me.

23
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,440
He is really looking forward to getting off work.

24
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,440
He doesn't want to stay with me.

25
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Let go!

26
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
Let go!

27
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
I am here!

28
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
What are you doing?

29
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,440
Help me! Help me!

30
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,440
You are the leader of the plan.

31
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,440
You will be the front.

32
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
I will be the back.

33
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
Today,

34
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,440
I must give Mengmeng

35
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
an unforgettable birthday.

36
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,440
Action!

37
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,440
Okay, okay, okay.

38
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Donggang,

39
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
Mengmeng is almost here.

40
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
Hurry up and get the flowers.

41
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
No problem.

42
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
I can't hold it anymore.

43
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
I won't pretend anymore.

44
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,440
I will win.

45
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
I am stabbing my brothers with two knives.

46
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Or stabbing my brothers with two knives?

47
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,440
You don't even dare to look at my eyes.

48
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,440
I am so scared.

49
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,440
I am scared.

50
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
I am scared.

51
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
I am scared.

52
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
I am scared.

53
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
How about this?

54
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,440
Then I will

55
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,440
give you a chance.

56
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
You will give it to me?

57
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,440
Thank you.

58
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
Thank you.

59
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
No.

60
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
Thank you.

61
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
No.

62
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,440
You...

63
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
What is this?

64
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
Come on.

65
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
I will cover it for you.

66
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
Hurry up.

67
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
I am coming.

68
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Do you like it?

69
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,440
I like it.

70
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
I especially picked this for you.

71
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
You bought a cake?

72
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
Let me do it.

73
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
It is sweet.

74
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
You...

75
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
You...

76
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
Look at this.

77
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
What are you doing?

78
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
What are you doing?

79
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
I like it.

80
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
I like it.

81
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Open the door.

82
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Open the door.

83
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,440
Open the door.

84
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,440
Open the door.

85
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
I...

86
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
I forgot.

87
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
Break up.

88
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
I tell you.

89
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,440
This red rope should be changed to a zipper.

90
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
It is too difficult to untie.

91
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
What drinking to find inspiration?

92
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
All nonsense.

93
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
What are you?

94
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
Music index rose to 99%.

95
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
What is the situation?

96
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
You have cream on your mouth.

97
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,440
I will help you.

98
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
You are responsible.

99
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
You are responsible.

100
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
Isn't it 0%?

101
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
You are very good.

102
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
You are very good.

103
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
You are very good.

104
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
You are very good.

105
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
You are very good.

106
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
You are very good.

107
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
You drink.

108
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,440
Music index rose to 0%.

109
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
It is all your fault.

110
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
Dad, look at that aunt.

111
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
She looks like you.

112
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
She is Lan Xin.

113
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
She is that bad guy.

114
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Let's go home.

115
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Who is she?

116
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
How many times did I tell you?

117
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
I am not your dad.

118
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
But I don't have dad.

119
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
I know you like her.

120
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
What's the use of liking?

121
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
You like me,

122
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
what's the use of liking her?

123
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
She likes you.

124
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
She likes you.

125
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,940
you may say

126
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:52,880
I am Recently

127
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,240
I've finally come here

128
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,880
I'll tell your mother

129
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
that you have their told

130
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Madam?

131
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
Do I need to tell her?

132
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,240
She's making wild wild faces

133
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,320
for you

134
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,200
This...

135
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,800
This is the last chance to make a wish.

136
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,280
If...

137
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,600
If I can go back...

138
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,760
Go back to the past,

139
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,840
I will definitely...

140
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,640
I will definitely find him.

141
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,200
You...

142
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,600
You...

143
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:47,800
You...

144
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,000
You...

145
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,240
You...

146
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,800
Give me the rope.

147
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,480
What...

148
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,360
What's going on?

149
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,240
Now there is also a treasure.

150
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,280
It's only been a day.

151
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Goodbye.

152
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,960
Huang Zhidong.

153
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,000
It's him.

154
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,320
It's me.

155
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:27,520
Those that we respect for our Pavilion of contents sale

156
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,000
do indeed suffer superb losses.

157
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,340
marshizeüf

158
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,380
eldest brother

159
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,220
is not strong

160
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,000
to shoot

161
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,460
still regret

162
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,980
for you

163
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,800
I've made every effort to keep the memories,

164
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,000
the wishes I've missed,

165
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,400
and the love I've missed.

166
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Yuwen Yue,

167
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,200
I've tried my best.

168
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,200
If you give me another chance,

169
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
I'll definitely give you another chance.

170
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,400
I'll never leave the Xiang Jun Group.

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The rain, the light and the sea

172
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,000
The waves and the windows

173
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
