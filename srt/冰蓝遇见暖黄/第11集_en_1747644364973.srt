1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,400
I'm intending to see you without you.

2
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,360
Just swap slowly.

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,640
Enjoy yourself instead.

4
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,840
Here.

5
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,200
Enough.

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,280
There you go.

7
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,280
That's for the old woman.

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,960
Although they look a little strange,

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,600
what they mean is

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,680
their appearance is way more impressive.

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,120
Here.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,800
Are you sure you're going to be all over it?

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,800
Of course.

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,560
B battery is useful to me.

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,520
Bo is not.

16
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,100
Taoosc UFC

17
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,860
What is it that i like!

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,340
Childish

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,600
straightforward

20
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,900
What are you doing

21
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,580
Dr..ise

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,800
Filming video

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,020
because a martial arts student

24
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,800
who knows nothing

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:33,860
can

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,100
read the mind of a martial arts student.

27
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,740
I might have to

28
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,580
come up with an excuse.

29
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,340
Why does she think

30
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,740
that you are someone

31
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,740
Hinterplay a martial arts student?

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,140
You're still my brother.

33
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,240
Am I right?

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,060
A real man

35
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,780
doesn't do Horizontal and Continental.

36
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,480
I'm like you.

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,400
Perfect and proud.

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,520
What do you think of my explanation?

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,920
Do you want to say everything?

40
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,960
What do you mean?

41
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,880
Otherwise, you'll be sun-drenched.

42
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,080
Give me a chance.

43
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,640
I've given you a chance.

44
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,120
I didn't have a choice before.

45
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,760
Now I want to choose a good man.

46
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,240
Okay.

47
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,920
Tell Mr. Yue

48
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,520
to see if he allows you to choose a good man.

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,920
You mean

50
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,760
you refuse me?

51
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,320
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,240
I'm a straight man.

53
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,280
No.

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,760
If I do this,

55
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,960
I'll be laughed at by that dog.

56
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,400
I really don't want to miss it.

57
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,040
But I can't say it.

58
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,400
What should I do?

59
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,200
This...

60
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,920
A man

61
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,440
should live for others.

62
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,840
Remember.

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,120
Don't think about it again.

64
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,120
I knew it.

65
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,080
He's still alive.

66
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,200
You...

67
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,080
Come on.

68
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,080
Lan Xun is too upright.

69
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,160
I heard he's single.

70
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,000
Really?

71
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,920
He said

72
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,560
he was almost caught by a scumbag.

73
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,160
Luckily, he woke up in time.

74
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,760
He also wrote this love

75
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,280
into the script.

76
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,680
No, bro.

77
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,760
Didn't you read the book?

78
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,560
I heard that

79
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,680
all the single dogs in our company

80
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,520
are already moving.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,520
No.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,520
This...

83
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,640
This is moving again?

84
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,600
I hope that silly man

85
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,600
can understand my feelings after reading the novel.

86
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
The most beautiful flower in the bloom.

87
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,760
Why does the hero of Lan Xun's novel

88
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,040
look so much like me?

89
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,960
Is it because

90
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,320
Lan Xun likes me?

91
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,280
What do you think?

92
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,280
Brother.

93
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,560
It's not a common taste.

94
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,120
No.

95
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,240
Why do you always look like a single dog?

96
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,680
It's okay.

97
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,920
I'm not a dog.

98
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,160
Let me try it first.

99
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,880
Let's go.

100
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,320
Let's go.

101
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,240
It seems that this silly man

102
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
understands my feelings after reading the novel.

103
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,920
Please drink the poison of love.

104
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,480
From now on, you will be suspicious of me.

105
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,320
I'm here.

106
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,360
I must have misunderstood just now.

107
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,960
What should I do?

108
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,840
We just said

109
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,880
that such a hint

110
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,800
is obvious enough.

111
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,280
Come on.

112
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,600
Come on.

113
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,280
Who sent this?

114
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:44,480
Should I just

115
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,400
영

116
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,000
ч

117
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:03,460
Could it be that I'm thinking about it too much

118
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,200
dataset

119
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
oysters

120
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,200
The sea waves and the windows

121
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Time to let people miss

122
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Also let people meet at this moment

123
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Our smile will go

124
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Meet me and you

125
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Our smile will go

126
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Meet me and you

127
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,200
The sea waves and the windows

128
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Time to let people miss

129
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Also let people meet at this moment

130
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Our smile will go

131
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Meet me and you

132
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,200
The sea waves and the windows

133
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Time to let people miss

134
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Also let people meet at this moment

135
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Our smile will go

136
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Meet me and you
