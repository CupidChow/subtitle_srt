1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,160
We're waiting for you

2
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,380
Midsummer from now on

3
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,000
pay attention to the words

4
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,680
She's up

5
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,420
You must have some Very strange

6
00:00:59,420 --> 00:00:59,580
Why come again

7
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,560
Yuki

8
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,960
Sun of Zhejiang

9
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,760
Fengfeng

10
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,020
self- expire

11
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,000
Youki

12
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,400
Did youell

13
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:22,460
You die

14
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,200
注意

15
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:23,840
Calm down

16
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,260
You

17
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:27,660
그런

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,680
Let go of me.

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
Let go of me.

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
Let go of me.

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,680
Let go of me.

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
Let go of me.

23
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
Let go of me.

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,680
There's someone up there.

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Show the target to the police.

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
Show the target to the police.

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
There's no such person.

28
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
She's not a person.

29
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
Check the moon first.

30
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
The jade emperor sits down.

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,680
A thousand years of the last blow.

32
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,680
The palace number is 001.

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Our cultivation has only been added for 990 years.

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,680
He's been in the dark for a thousand years.

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,680
Do you want to continue to be a man?

36
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
Okay.

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,680
What about this guy?

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,680
Let him check it again.

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,680
KPI, don't think about completing.

40
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
Lan, Lan Xin.

41
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680
If this bitch succeeds,

42
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,680
we'll always be trapped in the mortal world.

43
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
He has the power of seduction.

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,680
The mortal can't get close at all.

45
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,680
What should we do?

46
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
Sit and wait.

47
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,680
The number of wishes is reduced to 0.1%.

48
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
Star fire.

49
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
It can be a long distance.

50
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,680
Water?

51
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Water?

52
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
What is it?

53
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,680
See how I get you.

54
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,680
Brother, why is this steak so bad?

55
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,680
Sir, because you ordered a thousand-year steak.

56
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,680
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Come on, baby.

58
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
I'm going to the bathroom.

59
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
It's really bad.

60
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Who am I eating with?

61
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,680
Who am I eating with?

62
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
Who am I eating with?

63
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Who am I eating with?

64
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
Who am I eating with?

65
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
I'm eating with you.

66
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
You drank Peng Yan's secret soup.

67
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
You can't tell the difference between dreams and reality.

68
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
Who?

69
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Peng Yan's group.

70
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
The Peng Yan's group of Gaolongrong.

71
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,680
You said he was as perfect as I was back then.

72
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
Impossible.

73
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
You don't believe it?

74
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Look at it yourself.

75
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Look.

76
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
This is...

77
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
I don't have time to explain.

78
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
Remember.

79
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
No matter what he says later,

80
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
he's afraid of the dark.

81
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
Remember?

82
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
Why?

83
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Give me a reason.

84
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
I don't have time to explain.

85
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
It's okay.

86
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Don't add any wrong ingredients.

87
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
I'll kill him.

88
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Remember.

89
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
What?

90
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
You're so handsome.

91
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
Let's go.

92
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,680
I'll take you to a place.

93
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,680
Let's go.

94
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,680
Lan Xi.

95
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
Lan Xi.

96
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
He's a jerk.

97
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
I'll expose you.

98
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
What's going on?

99
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
He blacked out Peng Yan's group,

100
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
but he blacked out me.

101
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
As a writer,

102
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
I can't even understand the meaning of the sentence.

103
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
I hope it works.

104
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,680
Your kiss was good just now.

105
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,680
No.

108
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
I...

109
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
Lan Xi.

110
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
Lin Lan Xi.

111
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Will you marry me?

112
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,680
For the rest of your life,

113
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,680
will you be by my side?

114
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
I'm the rich.

115
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,680
I'm the safe.

116
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
You're the poor.

117
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
You're the disease.

118
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
Or you?

119
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
I'm willing to.

120
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
Let go of that jerk.

121
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,680
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,680
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,680
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
I'm sorry.

151
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,680
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680

I'm sorry.

161
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,680

169
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,680
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,680
