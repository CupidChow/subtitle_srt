(20 years ago)

2
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,440
My son,

3
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,039
this was your mother's blade.

4
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,000
She will watch over you from heaven

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,679
and protect you.

6
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,040
I'd take blades for brothers,

7
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,799
but flay foes fleshless.

8
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,480
I won't spare you

9
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,480
for not fighting back.

10
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,232

12
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:13,120

The Legend of the Condor Heroes)

13
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,230
=Southern Emperor and Northern Beggar=
=Episode 7=

14
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,520
The Princess Consort from Nuowu

15
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,400
killed the ruler of Dali.

16
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:24,240
The alliance marriage became a scheme.

17
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,479
War will erupt again.

18
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,039
Dali will surely fall.

19
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,479
I'll lead the Sa Tribe to capture Wuman

20
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,560
before conquering the entire Nanjiang.

21
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,280
By doing this,

22
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,080
both the Sa Tribe and Wuman civilians

23
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,919
will suffer too.

24
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,879
Every conqueror's path
is paved with skulls.

25
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,520
Since when has war spared lives?

26
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,560
We can avoid war.

27
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,439
That's not your decision!

28
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,560
Stop trying.

29
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,639
I've channeled One-yang Finger's qi

30
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,360
to guard my hand.

31
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,199
Those Gu-insects can't penetrate.

32
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,560
I warned you to abandon

33
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,759
this dark path.

34
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,120
So you knew all along

35
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,160
I was here.

36
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,879
I wanted to witness

37
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,959
what schemes you were plotting.

38
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,519
But seeing you now,

39
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,000
you look pitiful indeed.

40
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,720
This retribution fits your sins.

41
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,360
I'll send you to Tianlong Temple,

42
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,160
where monks will guide your redemption.

43
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,480
Stop your false compassion.

44
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,560
Neither of us are virtuous men.

45
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,920
That Li Hong

46
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,120
who saved you from me

47
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,920
years ago.

48
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
His entire family's demise

49
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,839
was caused by you too, right?

50
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,000
Father,

51
00:05:33,344 --> 00:05:34,272
you want to see me?

52
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,199
I know your friend's father.

53
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,240
He is my sworn brother.

54
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,160
He saved my life.

55
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,920
Therefore,

56
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,000
Hong Qi's mother's death

57
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,519
and those grievances are true?

58
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,319
To secure the throne,

59
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,800
I broke my oath.

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,879
I've carried this regret for decades.

61
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,160
But ultimately,

62
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,480
it changes nothing.

63
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,519
I always hoped

64
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,040
to hear a different answer.

65
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,639
I

66
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,519
have failed you.

67
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,160
Hong Qi told me

68
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,279
he'd come for vengeance.

69
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,360
To avenge his mother

70
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,959
is only righteous.

71
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,680
I'd do the same.

72
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,879
He's mastered
the 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms.

73
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,279
18 Dragon-Subduing Palms?

74
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,319
The young surpass us.

75
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,279
I've already lost to him.

76
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,199
Father, you must be cautious.

77
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,040
I can't bear anything harming you.

78
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,199
I've been strict,

79
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,399
and you've been mischievous

80
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,879
since you were young.

81
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,079
You became more rebellious

82
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,399
when I scolded you.

83
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,160
When you ran away,

84
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,360
I despaired at your immaturity.

85
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,560
Unexpectedly,

86
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,759
after the martial world trip,

87
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
you've shed childish ways

88
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,079
and become a true man.

89
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,240
After your mother died,

90
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,519
I feared for your safety.

91
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,639
So I confined you within palace walls.

92
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,439
Now I see

93
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,720
I was wrong.

94
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,040
I should've let you explore sooner.

95
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,480
I've caused you undue worry.

96
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,759
Look.

97
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,000
Our magnificent realm!

98
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,160
The future holds promise!

99
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,720
Who are you?

100
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,040
Don't you know

101
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:10,800
what your son did?

102
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,879
He pursued a man's wife
and harassed Elder Gao.

103
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,839
Your Majesty,

104
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,919
the ancestral memorial text
for this year is drafted.

105
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,840
We request your review.

106
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:56,600
The text needs revisions.

107
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,759
Son, approach.

108
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,720
Father.

109
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,000
Because I have decided

110
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,559
to abdicate the throne to my son.

111
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,896
Sect Leader,
your father is hurt internally.

112
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,399
Though he survived for now,

113
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,799
his time grows short.

114
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,679
Father, what happened?

115
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:44,720
Hong Qi, don't ask who.

116
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,000
Go...

117
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,240
go...

118
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,320
go to Dali.

119
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,120
After all I've said,

120
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,480
I still can't convince you.

121
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,679
Bro,

122
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,600
you may die now.

123
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,080
Elder Gao?

124
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,480
Elder Gao?

125
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,120
Elder Gao?

126
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,480
Why didn't you answer me?

127
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,600
Someone attacked my father

128
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,679
and left your name.

129
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,360
I believe someone

130
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:42,919
framed you.

131
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,960
I want to hear your explanation.

132
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,799
Elder Gao?

133
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,039
Sect Leader,

134
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,639
what happened?

135
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,919
Even if Elder Gao had countless faults,

136
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,759
you shouldn't have acted so rashly.

137
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,440
Please

138
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,519
revoke the abdication decree.

139
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,360
In your opinion,

140
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,720
who would win if I fought Hong Qi?

141
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,519
Not sure.

142
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,360
If

143
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,440
Hong Qi kills me,

144
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,840
you'll succeed to the throne.

145
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,320
But you must not seek vengeance.

146
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,159
If I kill Hong Qi,

147
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,799
no matter what,

148
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
Dali and the Beggar Sect

149
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,200
will both lose hundreds of lives.

150
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,000
By telling me this,

151
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,000
have you already conceived

152
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,759
a solution?

153
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,080
The solution to our mortal conflict

154
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,480
is abdication.

155
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,080
After stepping down,

156
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,399
I become a commoner.

157
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,559
Victory or defeat

158
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,240
becomes a personal matter.

159
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,519
My life and death
are martial world strife.

160
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:28,720
In the past,

161
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,919
I couldn't relinquish

162
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,440
the power in my grasp.

163
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,000
That caused grave mistakes.

164
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,399
Buddies,

165
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,200
Elder Gao's body has been examined.

166
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,039
The killer

167
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
snapped his neck.

168
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,200
What technique is it?

169
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,120
The killer hid the martial signature.

170
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,799
And the scene

171
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,799
shows no struggle.

172
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:04,960
A single lethal strike.

173
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,240
Elder Gao

174
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
couldn't resist at all.

175
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,720
Elder Gao

176
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,919
was a top-tier elite.

177
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:15,759
How formidable must the killer be?

178
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,720
Indeed.

179
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,080
How formidable?

180
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,320
No signs of forced entry.

181
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,399
Elder Gao likely knew the killer.

182
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,639
I've long conflicted with Elder Gao.

183
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,639
That gave me motive, right?

184
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
When I entered the room,

185
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,080
he coincidentally died.

186
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,519
It made me the obvious suspect.

187
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,960
This is what you all assume?

188
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,039
Sect Leader,

189
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,080
even if we don't think so,

190
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,720
our members

191
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,039
and martial peers

192
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,639
will likely think so.

193
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:49,759
How about this?

194
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,559
Please

195
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:52,759
investigate promptly

196
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:53,919
to provide answers.

197
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
You can investigate.

198
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,000
Now I have

199
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,600
urgent matters,

200
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,919
and I must leave the sect.

201
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:05,399
Sect Leader,

202
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:06,840
given what happened,

203
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,200
you shouldn't go.

204
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,679
I must go.

205
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,440
For how long?

206
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,559
My fate remains uncertain.

207
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,840
If you leave now,

208
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,279
aren't you afraid people will say

209
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,960
you're fleeing from justice?

210
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,919
I'll leave

211
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,440
whenever I choose.

212
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:27,919
If I did it, I did it.

213
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,039
If not, then not.

214
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,600
Please stay, Sect Leader.

215
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,720
Elder Bian,

216
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,080
what are you doing?

217
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:38,840
You're prepared?

218
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,039
We knew full well

219
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,639
we're no match for you.

220
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,919
But we'd risk our lives
to keep you here.

221
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,279
Therefore,

222
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,320
we had to make plans early.

223
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,679
Even disciples act like this.

224
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,799
Elder Xu,

225
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,919
you won't stand idly by, will you?

226
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,240
Sect Leader,

227
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:02,120
forgive us.

228
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,120
The Dog Beating Array!

229
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,919
You treated me like that,

230
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,759
yet did I injure you?

231
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,919
If I wanted to harm Elder Gao,

232
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,360
I'd not have toiled

233
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,960
or let you catch me.

234
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,159
I yield.

235
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,679
The buddies present here

236
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,759
all yield too.

237
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:31,519
However,

238
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:32,960
Elder Gao's followers

239
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,000
will not yield.

240
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:37,480
Nor will the martial world believe you.

241
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,600
We can't silence

242
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,120
the public opinion.

243
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,320
Elder of Teaching.

244
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:42,440
Yes?

245
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
To preserve our honor,

246
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,000
from now on,

247
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,799
you'll act as the sect leader

248
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,440
until we find the culprit.

249
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:50,240
Okay.

250
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,159
All disciples

251
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,279
shall follow Elder Xu's command.

252
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,120
- Understood.
- Understood.

253
00:16:57,888 --> 00:16:58,679
Elder of Teaching.

254
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,039
If anyone acts with ill intent,

255
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:05,039
use the Dog-Beating Staff mercilessly.

256
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes, Sect Leader.

257
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,039
From now on,

258
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,400
I'm no longer the sect leader,

259
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,680
but a wandering martial artist.

260
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,319
Everything about me

261
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,440
no longer concerns the sect.

262
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:30,720
Open it.

263
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,920
Cease your persistence, sir.

264
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,759
This is the Hall of Suffering,

265
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,720
where an ancient master
attained enlightenment.

266
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,319
His martial arts were peerless,

267
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,319
and no ordinary prison could hold him.

268
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,680
Hence these impenetrable walls.

269
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,799
None may leave

270
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,200
without achieving enlightenment.

271
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:13,759
The master stayed 30 years here

272
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,359
before relinquishing his grudges.

273
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,480
However you confine me,

274
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,400
I'll never submit.

275
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,480
I don't seek to make you suffer

276
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,799
but to liberate you from anguish.

277
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,160
You hold the blade,

278
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,839
so speak as you will.

279
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,319
I only know eye-for-eye justice.

280
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:38,440
I'll repay what you make me endure

281
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,319
twofold future.

282
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,039
Without food or water,

283
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:48,039
how will you survive till tomorrow?

284
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,880
Who knows

285
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,319
if there's some trickery here?

286
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,680
Go

287
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,599
and bring Duan Zhixing to me.

288
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,200
The prince doesn't receive summons.

289
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,559
I'll remember this grievance.

290
00:19:48,224 --> 00:19:53,494
(Tomb of Xue, Beloved Wife)

291
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:08,384
Your Highness.

292
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,880
Don't approach.

293
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:10,960
Beware the Gu-insects.

294
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:12,920
So much blood?

295
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,119
They hurt his organs.

296
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,240
It began days ago.

297
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,559
We tried many remedies,

298
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,680
but it worsened.

299
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,359
What'll happen?

300
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,119
Well...

301
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:23,799
Speak up.

302
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,440
Her organs will turn into pus.

303
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:26,688
She will die painfully.

304
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,400
Your Highness!

305
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:38,240
Open it.

306
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,359
Yes, Your Highness.

307
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,279
The antidote.

308
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,559
Is Yi Huo not yet

309
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,240
a pool of pus?

310
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,839
It'll happen soon.

311
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,480
In a few hours, at most.

312
00:20:59,079 --> 00:20:59,640
No antidote?

313
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,480
Suffer a hundredfold.

314
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,400
If I had the antidote,

315
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,599
would I be in this state?

316
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:12,559
I don't have it,

317
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,400
but someone does.

318
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:16,720
Who?

319
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,400
You.

320
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:23,160
Me?

321
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,160
I saw with my own eyes.

322
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,559
Duan Yichang
used the One-yang Finger to expel

323
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,240
the Gu-insects from his body.

324
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,079
If you hadn't come soon,

325
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,200
I couldn't have waited.

326
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,000
I warned you

327
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,079
I hold grudges.

328
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:33,880
Son!

329
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:36,720
Son!

330
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,119
Father.

331
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:41,039
How could you be so reckless?

332
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,759
One-yang Finger saps qi.

333
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,160
Repeated use depletes cultivation

334
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,079
and harms you.

335
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:46,200
You're green.

336
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,279
Had I been any later,

337
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:48,960
you'd be dead.

338
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,319
Yi Huo...

339
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,160
Yi Huo... couldn't wait.

340
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:58,599
Father,

341
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,640
did you truly
expel the Gu-insects before?

342
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:16,440
I beg you. Save Yi Huo.

343
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:22,319
Then you

344
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,160
must promise me

345
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:26,920
to accept abdication.

346
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,119
Your Majesty knows well

347
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,720
that expelling the Gu-insects
from the girl

348
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,240
will deplete over ten years

349
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
of Your Majesty's cultivation.

350
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,960
If enemies come now,

351
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,440
Your Majesty's life
would be in grave danger.

352
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,119
I caused the disaster back then,

353
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,200
and I'll bear its consequences.

354
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
No one else is to blame.

355
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,359
It is retribution,

356
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,400
and it must be repaid.

357
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,599
- Long live Your Majesty.
- Long live Your Majesty.

358
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,759
- Long live Your Majesty.
- Long live Your Majesty.

359
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,960
- Long live Your Majesty.
- Long live Your Majesty.

360
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,400
From today onward,

361
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,200
Mr. Duan, you shall join the Sangha,

362
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,599
and your Dharma name is Liaoxing.

363
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,799
Amitabha.

364
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,056
Your Majesty.

365
00:25:52,992 --> 00:25:53,984
The physicians say

366
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,279
you're out of danger now.

367
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,559
You just need time to recover.

368
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,720
State affairs

369
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,640
have kept me busy.

370
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,160
I couldn't see you.

371
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:04,359
I'm really sorry.

372
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,880
To a ruler,

373
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,240
state matters prevail.

374
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,839
Actually,

375
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,160
you needn't come to see me.

376
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,200
Your Majesty!

377
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,559
Your Majesty!

378
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,039
Your Majesty.

379
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,960
Your Majesty, an urgent military report!

380
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,079
Sa Tribe's High Priest

381
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,519
has fled back to the Wuman.

382
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,759
He's inciting
all Wuman tribes to revolt.

383
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,640
Xiushan County is besieged.

384
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,519
The situation is critical.

385
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,039
How many troops will you deploy?

386
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,680
Over twenty years ago,

387
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,279
my father didn't

388
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,200
send reinforcements

389
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:48,319
and

390
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,039
faced fallen cities
and dead citizens in the end.

391
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,640
This time,

392
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,759
I won't dispatch troops either.

393
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,400
What do you mean?

394
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,559
Because the two of us

395
00:27:05,632 --> 00:27:07,000
will be the best reinforcements.

396
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,400
Five days and still not captured.

397
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:36,960
We Puyong Tribe suffered greatly.

398
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:37,880
Exactly.

399
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,680
Demeng Tribe, too.

400
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,359
Our tribe, too.

401
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:40,200
Bi Tribe, too.

402
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,640
Tomorrow, you Nuowu Tribe
will lead the assault.

403
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,440
We have always led the charge.

404
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:46,960
Even our leader is hurt.

405
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,160
She is being treated.

406
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:49,559
How's my mother?

407
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,680
My lady, you've returned.

408
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,960
Your mother has external injuries.

409
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,119
She needs rest.

410
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,519
Why have you returned?

411
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,400
Did Dali harm you?

412
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,359
Dali treated me well.

413
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:01,640
and honored me.

414
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,640
Do as I say.

415
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:07,960
Take a look, everyone.

416
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,039
Take a look, everyone.

417
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
It was our all-out attack

418
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,319
that made Dali fear us.

419
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,000
It was our all-out attack

420
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,000
that made Dali fear us.

421
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,079
That's why they returned Yi Huo.

422
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:25,359
- He's...
- The main culprit is...

423
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:27,519
Duan Zhixing.

424
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,880
Nonsense!

425
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,759
Are you the Emperor of Dali?

426
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:33,359
Correct.

427
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,920
Cut the head off the snake.

428
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,200
Seize him...

429
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,400
And Dali will surrender without a fight.

430
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,519
If I

431
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,599
wanted your lives,

432
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,519
I wouldn't have waited.

433
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,599
I came alone

434
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,960
and arrived lightly equipped

435
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,319
just to tell you all

436
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,720
that Dali means no harm.

437
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:25,880
We've lost so many

438
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,400
siblings.

439
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:27,480
Your empty words

440
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:28,319
won't erase that.

441
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:29,279
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

442
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,400
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

443
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,559
Then how

444
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:34,599
will you believe me?

445
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,039
To gain our trust,

446
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,640
there's only one way.

447
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:38,559
Yes?

448
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,359
Marry Yi Huo immediately

449
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,119
and announce to the world

450
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,480
that your child

451
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,039
will be Dali's royal heir

452
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:48,400
and that Wuman and Dali
shall be equals henceforth.

453
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,079
Otherwise,

454
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,720
we'll fight to the death.

455
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,240
Run!

456
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:12,559
Mother!

457
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,359
Run!

458
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,119
Hurry!

459
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,160
Father!

460
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,960
Wake up!

461
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,640
Mother, I'm so hungry.

462
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,160
Young boy,

463
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:43,960
stop pulling.

464
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:48,880
I'll help bury them.

465
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,640
Are you going to war?

466
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:51,519
Take me with you.

467
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,039
You're still too young.

468
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,039
I must avenge my parents.

469
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:56,799
Take me,

470
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:57,680
or I won't make way.

471
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,319
When you grow up,

472
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:10,480
come find me

473
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,079
in Dali City with this.

474
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:19,880
Okay, it's a deal.

475
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,160
Deal.

476
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,119
Don't forget

477
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,799
my name is Wu Santong.

478
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:38,680
I'll remember.

479
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,880
I'll never agree to this.

480
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,720
I don't care about

481
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,440
who you love.

482
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:50,720
This marriage

483
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,920
is no longer a family matter.

484
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,880
It concerns all Wuman tribes

485
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,000
and everyone's fate.

486
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,759
But why must I bear

487
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,240
such a big burden

488
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,960
alone?

489
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,559
You bear it alone?

490
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,519
Yi Huo,

491
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,839
upon hearing you were captured,

492
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,559
they immediately took up arms

493
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:11,200
and risked their lives to save you.

494
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:13,319
Compared to them,

495
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,200
your burden is nothing.

496
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,519
Once out of the tent,

497
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,640
open your eyes wide

498
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,640
and see

499
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,559
what bearing the burden is.

500
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:27,279
I had no other choice.

501
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,160
So I asked you here.

502
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,799
What solution do you have

503
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,559
for the current predicament?

504
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,319
Why are you unwilling

505
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,920
to marry Yi Huo?

506
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:40,920
She...

507
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:44,400
She loves someone else.

508
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:46,799
I cannot force this upon her.

509
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:50,240
The martial world leaves no freedom,

510
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,400
and the courts do even more so.

511
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:55,200
Hurry.

512
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,240
Xiaoxue, listen to Mother.

513
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:57,759
Understand?

514
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,200
I will find you

515
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,039
after some time.

516
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,240
Take good care of her. Go.

517
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,079
Hurry. Be careful.

518
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,559
You must return alive.

519
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,679
I know.

520
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,719
This is exactly
what 'forcing' looks like.

521
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,159
Just because two of you

522
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,800
aren't mutually in love,

523
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,679
commoners must face ruin and death

524
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:27,119
and soldiers

525
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,760
must die on battlefields?

526
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,239
I thought

527
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,960
your trip in the martial world

528
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:41,440
would have taught you

529
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,639
life's hardships.

530
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,000
When people suffer,

531
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,440
true men rise to duties.

532
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,079
Whether you're emperor or beggar

533
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,280
matters not.

534
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:52,760
It only matters

535
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,599
if you act as a true man.

536
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,119
Congratulations!

537
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:21,440
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

538
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,239
We've finally returned.

539
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,840
Yes, we returned at last.

540
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,039
Xing?

541
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,039
He has actually become Dali's emperor?

542
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:13,400
- May you eternal peace and happiness.
- May you eternal peace and happiness.

543
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,599
- May you eternal peace and happiness.
- May you eternal peace and happiness.

544
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,039
- May you eternal peace and happiness.
- May you eternal peace and happiness.

545
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,400
- May you eternal peace and happiness.
- May you eternal peace and happiness.

546
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,840
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

547
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:28,960

I'll go there.

566
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,599
Wait.

567
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,808
(Newlyweds' Joy)

568
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,119
At Junshan,

569
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,400
I drank wine you like.

570
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,079
Now, in Dali,

571
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:09,039
taste the wine I like.

572
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:20,400
Eternal unity.

573
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:28,960
Wine

574
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,400
is sorrow's antidote.

575
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:36,039
Let's share our sorrows.

576
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:37,760
We drink a bowl

577
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,039
for each sorrow spoken.

578
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,679
The one I love got married.

579
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:49,000
The groom isn't me

580
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:51,119
but my sworn brother.

581
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:56,119
That deserves a bowl.

582
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,800
The woman I must wed

583
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,840
longs for another,

584
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:11,800
and that man

585
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,280
is also my sworn brother.

586
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,679
It deserves a bowl.

587
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,920
My sworn brother's father

588
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,960
killed my mother.

589
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,832
My sworn brother's mother

590
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,159
was killed by my father.

591
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:57,920
My sworn brother

592
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,599
wants to kill my father

593
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,320
for vengeance.

594
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,280
My sworn brother

595
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,280
will become my mortal enemy

596
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,280
if I kill his father.

597
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,760
What cursed fate is this?

598
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,440
In the martial world,

599
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:37,079
there is no freedom.

600
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:42,519
I loathe hearing

601
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:43,599
'there is no freedom'.

602
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,719
My birth wasn't my choice.

603
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,159
Must my life also be dictated?

604
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,480
But at least

605
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,159
one choice remains mine.

606
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,519
Choose you as my friend.

607
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,320
With those words,

608
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,199
my life

609
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,400
is fulfilled.

610
00:42:34,432 --> 00:42:35,280
(Next time we meet,)

611
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,119
(we'll be foes, not friends.)

612
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,960
(May we)

613
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,000
(never meet again.)
