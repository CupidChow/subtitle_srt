00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,719
Li,

3
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,280
I'll send a pigeon message

4
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,120
to let Chu Wei's troops reinforce.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,800
I guarantee your wife's safety.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,800
I swear on my life.

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,600
Duan Yichang didn't reinforce

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,719
but sent troops

9
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:28,879
to Dali.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,600
Throne.

11
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:32,640
I want the throne!

12
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,319
I lost my martial arts.

13
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,640
But don't worry, my dear.

14
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:35,680
I'll definitely avenge you.

19
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,879
Hong Qi,

20
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,840
the Duan family

21
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,639
murdered your mother in the past

22
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,400
and now has taken your wife.

23
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,240
The vengeance must be taken.

24
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,520
Show no mercy.

25
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:43,879
Don't worry.

26
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,216
(Tianlong Temple, Dali)

27
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,000
Liaoxing,

28
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,519
transcribe the sutras.

29
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,439
Esteemed guest from afar,

30
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,279
this old monk greets you.

31
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,160
Abbot,

32
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,160
I wish to avoid complications.

33
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,120
Please grant me passage.

34
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,519
Would you care

35
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,319
to heed my advice?

36
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,680
If words could resolve this,

37
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,680
I wouldn't be standing here.

38
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:55,959
If you

39
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,959
persist in stopping me,

40
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,600
then I must force passage.

41
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,000
Your mastery of One-yang Finger

42
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,720
far surpasses mine.

43
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,959
One move.

44
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,439
I couldn't withstand even one move.

45
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,399
You've suffered.

46
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,040
Whether you're emperor or monk,

47
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,040
I need to ask you one question.

48
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,000
Why didn't you send troops back then?

49
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,079
Because of my greed.

50
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,360
Greed for power.

51
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,704
The sutra states that

52
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,680
desire breeds worry

53
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,199
and fear.

54
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,120
Without desire,

55
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,959
no worries or fears.

56
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,160
Eloquent words.

57
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,120
But know that your greed

58
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,399
made countless lives suffer.

59
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,279
I am

60
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,560
filled with endless remorse.

61
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,680
Who can repay 20 years

62
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,199
of my father's suffering?

63
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,560
I seek no forgiveness,

64
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,839
only that the living

65
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,079
may live peacefully.

66
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,839
Your visit is fate.

67
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,519
Stay awhile

68
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,279
and copy sutras

69
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,800
to purge your resentment.

70
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,000
What's your plan?

71
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,399
Tianlong Temple

72
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,360
answers to no emperor.

73
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:34,960
For my father,

74
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,360
I shouldn't have told you.

75
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,559
Then why did you?

76
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,879
Given Qi's temperament,

77
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,120
he'll never yield.

78
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,000
I can't

79
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,919
let Tianlong Temple trap him.

80
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,240
And I know how you feel about him...

81
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,200
Thank you.

82
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,159
Yi Huo.

83
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,200
I never expected

84
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,440
you'd request this meeting.

85
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,279
I need you

86
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,080
to do something.

87
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,320
Why should I help?

88
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,320
I don't crave wealth.

89
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,240
I have no lust for beauty.

90
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,159
And I seize power myself.

91
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,799
But there's something

92
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
only you require,

93
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,159
and only I possess.

94
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,879
Is that so?

95
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,120
All Wuman tribes

96
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,960
breed Gu-insects.

97
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,559
And their purposes

98
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,600
vary a lot,

99
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,559
but all share one trait.

100
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,039
At midnight

101
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,559
each night, the infected

102
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,399
endure agony as the insects

103
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,639
devour them.

104
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:27,960
I suspect

105
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,000
your Brain-Eating Gu

106
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
works similarly.

107
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,200
The shamans of Nuowu discovered

108
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,519
the blood of those

109
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,039
who recovered from Gu-insects

110
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,759
could suppress similar Gu-insects,

111
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,759
preventing them from devouring

112
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,799
the host's body.

113
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,799
I'm the only one

114
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,000
infected by Brain-Eating Gu

115
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
who fully recovered.

116
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,440
Therefore, my blood

117
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,960
can cure your pain.

118
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,759
It's empty talk.

119
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,440
Why should I trust you?

120
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,559
It's truly unbreakable.

121
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,759
I've strengthened my cultivation again,

122
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,960
yet it remains immovable.

123
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,360
Are you okay?

124
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,120
What do you want me to do?

125
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,200
Go to the temple.

126
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,120
I'm not foolish enough

127
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:24,039
to walk into a trap.

128
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,080
You escaped the Hall of Suffering.

129
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,639
Rescue

130
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,600
someone from there.

131
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,399
This is payment.

132
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,840
Find me

133
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,960
ten elites of Huazhu Tribe.

134
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,320
Are you hurt?

135
00:13:59,159 --> 00:13:59,679
I'm fine.

136
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,759
Thank you, Consort.

137
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,720
Who is he?

138
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,360
I'll tell you later.

139
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,080
You're now the consort
yet came to save me.

140
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,120
Then Xing...

141
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,360
He told me you were here.

142
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,559
Why?

143
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,320
He didn't want you to die here

144
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:34,559
or his father

145
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,679
to cross blades with you.

146
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,639
Most of all,

147
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,320
he hated my constant sadness.

148
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,720
He wanted you to take me away.

149
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,440
What more could I ask
with such a friend?

150
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,960
Yi Huo,

151
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,240
life is but a fleeting dream.

152
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,720
Let's go.

153
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:35,720
Mother?

154
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,200
Yi Huo,

155
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,080
when you sought

156
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,080
Huazhu Tribe's leader,

157
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,240
I knew something was wrong.

158
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,120
Greetings, ma'am.

159
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,279
You liar,

160
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,120
you faked the prince to deceive us.

161
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,240
Now you want to trick Yi Huo

162
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,080
into eloping.

163
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:52,919
Mother,

164
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,200
he's not a liar.

165
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,240
I chose to leave with him.

166
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,600
I don't want

167
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,440
to be a caged bird.

168
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,360
Yi Huo!

169
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,639
You're Nuowu's heiress.

170
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,240
Have you forgotten Dali's

171
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,120
and all the tribes'

172
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,639
people's lives?

173
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:07,600
If you two leave,

174
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,120
war will reignite.

175
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,879
The peace achieved

176
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:11,759
with blood

177
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,960
will be wasted.

178
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,360
You're blinded by his charms.

179
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:19,360
Today,

180
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,159
I'll slay this male temptress.

181
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,600
You are fighting against me?

182
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,759
Mother,

183
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,120
I'll go with you.

184
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:21,759
Father,

185
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,279
I lost.

186
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,559
It's fine.

187
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,680
Perhaps it's heaven's will.

188
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,160
Hong Qi,

189
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,640
I can't hold on much longer.

190
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,640
I'll join your mother soon.

191
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:51,759
Write

192
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,039
my name

193
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,319
on it too.

194
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,448
(Memorial Tablet of Xue Xiuzhi)

195
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,920
Why the gloom?

196
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,359
The longer I'm the emperor,

197
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,799
the more I realize

198
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,720
what true loneliness means.

199
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
Like this lamp.

200
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,000
It seems to light up darkness.

201
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,119
Yet actually,

202
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,000
it's as fragile as a moth's breath.

203
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,440
Do you know where

204
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,240
Four Heavenly Kings guard?

205
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,240
Eastern Divine Land,

206
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,640
Southern Saha World,

207
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:46,960
Western Ox Dominion,

208
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,608
and Northern Harvest Realm.

209
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,880
Upholder of the Nation

210
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,880
holds a pipa,

211
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,720
implying that taut snaps

212
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,240
and slack slacks.

213
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,079
Growth Guardian
wields the Sword of Wisdom

214
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,759
that severs worldly ties.

215
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,720
All-Seeing Lord holds a serpent,

216
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,640
signifying impermanence,

217
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:08,799
and a pearl,

218
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,880
representing an unshakable core.

219
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,240
All-Hearing Lord holds an umbrella,

220
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,960
protecting the heart from corruption.

221
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,759
They're compassionate,

222
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,000
protecting the common folk

223
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,559
and severely punishing evil.

224
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,440
A ruler

225
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,200
should emulate them

226
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,839
to achieve balance

227
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,519
and have inner wisdom

228
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,680
against lies.

229
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,359
It's easy to understand.

230
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,359
But my heart just can't stay calm.

231
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:42,839
Father,

232
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,079
how did you endure this?

233
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,559
Martial arts training.

234
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,079
Immerses completely,

235
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,519
and all worldly concerns fade.

236
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,839
Balance. Balance.

237
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,519
The true essence of One-yang Finger

238
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,920
lies not in brute force

239
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,000
but in precise application.

240
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,880
Your Majesty, please look.

241
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,480
Extinguishing one

242
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,000
and lighting one.

243
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,960
The difference is clear.

244
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,680
I still fall far short of your skill.

245
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,559
I too was competitive in my youth,

246
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,400
extinguishing candles only.

247
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:55,599
Decades later I realized

248
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,400
extinguishing a candle

249
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,440
can't compare to lighting one.

250
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:02,960
I'm enlightened.

251
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,640
Thank you for your guidance.

252
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:10,920
Your Majesty, please.

253
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,559
Esteemed patron,

254
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,839
I have something to share.

255
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,920
When saving Miss Yi Huo,

256
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,960
he knew it'd cost him

257
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,640
decades of cultivation

258
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,480
and the advantage against you,

259
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,680
yet he still saved her.

260
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,359
Today brings resolution.

261
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,599
Let us begin.

262
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:03,720
Why?

263
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,400
Sins

264
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,119
must be repaid.

265
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
This is our personal feud.

266
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:16,960
Step aside.

267
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,119
Father,

268
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:19,119
forgive me.

269
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,960
The acupoint will

270
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,359
be unsealed in an hour.

271
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:25,680
Master,

272
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
it's our own dispute.

273
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,359
Allow us this resolution.

274
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,200
At Junshan that day,

275
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,799
we agreed

276
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:40,559
to fight again.

277
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Let our fathers' feud

278
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,000
end with us

279
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,799
today.

280
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,200
Your One-yang Finger is formidable,

281
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,559
but I've found its weakness.

282
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,960
Your injuries on my account

283
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,119
become another sin of mine.

284
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,759
Finally,

285
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,759
this day has come.

286
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:12,599
Xiuzhi,

287
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,559
(Memorial Tablet of Xue Xiuzhi)
my dear,

288
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:16,200
look!

289
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,519
Your vengeance nears fulfillment.

290
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:21,599
Li,

291
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,400
I can finally

292
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,599
apologize to you face-to-face.

293
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,039
I curse you!

294
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,400
Nightmares in life,

295
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,640
no rest in death!

296
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,640
I deserve this judgment.

297
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,279
Li,

298
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,519
strike now.

299
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,440
Father,

300
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,880
no!

301
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,240
Kind sir,

302
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:53,039
help me quickly.

303
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,160
Kill him for me.

304
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,480
Sa Tribe's High Priest?

305
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,079
Well, well, Li Hong,

306
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,079
if you hadn't meddled

307
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,000
back then in the Stone Forest,

308
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:30,279
I would've killed Duan Yichang.

309
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,960
How could there be

310
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:35,200
all these grievances now?

311
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:38,079
You incited the war

312
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,960
and brought that catastrophe back then

313
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
and the disaster today.

314
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:44,000
You're only half right.

315
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,640
Before you die,

316
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,960
I'll make you watch

317
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,559
as your own sons

318
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,880
become Gu-hosts.

319
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,240
Yi Huo!

320
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:59,559
Such a spectacle

321
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,640
delights me greatly!

322
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,559
What are you doing?

323
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,079
I am

324
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:13,039
using all my cultivation

325
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,200
to rid your body of Gu-insects!

326
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,920
Those Gu-insects are my life's treasure.

327
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,039
Why would you...

328
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,319
Your body has no Gu-insects now.

329
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:26,000
I'll dispel your witchcraft

330
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,839
and evil techniques too.

331
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,480
Li,

332
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,880
why did you help me?

333
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,839
You saved my son's life.

334
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,720
A life for a life.

335
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,880
Our debts are settled.

336
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,519
The decades-old guilt

337
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:05,039
weighing on my heart

338
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,440
is finally lifted.

339
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:28,640
Your Majesty?

340
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,040
Your Majesty!

341
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,079
Father.

342
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,359
Father.

343
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,559
Hong Qi.

344
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,400
Father.

345
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
All these years,

346
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,559
the person I've wronged most

347
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,279
is you.

348
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,000
Father, what are you doing?

349
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,720
I raised you all your life

350
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,240
and deceived you all your life.

351
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,440
The truth is,

352
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,359
I'm not your biological father.

353
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,920
I found you beside

354
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,359
a corpse.

355
00:32:01,216 --> 00:32:03,648
(20 years ago)

356
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,480
Little girl?

357
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:13,440
Little girl?

358
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,240
Give up.

359
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,000
You can't keep him alive.

360
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:31,400
The girl froze to death.

361
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,160
But the boy survived.

362
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,039
He has a tough body

363
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:36,799
and a tough fate.

364
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,680
Perfect for revenge.

365
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,359
(Don't cry.)

366
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:41,839
(Don't cry now.)

367
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:46,960
I beat you,

368
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,880
berated you,

369
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:55,799
and forced you to train.
None of it was kindness.

370
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,799
It was all to make you

371
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,640
avenge me

372
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,559
when you grow up.

373
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,119
I meant to stay cold. But you...

374
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:11,039
But you have been so filial.

375
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,319
The longer I raised you,

376
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,920
the more guilt consumed me.

377
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,440
I increasingly feared
sending you to fight

378
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,599
and to die.

379
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,319
But seeing her memorial tablet

380
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,799
and remembering her past,

381
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,440
I couldn't stop.

382
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,039
Son,

383
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,240
farewell.

384
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:38,839
My love,

385
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,279
I'm coming.

386
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,160
Father.

387
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:54,720
Father!

388
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:01,079
Father!

389
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,639
Father!

394
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:17,440
I can't be with you anymore.
