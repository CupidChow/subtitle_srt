1
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,439
Your Majesty, you go first.

2
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,600
We will hold them off.

3
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:05,159
I knew you'd slip away,

4
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,439
so I waited here

5
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,280
for you.

6
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,959
I knew you incited Wuman tribes'

7
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,000
(Sa Tribe of Wuman, High Priest)
rebellion.

8
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,319
I've been wanting to meet you.

9
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,760
It is a forbidden technique.

10
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,120
You'd be hunted by the martial world.

11
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,319
Thanks for the reminder.

12
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,840
I am scared.

13
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,959
Really.

14
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,480
But if you die,

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,239
then no one will know.

16
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,120
Your Majesty.

17
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,840
General Li.

18
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,439
General Li, watch out!

19
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,039
You two

20
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,479
are so close.

21
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,199
Li.

22
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,560
Thank you

23
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,000
for saving me.

24
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,319
Your Majesty,

25
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,400
no need for formalities.

26
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,800
Didn't you escort your wife

27
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,680
to Xiushan County?

28
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,159
Why are you

29
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,039
here?

30
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,039
I heard

31
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,879
about the High Priest's ambush plot,

32
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,960
so I rushed here.

33
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,319
Your Majesty, a pigeon message.

34
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,879
Rebels are besieging Xiushan County.

ten-year-old gastrodia.

43
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
You're roasting buns
with all these rare herbs?

44
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,600
I know you use premium ingredients.

45
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,360
I want to taste luxury

46
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,800
before I die.

47
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,000
The fire is not strong.

48
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,319
Why is it burnt?

49
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,759
Was that

50
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,720
cold poison flare-up?

51
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,439
Yes,

52
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,439
it was.

53
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,279
Worse than yesterday's.

54
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,160
Felt like freezing.

55
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,519
Your practice has

56
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,639
improved your vitality.

57
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,399
Practice makes me

58
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,439
feel stronger

59
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,560
physically.

60
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,560
But...

61
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,000
You can feel

62
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:12,879
the energy,

63
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,439
yet can't exert it?

64
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,079
Previously, you were so weak,

65
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,480
so I only taught you foundation,

66
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,680
no techniques.

67
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,040
Now you

68
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,000
are much better now,

69
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,199
time to teach you that.

70
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,120
Why laugh?

71
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,560
I'm dying, why waste time

72
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,120
practicing here?

73
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:10,959
Young Master.

74
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,399
If I'm not mistaken,

75
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:14,720
only one toxin

76
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,040
remains in my body, right?

77
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,199
Yes.

78
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,920
You know the cure?

79
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,360
Yes.

80
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,800
You know the cure,

81
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,800
but don't cure me.

82
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,240
There must be a reason.

83
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,519
To cure the last toxin,

84
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,439
just acupuncture Qishe point.

85
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,360
However, the last toxin

86
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,920
is the most fatal.

87
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,800
Previously, a dozen toxins

88
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,800
balanced each other,

89
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,319
so it didn't flare up.

90
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,279
Now, those toxins

91
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,560
are gone,

92
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,079
like this fire

93
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,759
without ash covering,

94
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
will burn fiercer.

95
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,000
Without treatment,

96
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,279
how long have I got?

97
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
Three days at most.

98
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,240
But during detoxification,

99
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,720
your Ren and Du meridians

100
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,720
will burn,

101
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,040
and your body

102
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,639
will limp like these beads,

103
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,079
joint by joint,

104
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,639
losing all strength.

105
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,480
You might not even

106
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,279
lift a finger.

107
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,240
Not treating it, I'm a dead man.

108
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,240
Treating it, I'll be a living dead.

109
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,160
Whatever.

110
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,160
I have three days left

111
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,839
to enjoy myself.

112
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,839
Whatever.

113
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,679
I'll roast another bun.

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,960
Okay, go.

115
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,240
Name.

116
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,080
Single-Sack disciple, Xing.

117
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,000
Here.

118
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,360
(282, Xing)

119
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,879
Go ahead.

120
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:54,519
Thanks.

121
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,039
Hold on.

122
00:08:59,279 --> 00:08:59,919
I heard

123
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,200
this man assaulted our members,

124
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,879
breaking our code of conduct.

125
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,799
As our rules,

126
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,120
he can't participate.

127
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,960
Who's he?

128
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,879
So arrogant?

129
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,279
Keep your voice down.

130
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,440
He's Elder Gao of Discipline,

131
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,679
second in the sect.

132
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,440
He's with Leader Pang's faction.

133
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,639
Then we're doomed.

134
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:19,200
We still have hope.

135
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,039
The former sect leader

136
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,919
left three Junshan Tokens.

137
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:27,279
If anyone can lift one

138
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,200
and put it
on the Martial Assembly pedestal,

139
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,679
they can access to any location

140
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
on Junshan.

141
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,159
Ridiculous!

142
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,120
Who could do that?

143
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,679
Then there's no way.

144
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,600
Go home.

145
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,120
Next.

146
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,600
You should

147
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,399
practice more.

148
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,720
I can't.

149
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,720
You've worn out,

150
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,559
and the poison's acting up again.

151
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,200
I will detoxify you.

152
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,879
No need.

153
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,279
I've made up my mind.

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,080
Let this poison

155
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,639
stay in me.

156
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,320
Junshan is right ahead.

157
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,240
Are you giving up now?

158
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,960
I hoped to return home

159
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,279
to see my father one last time.

160
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,679
But that was just

161
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,080
foolish hope.

162
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,399
I can't make it.

163
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,559
I can't let my father

164
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,080
see me at this state.

165
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,080
There's a donkey cart!

166
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,240
Hey,

167
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,360
no one is here.

168
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,879
Please don't rummage.

169
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,039
Those jars

170
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,039
contain herbs,

171
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,279
easily broken.

172
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,440
Someone is here.

173
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,320
A monk.

174
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,440
I dropped it.

175
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:53,960
Come on.

176
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,960
Let's see.

177
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,519
What is this?

178
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,399
Stop!

179
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,879
Who's there?

180
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:02,600
What?

181
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:06,440
He...

182
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,480
He seems sick.

183
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,799
And seriously ill.

184
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,759
You'd check.

185
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,639
- Go.
- Check it.

186
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,720
- Go.
- Just go.

187
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,840
Go check on him.

188
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,600
He made me bleed.

189
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,000
He made me bleed.

190
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,039
He made me bleed.

191
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,480
Your blood?

192
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,759
That's his blood.

193
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,679
He is gravely ill.

194
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Show some mercy.

195
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,720
Show some mercy?

196
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,679
Bro.

197
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,960
Should we?

198
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:43,639
Since he's dying,

199
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,240
alright.

200
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,960
Thank you all.

201
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,240
Beat him up!

202
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,240
Can anyone really lift it?

203
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,440
Someone actually did it before.

204
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,960
But there's another rule.

205
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,159
You can't drop it before placement.

206
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,200
Otherwise,

207
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,960
you'll never set foot here again.

208
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,799
The masters who attempted to do it

209
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,080
either crippled with injuries

210
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,600
or died along the way.

211
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,080
None ever reached the summit.

212
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,799
So, no one attempted it afterward.

213
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,399
Xing.

214
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,639
Leader Pang wants to

215
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,440
kill you without any efforts.

216
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,320
Sir,

217
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,759
for Qi's sake,

218
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,120
I must go.

219
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,799
I'll challenge to do it!

220
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,240
This...

221
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:50,200
This punk dares to do it?

222
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,480
What a joke!

223
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:52,679
What a joke!

224
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,600
Fine.

225
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,480
Please.

226
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,360
He's there.

227
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,320
Really.

228
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:27,960
He lifts it!

229
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:28,919
Indeed.

230
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,840
Impressive!

231
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,080
Look! He's lifting it!

232
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,879
Indeed.

233
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,559
He is truly remarkable.

234
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,200
Indeed.

235
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,080
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

236
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:47,600
Awesome!

237
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,039
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

238
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:55,879
Sirs,

239
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,799
good deeds yield good fortune.

240
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,600
Evil deeds bring retribution.

241
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,320
Bro.

242
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,440
We've vented our anger,

243
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,919
but if he reports this,

244
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,240
we'll be in trouble.

245
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,360
We can't kill him, can we?

246
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,360
Bro.

247
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,840
You are so ruthless.

248
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,720
Go.

249
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,799
Not again.

250
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,279
I was just saying!

251
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,360
Then that was well-said.

252
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,840
Go, go!

253
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:21,799
Go!

254
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,279
- Go!
- Go!

255
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,840
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

256
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,480
- Xing!
- Xing!

257
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,799
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

258
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,679
Xing!

259
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:20,759
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

260
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,840
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

261
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
(To cure the last toxin,)

262
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,600
(just acupuncture)

263
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,279
(Qishe point.)

264
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,120
(But during detoxification,)

265
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,440
(Ren and Du meridians)

266
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,480
(will burn,)

267
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,919
(you'll gain temporary great strength,)

268
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,320
(but soon,)

269
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,399
(the burning)

270
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:43,759
(shatters all your meridians.)

271
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,359
What's Pang up to?

272
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,599
He's blocking the way.

273
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,519
Put it here.

274
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,000
The noon's passed.

275
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,160
The assembly will end shortly.

276
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:48,400
End?

277
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,319
Can't believe it!

278
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,240
He's come this far.

279
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:55,839
Thank you,

280
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,400
Leader Pang.

281
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,319
Thank you

282
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,400
for your help.

283
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,960
That was crucial.

284
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,680
- He did it!
- He did it!

285
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,680
- He did it!
- He did it!

286
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:27,880
Thanks.

287
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,039
Amazing.

288
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,039
You are amazing!

289
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,319
Awesome!

290
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,880
That thing weighs a ton!

291
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,880
I should be called Dazhuang!

292
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,039
- Dazhuang!
- Dazhuang!

293
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,519
Xing! Well done!

294
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,240
Sir,

295
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,240
it's nothing.

296
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,839
Thanks to him.

297
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,519
Let's enter then.

298
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,200
Go!

299
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,599
- Go!
- Let's go!

300
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,240
- Go!
- Let's go!

301
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,528
(Elder Gao, Elder of Discipline)

302
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,360
(Elder Xu, Elder of Teaching)

303
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,160
(Elder Bian, Elder of Staff)

304
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,920
Qi, I'll do my best
to revive the Beggar Sect.

305
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,480
Everyone,
I'm Xing from Single-Sack.

306
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,680
Greetings.

307
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,279
That was close.

308
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,880
I almost got you killed.

309
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,319
Fortune and misfortune are destined.

310
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,519
I thought your meridians would burn,
with no possible cure.

311
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,799
Unexpectedly, the cold river water
cooled and protected your body.

312
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,079
At critical moments,

313
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,240
you were still figuring out
how to detoxify me.

314
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,759
Now you've gathered all toxins,

315
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,000
you can cure your disease.

316
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,319
After recovery,

317
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,000
what will you do?

318
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,079
I need to meet someone.

319
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,599
Sir,

320
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,519
you can reunite with your father.

321
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,480
Besides my father,

322
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,000
there's someone

323
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,319
I long to see more.

324
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,920
The winner

325
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:05,960
is about to come out.

326
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,640
Go down.

327
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,960
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

328
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,680
Elder Bian,

329
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:42,000
I heard you

330
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,279
expelled him.

331
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,240
Then we will gladly take him.

332
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,559
It isn't over yet.

333
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,480
Xing,

334
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,119
you've won nine duels.

335
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:55,480
One more victory

336
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,359
and you'll secure the last

337
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,200
opportunity to study at Tianshan.

338
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,200
Elder,

339
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,119
I'll

340
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,599
do my best.

341
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:05,920
Xing,

342
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,400
be cautious.

343
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,000
Understood.

344
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:01,319
This is bad!

345
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:02,559
Why?

346
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,720
After nine duels,

347
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,960
Xing's moves have been analyzed.

348
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:08,920
This man came prepared.

349
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,680
Every strike counters Xing's moves.

350
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,079
Even the most skilled

351
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,839
can be seen through eventually.

352
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,440
See, Xing

353
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,759
doesn't seem so easily

354
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,759
to be seen through.

355
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,000
His variations keep coming!

356
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:55,880
Indeed.

357
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,880
This makes the fight thrilling.

358
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:05,880
Now a real show is coming.

359
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:14,920
Miss,

360
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,240
did you drop this?

361
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:18,400
Smells good.

362
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,200
Not mine.

363
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,039
Could you be mistaken?

364
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,160
Exactly.

365
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,720
Look into my eyes.

366
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,519
I'll make you

367
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,079
forget all troubles.

368
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,119
I got your pulse.

369
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,440
You've lost.

370
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,359
Aren't you curious

371
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:58,960
why I still thrust

372
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,839
knowing I'd lose?

373
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,519
Explain yourself.

374
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,359
Look behind me.

375
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,440
This strike

376
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,839
was meant to get close to you.

377
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,720
With your strength,

378
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,640
my mind control fails.

379
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,960
But when you panic,

380
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,880
it becomes feasible.

381
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,599
Look into my eyes.

382
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,759
Want to save her?

383
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,680
Come.

384
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,519
Oh no!

385
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:03,960
What now?

386
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,759
Xing!

387
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,000
Xing!

388
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,119
Kill yourself,

389
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,240
and she'll be spared.

390
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,359
Kill yourself.

391
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,000
Are you okay?

392
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,680
What technique?

393
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,359
So formidable.

394
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:50,759
What now?

395
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,039
What happened?

396
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:53,440
One-yang Finger.

397
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:54,920
No idea.

398
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,480
Well.

399
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,839
You...

400
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,599
I'm fine.

401
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,319
Thank you for saving me.

402
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,119
Actually,

403
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,960
you got into danger because of me.

404
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,000
You?

405
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,559
They

406
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,640
wanted to use you

407
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,880
to force me to surrender.

408
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,039
If I'm not mistaken,

409
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,559
you used the One-yang Finger?

410
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,519
You call yourself Xing,

411
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,920
must be Prince Duan Zhixing.

412
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,880
Prince?

413
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,680
Prince?

414
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,799
It's my 50 taels.

415
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:30,319
Sir,

416
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,279
he's Prince of Dali?

417
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,039
Why the Duan family

418
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,799
meddle with our sect's affairs?

419
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:38,279
This has

420
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,680
nothing to do with Dali.

421
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:42,000
It's my personal decision.

422
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,559
Then why come

423
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:44,680
to Junshan?

424
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,599
I want a martial arts exchange.

425
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,960
I'm afraid not.

426
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,240
You even brought backup.

427
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,599
The one who carried the Junshan Token,

428
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,279
show yourself!

429
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,839
He

430
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:31,240
threw the Junshan Token of our sect.

431
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,119
Quite impressive.

432
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,160
How dare you do so?

433
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,799
I saw

434
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,880
someone

435
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,839
using mind-control to harm others,

436
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,480
so I had to stop him.

437
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,279
If I offended you,

438
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,759
I beg your pardon.

439
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,759
Thank you for helping me.

440
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:52,359
Don't

441
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:53,920
mention it.

442
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,519
The Junshan Token

443
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,079
lay untouched for 30 years.

444
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,160
Today at our assembly,

445
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:01,960
you two

446
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,960
moved it.

447
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:04,960
What for?

448
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,839
Don't tell me

449
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,319
you came for the duel too?

450
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,799
Exactly.

451
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,079
I came for the duel.

452
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,839
Ridiculous!

453
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,279
How dare you

454
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:14,759
mess around here!

455
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,440
Friend,

456
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,160
I'd like to challenge your

457
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,160
One-yang Finger alone.

458
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:32,279
But

459
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,160
why not show your face?

460
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:35,759
You keep your name,

461
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,319
and I'll keep my mask.

462
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,279
Not for the sect leader post,

463
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:40,640
I just want a good fight.

464
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,160
A good fight it is.

465
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,319
Brother,

466
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:47,440
please.

467
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,759
Please.

468
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,880
Why hold back?

469
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,319
You've fought ten duels.

470
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,799
Victory now would be hollow.

471
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,039
I'll help you recover.

472
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,000
What's wrong?

473
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,559
All these years,

474
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,839
I've seen every dirty trick

475
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,519
in the duel.

476
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,640
But helping

477
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,279
the rival is new.

478
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,000
This is martial virtue.

479
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:16,599
Now I believe

480
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,720
these two

481
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,759
genuinely came for the duel.

482
00:31:23,072 --> 00:31:25,280
♪Live a life with passion♪

483
00:31:25,408 --> 00:31:28,064
♪Don't let the world deceive you♪

484
00:31:28,128 --> 00:31:30,443
♪Where does the righteous path lie♪

485
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:35,712
♪Question the world, hard to find♪

486
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,166
♪Sun and moon reflect in my heart♪

487
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,065
♪My soul seeks truth,
dreams take flight♪

488
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,079
This is just

489
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,559
a show.

490
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,559
Even you got fooled.

491
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,799
Not at all.

492
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,920
Seeing them reminds me

493
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,720
of my youthful days

494
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,680
in martial world,

495
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,640
I was just like them.

496
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,759
Everyone did.

497
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,359
When I was young,

498
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,160
I sought to reform the martial world.

499
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:00,960
Looking back,

500
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,240
I realize

501
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,920
how naive I was.

502
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,720
True.

503
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,480
The martial world

504
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,119
has changed everyone.

505
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,759
Again!

506
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:23,960
Then do not

507
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:25,160
hold back.

508
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,559
Forgive me then.

509
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:27,640
Be careful!

510
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,920
Force can't beat speed.

511
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,200
Adding more strength is futile.

512
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,720
(Upper nine.)

513
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:35,519
(Proud Dragon Repents.)

514
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,680
(The Saint with dragon's might
reigns supreme.)

515
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,599
(Prolonged zenith)

516
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,960
(brings reversal.)

517
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,160
(Hence the repentance.)

518
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,440
(Clumsy beats clever.)

519
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,400
(Slow defeats swift.)

520
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,799
(Knowing tides of times,)

521
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,920
(yet never straying,)

522
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,119
(this is a saint's way!)

523
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,960
What...

524
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,239
What an amazing fight!

525
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,000
You are way better than me.

526
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,280
You defeat me.

527
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,320
Xing has lost?

528
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:54,800
May I ask

529
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,119
what technique it is?

530
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:57,840
It's for health-preserving.

531
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,159
W-What?

532
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:13,760
It's...

533
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,559
18 Dragon-Subduing Palms!

534
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:16,800
What?

535
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,199
18 Dragon-Subduing Palms?

536
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,360
18 Dragon-Subduing Palms?

537
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,280
Is it real?

538
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,119
Impossible!

539
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,039
I've never seen it.

540
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,280
Elder Xu, what did you say?

541
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:25,800
This is our sect's treasure,

542
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,039
18 Dragon-Subduing Palms!

543
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,119
Treasure!

544
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,480
18 Dragon-Subduing Palms!

545
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,679
- Yes!
- It's real!

546
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:33,719
We never see it!

547
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,039
You can't joke about it.

548
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,639
Have you gone crazy?

549
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:38,840
Elder Xu.

550
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,920
Since Master Qiao's death,

551
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,480
this technique was lost!

552
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,320
Generations of elders tried and failed.

553
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,320
How can you tell its authenticity?

554
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:52,760
Look!

555
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,559
What's this?

556
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,320
What's this?

557
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:57,800
Proud Dragon Repents!

558
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,119
After Master Qiao died,

559
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,880
the Elder of Teaching

560
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,199
recorded what he saw

561
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:04,880
on

562
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:05,960
this cloth,

563
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,239
letting it pass down

564
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,599
through generations.

565
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,000
Today,

566
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:13,719
18 Dragon-Subduing Palms

567
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,760
reemerge!

568
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,559
So it's 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms!

569
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,000
What an honor!

570
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:25,599
What an honor!

571
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:30,000
Today's Martial Assembly

572
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:30,880
was meant to

573
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,679
select experts to Tianshan

574
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,320
to learn 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms

575
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,239
and become our 18th Sect Leader.

576
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,840
But unexpectedly,

577
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:40,280
the technique reemerges.

578
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,920
Heaven has sent this master

579
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:44,519
to revive the Beggar Sect!

580
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:49,559
I'm a Nine-Sack,

581
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,960
greetings, Sect Leader!

582
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,360
Greetings, Sect Leader!

583
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,400
Greetings, Sect Leader!

584
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:58,800
Greetings, Sect Leader!

585
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,400

please show us

587
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,599
your face.

588
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,719
Please, Sect Leader!

589
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,239
Please, Sect Leader!

590
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:24,079
Please, Sect Leader!

Please, Sect Leader!

Please, Sect Leader!

593
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,920
Please, Sect Leader!

594
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,800
Everyone,

595
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,519
I'm Hong Qi.

596
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:28,400
Leader Hong!

597
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,079
- Leader Hong!
- Leader Hong!

598
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,599
- Leader Hong!
- Leader Hong!

599
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,880
- Leader Hong!
- Leader Hong!

600
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:37,079
He didn't die.

601
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:38,760
- Leader Hong!
- Leader Hong!

602
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,960
My son.

603
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,960
It's my son Hong Qi.

604
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,639
My son.

605
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:47,880
My son.

606
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,280
Qi, you're still alive.

607
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:07,840
Miss.

608
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,320
Why did you

609
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:23,679
deceive me again?

610
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,679
You even pretend to die!

611
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,280
What a heavy slap!

612
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,320
Luckily I never agreed

613
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,079
to be with her.

614
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,039
I'd have been beaten to death!

615
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,000
Our men said

616
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,159
Young Master is nearby.

617
00:41:27,584 --> 00:41:30,679
(To Hong Qi)

618
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,719
Heaven has blessed you

619
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,079
with exceptional gifts.

620
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,360
You must fulfill Heaven's will.
