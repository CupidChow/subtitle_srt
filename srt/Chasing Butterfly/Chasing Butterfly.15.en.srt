1
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,320
Auntie.

2
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,180
This awakening procedure

3
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,450
uses the latest AI technology to repair consciousness.

4
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,720
You can trust me with Xiaoyu.

5
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,340
Thank you for taking care of her all these years.

6
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,160
I trust you completely with Xiaoyu.

7
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,320
This experiment

8
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,920
is based on the subject's life experiences

9
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,180
written into a script.

10
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,580
The AI then builds a virtual world based on this script.

11
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,440
Finally, we upload the consciousness into it.

12
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,770
This allows us to create

13
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,920
scenarios that repair the consciousness.

14
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,720
Xiao Ding.

15
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,490
You don't need to explain so much to me.

16
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,680
I believe in you.

17
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,080
The doctor told me yesterday

18
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,320
that Xiaoyu's physical condition is very poor.

19
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,560
If this continues,

20
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,960
she has three months at most.

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,160
You are our last hope.

22
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,460
I will definitely wake you up.

23
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,200
Hello, master.

24
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,360
AI Number Seven is now activated.

25
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,640
Number Seven.

26
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,730
I've uploaded Xiaoyu's life experiences to the system.

27
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,000
I need you

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,660
to create a script to repair her consciousness.

29
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,340
Start the awakening task.

30
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,720
Number Seven has completed

31
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,080
a full scan of Lin Yu's consciousness.

32
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,920
Lin Yu hasn't awakened

33
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,120
because she's trapped by regrets.

34
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,960
Although Lin Yu is in a coma,

35
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
her consciousness remains active.

36
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,720
Within her consciousness,

37
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,840
she carries many regrets.

38
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,800
She was unable to save

39
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,400
her brother Wu Zhun,

40
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,320
her best friend Nana,

41
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,640
her friend Liu Jun,

42
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,300
and her crush Ding Chongxi during the accident.

43
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,370
What did you say?

44
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,680
Lin Yu was unable to save

45
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,280
her brother Wu Zhun,

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,200
her best friend Nana,

47
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,320
her friend Liu Jun,

48
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,980
and her crush Ding Chongxi during the accident.

49
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
Xiaoyu likes me?

50
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,060
Number Seven confirms. Detection is accurate.

51
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,680
Since when?

52
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,760
Time estimated to be

53
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,520
the summer when she was 17.

54
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,320
Could it be...

55
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,800
Back then?

56
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,280
Ding Chongxi.

57
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,040
This is for you.

58
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,560
Yan.

59
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,880
Number Seven wants to tell you

60
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,080
that Lin Yu's consciousness is filled with regret about you.

61
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,159
Script plot.

62
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,480
It needs to include you, Wu Zhun, Liu Jun, and Nana.

63
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,920
She needs to confirm

64
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
that you're all still alive and well

65
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,770
before her consciousness can be fully restored.

66
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,840
You mean

67
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,440
Xiao Yu thinks I'm gone too?

68
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,280
Yes.

69
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,480
Start setting up the script.

70
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,040
Guide: Ding Chongxi.

71
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,920
You mean

72
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,060
you need to upload my consciousness too?

73
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,640
Yes, master.

74
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,480
Lin Yu has been trapped in critical condition for too long.

75
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,560
To lower her consciousness defenses,

76
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,490
only her original family memories will be unlocked.

77
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,200
Under these circumstances,

78
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,240
without a guide,

79
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,640
she won't be able to meet Liu Jun, Nana, or Wu Zhun,

80
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,520
let alone leave the consciousness safe zone on her own.

81
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,040
When you become her guide,

82
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,800
she will follow you.

83
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,400
How can you ensure she'll definitely follow me?

84
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,440
Number Seven

85
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,400
will implant a guiding dream for Lin Yu.

86
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,800
As long as Lin Yu still has a trace of affection for you,

87
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,000
you two will meet.

88
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,360
Once you meet,

89
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,880
Number Seven will inform her

90
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,080
that she needs to save you from your coma

91
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,560
in order to exit the system.

92
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,040
But this is a lie,

93
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,640
a well-intentioned lie.

94
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,640
What if she doesn't like me,

95
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,000
doesn't have any positive feelings at all?

96
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,040
How can there be any affection then?

97
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,600
If that's the case,

98
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,080
Number Seven will customize a new script for you.

99
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,520
Script has started running.

100
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,600
Script has started running.

101
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,000
Lin Yu

102
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,160
Miao Qing Luan Lin Wei Zheng

103
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,560
