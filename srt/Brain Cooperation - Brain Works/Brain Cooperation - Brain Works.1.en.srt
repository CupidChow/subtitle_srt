00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,899
What are you saying?

169
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,775
The Department Chief
just texted me and said...

170
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:54,275
to investigate the case thoroughly
and leave no doubt...

171
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:56,546
as all eyes are on the case now.

172
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,570
And what? You can't do it?

173
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:01,039
I was just typing three exclamation
marks next to "Yes, sir."

174
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:03,039
How could you let me down like this?

175
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:05,759
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:07,919
Use all your resources.

177
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:09,995
Ask for help and advice.

178
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,125
If you're willing, you do anything.

179
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:13,820
Since when were we perfectly ready
before we did anything?

180
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:16,009
Oh, right.

181
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:19,659
Do you not know how it is because
you haven't done much fieldwork?

182
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,850
Or...

183
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:23,870
are you trying to mess with me
when you know?

184
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,950
Sir.

185
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,446
I complained to her because
I felt that we weren't ready.

186
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,820
I apologize, sir.

187
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:38,489
In the era
of the Fourth Industrial Revolution,

188
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:41,155
I launched this new team
with high aspirations...

189
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:43,649
in keeping with
the Brain Science Initiative Policy.

190
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,995
How you two handle this case
will directly affect...

191
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,369
my performance review.

192
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:48,960
Solve the case no matter what.

193
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:50,659
Do you understand?

194
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:52,279
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir!

195
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,830
So Mr. Kim Jae Won
had Parkinson's disease?

196
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,720
But he was young.

197
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,690
He was diagnosed three years ago.

198
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,290
The doctor said it'd progress
quickly due to his young age.

199
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:09,210
He even underwent
deep brain stimulation surgery.

200
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,885
It's a surgical procedure where...

201
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:15,589
electrodes are implanted in the
brain to reduce hand tremors, right?

202
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:19,139
Yes.

203
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,690
The surgery went well, so he was
able to return to his daily routine.

204
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:31,700
The problem was that
he could no longer play the guitar.

205
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,470
Guitar was his everything.

206
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,210
He always said he wanted to die
while playing the guitar.

207
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,980
Right before his concert,
he said this to me.

208
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,556
"Kill me
when I'm shining most brightly..."

209
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,930
"on stage."

210
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,895
He said he had a brilliant idea.

211
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,059
He said we should use
a high-frequency bracelet.

212
00:12:57,629 --> 00:12:59,005
Those who underwent DBS...

213
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,399
must not use high-frequency devices.

214
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:04,375
He managed
to get a high-frequency bracelet...

215
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,240
that was illegally rewired for high heat.

216
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,230
Then he said he'd put it on
before he went up on stage.

217
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,149
This is his phone.

218
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:26,149
He asked me to use this app to turn it on.

219
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:39,769
I did what he asked me to do.

220
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,639
But I ended up killing him.

221
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,320
I am...

222
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,440
a murderer.

223
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,170
Yes, it's possible.

224
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,635
The diatomic energy can flow
through implanted devices...

225
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:02,635
and cause tissue damage,

226
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:04,330
which could lead to death.

227
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,559
Most medical devices are fine,

228
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:10,230
but if they were illegally wired...

229
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:13,119
Then it's a different story.

230
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,909
He was depressed, so I suggested
he see a psychiatrist.

231
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,409
I feel ashamed as his doctor.

232
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,930
We're ready.

233
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,919
All right. I'll increase it now.
Here we go.

234
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,799
Gosh, it exceeded the maximum value.

235
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,905
The hertz meter can't even measure it.

236
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:45,429
And it gets very hot.

237
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,340
It was illegally rewired, indeed.

238
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:50,539
We still have to wait
for the autopsy results,

239
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:53,416
but I think Jung In Young
was telling us the truth.

240
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,080
Gathering scientific evidence will be key.

241
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:57,985
We should do some simulations.

242
00:14:58,009 --> 00:14:59,879
What? Me?

243
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,765
No, I should do it. I'll do it.

244
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:07,296
No, that's not what I meant.
If we were to do simulations...

245
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,895
We'd need mannequins
for the experiments, wouldn't we?

246
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,129
Right. But since we don't have any...

247
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,799
We'd have to reach out to a lab
to do the experiments.

248
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,176
There's a place called Brain Hub.

249
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,405
It's a neurological simulation center...

250
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:22,769
at the Korea National University Hospital.

251
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,190
"Brain Hub?"

252
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:27,379
I don't know stuff like this.

253
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:29,129
Where did I hear this?

254
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,355
You probably know about it because of him.

255
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:33,850
That super famous neuroscientist.

256
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,326
He's here to give an amazing lecture.

257
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,159
Let's welcome Neuroscientist Shin Ha Ru.

258
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,135
His name is Shin Ha Ru.

259
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,889
The neuroscientist
who's often seen in documentaries.

That guy, right?

He does this.
That guy in the TV commercial.

267
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,250
Yes, him.

268

Oh, he's written a book too.

269
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,269
Yes.

270
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,666
Here.

271
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,936

He's the guy we need!

Gosh, don't you worry.

and offer advice?

to easily agree to the consultation.

to kiss up to him.

there will be no reason to live.

00:30:26,769 --> 00:30:28,119
I am forced to...

498
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:30,279
end the briefing here. Thank you.

499
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:31,926
- But...
- Wait.

500
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,009
- You can't leave already.
- We're not done yet.

(Post-mortem Brain Donation Consent Form)

502
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,840
Why isn't he here yet?

503
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:46,890
We forged the donor consent form.

504
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:49,400
If we get caught,
we'll get in big trouble.

505
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
I'll explain the details later,

506
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,440
but you're doing a great deal
for brain science development.

507
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:04,450
You must stay completely still.

508
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,560
Until I return.

509
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,230
Goodbye.

510
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,039
Are you a ghost?

511
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,060
What the...

512
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,569
Name, Kang Sung Ha. Age, 56.

513
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,020
COD, suicide.

514

Scored 100 percent on the psychopath test.

Psychopath brain confirmed
through functional MRI.

516
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:07,686
The MAO-A gene absent.

517
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,456
(Missing the MAO-A gene
can cause excessive violence.)

518
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,830
I'll begin...

519
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:12,899
the brain biopsy.

520
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,866
Who are you?

521
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:27,930
You're not Kang Sung Ha.
What are you doing here?

522
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,606
I'm... That doctor.

523
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:34,670
Dr. Shin Ha Ru told me
to lie still on the table.

524
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,869
- My hair.
- He did?

525
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,509
Darn it.

526
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,809
He'll drive me insane one day.

527
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,985
I'm the one who's about to go insane!

528
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:46,609
Look. What'll you do about this?

529
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:49,150
I need to see a mirror. Where is it?

530
00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:50,699
Oh, great.

531
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:53,469
Darn it!

532
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:55,565
What'll you do about this?

533
00:32:55,589 --> 00:32:58,166
Give me back my hair! I want it back in!

534
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,906
I'm really sorry.

535
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,930
I thought you were Kang Sung Ha's body.

536
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,200
His body was right here a while ago.

537
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,069
Oh, how about...

538
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,976
you get a haircut...
Oh, no. I forgot my wallet.

539
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,470
A haircut?

540
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,085
What haircut can fix a highway
you shaved through my head?

541
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:16,459
Darn it.

542
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,500
What's going on?

(Post-mortem Brain Donation Consent Form)

544
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,235
(The brain goes solely to Dr. Shin Ha Ru.)

545
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:31,230
It goes solely to Dr. Shin?

546
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,240
That's preposterous.

547
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,080
Where's Kang's body?

548
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,369
I think Dr. Shin smuggled it out.

549
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:39,970
Find it now!

550
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:41,619
Yes, sir.

551
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:43,476
What the heck...

552
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,769
Hey. Hello? What just happened?

553
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,490
Didn't they see me?

554
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,279
Where did they all
run off to leaving me here?

555
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,010
Dr. Shin!

556
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:09,599
Open the door. Open it right now!

557
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,930
Let me in!

558
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,070
Open this door!

559
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,860
Dr. Shin!

560
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,299
Open the door now!

561
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:32,839
Dr. Shin.

562
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:37,960
Stop what you're doing
and open this door now!

563
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,509
Dr. Shin!

564
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,080
Dr. Shin!

565
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,049
Get the master key!

566
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:56,889
Dr. Shin!

567
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:08,139
I got the key!

568
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:17,630
Who said you could cut him open?

569
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,276
Thomas Harvey
who cut out Einstein's brain...

570
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,500
kept the photos to himself until he died.

571

the model of the movie "Memento."

573
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,790
My point is,

574
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:36,179
why should I share the trophy with you?

575
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:37,969
Dr. Shin!

576
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,170
Dr. Shin!

577
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:42,019
Oh, here you are.

578
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:44,929
I won't let this slide.
I'll make an official complaint.

579
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,929
I can't let this slide either.

580
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:50,130
Do you see this? What'll you do about it?

581
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:52,646
Who are you? Why have you
been making such a fuss?

582
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,916
Can't you tell? I'm a victim!

583
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,776
He told me to lie on a table,

584
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,876
and this happened!

585
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,885
Why did you even agree to do that?

586
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:00,909
Are you an idiot?

587
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:03,340
What? Is that all you can say?

588
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,579
Let's sum this up.

589
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:13,489
You, make an official complaint.

590
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:17,219
I am partially responsible,

591
00:36:17,889 --> 00:36:19,239
and it is an ugly look.

592
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,980
What?

593
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:26,329
Cover it up with this for a while.

594
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,180
I'll buy you another one that's expensive.

595
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,139
That's that all sorted.

596
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,020
Goodbye, then.

597
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,589
Take care.

598
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,555
Hey. Dr. Shin!

(Autopsy Lab)

600
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:50,590
What kind of weirdo is that?

601
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,040
I apologize.

602
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,389
If you don't mind,
you can wear that for now.

603
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:57,909
Poor you.

604
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,250
Don't worry about it.

605
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,850
You keep this.

606
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,639
Judging by how that jerk treats you,

607
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,540
you must've been stressed out
having to put up with him.

608
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,420
That's why I ended up like this.

609
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,349
This is nuts.

610
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:20,889
Darn it. My nice hair was
the only thing I got going for me.

611
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:23,460
What is this?

612
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,389
Gosh, I really can't believe this.

613
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,460
I should've tried harder to stop him.

614
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,310
I'm sorry.

615
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,170
Oh, why are you apologizing?

616
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,739
That jerk is a piece of trash.

617
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:39,269
A piece of trash? Who?

618
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,969
I want to know his name.

619
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,960
Oh!

620
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:49,349
What happened? Why did you get
a buzz cut only on that part?

621
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:51,896
Who did it? A robber?

622
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,626
What robber carries around a clipper?

623
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,000
Only a pervert would do that.

624
00:37:58,059 --> 00:37:59,730
Let's go. I need a drink.

625
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,405
The news about his death...

626
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:03,460
has sparked an investigation...

627
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,980
into the causes of...

628
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,139
Looking all serious, he said,

629
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,469
"You're contributing to the
advancement of neuroscience."

630
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,115
How ridiculous.

631
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:16,440
He's nuts. He's a total nutcase.

632
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,325
Right. That obnoxious jerk.

633
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:21,796
Find out what he's really up to, okay?

634
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,480
- Such questions were brought up.
- Oh.

635
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:25,425
- Dr. Shin Ha Ru from Brain Hub...
- It's that obnoxious jerk.

636
00:38:25,449 --> 00:38:26,799
Will tell us more.

637
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:29,066
Kang Sung Ha decided
to donate his brain...

638
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,090
as a way of repenting
what he did to the victims...

639
00:38:31,429 --> 00:38:33,566
and told us to use it
to study the brains of criminals.

640
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,940
Why isn't he here yet?

641
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,559
We forged the donor consent form.

642
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,000
If we get caught,
we'll get in big trouble.

643
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,420
Oh, that's right.

644
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,880
That consent form is fake.

645
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:51,280
I heard it.

646
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:53,809
When I was lying there with
the sheet over my face like this,

647
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,400
the guy with the clipper said so.

648
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:56,595
Do you have evidence?

649
00:38:56,619 --> 00:38:59,550
Evidence? I sure do. My ears.

650
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,195
I told you. I heard that guy with
the clipper mumbling to himself...

651
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:03,569
that they forged it.

652
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:05,730
Why would he lie about it when he's alone?

653
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,699
You had a really long day.

654
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,300
Are you sure you heard him right?

655
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,880
Darn you...

656
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,340
Do you want to bet? How much?
Hundred dollars? Five hundred?

657
00:39:21,269 --> 00:39:22,619
Ouch...

658
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:28,699
Perfect.

659
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:37,090
(Director Park)

660
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,559
Darn it. What a nuisance.

661
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:42,779
Right.

662

Kang Sung Ha's brain by yourself?

Kang Sung Ha's brain
is a precious treasure,

664
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:52,049
and I discovered it.

we receive at the lab.

I will share it.

you wanted to do with it?

with your selfish antics,

Right, I'm supposed
to meet a friend of mine.

It was a purely psychopathic brain
with no underlying conditions.

on a day like this.

very uncomfortable right now.

about that little punk?

00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,019
Don't you know who qualifies as a victim?

826
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:08,030
Groundless rumors have been
dragging my name through the mud...

827
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,380
which makes me the victim.

828
00:49:11,429 --> 00:49:13,130
Calm down, will you?

829
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:15,769
Let's be honest, man to man.

830
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,945
You lied to me that day...

831
00:49:17,969 --> 00:49:19,816
and used me to get what you wanted.

832
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,546
After what happened to my hair,

833
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:23,486
I had to drink to let off some steam.

834
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:26,110
But then I saw the murderer
on the news and...

835
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,750
Hold on. Why did the barber
say such a thing?

836
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,670
He said you forged something.

837
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,570
Why did you go from making excuses...

838
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,360
to questioning me?

839
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:40,789
Because I got curious.
I heard him loud and clear.

840
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:45,159
Memories easily get distorted,
exaggerated, and lost.

841
00:49:45,469 --> 00:49:47,075
How can you be sure of what you heard...

842
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:48,305
when your hair got shaved off?

843
00:49:48,329 --> 00:49:51,000
Would you be able to handle
what you think you remember?

844
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,369
Why are you here, then?

845
00:49:53,739 --> 00:49:55,916
Isn't it to see if I am the source?

846
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,039
I wanted to know how one should proceed...

847
00:49:58,579 --> 00:49:59,929
with a defamation lawsuit.

848
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,925
Gangnam Police Station
is close enough to hear you fart,

849
00:50:02,949 --> 00:50:04,349
so why would you come all this way?

850
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:08,550
I wonder why.
My feet just brought me here.

851
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,110
My brain...

852
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:14,506
must've led me toward
the source of this groundless rumor.

853
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:17,300
That's how creative I can be.

854
00:50:17,929 --> 00:50:20,869
I should check and see
if the rumor is actually false.

855
00:50:21,369 --> 00:50:23,340
You should look into
what jobs you can get...

856
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,070
after you're kicked off the force.

857
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,309
I see you bite with your words.

858
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:30,809
The ones who are usually like that
are the con artists I arrest.

859
00:50:31,179 --> 00:50:32,579
You're one to talk.

860
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,880
You have the brain of a con artist.

861
00:50:40,949 --> 00:50:42,489
Something important came up.

862
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:44,559
It's too bad,

863
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:47,860
but I'll have to hear your quips
some other time.

864
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,429
Good luck on that consultation.

865
00:50:59,969 --> 00:51:01,539
Says the crooked cop.

866
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:03,589
How dare you.

867
00:51:18,219 --> 00:51:19,965
Am I in this mess
because of a shady cop...

868
00:51:19,989 --> 00:51:21,339
who takes bribes?

869
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,170
(Director Park)

870
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:34,340
Say that I went out on business.

871
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:36,360
Sure.

872
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:40,060
Yes, Director Park.

873
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:41,960
I'm out of the office...

874
00:51:51,219 --> 00:51:54,289
(Korea National University Hospital)

875
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:56,040
Follow me this second.

876
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,969
(Korea National University Hospital)

877
00:52:03,469 --> 00:52:05,469
The forgery will be easy enough to prove.

878
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:06,710
Bring me the consent form.

879
00:52:06,909 --> 00:52:09,610
Kang Sung Ha brutally killed eight people.

880
00:52:09,909 --> 00:52:12,139
Women, children, the elderly,

881
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:13,699
and the socially disadvantaged.

882
00:52:13,909 --> 00:52:15,980
Two of his victims
were in elementary school.

883
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:17,626
Bring me the consent form.

884
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:19,119
The young children...

885
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:22,019
were sexually abused
and strangled to death.

886
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,130
How would they have felt
when they closed their eyes...

887
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,210
in pain?

888
00:52:28,289 --> 00:52:29,639
How lonely,

889
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,310
scared,

890
00:52:31,699 --> 00:52:32,675
and in pain were they?

891
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:34,130
Enough with the nonsense.

892
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:38,389
Bring it to me.

893
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,259
It's gone.

894
00:52:47,179 --> 00:52:48,529
I lost it.

895
00:52:52,489 --> 00:52:53,839
When?

896
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:55,869
Where?

897
00:52:56,889 --> 00:52:58,336
If I had known that,
I would have found it.

898
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,960
I looked in all my drawers.

899
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,610
Maybe it's in the autopsy room.

900
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,080
Come in.

901
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:19,380
Director Park told me to bring it.

902
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:20,780
(Post-mortem Brain Donation Consent Form)

903
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,856
Bring it here.

904
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,230
Wait.

905
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:27,040
Let me.

906
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:37,080
Don't tell me...

907
00:53:41,929 --> 00:53:43,546
- Are you out of your mind?
- What are you doing?

908
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:44,920
- Don't!
- Step back!

909
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:49,860
But...

910
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:53,579
What game are you playing?

911
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:55,550
I apologize for that.

912
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:58,849
My amygdala sensed danger
and caused me to act irrationally.

913
00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:01,199
Call the prison...

914
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:02,896
and ask for a copy of the consent form.

915
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,159
A copy won't hold up in court.

916
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:10,960
But we're not in court.

917
00:54:13,929 --> 00:54:16,876
Dr. Shin Ha Ru forging the consent form...

918
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,276
has become a controversial matter.

919
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,539
What are your thoughts on it?

920
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:22,380
We'll have to wait and see,

921
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,039
but if he did forge the consent form,

922
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:26,486
it can only be a major ethical violation.

923
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,480
Even if the donor
was a hardened criminal...

924
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:36,519
(Director Park)

925
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,706
(Dr. Shin Ha Ru at Brain Hub
Forges Consent Form)

926
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,080
It's me.

927
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:44,030
Do you have a moment to talk?

928
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,769
The prison doesn't have
the original document.

929
00:54:49,539 --> 00:54:51,379
We're in the process
of confirming the forgery.

930
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,170
We both know it will be proven as one.

931
00:54:55,809 --> 00:54:57,159
If he did forge the document,

932
00:54:57,409 --> 00:54:58,759
I won't be able to shield him.

933
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,885
There will be a disciplinary hearing,

934
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:03,109
and I'll have to comply
with what the committee decides.

935
00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:07,099
Why must he always be a loose cannon?

936
00:55:07,389 --> 00:55:09,029
He is becoming more impossible to manage.

937
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:12,540
It's his brain.

938
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,810
You're aware...

939
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,750
of the secret it harbors.

940
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:23,099
You're like...

941
00:55:23,869 --> 00:55:25,400
a father to Ha Ru.

942
00:55:26,739 --> 00:55:28,940
Please give him one last chance.

943
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:31,589
I'll make sure...

944
00:55:33,349 --> 00:55:34,699
that he apologizes.

945
00:55:39,449 --> 00:55:40,799
Apologize?

946
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,760
The stress must be making me hear things.

947
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:47,559
It's for your own sake.

948
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:49,210
Things don't look so good.

949
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:52,409
Your punishment could be severe.

950
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:55,570
And whose loss will that be?

951
00:55:56,039 --> 00:55:59,269
Do you think Brain Hub
can function without me?

952
00:56:02,269 --> 00:56:03,619
Ha Ru.

953
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:08,010
Will you please give in just this once?

954
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:35,880
(Disciplinary Committee)

955
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:40,060
I apologize.

956
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:43,920
I forged the consent form
and hurt the center's reputation.

957
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:46,429
I apologize for that.

958
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:52,260
But will you please let me explain
why I had no choice...

959
00:56:52,489 --> 00:56:54,190
but to go to such extremes?

960
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:58,500
Kang Sung Ha was a brute
who took eight lives.

961
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,006
Because of him, not just his victims,

962
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:04,139
but his victims' families suffered
and so did their communities.

963
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,539
You know how grievous that damage was.

964
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:10,940
To reduce the likelihood
of this happening again,

965
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:13,986
I'm working on the Psychopathic
Brain Rebuilding Project,

966
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:16,250
and his brain is a must for our research.

967
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:18,495
If this project succeeds,

968
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:21,325
we can protect multitudes
from serious crimes.

969
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:22,695
Isn't that...

970
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:25,590
real and true justice
that science can bring about?

971
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:28,436
(Disciplinary Committee Member)

972
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:31,030
Yes. I get it.

973
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:34,730
My actions were immoral.

974
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,250
But...

975
00:57:38,369 --> 00:57:40,745
just like Edward Jenner
injected his gardener's...

976
00:57:40,769 --> 00:57:42,856
eight-year-old son
with the smallpox vaccine,

977
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,349
science developed with the aid
of certain immoral experiments.

978
00:57:46,909 --> 00:57:48,259
You all know that.

979
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:52,789
If I'd adhered to every moral restraint,

980
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:55,349
would Brain Hub even exist?

981
00:57:58,659 --> 00:58:00,329
To be honest...

982
00:58:07,699 --> 00:58:11,115
aren't you all able to focus
on your research because...

983
00:58:11,139 --> 00:58:14,539
I stopped at nothing
to bring you fresh brain tissue?

The research building.

987
00:58:22,579 --> 00:58:25,256
So we could build the building
that houses all your cushy offices,

988
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,920
I think I told at least
a thousand lies to our investors.

989
00:58:29,489 --> 00:58:31,460
You, sir. Your fountain pen.

00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,429
(Disciplinary Committee Member)

991
00:58:33,929 --> 00:58:35,279
Your brand new phone.

992
00:58:35,789 --> 00:58:37,035
(Disciplinary Committee Member)

993
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:38,336
(Committee Subject)

994
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,500
I got you them for free.

995
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:43,480
Do you know that?

996
00:58:53,809 --> 00:58:55,126
This is crazy.

997
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:57,356
It turned out
the consent form was a forgery.

998
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,730
I was right, wasn't I?

999
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:00,995
And what did he say to me?

1000
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:03,289
Gosh, the shameless fool.

1001
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,736
Sorry, but you said
it was a drunken frenzy.

1002
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,929
A disciplinary committee was summoned.

1003
00:59:09,289 --> 00:59:10,976
My hunch...

1004
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,535
and instinct to uncover criminals...

1005
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:15,070
were not dulled even when I was drunk!

1006
00:59:15,869 --> 00:59:18,840
What will happen to Dr. Shin, then?

1007
00:59:18,969 --> 00:59:20,319
He's ruined.

1008
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,385
(Disciplinary Committee Member)

1009
00:59:24,409 --> 00:59:27,309
We suspect his moral compass
as a researcher,

1010
00:59:27,579 --> 00:59:29,655
so Brain Hub's disciplinary committee...

1011
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:33,349
has decided to dismiss Dr. Shin Ha Ru.

1012
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,289
Can you handle
the aftermath of this decision?

1013
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:03,250
Director Park. Don't you think
this is a bit too harsh?

1014
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:06,469
Ha Ru.

1015
01:00:08,019 --> 01:00:10,460
When humans care how other people feel,

1016
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:13,929
do you think it's out of altruism
or selfishness?

1017
01:00:18,099 --> 01:00:19,900
Take a break and think about it.

1018
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,449
(Welcome to Brain Hub.)

1019
01:00:46,329 --> 01:00:47,679
Darn it.

1020
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,630
Will you answer the...

1021
01:01:21,489 --> 01:01:22,489
Hello?

1022
01:01:22,659 --> 01:01:24,009
Dr. Shin.

1023
01:01:24,099 --> 01:01:26,670
It's the guy who spread the false rumor.

1024
01:01:26,969 --> 01:01:29,800
Oh, no. It turned out to be a fact.

1025
01:01:31,269 --> 01:01:33,186
Thank you so much.

1026
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:36,885
Thanks to you, I got to prove
that my hunch is still sharp...

1027
01:01:36,909 --> 01:01:38,610
even when I'm drunk.

1028
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,480
Listen.

1029
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:42,550
Why don't you come by one day?

1030
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:44,695
As a way of saying thanks,

1031
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:47,619
I'll serve you a nice cup of sweet coffee.

1032
01:01:47,789 --> 01:01:50,460
It'll help with your
extreme levels of stress.

1033
01:01:52,289 --> 01:01:54,760
I'll wait to hear from you, then.

1034
01:01:57,329 --> 01:01:58,679
Gosh, my coffee's hot.

1035
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,130
Have you lost your mind, idiot?

1036
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,869
What is the matter with you?

1037
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:08,115
Darn you, psycho!

1038
01:02:08,139 --> 01:02:10,480
What do you want from me?

1039
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:21,440
Ha Ru.

1040
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:23,440
Ha Ru.

1041
01:02:34,969 --> 01:02:36,699
Why didn't you make a sound?

1042
01:02:36,969 --> 01:02:38,319
You scared me.

1043
01:02:41,269 --> 01:02:42,840
What were you thinking about?

1044
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:47,480
How did my life
end up like this overnight?

1045
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:49,750
Where did it start to go wrong?

1046
01:02:50,949 --> 01:02:52,299
Stuff like that.

1047
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,369
Who knows?

1048
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:56,550
It could become a new opportunity.

1049
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:01,890
You won't have to pay too much for
the commercials' breach of contract.

1050
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:06,730
"What's so bad about using
a murderer's brain for research?"

1051
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:09,046
That's the public sentiment.

1052
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:10,376
(Agreement to Cancel Contract)

1053
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,869
We settled on a decent amount.

1054
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,469
That public sentiment.

1055
01:03:14,809 --> 01:03:16,639
Is Brain Hub aware of it?

1056
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,650
Let's forget about them.

1057
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:23,679
The Max Planck Institute
wants you to join.

1058
01:03:24,019 --> 01:03:25,369
No.

1059
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:29,095
To be honest, I think
you're wasting away here.

1060
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:30,195
A bigger pond...

1061
01:03:30,219 --> 01:03:32,960
So many world-renowned institutes
asked me to join them.

1062
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:36,210
Don't you know why I said no?

1063
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:43,739
I wanted to stay here, in my country.

1064
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,510
To bring up the level
of brain research in Korea.

1065
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:50,956
If all I wanted was success and riches,

1066
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:52,610
I wouldn't have stayed at Brain Hub.

1067
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:57,480
I worked like mad to put them on track,

1068
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,230
and they kicked me out?

1069
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:03,690
I'll leave when I want.
Now is not the time.

1070
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,889
I'll go back and show them all.

1071
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:12,360
I swear. I'll go back.

1072
01:04:13,429 --> 01:04:14,779
Okay, then.

1073
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:17,690
You might as well take a break
while you're at it.

1074
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:20,710
Why not visit Dr. Eaton...

1075
01:04:20,969 --> 01:04:22,319
No.

1076
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:25,230
There's something I must do
before I return.

1077
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:27,029
Something you must do?

1078
01:04:27,909 --> 01:04:29,259
What is it?

1079
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:33,590
Something my brain wants.

1080
01:04:36,619 --> 01:04:38,260
He got fired?

1081
01:04:38,619 --> 01:04:39,969
Of course.

1082
01:04:40,059 --> 01:04:41,635
Even if he was a criminal,

1083
01:04:41,659 --> 01:04:44,000
if you go about stuff
with no regard for the law,

1084
01:04:44,199 --> 01:04:45,900
what would that do to our law and order?

1085
01:04:46,429 --> 01:04:48,276
If I ever set eyes on him,

1086
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,340
I'll just dropkick...

1087
01:04:59,849 --> 01:05:02,380
What... are you doing here?

1088
01:05:03,719 --> 01:05:05,250
Why are you here?

1089
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:07,489
- Didn't you say you'd wait?
- What?

1090
01:05:08,619 --> 01:05:10,995
Did you actually come here...

1091
01:05:11,019 --> 01:05:13,030
for some sweet coffee?

1092
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:18,810
Congratulations.

1093
01:05:19,329 --> 01:05:22,969
You'll get to see
my blessed face for a while.

1094
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,239
What hilarious news is this?

1095
01:05:30,809 --> 01:05:32,639
I'm joining the team as a consultant.

1096
01:05:33,079 --> 01:05:35,026
In a cooperative capacity of sorts.

1097
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:36,400
"Cooperation?"

1098
01:05:36,619 --> 01:05:38,619
You and me? Does that even make sense?

1099
01:05:39,579 --> 01:05:40,929
I know.

1100
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,159
Why do you think I volunteered...

1101
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,820
to do something so nonsensical?

1102
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:49,810
Because you're insane?

1103
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,030
Yes. That's right.

1104
01:05:54,199 --> 01:05:57,546
Your drunken comment
is hindering my project,

1105
01:05:57,570 --> 01:05:58,745
which was going successfully,

1106
01:05:58,769 --> 01:06:01,139
as well as
the advancement of neuroscience.

1107
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:04,380
So seeing you play a cop
as if nothing had happened...

1108
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:06,510
was driving me nuts.

1109
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:13,330
Get ready for it.

1110
01:06:13,889 --> 01:06:16,559
I'll stay glued to you...

1111
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:20,360
and chew you to pieces.

1112
01:06:47,449 --> 01:06:49,989
(Brain Works)

1113
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,920
I have a bad feeling about this.

1114
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:53,789
The way he looks at me...

1115
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:55,509
We'll get him fired.

1116
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:57,380
You're dead meat now.

1117
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:02,046
He lost his job due to an ethical issue.

1118
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:03,945
We can't keep him on as our advisor.

1119
01:07:03,969 --> 01:07:05,319
No!

1120
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,809
Darn it!

1121
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:09,686
Leave me alone, will you?

1122
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:11,060
I've finally figured it out.

1123
01:07:11,909 --> 01:07:13,380
The person who killed Kim Jae Won.

1124
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,380
Who are you?

1125
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:19,029
The real culprit.
