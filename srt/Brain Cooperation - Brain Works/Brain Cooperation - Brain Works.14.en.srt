00:00:05,902 --> 00:00:10,501
(Episode 14. The Best Revenge)

2
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:14,011
What is that, you psycho?

3
00:00:15,342 --> 00:00:16,481
I told you.

4
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:18,551
It's a torture machine.

5
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:20,682
Let me show you.

6
00:00:58,182 --> 00:00:59,451
What the heck.

7
00:01:00,552 --> 00:01:01,852
Will you kill me with that?

8
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:05,292
No.

9
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:08,462
I said I'd make you beg me to kill you.

10
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:10,902
How about...

11
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,231
we begin?

12
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:15,402
No, don't.

13
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,042
No. You can't!

14
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:19,611
No!

15
00:01:54,141 --> 00:01:56,111
What are you doing, you pervert?

16
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:57,242
I'm preparing...

17
00:01:58,311 --> 00:01:59,382
to torture you.

18
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:08,351
What shall I start with first?

19
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,561
The least painful, right?

20
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:13,531
Oh, yes.

21
00:02:14,992 --> 00:02:16,061
This will do.

22
00:02:24,642 --> 00:02:27,212
What? You'll crush my hand?

23
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:28,781
I should.

24
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:32,552
You used it to take terrible photos.

25
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:33,982
It should be crushed.

26
00:02:36,381 --> 00:02:37,381
Don't.

27
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:39,452
Don't do it!

28
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:48,530
It hurts! My hand! You jerk!

29
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:49,631
I will report you to the police!

30
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:52,471
Police? Sure, go ahead.

31
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:55,202
I didn't hit your hand.

32
00:02:56,202 --> 00:02:57,702
Even if you call the police, there's no evidence.

33
00:03:00,642 --> 00:03:02,241
I didn't hit your hand.

34
00:03:02,242 --> 00:03:03,941
I hit this rubber hand.

35
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:05,911
So there's no evidence that I hit you.

36
00:03:07,281 --> 00:03:08,281
What?

37
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:10,621
Then why did it hurt?

38
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,791
Why did it hurt?

39
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:16,621
I didn't hit your hand, so why did it hurt?

40
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:18,791
It's because...

41
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:42,452
You didn't hit my hand. Why did it hurt?

42
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:45,522
You want to know why?

43
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:47,521
It's because your premotor cortex...

44
00:03:47,522 --> 00:03:49,821
thinks that this rubber hand belongs to you.

45
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:54,331
When I touched your hands with the same brushes earlier,

46
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:56,231
your premotor cortex...

47
00:03:56,232 --> 00:03:59,701
combined what you could see and feel...

48
00:03:59,702 --> 00:04:01,732
and believed that the rubber hand was a part of your body.

49
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:04,941
Oh, my. This is truly fascinating.

50
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:06,971
But will this work?

51
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:09,212
We'll invoke fear and use it.

52
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,240
It'll be even more painful and terrifying...

53
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:13,712
if he experiences it without understanding the theory behind it.

54
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:15,851
It's because...

55
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:19,022
I can control your brain.

56
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:22,522
As you know, I am a smart psychopath.

57
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,591
Without laying a finger on you,

58
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,832
I can make your brain feel pain,

59
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:29,361
as you just experienced.

60
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:35,231
It'd be no fun to experience the same kind of pain all over again.

61
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:44,442
How about I chop up your body part?

62
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:46,351
Or...

63
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:51,022
shall I pull out your fingernails?

64
00:04:52,022 --> 00:04:53,022
Oh, that's right.

65
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,252
I should start with this.

66
00:04:57,861 --> 00:04:59,530
Stop, you psycho!

67
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:02,431
The pain of getting your hands chopped off.

68
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:04,502
This won't hurt so much,

69
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:06,402
so let's start with this.

70
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:13,241
No! Don't!

71
00:05:14,512 --> 00:05:15,512
Please spare me.

72
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:18,041
If you want me to spare you,

73
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:19,812
hand over the photos.

74
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:22,751
I don't have any.

75
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:23,821
How dare you lie to my face?

76
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:25,152
I am telling you the truth!

77
00:05:25,752 --> 00:05:26,952
I never took any photos.

78
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:31,421
- What? - I never took any photos of Yi Na.

79
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:33,291
There are no photos.

80
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:37,861
I lied to give her a hard time.

81
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:40,132
But Yi Na said she saw them.

82
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:41,332
That was...

83
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,872
It was just a picture of her skirt riding up.

84
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:47,712
An Hye Young took it.

85
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:49,241
Well...

86
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:51,081
I don't believe you.

87
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:53,381
Don't believe me, then! What do you want me to do?

88
00:05:53,382 --> 00:05:54,981
- I'll chop your hands off! - No!

89
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:58,622
I'll show you my phone. I'll show you everything.

90
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:00,591
Really?

91
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:03,762
I must check with my own eyes.

92
00:06:05,562 --> 00:06:06,661
It's in my pocket.

93
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:21,072
What's the password?

94
00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:24,142
Your password.

95
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:27,281
It's 030415.

96
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:36,991
If I find more pictures of Yi Na,

97
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:38,931
I will hit you every single time.

98
00:06:39,361 --> 00:06:41,131
Aren't you an adult? Why are you so childish?

99
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:42,132
That's right.

100
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:43,801
I am childish.

101
00:06:44,332 --> 00:06:46,502
You're stuck with a childish adult here,

102
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:48,501
so you'd better listen and behave yourself.

103
00:06:48,502 --> 00:06:50,372
Darn you. There are no photos of her!

104
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:52,101
See for yourself!

105
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:01,012
Okay.

106
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:02,981
So you were telling the truth.

107
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:05,551
Why did you do that to Yi Na?

108
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:08,221
To get back at her.

109
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,221
For what?

110
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:12,091
Just because...

111
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,291
I asked her out, but she rejected me and started seeing someone else.

112
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,632
You see, men like you become abusive boyfriends later on.

113
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:21,171
Engrave this in your brain.

114
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:23,841
"When a woman says no, she means it."

115
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:26,111
"I don't want you either. Goodbye."

116
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,781
What does it mean when a woman says no?

117
00:07:31,442 --> 00:07:32,481
No means no.

118
00:07:32,882 --> 00:07:34,851
I don't want you either. Goodbye.

119
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:36,181
One more time.

120
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,952
What does it mean when a woman says no?

121
00:07:38,522 --> 00:07:40,952
No means no. I don't want you either. Goodbye.

122
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:44,091
Say it 100 times. That way, it'll be engraved in your memory.

123
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:45,491
Go.

124
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:50,360
"When a woman says no, she means it."

125
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:52,231
"I don't want you either. Goodbye."

126
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:53,772
One.

127
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:56,741
Ninety-nine.

128
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:59,371
"When a woman says no, she means it."

129
00:07:59,372 --> 00:08:01,072
"I don't want you either. Goodbye."

130
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:02,981
One hundred. Okay.

131
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:05,781
Now, let me go!

132
00:08:06,512 --> 00:08:09,721
Well, there's one more thing you have to do before I let you go.

133
00:08:13,522 --> 00:08:14,921
How about another round of torture?

134
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:17,161
Fine, I'll do it.

135
00:08:17,522 --> 00:08:18,921
I will do it!

136
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:29,272
Gosh, it worked.

137
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,170
A so-called psycho...

138
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:32,940
made him feel pain without laying a finger on him,

139
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:33,941
so he must've been terrified.

140
00:08:35,742 --> 00:08:37,242
It was terrifying indeed.

141
00:08:37,612 --> 00:08:38,781
Even I was scared.

142
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,622
That message.

143
00:08:44,152 --> 00:08:45,451
Yi Na didn't send it?

144
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:47,892
No.

145
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:49,961
I did it.

146
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:53,061
When Yi Na was passed out,

147
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:55,461
I unlocked her phone using her fingerprint.

148
00:08:57,402 --> 00:09:00,232
To frame her for what happened to Eun Ho?

149
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:05,102
What happened to Eun Ho?

150
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:13,012
Eyes down.

151
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:14,911
Eyes down.

152
00:09:15,482 --> 00:09:17,522
I said, eyes down! You little...

153
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:21,051
Okay.

154
00:09:22,722 --> 00:09:24,961
You punched Eun Ho. Now, we have evidence.

155
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:28,161
If you don't tell the police the truth,

156
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:30,132
I'll hand this over to them.

157
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:32,700
Then things will get even more complicated.

158
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:33,872
And since I'm a psychopath,

159
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:36,342
even I don't know what I could do next to inflict pain on you.

160
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:38,842
Do you understand?

161
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:45,781
What happened was...

162
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:50,781
We were just goofing around, but that idiot...

163
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:04,262
My gosh.

164
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:10,402
Hey, what are you doing?

165
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,710
Take some sexy photos.

166
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:14,242
We'll set it as a wallpaper.

167
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:15,512
Shall we?

168
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:17,512

Dr. Shin, it gave me satisfaction.

That's because the nucleus accumbens in your brain has been activated.

You think everything he does is cool.

No way. Dr. Shin must've read all of them.

Don't be ridiculous. They're only for display.

Just think about it. No one could read these many books.

Why am I getting a bad feeling about this?

335
00:20:09,915 --> 00:20:11,645
I'm sure you'll be delighted.

336
00:20:12,915 --> 00:20:14,215
Let's take off our jackets.

337
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:18,084
- In 1, 2, 3. Ta-da. - Ta-da.

338
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:30,235
I'm sorry, but this was the only photo I had.

339
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:35,804
Dr. Brain, you look adorable in this photo.

340
00:20:38,044 --> 00:20:39,475
We got one for you as well.

341
00:20:40,145 --> 00:20:41,215
Ta-da.

342
00:20:42,985 --> 00:20:44,915
Did you think I'd wear this?

343
00:20:45,784 --> 00:20:48,414
No, we just thought we'd offer.

344
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,754
Come on. Dr. Brain's getting upset.

345
00:20:51,024 --> 00:20:52,283
Let's eat and leave.

346
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,394
Cover the shirts and put that back in the bag.

347
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:56,094
- Come on. - Let's eat.

348
00:21:12,544 --> 00:21:15,145
I put forth my best work. What do you think?

349
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:17,514
It's good.

350
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:19,854
Dr. Shin, please enjoy.

351
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:22,215
Next time, I'll be the one to cook.

352
00:21:23,054 --> 00:21:24,084
It's not necessary.

353
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,854
By the way, I had a question to ask.

354
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:32,024
How did you get the boy to confess?

355
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,534
I tortured him in a cruel way.

356
00:21:40,304 --> 00:21:45,405
Not his body, his brain. He tortured the kid's brain.

357
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:46,875
Gosh.

358
00:21:47,344 --> 00:21:48,344
That's awesome.

359
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:51,514
Teach me so I can do it to get revenge.

360
00:21:52,985 --> 00:21:53,985
- Yi Na. - Yi Na.

361
00:21:55,254 --> 00:21:56,324
What?

362
00:21:56,754 --> 00:21:58,284
Seeing him tremble...

363
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,395
gave me such a thrill.

364
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,625
That's because your brain felt the pleasure of revenge.

365
00:22:05,064 --> 00:22:07,034
But do you still feel that way?

366
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:09,564
No.

367
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:11,865
I just feel...

368
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:13,774
so-so.

369
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:15,334
That's it.

370
00:22:15,975 --> 00:22:17,244
I said that...

371
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,974
when we get revenge, it activates our nucleus accumbens,

372
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:22,244
which gives us a thrill.

373
00:22:23,915 --> 00:22:24,915
Yes.

374
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,484
But once that dies down, the pleasure subsides...

375
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:30,425
and the good feeling deteriorates.

376
00:22:30,955 --> 00:22:33,655
You're more likely to be overcome by a negative emotion.

377
00:22:34,695 --> 00:22:36,823
If you don't get revenge in a more drastic manner,

378
00:22:36,824 --> 00:22:38,764
you can't feel the same kind of pleasure.

379
00:22:39,094 --> 00:22:40,934
It's similar to why an alcoholic...

380
00:22:40,935 --> 00:22:43,465
slowly requires and demands more alcohol.

381
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:47,735
You get addicted to getting revenge, then.

382
00:22:48,205 --> 00:22:50,875
Yes. That's why there's this saying.

383
00:22:52,074 --> 00:22:55,274
"The best revenge is to smile at loathing."

384
00:22:57,145 --> 00:22:59,084
Your living a happy life...

385
00:22:59,415 --> 00:23:01,485
will be the best revenge, okay?

386
00:23:01,685 --> 00:23:04,354
Okay. I'll live well and happily.

387
00:23:07,425 --> 00:23:08,655
So I've decided.

388
00:23:14,135 --> 00:23:15,135
I'll...

389
00:23:15,665 --> 00:23:17,165
marry you.

390
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:22,135
My gosh.

391
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:26,543
Yi Na. Don't you think there's a huge age gap?

392
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:28,145
Who cares about that?

393
00:23:28,344 --> 00:23:31,514
He's a hero. He's my superhero.

394
00:23:32,885 --> 00:23:34,254
Yes, he is,

395
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:36,583
but you don't marry a hero.

396
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:38,624
You must only be grateful.

397
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,694
Marrying a hero will give you all sorts of headaches.

398
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:43,394
He'll have no time for you.

399
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:46,493
He'll be too busy going out to serve justice.

400
00:23:46,494 --> 00:23:48,164
I can go out with him.

401
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:50,735
You don't care about justice.

402
00:23:50,935 --> 00:23:52,665
I do now.

403
00:23:53,405 --> 00:23:54,975
After what I've been through.

404
00:23:56,544 --> 00:23:59,405
When it comes to choosing a future spouse,

405
00:23:59,574 --> 00:24:01,244
his job is most important.

406
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:03,614
You're right.

407
00:24:03,615 --> 00:24:05,114
Dr. Brain's jobless.

408
00:24:05,115 --> 00:24:07,114
You might have to support him.

409
00:24:07,115 --> 00:24:08,715
Don't, honey.

410
00:24:08,985 --> 00:24:11,155
You can't say that to his face.

411
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,455
Who cares if he's jobless? I can support him.

412
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,094
Don't you worry, doctor.

413
00:24:20,935 --> 00:24:21,935
Forget it.

414
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:23,804
I'm glad you brought it up.

415
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,263
Someone caused me to get fired,

416
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,635
so I must do some job-hunting.

417
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:30,675
The party's over.

418
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:33,814
Quickly and immediately get out.

419
00:24:36,145 --> 00:24:39,984
Dr. Brain, if we offended you, we're very sorry.

420
00:24:39,985 --> 00:24:41,754
Yes. I apologize.

421
00:24:43,385 --> 00:24:46,254
The offended jobless man is at his wit's end.

422
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:48,324
Get up, everyone.

423
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:51,165
I should clean all this up.

424
00:24:52,465 --> 00:24:53,833
I have more to say.

425
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:56,864
I'm really sorry. We'll clean all this up first.

426
00:24:56,865 --> 00:24:59,164
It's fine. Leave. Get out.

427
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,174
But...

428
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:01,874
- Leave. - It won't take long.

429
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,273
I'm so sorry.

430
00:25:03,274 --> 00:25:04,404
My jacket.

431
00:25:04,405 --> 00:25:05,944
Let me put all this away.

432
00:25:05,945 --> 00:25:06,945
It's fine.

433
00:25:06,946 --> 00:25:08,514
- But... - Leave.

434
00:25:09,744 --> 00:25:10,744
My goodness.

435
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:12,544
Hey.

436
00:25:12,584 --> 00:25:14,354
Get home safely.

437
00:25:14,655 --> 00:25:16,685
We had fun, Dr. Brain. Sorry!

438
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:21,794
Dr. Brain, I left some food in the fridge. Eat that too.

439
00:25:22,195 --> 00:25:24,293
Doctor, I'll visit another time!

440
00:25:24,294 --> 00:25:26,324
As if you will. Let's go home.

441
00:25:26,665 --> 00:25:27,993
My goodness.

442
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:30,104
- What a mess. - Let's go.

443
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,544
Whose fault is it that I'm jobless?

444
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,885
They're helpless.

445
00:26:20,354 --> 00:26:22,485
Did Dr. Shin call today?

446
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:26,794
No.

447
00:26:27,354 --> 00:26:28,954
Did you not miss it?

448
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:31,195
I have his number saved on my phone.

449
00:26:33,395 --> 00:26:34,594
Hand it over.

450

(Dr. Shin Ha Ru)

451
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:13,675
- The person... - I think he blocked my number.

452
00:27:16,175 --> 00:27:18,145
He lacks the courage.

453
00:27:20,344 --> 00:27:22,744
The courage to face pain.

454
00:27:24,985 --> 00:27:26,715
So he can find the courage,

455
00:27:27,885 --> 00:27:31,625
I should send Dr. Shin a present.

456
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,655
Will you help me?

457
00:27:41,865 --> 00:27:42,865

Hello.

462
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,344
How is Yi Na doing?

463
00:27:55,145 --> 00:27:56,985
She's doing much better.

464
00:27:57,445 --> 00:27:59,385
She's back to her grumbling self.

465
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:00,985
I'm so relieved.

466
00:28:02,385 --> 00:28:03,385
That's good to know.

467
00:28:04,284 --> 00:28:06,385
You all were a huge help.

468
00:28:07,425 --> 00:28:08,425
How about...

469
00:28:10,195 --> 00:28:11,895
we get a soda?

470
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:20,834
Where is everyone?

471
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,754
Hello, Seobu's Neuroscientific Investigation Team.

472
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:37,324
Phone records?

473
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,225
Oh, yes.

474
00:28:41,794 --> 00:28:42,794
Just a moment.

475
00:28:43,365 --> 00:28:45,665
Kim Hyun Jun and An Hye Young?

476
00:28:48,094 --> 00:28:50,034
Are you sure you called the right team?

477
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:55,534
They requested Kim Hyun Jun and An Hye Young's...

478
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,175
cellphone records?

479
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:02,314
Yes, I understand.

480
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,584
I'll send over the missing documents.

481
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:07,554
Bye.

An Hye Young.

484
00:29:29,945 --> 00:29:33,104
Why did this team pull their phone records?

485
00:29:33,645 --> 00:29:34,875
It was Women and Youth's case.

486
00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:38,645
It can't be.

487
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:45,155
Hello, Dr. Brain.

488
00:29:45,725 --> 00:29:47,593
Can I ask you something?

489
00:29:47,594 --> 00:29:48,594
Yes.

490
00:29:49,195 --> 00:29:52,465
Can you ask for phone records on another team's case?

491
00:29:53,294 --> 00:29:56,333
Are you asking if we can ask a phone company to send over...

492
00:29:56,334 --> 00:29:58,435
someone's records when it's not our case?

493
00:29:58,905 --> 00:29:59,905
Exactly.

494
00:29:59,906 --> 00:30:03,204
No, of course not. That would cause a huge problem.

495
00:30:03,205 --> 00:30:04,743
Times have changed.

496
00:30:04,744 --> 00:30:06,244
We'd be penalized if we got caught.

497
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:09,074
Penalized?

498
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,284
That's forging an official document, which is bad.

499
00:30:12,615 --> 00:30:14,354
You could get into real trouble.

500
00:30:17,955 --> 00:30:20,655
If you see Detective Geum, tell him I'm in a meeting.

501
00:30:20,854 --> 00:30:21,854
Sure.

502
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:29,534
I think I have something huge on Detective Geum.

503
00:30:33,504 --> 00:30:34,504
Here.

504
00:30:40,145 --> 00:30:43,945
You were a huge help and support in Yi Na's case.

505
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:45,244
Thank you.

506
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:48,584
This isn't good enough.

507
00:30:49,284 --> 00:30:50,985
I'll buy you dinner one day.

508
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:53,225
You don't have to.

509
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:01,635
Captain Seul.

510
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,734
Do I make you feel uncomfortable?

511
00:31:05,735 --> 00:31:06,735
What?

512
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,435
Oh, no, it's fine.

513
00:31:11,344 --> 00:31:13,975
Good. I've gotten over it too.

514
00:31:14,645 --> 00:31:17,784
To me, you're the old Captain Seul.

515
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,485
You don't have to feel awkward.

516
00:31:22,885 --> 00:31:24,584
Right. Neither do you.

517
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:31,625
Excuse me.

518
00:31:35,034 --> 00:31:38,564
You can head back. I have to take care of something.

519
00:31:39,804 --> 00:31:40,834
See you.

520
00:31:57,385 --> 00:31:59,824
Come to the parking lot? Why?

521
00:31:59,955 --> 00:32:01,354
My goodness.

522
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:03,094
It's so cold!

523
00:32:05,494 --> 00:32:06,564
Hey, you scared me!

524
00:32:08,435 --> 00:32:11,705
What's going on? This feels all too familiar.

525
00:32:12,135 --> 00:32:13,235
I'm relieved to know...

526
00:32:13,675 --> 00:32:15,774
that your hippocampus is functioning well.

527
00:32:16,104 --> 00:32:19,303
We fought here. Remember?

528
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:22,645
Of course, I remember. You looked like you were about to kill me.

529
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,014
You yelled at me nonstop. How could I forget that?

530
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:26,543
Anyway, what's up?

531
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,054
At last,

532
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:31,554
I have something on you even though you always pretend to be a saint.

533
00:32:33,725 --> 00:32:36,054
Kim Hyun Jun and An Hye Young's phone records.

534
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,324
You put in that request, right?

535
00:32:38,794 --> 00:32:39,794
What?

536
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:43,604
My goodness. You actually look as if you know nothing about it.

537
00:32:43,935 --> 00:32:45,905
Your acting skills are improving by the day.

538
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:47,705
Drop the act.

539
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:49,905
The mobile carrier got in touch and said...

540
00:32:50,804 --> 00:32:52,205
they received a request to cooperate.

541
00:32:56,215 --> 00:32:58,844
I, of all people, happened to answer that call.

542
00:32:59,915 --> 00:33:02,054
Since it's not one of our cases,

543
00:33:02,215 --> 00:33:04,325
we can say that you forged the request.

544
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:11,365
That face confirms my suspicion.

545
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:14,265
You committed forgery.

546
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:19,805
Look, Dr. Brain.

547
00:33:20,604 --> 00:33:22,135
You see...

548
00:33:22,675 --> 00:33:24,345
I can explain.

549
00:33:24,704 --> 00:33:26,345
I understand you did it for Yi Na.

550
00:33:27,914 --> 00:33:29,944
I'm sure you were worried that your daughter...

551
00:33:29,945 --> 00:33:32,314
would end up with a criminal record because of the false accusation.

552
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:33,985
Yes.

553
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:37,853
That's right. So please...

554
00:33:37,854 --> 00:33:39,954
You want me to let it go because you did it for your daughter?

555
00:33:40,754 --> 00:33:43,254
I did what I did to contribute to the advancement of brain science.

556
00:33:45,164 --> 00:33:46,495
But what happened to me?

557
00:33:47,265 --> 00:33:49,765
I got kicked out of the lab to which I was completely dedicated...

558
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:51,164
and became unemployed...

559
00:33:51,305 --> 00:33:53,675
because you accused me of forgery.

560
00:33:58,345 --> 00:34:01,845
Do you now understand what it's like to feel wronged?

561
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:06,445
I've been feeling so bad for what happened in the past.

562
00:34:07,814 --> 00:34:10,724
I didn't know things would get out of hand like that.

563
00:34:11,524 --> 00:34:14,324
I said it in passing while having a drink with the reporter I know.

564
00:34:14,325 --> 00:34:15,825
Call Reporter Moon.

565
00:34:16,394 --> 00:34:18,024
I need to talk to him.

566
00:34:18,495 --> 00:34:20,024
Please.

567
00:34:20,635 --> 00:34:23,064
Don't go public with it.

568
00:34:24,334 --> 00:34:25,465
Why should I listen to you?

569
00:34:26,035 --> 00:34:27,873
The media chewed me out,

570
00:34:27,874 --> 00:34:29,504
I was humiliated at the national level.

571
00:34:31,144 --> 00:34:32,745
I'm really sorry.

572
00:34:33,474 --> 00:34:35,314
You ruined my career.

573
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,184
You're "sorry," and that's it?

574
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:41,314
Then what can I do to make you forgive me?

575
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:44,084
Oh, it happened when I was drunk.

576
00:34:44,524 --> 00:34:45,623
I'll quit drinking.

577
00:34:45,624 --> 00:34:47,925
Goodness. You're being ridiculous.

578
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,495
That will help you, not me.

579
00:34:51,164 --> 00:34:53,024
Oh, really?

580
00:34:54,265 --> 00:34:55,595
Then what do you want?

581
00:34:56,265 --> 00:34:57,905
Should I resign and leave the force?

582
00:35:06,575 --> 00:35:07,914
Good idea.

583
00:35:08,745 --> 00:35:11,484
Hey, I said that without thinking...

584
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:14,155
Show me that you can take responsibility for your own words.

585
00:35:15,184 --> 00:35:16,954
Listen, Dr. Brain.

586
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:19,155
While you're handing in your resignation,

587
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,894
think about how I must've felt when I was getting kicked out...

588
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:24,265
of the organization I had been so devoted to,

589
00:35:24,695 --> 00:35:26,495
just because of what you said without thinking.

590
00:35:45,414 --> 00:35:47,814
As they say, everyone has a little dirty laundry.

591
00:35:48,055 --> 00:35:50,584
See? He always acted like he'd never do anything wrong.

592
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:52,555
You're right.

593
00:35:52,825 --> 00:35:54,724
He's a parent after all.

594
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:57,195
But is he really going to resign?

595
00:35:58,394 --> 00:35:59,624
He won't.

596
00:36:00,495 --> 00:36:02,735
Knowing how Detective Geum is, he might actually resign.

597
00:36:04,504 --> 00:36:05,604
Let's wait and see.

598
00:36:06,334 --> 00:36:07,704
If he really quits...

599
00:36:09,274 --> 00:36:10,745
Then you'll get your revenge.

600
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:13,945
- You bet I will. - How would you feel?

601
00:36:15,075 --> 00:36:16,774
Isn't revenge always sweet?

602
00:36:24,155 --> 00:36:25,325
Why did I do that?

603
00:36:26,754 --> 00:36:29,454
What is it? Is something the matter, Dad?

604
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:31,894
Yes, just something.

605
00:36:35,365 --> 00:36:36,465
What's going on?

606
00:36:37,765 --> 00:36:38,834
Well...

607
00:36:39,604 --> 00:36:43,075
It's not something you can help me with.

608
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:45,774
Really?

609
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:49,044
Then you should ask Dr. Brain for help.

610
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,385
He's a hero, you know.

611
00:36:51,814 --> 00:36:53,515
He can solve anything and everything.

612
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,754
Hey, daughter.

613
00:36:56,354 --> 00:36:58,825
Stop talking rubbish.

614
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:00,325
Let's just eat.

615
00:37:14,035 --> 00:37:16,035
Yi Na, dip it in this.

616
00:37:21,445 --> 00:37:23,615
I should've called you in advance.

617
00:37:24,684 --> 00:37:26,914
No, we just started eating.

618
00:37:29,084 --> 00:37:31,655
Something's up with Dad though.

619
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:35,925
My gosh. I can tell from his face.

620
00:37:36,124 --> 00:37:37,664
He sure looks worried.

621
00:37:38,164 --> 00:37:40,124
What's the matter? What's bothering you?

622
00:37:40,765 --> 00:37:42,035
It's all because of you.

623
00:37:42,265 --> 00:37:43,735
Why do you keep coming over?

624
00:37:43,765 --> 00:37:45,634
People will think we're still married.

625
00:37:45,635 --> 00:37:46,934
You see, we got divorced.

626
00:37:48,104 --> 00:37:50,003
- Can divorced couples... - "Not eat jokbal together?"

627
00:37:50,004 --> 00:37:52,644
"Is it illegal?" Don't say that. Just don't.

628
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,274
Okay.

629
00:37:55,144 --> 00:37:58,084
I won't. Just eat this.

630
00:37:58,245 --> 00:37:59,285
Here.

631
00:38:01,215 --> 00:38:03,885
I don't have time to eat this with you now.

632
00:38:04,485 --> 00:38:07,724
Oh, that's right. I might have to open a jokbal place soon.

633
00:38:07,894 --> 00:38:09,454
If I do, come often to buy jokbal from me.

634
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:11,164
Eat up.

635
00:38:11,765 --> 00:38:12,765
Goodness.

636
00:38:15,834 --> 00:38:18,405
He'll sell jokbal? Why, all of a sudden?

637
00:38:19,504 --> 00:38:21,735
My gosh. Did he get fired?

638
00:38:23,474 --> 00:38:25,905
What? No way.

639
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:27,814
Darn it.

640
00:38:31,285 --> 00:38:33,314
While you're handing in your resignation,

641
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,784
think about how I must've felt when I was getting kicked out...

642
00:38:35,785 --> 00:38:38,155
of the organization I had been so devoted to,

643
00:38:38,425 --> 00:38:40,325
just because of what you said without thinking.

644
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:45,365
He wasn't joking.

645
00:38:45,765 --> 00:38:48,294
If I don't quit, he won't stay quiet.

646
00:38:50,865 --> 00:38:52,305
I can't even ask him why.

647
00:38:53,704 --> 00:38:55,535
Gosh, what a headache.

648
00:38:56,405 --> 00:38:57,845
This is driving me nuts.

649
00:39:03,615 --> 00:39:04,615
Darn it.

650
00:39:04,644 --> 00:39:05,944
(Seobu Police Station)

651
00:39:05,945 --> 00:39:06,985
"Letter of resignation?"

652
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:10,015
"Letter of resignation?" You're quitting?

653
00:39:11,024 --> 00:39:13,825
What is this? This is so random.

654
00:39:15,024 --> 00:39:18,595
There are times when you must make a random decision in life.

655
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:21,934
But why? What is your reason?

656
00:39:22,934 --> 00:39:24,004
It's just...

657
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:30,905
This is nuts.

658
00:39:37,385 --> 00:39:40,115
Why are you doing this? Are you going through a midlife crisis?

659
00:39:41,055 --> 00:39:42,115
Oh, maybe.

660
00:39:43,055 --> 00:39:44,584
Why am I suddenly tearing up?

661
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:47,394

Well, I guess...

Right here. The anterior cingulate cortex...

Are you that sure Yi Na was framed?

829
00:53:33,954 --> 00:53:35,985
If you are, pull the records yourself.

830
00:53:55,505 --> 00:53:58,715
Because it was so clear Yi Na was being framed.

831
00:54:00,045 --> 00:54:02,715
If I gave the records to the Women and Youth Division,

832
00:54:03,045 --> 00:54:04,354
that would be enough...

833
00:54:04,355 --> 00:54:06,715
to stop them from transferring her to the prosecutors.

834
00:54:09,485 --> 00:54:11,655
Did that get you in trouble?

835
00:54:13,255 --> 00:54:15,425
Did Dr. Brain catch on?

836
00:54:21,105 --> 00:54:22,764
Now that I'm in his shoes,

837
00:54:23,664 --> 00:54:25,775
I kind of understand...

838
00:54:27,204 --> 00:54:28,775
how he must've felt.

839
00:54:31,675 --> 00:54:33,743
Then let me take responsibility.

840
00:54:33,744 --> 00:54:35,215
Let me be disciplined.

841
00:54:36,145 --> 00:54:37,284
No.

842
00:54:37,684 --> 00:54:40,315
You fought so hard for Yi Na.

843
00:54:41,184 --> 00:54:43,925
I can't let you be disciplined too.

844
00:54:44,295 --> 00:54:46,155
I'm the one in the wrong.

845
00:54:46,295 --> 00:54:47,525
Please don't.

846
00:54:48,695 --> 00:54:50,525
Let's keep it a secret and move on.

847
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:11,684
Was that why I felt so oddly bothered?

848

00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:34,445
I should ask you that. Why are you here?

853
00:55:35,704 --> 00:55:37,405
I was passing by.

854
00:55:38,514 --> 00:55:39,875
So why did you stop?

855
00:55:41,085 --> 00:55:42,484
And stare up at my place?

856
00:55:42,485 --> 00:55:43,715
I did not stare.

857
00:55:44,014 --> 00:55:46,985
I parked the car to look for something.

858

Were you worried about me?

859

Don't even say something you can't handle.

860

Talk nonsense to someone who'll put up with it. Bye.

861
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:58,834
Why not come in for a drink?

862
00:55:58,835 --> 00:56:01,304
No, thanks. I didn't mean to stop. Bye.

Wasn't he?

He was.

I just can't decipher him.
