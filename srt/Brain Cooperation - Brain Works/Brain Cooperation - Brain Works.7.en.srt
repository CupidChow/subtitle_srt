- Captain Seul!

163
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,720
- She's so cool!
- Captain Seul!

164
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,769
She just wanted a drink. My goodness.

165
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,779
Hello. Captain Seul, right?

166
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,580
Yes, that's right.

167
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,019
Ms. Surrogate Drinker.

168
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,320
What is your name?

169
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,779
Why do you want to know my name?

170
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,178
You're my husband's boss. That's why.

171
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:19,970
As you know, I am
Detective Geum Myung Se's ex-wife.

172
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,070
Yes, I'm Seul So Jeong.

(Ladies)

174
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:29,309
Don't you think it's inappropriate
to call your ex-husband so fondly?

175
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,809
I can address him however I want.

176
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,899
I know that you're his boss,

177
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,009
but it's none of your business!

178
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,668
I mean, it's none of your business.

179
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,049
Oh.

180
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,490
- Right here.
- My gosh.

181
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,679
I see that you have a head.

182
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,159
I need to fix my hair...

183
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,710
Take some time to think about why...

184
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,929
I'm meddling in your business.

185
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,350
- Move.
- What? Come again?

186
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,500
My goodness. What did she say?

187
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,909
She practically declared war on me.

188
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,710
My gosh.

189
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,159
- Are you really all right?
- Yes, of course.

190
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,330
- I'm fine.
- Your ears are beet red.

191
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,029
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- It's fine.

192
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:09,269
Are you sure? Okay, then cheers!

193
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,240
- Cheers!
- Bottoms up!

194
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,850
- Gosh.
- This is nice.

195
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,059
Guys.

196
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:19,080
Where is the man of the hour?

197
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,330
Well... Oh, where did he go?

198
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,929
I don't know. Let's drink. Drink more!

199
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,299
Hey, you're here.

200
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,298
What is this? You called me here
at this late hour,

201
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:43,679
but you're dozing off.

202
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:49,639
Why don't you just go home and sleep
if you're drunk?

203
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:51,519
I need to talk to you.

204
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:53,308
Hey, Dr. Brain.

205
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:56,019
That thing earlier...
It was you, wasn't it?

206
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,559
Why ask? You already know the answer.

207
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,788
Why did you do that?

208
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:02,558
I warned you...

209
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,128
that I would chew you to pieces.

210
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:07,710
Then go ahead and chew me to pieces!

211
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,480
Don't pull such underhanded antics on me.

212
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,200
Thank goodness Sung Mi showed up.

213
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,549
If she hadn't, I would've been
humiliated and ostracized!

214
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:18,569
That was exactly what I wanted.
Too bad she showed up.

215
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,539
You little...

216
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,720
Go ahead and punch me
if you can handle the consequences.

217
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,600
I told you not to do things
that you can't handle.

218
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:36,669
Fine. Clearly, you're harboring
a lot of resentment against me.

219
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,009
Let's fight man to man
and put an end to this, you jerk.

220
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,309
We're in agreement for once.

221
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,038
Wait, stop!

222
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,419
Hold on.

223
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,479
Hey.

224
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,090
Wait right here.

225
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,659
My goodness.

226
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:39,548
You said we should put an end to this!

227
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:41,700
Yes! So wait right there.

228
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,758
Gosh.

229
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,789
- My gosh.
- That little... What's he doing?

230
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:49,659
Gosh, you dropped these big ones.

231
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:51,740
Here. Oh, boy.

232
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,999
Here. My goodness.

233
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,740
Women shouldn't be walking around
alone at this late hour.

234
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,940
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

235
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,879
It's fine. I got this.

236
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,539
No, it's not fine!

237
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:06,008
I can tell that you have bad knees.

238
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:08,548
Let's go. Lead the way.

239
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:10,529
I'll push the cart from behind.

240
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,929
Okay, let's go!

241
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,039
I'll be back in a minute.
Wait right there!

242
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,970
What the...

243
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,990

Get out.

Eat up.

Playing a song by N.Flying.

You can do stuff like this?

My, what an amazing world
we're living in these days.

I can sing karaoke
and watch movies with her too.

300

You can do all sorts of things.

301
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,429
Come on. Don't be such a boomer.

302
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,530
I am a boomer.

303
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,630
This boomer has a question for you.

304
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:46,588
What time did your dad
get home last night?

305
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:47,689
No idea.

306
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,810
I went to bed at 2 a.m.
He wasn't home until then.

307
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,679
He didn't come home until 2 a.m.?
That fool...

308
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,940
- But...
- Yes.

309
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,679
he looked like he got into a fight.

310
00:18:58,769 --> 00:18:59,808
What?

311
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:01,339
I checked his clothes.

312
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:03,939
They were all stretched out and soiled.

313
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,320
No joke.

314
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,830
Really?

315
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:11,199
Then he wasn't with a woman.

316
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,999
Good morning! I prepared
a delicious breakfast for you.

317
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,159
Don't you think this is too much?

318
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,328
Well...

319
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:25,479
I'm trying to be nice to my best friend.

320
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,249
Even the ghost of a best friend
would find this extreme.

321
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,039
Daughter, have a good day in school.

322
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,068

the possibility of them running away.

She'll be hurling for sure.

I don't want to talk to you, so...

A virtual human hurt his wife?

And his wife is missing?

405

At home.

407
00:24:11,903 --> 00:24:14,123
He said that it was in human form.

408
00:24:15,173 --> 00:24:18,781
Then go to his house
and meet Cherri in person.

You always accompany me
when I'm out in the field,

414

but now you're staying back.

415
00:24:32,062 --> 00:24:34,412
Why is that? Are you upset about
what happened yesterday?

416

Let's not be petty about this.

get into physical altercations...

He's moping for sure.

It's that detective who interests me more.

424
00:25:04,092 --> 00:25:06,403
The man hasn't done
a bad deed in his life.

But I haven't been digging that much.

That's enough.

I agree that he inconvenienced you,

00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:44,422
No.

486
00:29:54,983 --> 00:29:57,962
She isn't Kim Jae Sook.
That's not my wife.

487
00:29:58,822 --> 00:30:00,452
That is Cherri.

488
00:30:00,453 --> 00:30:02,702
She did something to my wife...

489
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,362
and is pretending to be her.

490
00:30:04,362 --> 00:30:05,742
What?

491
00:30:10,663 --> 00:30:13,482
Can you open your eyes?

492
00:30:13,733 --> 00:30:15,113
I'm a police officer.

493
00:30:15,503 --> 00:30:17,153
Are you Kim Jae Sook?

494
00:30:17,473 --> 00:30:19,522
Yes, I am.

495
00:30:20,213 --> 00:30:22,853
My husband hit me.

496
00:30:25,312 --> 00:30:27,363
He tried to kill me.

497
00:30:28,153 --> 00:30:30,183
That's because
you pretended to be my wife!

498
00:30:30,183 --> 00:30:31,932
Where's my wife?

499
00:30:35,023 --> 00:30:39,223
Heo Bum Soo, you're under arrest
for domestic violence.

500
00:30:39,223 --> 00:30:40,462
No.

501
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,962
No, that woman's not my wife!

502
00:30:42,963 --> 00:30:45,131
That's not my wife!

503
00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:46,601
She's not my wife!

504
00:30:46,602 --> 00:30:49,371
What woman isn't my wife!

505
00:30:49,372 --> 00:30:51,703
Heo Bum Soo, aged 45.

506
00:30:51,703 --> 00:30:53,772
He works at a trading company
as a manager.

507
00:30:53,773 --> 00:30:55,243
He has a wife...

508
00:30:55,243 --> 00:30:57,782
and a teenage daughter
who stays at her school dorm.

509
00:30:57,782 --> 00:30:59,111
He has no record...

510
00:30:59,112 --> 00:31:01,682
and no domestic violence reports.

511
00:31:01,683 --> 00:31:04,702
The victim, his wife,
was taken to a hospital.

512
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:08,033
He insists his wife is Cherri
the virtual human?

513
00:31:08,223 --> 00:31:09,672
Is he on something?

514
00:31:10,052 --> 00:31:12,122
His urine sample came back negative.

515
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:14,373
We're waiting on the blood test results.

516
00:31:15,092 --> 00:31:17,143
It looks like some kind of illness.

517
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,383
(Neuroscientific Investigation Team)

518
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:24,041
Dr. Brain, you're back.

519
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:25,173
Welcome.

520
00:31:25,173 --> 00:31:27,012
It is an illness.

521
00:31:27,013 --> 00:31:28,612
(Heo Bum Soo, 45)

522
00:31:28,612 --> 00:31:30,323
I was briefed.

523
00:31:30,382 --> 00:31:33,823
Let's find out if he really is ill.

524
00:31:41,392 --> 00:31:44,742
She imitated my wife so perfectly.

525
00:31:45,423 --> 00:31:47,442
She sometimes feels like her.

526
00:31:54,102 --> 00:31:55,583
How interesting.

527
00:31:57,503 --> 00:32:00,083
I see the brain scientist gets it.

528
00:32:00,642 --> 00:32:02,492
You believe me.

529
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:05,762
We'll see if I do
after a few more questions.

530
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:07,932
So,

531
00:32:08,753 --> 00:32:11,133
why did you assault Cherri?

532
00:32:11,822 --> 00:32:13,202
Well...

533
00:32:14,653 --> 00:32:16,772
I asked what she'd done to my wife.

534
00:32:17,663 --> 00:32:20,373
Then I lost my temper.

535
00:32:21,663 --> 00:32:24,532
Why had you hidden her before I got there?

536
00:32:24,532 --> 00:32:26,632
If she were evil,
you should've asked me to take her.

537
00:32:26,632 --> 00:32:28,153
I did that because...

538
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,952
I was afraid you'd notice I'd hit her.

539
00:32:32,102 --> 00:32:34,692
There's no other reason.

540
00:32:36,612 --> 00:32:38,893
You're suddenly touching your ear...

541
00:32:39,812 --> 00:32:41,533
and your nose.

542
00:32:42,653 --> 00:32:45,863
Yes, well, they suddenly started to itch.

543
00:32:46,622 --> 00:32:48,073
Let me tell you...

544
00:32:48,653 --> 00:32:50,033
why they itch.

545
00:32:50,963 --> 00:32:53,343
It's because you're lying.

546
00:32:54,463 --> 00:32:57,432
A human feels uneasy when they lie.

547
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,032
To shake the feeling...

548
00:32:59,032 --> 00:33:02,113
they send more blood to important organs.

549
00:33:02,302 --> 00:33:05,772
The blood leaves external features
such as the ear and nose,

550
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:08,752
stimulating them,
causing an itchy sensation.

551
00:33:09,312 --> 00:33:10,692
Before you know it...

552
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:13,992
you're doing this.

553
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:17,012
Pinocchio's nose grows when he lies.

554
00:33:17,013 --> 00:33:18,633
There's a reason for that.

555
00:33:19,683 --> 00:33:22,932
What are you saying I'm lying about?

556
00:33:23,453 --> 00:33:24,843
I don't know.

557
00:33:24,862 --> 00:33:28,712
But I wonder if you hit Cherri
for another reason.

558
00:33:33,233 --> 00:33:34,752
Because he likes her.

559
00:33:37,973 --> 00:33:41,022
Your husband likes Cherri?

560
00:33:41,372 --> 00:33:42,641
Yes.

561
00:33:42,642 --> 00:33:46,182
My husband's having an affair
with that virtual human thing.

562
00:33:46,183 --> 00:33:48,713
Okay... So you're aware that,

563
00:33:48,713 --> 00:33:52,462
for some reason,
your husband thinks you're Cherri?

564
00:33:53,122 --> 00:33:54,391
Yes.

565
00:33:54,392 --> 00:33:56,502
He fell in love with me,

566
00:33:56,653 --> 00:33:59,502
but he thinks I'm Cherri.

567
00:34:01,892 --> 00:34:03,373
I don't know why,

568
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:06,482
but my heart pounds...

569
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:08,353
and my body reacts when I see her.

570
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:10,853
Pay more attention to Ji Woo.

571
00:34:10,943 --> 00:34:12,323
Okay?

572
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:13,811
Okay?

573
00:34:13,812 --> 00:34:15,223
She's a teenager.

574
00:34:29,323 --> 00:34:31,272
Feeling like that again...

575
00:34:31,492 --> 00:34:33,872
made me feel young, and I liked it.

576
00:34:34,863 --> 00:34:36,872
I knew it was wrong.

577
00:34:37,832 --> 00:34:40,582
She's an evil woman
who kicked my wife out.

578
00:34:41,303 --> 00:34:43,513
But I loved sleeping with her.

579
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:46,082
I kept the affair going.

580
00:34:46,372 --> 00:34:49,292
How is it an affair if it's your wife?

581
00:34:52,412 --> 00:34:56,033
Cherri keeps making you
cheat on your wife.

582
00:34:56,412 --> 00:34:58,533
You must have a love-hate relationship.

583
00:35:00,452 --> 00:35:01,832
"Love-hate?"

584
00:35:07,432 --> 00:35:08,843
I guess so?

585
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,312
Is that why you hit her?

586
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:14,673
Cherri suddenly said...

587
00:35:14,673 --> 00:35:17,352
she'd tell my wife about our affair.

588
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:19,903
I'll tell your wife about us.

589
00:35:19,903 --> 00:35:21,312
No, you can't, Cherri.

590
00:35:21,312 --> 00:35:22,692
Let go.

591
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:52,183
I can't let my wife find out.
That would be disastrous.

592
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:54,622
Will you...

593
00:35:55,113 --> 00:35:56,493
keep my secret?

594
00:35:56,943 --> 00:35:59,122
When he first called me Cherri,

595
00:35:59,613 --> 00:36:01,562
I thought it was a prank.

596
00:36:02,213 --> 00:36:03,593
But...

597
00:36:21,733 --> 00:36:24,541
He suddenly wanted a sexual relationship.

598
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:26,823
He was like a completely different man.

599
00:36:28,142 --> 00:36:31,192
We haven't done it in years.

600
00:36:32,142 --> 00:36:34,192
I wondered what had gotten into him,

601
00:36:34,352 --> 00:36:37,232
if his love for me suddenly got rekindled.

602
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:41,433
To be honest, it was exciting,

603
00:36:41,622 --> 00:36:45,303
but then I realized it was because
he thought I was someone else.

604
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:50,312
I was flabbergasted and just shocked.

605
00:36:50,702 --> 00:36:54,883
I'm not really sure how to describe
this disgusting feeling.

606
00:36:55,773 --> 00:36:57,752
I got so angry today...

607
00:36:57,943 --> 00:37:00,053
that I said I'd tell his wife.

608
00:37:00,102 --> 00:37:02,993
He said I couldn't and hit me.

609
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:07,062
He's afraid I'll find out, I guess.

610
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:12,002
What's the matter with him?

611
00:37:12,082 --> 00:37:13,933
It's called Capgras syndrome.

612
00:37:14,122 --> 00:37:16,923
They think a family member
or a close friend...

613
00:37:16,923 --> 00:37:18,823
is replaced by...

614
00:37:18,823 --> 00:37:21,362
an identical-looking alien or fraud.

615
00:37:21,363 --> 00:37:23,272
Yes. I read about it.

616
00:37:23,463 --> 00:37:25,331
I don't get along with books.

617
00:37:25,332 --> 00:37:26,712
I never heard of it.

618
00:37:29,233 --> 00:37:30,953
Our brain...

619
00:37:31,242 --> 00:37:34,442
uses different parts
to process different stimuli.

620
00:37:34,443 --> 00:37:36,443
The part that recognizes faces...

621
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:38,823
is the fusiform area
below the temporal lobe.

622
00:37:38,943 --> 00:37:41,763
The part that processes emotions
regarding that person...

623
00:37:41,783 --> 00:37:43,433
is the limbic system.

624
00:37:44,082 --> 00:37:47,822
These two parts are connected by synapses.

625
00:37:47,823 --> 00:37:50,892
That's why we feel uncomfortable
when we see someone we dislike,

626
00:37:50,892 --> 00:37:53,573
and we feel good
when we see someone we like.

627
00:37:53,892 --> 00:37:57,292
If, for some reason, the part
that recognizes faces...

628
00:37:57,292 --> 00:38:01,183
and the part that processes emotions
about that person detach,

629
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:03,783
we get someone like Heo Bum Soo.

630
00:38:05,472 --> 00:38:07,892
He looks at the face
and knows it's his wife.

631
00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:11,712
But recognition isn't attached to emotion,

632
00:38:11,713 --> 00:38:14,011
so she doesn't feel friendly.

633
00:38:14,012 --> 00:38:17,062
He sees his wife, but she
feels like a complete stranger.

634
00:38:18,553 --> 00:38:22,851
To process this confusing situation
the brain creates stories.

635
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:26,023
"I think this woman is my wife,
but I have no feelings for her."

636
00:38:26,023 --> 00:38:27,331
"This is odd."

637
00:38:27,332 --> 00:38:30,233
"Then this person must be a fake
who stole..."

638
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:32,383
"my wife's face and body."
That's what happens.

639
00:38:32,803 --> 00:38:34,243
My gosh.

640
00:38:34,332 --> 00:38:37,272
Your brain can make up stories like that?

641
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,482
The brain is an excellent storyteller.

642
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:43,392
But why Cherri?

643
00:38:43,642 --> 00:38:46,323
Why not an alien or some kind of animal?

644
00:38:46,343 --> 00:38:49,433
There must be a reason.
We'll look into it and find out.

645
00:38:50,253 --> 00:38:54,602
Then let's find out if it really is Cap...

646
00:38:55,193 --> 00:38:58,272
I mean, let's find out
if Capgras syndrome is what he has.

647
00:38:58,923 --> 00:39:01,942
We can do a simple test here and find out.

648
00:39:02,262 --> 00:39:03,672
That's right.

649
00:39:11,273 --> 00:39:15,122
We can use a lie detector to find
out whether it's Capgras syndrome?

650
00:39:15,472 --> 00:39:18,082
When people see their parents,

651
00:39:18,082 --> 00:39:19,681
they sweat a little,

652
00:39:19,682 --> 00:39:21,253
and their electrodermal activity
dynamics exhibit changes,

653
00:39:21,253 --> 00:39:24,363
but that's not the case for those
suffering from Capgras syndrome.

654
00:39:24,582 --> 00:39:27,033
It's because they don't feel anything.

655
00:39:42,602 --> 00:39:45,482
My gosh. It really isn't changing at all.

656
00:39:50,073 --> 00:39:52,912
It is highly likely
that he is suffering...

657
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:54,712
from Capgras syndrome.

658
00:39:54,713 --> 00:39:57,232
He shouldn't be kept here.

659
00:39:57,753 --> 00:39:59,203
He should be hospitalized.

660
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:07,832
The cerebral aneurysm here...

661
00:40:07,832 --> 00:40:10,642
probably caused Capgras syndrome.

662
00:40:11,303 --> 00:40:13,702
It can happen when an external
injury causes damage...

663
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,133
to the blood vessel wall.

664
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:16,502
Do you know if your husband...

665
00:40:16,503 --> 00:40:19,422
hit his head hard somewhere recently?

666
00:40:19,803 --> 00:40:21,011
Yes, he did.

667
00:40:21,012 --> 00:40:24,122
He recently fell off his bike
and hit his head.

668
00:40:24,613 --> 00:40:26,392
But he said he was okay.

669
00:40:26,412 --> 00:40:29,033
It's very likely that
it was what caused this.

670
00:40:29,582 --> 00:40:32,082
First, we'll perform a clip ligation...

671
00:40:32,082 --> 00:40:34,222
to prevent the vessel
from rupturing. Then...

673
00:40:38,222 --> 00:40:40,073
It'll take a while.

674
00:40:40,162 --> 00:40:41,872
It's an extremely rare condition.

675
00:40:43,432 --> 00:40:45,442
Do something nice while you wait.

676
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:47,266
Something nice?

677
00:40:48,418 --> 00:40:50,668
Gosh, seriously.

678
00:40:53,388 --> 00:40:55,727
Are you wearing any kind of metal?

679
00:40:55,728 --> 00:40:57,807
No, I already told you.

680
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:00,597
Something's very fishy here.

681
00:41:00,598 --> 00:41:03,196
You said you were studying
psychopaths' brains.

682
00:41:03,197 --> 00:41:05,837
I am not a psychopath.

683
00:41:05,837 --> 00:41:08,987
It doesn't mean I only need
to look at psychopaths' brains.

684
00:41:09,138 --> 00:41:12,018
I need a control group
that consists of normal brains.

685
00:41:12,578 --> 00:41:14,207
You're doing a good deed.

You're contributing to the advancement...

of Korean neuroscience.

688

Gosh, I've heard that line before.

689
00:41:26,228 --> 00:41:29,577
This is making me nervous. Goodness.

690
00:41:32,797 --> 00:41:35,617
All right. Let's get started.

691
00:41:49,978 --> 00:41:52,228
How is your brain wired?

692
00:41:56,817 --> 00:41:58,187
Hey.

693
00:41:58,188 --> 00:42:01,227
Are there problems with my brain?

694
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:04,208
The way you behave makes me think
there would be tons of problems.

695
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:05,896
But we shall see.

696
00:42:05,897 --> 00:42:08,168
Don't give me that again.
You're making me anxious.

697
00:42:08,168 --> 00:42:10,818
Then be anxious. I'm off.

698
00:42:11,397 --> 00:42:12,818
Hey, where are you going?

699

Why should I go with you?

701
00:42:18,138 --> 00:42:21,188
I did you a favor,
so you have to come with me.

702
00:42:22,047 --> 00:42:23,747
Let go, will you?

703
00:42:23,748 --> 00:42:25,486
Come on. Let me hold your arm.

704
00:42:25,487 --> 00:42:27,748
I was in that thing for a while,
so I feel light-headed now.

705
00:42:27,748 --> 00:42:29,788
Are you trying to sound cute?
That made me cringe.

706
00:42:29,788 --> 00:42:32,407
- Oh, come on.
- Gosh.

Thank you.

710

You're submitting this,

- Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

00:42:49,578 --> 00:42:52,927
You must have a lot on your mind,
but I made you sign this.

714

But you see, this is my job.
Please understand.

715
00:42:58,317 --> 00:43:00,117
You must be devastated.

716
00:43:00,118 --> 00:43:02,268
I had no idea
such an absurd disorder existed.

717
00:43:02,558 --> 00:43:05,338
Gosh, I don't know what to say
to comfort you.

718
00:43:07,228 --> 00:43:10,208
I can comfort you.

719
00:43:15,638 --> 00:43:17,637
Those suffering from Capgras syndrome...

720
00:43:17,638 --> 00:43:20,667
never confuse strangers with someone else.

721
00:43:20,668 --> 00:43:23,208
They only react like that with people...

722
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:24,887
who they have strong feelings for.

723
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:27,107
The fact that your husband
mistook you for Cherri...

724
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:29,827
means that he has strong feelings for you.

725
00:43:30,348 --> 00:43:33,986
My gosh. He must love you very much.

726
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:36,657
Oh, come to think of it...

727
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:39,007
He only calls me Cherri.

728
00:43:39,927 --> 00:43:43,277
But if he loved me that much,

729
00:43:44,527 --> 00:43:48,648
why was he closer to Cherri?

730
00:43:49,098 --> 00:43:52,336
I suggest you consult
a marriage counselor.

731
00:43:52,337 --> 00:43:53,717
Hey.

732
00:43:53,808 --> 00:43:56,788
His condition is to blame.

733
00:43:56,938 --> 00:44:00,527
But not everyone with the disorder
behaves like that.

734
00:44:02,118 --> 00:44:05,327
I thought he had no interest
in such things.

735
00:44:06,188 --> 00:44:09,237
Sorry, that's not the point.

736
00:44:09,717 --> 00:44:13,108
I want to know how he really feels.

737
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:15,407
I'm so frustrated.

738
00:44:16,027 --> 00:44:17,938
Why are you curious about that?

739
00:44:19,467 --> 00:44:23,018
You should respect your spouse's privacy.

740
00:44:24,368 --> 00:44:27,648
You're not married, right?

741
00:44:29,908 --> 00:44:31,418
Marriage...

742
00:44:31,478 --> 00:44:33,047
shackles your rights
and responsibilities...

743
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:35,288
under the pretense of love.

744
00:44:35,447 --> 00:44:37,057
So why should I get married?

745
00:44:40,918 --> 00:44:42,586
You're still young.

746
00:44:42,587 --> 00:44:46,307
When you get married,
you'll understand how I feel.

747
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:48,998
This guy will never get married.

748
00:44:48,998 --> 00:44:50,577
Drop it, you two.

749
00:44:51,658 --> 00:44:54,296
I don't want to get married, ever.

750
00:44:54,297 --> 00:44:57,548
But there's a way to find out
how your husband really feels.

751
00:45:00,808 --> 00:45:04,387
Should I tell you or not?

752
00:45:08,007 --> 00:45:09,827
Please tell me.

753
00:45:10,817 --> 00:45:12,257
It's very simple.

754
00:45:12,817 --> 00:45:16,237
Before his surgery,
pretend you're Cherri and ask him.

755
00:45:31,168 --> 00:45:32,588
Okay.

756
00:45:32,607 --> 00:45:36,077
I won't tell your wife
about our relationship.

757
00:45:36,078 --> 00:45:37,487
You have my word.

758
00:45:39,877 --> 00:45:42,188
- Really?
- Of course.

759
00:45:42,777 --> 00:45:45,597
I'll never do
what you don't want me to do.

760
00:45:48,857 --> 00:45:51,388
Thanks, Cherri.
I'm really sorry I hit you.

761
00:45:51,388 --> 00:45:54,407
I just got so flustered
when you said you'd tell her.

762
00:45:56,127 --> 00:45:59,447
But I want to ask you something.

763
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:02,478
Answer honestly.

764
00:46:04,397 --> 00:46:06,288
You want me,

765
00:46:07,438 --> 00:46:10,788
but not your wife. Why is that?

766
00:46:15,418 --> 00:46:18,217
Oh, that's because...

767
00:46:18,217 --> 00:46:20,128
I want your honest answer.

768
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,608
Ever since that day...

769
00:46:38,268 --> 00:46:42,418
Ji Woo isn't home. This is nice!

770
00:46:43,078 --> 00:46:44,518
Come here.

771
00:46:44,938 --> 00:46:46,987
You know,
they raised the interest rate again.

772
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:48,708
If we take the interest
and taxes into account,

773
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:50,176
we're practically paying rent every month.

774
00:46:50,177 --> 00:46:52,597
Should we just sell this place
and rent an apartment?

775
00:47:01,888 --> 00:47:04,677
That moment, I felt so humiliated.

776
00:47:05,728 --> 00:47:07,527
Even after that, whenever
I tried to do anything romantic,

777
00:47:07,527 --> 00:47:09,947
she talked about money or Ji Woo.

778
00:47:12,808 --> 00:47:14,347
Of course, I know that...

779
00:47:14,768 --> 00:47:17,657
she has to teach those young brats
and that her job is stressful.

780
00:47:17,938 --> 00:47:21,128
She's always exhausted.
Asking her to love me...

781
00:47:23,147 --> 00:47:25,427
I was ashamed of how shameless I sounded.

782
00:47:28,748 --> 00:47:31,798
Not wanting a sexual relationship
means no humiliation,

783
00:47:32,288 --> 00:47:33,838
so it was easier that way.

784
00:47:33,888 --> 00:47:36,637
Because apart from that,
our marriage is solid.

785
00:47:38,558 --> 00:47:39,947
However,

786
00:47:42,438 --> 00:47:43,818
I was lonely.

787
00:47:51,777 --> 00:47:53,407
A daily getaway.

788
00:47:53,408 --> 00:47:54,987
Do you want to join me?

789
00:48:03,987 --> 00:48:05,487
Rather than my wife...

790
00:48:05,487 --> 00:48:07,137
who came home late after teaching kids,

791
00:48:07,987 --> 00:48:10,338
I got to see you more.

792
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,367
Can you imagine how hard it is?

793
00:48:14,368 --> 00:48:17,018
There was no one
to have a heart-to-heart with.

794
00:48:17,668 --> 00:48:20,067
That's something you can consider.

795
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:21,107
I guess you're right.

796
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:24,208
Dooly wanders around
searching for his mom.

797
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:26,088
- That's right.
- It must be lonely.

798
00:48:26,507 --> 00:48:30,057
Mr. Bum Soo, how are you feeling today?

799
00:48:30,217 --> 00:48:31,597
Then one day,

800
00:48:33,188 --> 00:48:35,168
you stroke up a conversation.

801
00:48:35,418 --> 00:48:36,798
Me?

802
00:48:46,027 --> 00:48:47,548
I'm lonely, I guess.

803
00:48:47,897 --> 00:48:49,447
Are you lonely?

804
00:48:50,098 --> 00:48:51,818
I'm lonely too.

805
00:48:52,938 --> 00:48:54,318
That day,

806
00:48:54,868 --> 00:48:57,157
your unexpected words...

807
00:48:58,578 --> 00:49:00,188
comforted me.

808
00:49:10,018 --> 00:49:11,658
Ever since then, you became my friend.

809
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:13,627
I sang karaoke with you and talked to you.

810
00:49:13,627 --> 00:49:15,728
Remember how I said
I wanted you to be real?

811
00:49:15,728 --> 00:49:17,458
Then you appeared before me.

812
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:20,007
Do you have any idea
how happy I was to see you?

813
00:49:21,467 --> 00:49:24,648
You fired up my heart
that had been going cold.

814
00:49:25,768 --> 00:49:27,217
Thank you, Cherri.

815
00:49:29,277 --> 00:49:32,177
Do you love me?

816
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,728
Of course.

817
00:49:36,377 --> 00:49:37,757
Then,

818
00:49:38,647 --> 00:49:40,097
what about your wife?

819
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:44,668
Right. I love her as well.

820
00:49:44,817 --> 00:49:47,407
It's different, but I love her too.

821
00:49:48,658 --> 00:49:51,407
What if you had to choose between us?

822
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:54,447
Who do you love more?

823
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:37,617
My wife.

824
00:50:41,277 --> 00:50:42,998
She's my everything.

825
00:50:45,578 --> 00:50:47,068
I'm sorry, Cherri.

You came back.

832

I'm glad.

833
00:51:33,197 --> 00:51:35,007
I missed you.

834
00:51:38,397 --> 00:51:40,117
I want to see you.

Your surgery went well.

Honey.

839
00:51:59,688 --> 00:52:01,708
You came back.

Do you recognize me?

Thank goodness.

842
00:52:21,478 --> 00:52:24,298
There's no need to be anxious.
Cherri's gone.

843
00:52:24,717 --> 00:52:28,128
You briefly came down
with an odd physical condition.

844
00:52:36,257 --> 00:52:37,677
Hello, Detective.

845
00:52:38,297 --> 00:52:40,828
Yes, the surgery went well.

846
00:52:40,828 --> 00:52:42,538
Unbelievable.

847
00:52:42,538 --> 00:52:46,318
Some uncanny illness
rekindled your romance.

848
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:51,117
I'm glad to hear that.
Have a good day, then.

849
00:52:51,237 --> 00:52:52,887
Gosh.

850
00:52:53,047 --> 00:52:57,498
She asked whether it was her
or Cherri he loved more.

851
00:52:57,777 --> 00:52:59,827
He chose his wife.

852
00:53:00,217 --> 00:53:03,117
The man is a romantic.

853
00:53:03,118 --> 00:53:05,068
Romantic, my foot.

854
00:53:07,788 --> 00:53:09,158
How can someone who loves his wife...

855
00:53:09,158 --> 00:53:11,507
develop feelings for another woman?

856
00:53:11,757 --> 00:53:13,148
It's possible.

857
00:53:13,897 --> 00:53:15,608
Our brains...

858
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:19,987
developed three different systems
in order to find our partners.

859
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:22,588
Our sexual desires
help us search for the one.

860
00:53:24,438 --> 00:53:28,057
Our romantic desires let us fixate
on a monogamous relationship.

861
00:53:31,748 --> 00:53:33,018
And attachment is formed...

862
00:53:33,018 --> 00:53:35,197
because we wish
for long-term relationships.

863
00:53:35,717 --> 00:53:37,418
Thanks to these three systems,

864
00:53:37,418 --> 00:53:40,027
humans fall in love, mate,

865
00:53:40,027 --> 00:53:42,338
and pass on their DNA
to the next generation.

866
00:53:43,498 --> 00:53:46,327
The problem occurs
when these three systems...

867
00:53:46,328 --> 00:53:49,268
aren't linked to the same person.

868
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:50,947
They can be separate.

869
00:53:52,607 --> 00:53:54,908
You can be in love with someone...

870
00:53:54,908 --> 00:53:56,807
while being deeply attached to another.

871
00:53:56,808 --> 00:54:00,188
You can feel lust
toward a stranger as well.

872
00:54:00,748 --> 00:54:03,376
Sexual desires,
romantic desires, and attachments...

873
00:54:03,377 --> 00:54:05,377
can be felt toward different people.

874
00:54:05,377 --> 00:54:09,768
I see. No wonder
my ex-wife acted that way.

875
00:54:10,487 --> 00:54:13,208
Dr. Brain, your explanation
cleared things up...

876
00:54:13,427 --> 00:54:15,208
although I still can't forgive her.

877
00:54:17,598 --> 00:54:19,467
Detective Geum, you'll find someone nice.

878
00:54:19,467 --> 00:54:21,026
Forget it.

879
00:54:21,027 --> 00:54:23,818
I'm done wanting to fall in love.

880
00:54:24,567 --> 00:54:26,308
It's as if I died in combat...

881
00:54:26,308 --> 00:54:28,767
after being at war
on the battlefield of love.

882
00:54:28,768 --> 00:54:30,617
Maybe in a different life.

883
00:54:32,038 --> 00:54:36,257
Dr. Brain, has the love system
ever been activated for you?

884
00:54:39,248 --> 00:54:40,946
I'm asking if you've been in love.

885
00:54:40,947 --> 00:54:43,317
I have more experience than you,
so mind your own business.

886
00:54:43,317 --> 00:54:44,657
You're lying.

887
00:54:44,658 --> 00:54:46,328
Why would I lie?

888
00:54:46,328 --> 00:54:48,268
It's obvious that you're lying.

889
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:52,566
You may be able to see what's in here,

890
00:54:52,567 --> 00:54:55,577
but I can read these.

891
00:54:55,768 --> 00:54:58,018
The eyes show if you've been in love.

892
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:01,818
It's not the case for you.

893
00:55:12,447 --> 00:55:14,768
The eyes show if you've been in love.

894
00:55:15,317 --> 00:55:16,998
It's not the case for you.

895
00:55:18,317 --> 00:55:19,708
Such nonsense.

896
00:55:20,987 --> 00:55:22,367
Right.

897
00:55:29,837 --> 00:55:31,196
Hey, Ha Ru.

898
00:55:31,197 --> 00:55:33,887
Do you have Detective Geum's MRI images?

899
00:55:34,007 --> 00:55:35,606
I do.

900
00:55:35,607 --> 00:55:37,157
We'll watch it together at home.

901

Tell him we should grab a bite soon.

you two should grab a bite soon.

Sure, I'll see you later.

904
00:55:45,348 --> 00:55:46,728
He heard you.

905
00:55:47,618 --> 00:55:49,817
Is he still busy solving police cases?

906
00:55:49,817 --> 00:55:53,426
Contrary to what I believed,
he finds them exciting.

907
00:55:53,427 --> 00:55:54,807
Exciting?

908

Ha Ru finds them exciting?

909
00:55:57,397 --> 00:55:59,807
He's been surprising us
in different ways lately.

910
00:56:01,467 --> 00:56:03,668
I don't know if it's because...

911
00:56:03,668 --> 00:56:06,307
he doesn't have to be
assessed all the time,

912
00:56:06,308 --> 00:56:09,148
or because he's around
less uptight people,

913
00:56:10,038 --> 00:56:11,757
but he has somewhat changed.

914
00:56:12,607 --> 00:56:14,458
I feel a warmth coming from him.

915
00:56:15,947 --> 00:56:19,586
He doesn't try to catch criminals
to improve his public image.

916
00:56:19,587 --> 00:56:21,097
The drive comes from the heart.

917
00:56:22,118 --> 00:56:23,998
- Really?
- Yes.

918
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:28,807
Maybe what Ha Ru needs
isn't study and research.

of his temporoparietal junction.

924
00:56:44,777 --> 00:56:48,427
His brain has all the elements
of an altruistic brain.

925
00:56:48,877 --> 00:56:51,728
Even his amygdala is larger
than the average person's.

she looked terrified.

No wonder.

929
00:57:01,058 --> 00:57:03,027
That's why he's sensitive
when it comes to fear and terror.

930
00:57:03,027 --> 00:57:04,407
Of course.

931
00:57:05,357 --> 00:57:08,828
He can quickly tell
when someone is terrified.

932
00:57:08,828 --> 00:57:10,367
It's why...

933
00:57:10,368 --> 00:57:14,717
he selflessly helps others
almost subconsciously.

934
00:57:17,107 --> 00:57:19,827
Obviously, he was born a kind soul.

935
00:57:20,947 --> 00:57:24,847
Well, being good doesn't mean
he's not corrupt.

936
00:57:24,848 --> 00:57:26,947
It's very unlikely.

937
00:57:26,947 --> 00:57:28,597
Look at his amygdala.

938

He's not the type who can sleep
at night after doing something bad.

Okay. I need a new plan
if I'm to get revenge.

solving crimes, and it was rewarding.

969
00:59:11,558 --> 00:59:13,137
Goodbye, all.

970
00:59:14,987 --> 00:59:17,438
- What?
- But...

971
00:59:21,067 --> 00:59:24,098
Go, cling to his leg or something.

972
00:59:24,098 --> 00:59:25,478
Why...

973

Dr. Brain!

975
00:59:33,208 --> 00:59:36,146
Dr. Brain. What's this about?

976
00:59:36,147 --> 00:59:37,998
Is it because of me?

977
00:59:38,018 --> 00:59:39,747
If you get that, stay away.

978
00:59:39,748 --> 00:59:41,168
It is because of me?

979
00:59:41,217 --> 00:59:44,137
Why? What did I do?

980
00:59:44,158 --> 00:59:47,256
Is it because we fought that day?

981
00:59:47,257 --> 00:59:49,108
Okay, I apologize.

982
00:59:49,728 --> 00:59:52,356
What did you do
that you need to apologize?

983
00:59:52,357 --> 00:59:53,967
I challenged you to a fight.

984
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:55,748
Late at night.

985
00:59:56,168 --> 00:59:58,077
Didn't I make you angry?

986
00:59:58,498 --> 01:00:00,506
You did, yes, that was why.

987
01:00:00,507 --> 01:00:02,217
Still, I'm sorry.

Detective.

I...

killed someone.

I don't get Mr. Heo's motive.

997
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:18,277
It's oddly discrepant
to the direction of the head wound.

998
01:01:18,277 --> 01:01:19,277
Forget it.

No, wait. What was that about?

1001
01:01:23,217 --> 01:01:25,038
Let me be very clear.

1002
01:01:25,158 --> 01:01:27,007
- Gosh.
- This is the last case.

1003
01:01:28,788 --> 01:01:31,057
Is this the real murder weapon?

1004
01:01:31,058 --> 01:01:34,667
I thought of a way
to find the real killer.

1005
01:01:34,668 --> 01:01:36,296
I'll do anything you want.

I want you to leave.
