However, he was the one I found most suspicious.

You developed aphasia and memory loss because of it.

That's how traumatic the event was for you.

that the condition could lead to a mental disorder...

Why'd you do it?

348
00:25:30,827 --> 00:25:31,827
Just so...

349
00:25:33,226 --> 00:25:34,726
you could steal his paper?

350
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:36,157
Yes.

351
00:25:37,266 --> 00:25:38,597
I stole his paper.

It's Dr. Hwang. Dr. Hwang killed him!

Dr. Hwang blackmailed me.

He said he'd forged evidence.

397

I only came here to try to get rid of the fake proof.

That's the quickest option.

If he was traumatized enough to suffer from dissociative amnesia,

psychologically speaking, he'll be very defensive.

Is it because of the side effects of the medication?

541

Or is he just frozen because he's too scared?

I'm not sure.

Get out!

673
00:51:51,578 --> 00:51:53,449
Get out before I smash the window!

674
00:52:05,728 --> 00:52:07,728
What's the matter?

675
00:53:15,998 --> 00:53:18,839
Is this your jacket?

676
00:53:20,869 --> 00:53:23,339
Well, the truth is...

678
00:54:03,748 --> 00:54:04,978
I stole it.

679
00:54:06,819 --> 00:54:09,319
Don't lie! You're in on it, aren't you?

680
00:54:09,518 --> 00:54:10,889
What are you talking about?

681
00:54:11,288 --> 00:54:12,418
No, Dr. Brain.

682
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:16,958
He's a thief. Take it from here.

683
00:54:17,828 --> 00:54:19,828
You're under arrest for theft.

684
00:54:20,259 --> 00:54:21,998
You can ask for a lawyer...

685
00:54:21,998 --> 00:54:23,168
and remain silent.

686
00:54:23,168 --> 00:54:24,598
He's definitely with Dr. Hwang.

687
00:54:25,139 --> 00:54:26,369
Okay, fine.

688
00:54:26,898 --> 00:54:28,038
Let's find out.

689
00:54:31,538 --> 00:54:32,878
Darn it.

690
00:54:36,978 --> 00:54:38,148
It's theft all right.

691
00:54:38,518 --> 00:54:40,878
We caught him leaving, wearing the said jacket.

692
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:48,159
Hwang Dong Woo walked off...

693
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,989
without even trying to avoid the cameras.

694
00:54:50,759 --> 00:54:53,429
He sent us on a wild goose chase...

695
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:55,268
so he could walk leisurely out.

696
00:54:56,268 --> 00:54:59,038
He didn't meet with the thief.

697
00:54:59,768 --> 00:55:01,668
He met this man here.

698
00:55:03,038 --> 00:55:04,808
He has another accomplice?

699
00:55:04,808 --> 00:55:06,808
This man drove off.

700
00:55:07,139 --> 00:55:09,348
The police said they'd track him down.

701
00:55:09,779 --> 00:55:11,179
I saw him somewhere.

702
00:55:19,089 --> 00:55:20,659
May I ask you something?

703
00:55:20,759 --> 00:55:22,228
Are you here to do some repairs?

704
00:55:23,328 --> 00:55:26,029
Yes. Someone asked me to take care of this.

705
00:55:27,228 --> 00:55:28,268
I remember.

706
00:55:28,828 --> 00:55:31,199
I know where Hwang Dong Woo went.

707
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:36,239
Dr. Brain. Where are you going?

708
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:40,478
- Thanks a lot. - Sure.

709
00:55:45,018 --> 00:55:47,319
That man really left this home?

710
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:48,989
I'm positive.

711
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:16,378
- Hwang Dong Woo! - Stop right there!

712
00:56:22,288 --> 00:56:23,288
Darn it.

713
00:56:26,058 --> 00:56:28,058
Let's see. Should we...

714
00:56:28,058 --> 00:56:29,628
smash something?

715
00:56:29,688 --> 00:56:32,159
A detective can't even open a door?

716
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:34,998
You bet I can.

717
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:37,998
This will do,

718
00:56:38,768 --> 00:56:42,038
but having no warrant makes it breaking and entering.

719
00:56:42,808 --> 00:56:45,639
If you're scared, hand that over and leave.

720
00:56:46,609 --> 00:56:49,708
I am scared, but I don't want to leave.

721
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:18,109
It's just the same.

722
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:21,878
How could that be?

723
00:57:23,109 --> 00:57:26,348
I believe they sold it in a hurry before moving to the US.

724
00:57:27,018 --> 00:57:30,418
Did Hwang Dong Woo buy the house, then?

725
00:57:30,518 --> 00:57:32,259
His own murder scene?

726
00:57:32,589 --> 00:57:36,159
He must've rejoiced as he relived that moment.

727
00:57:36,228 --> 00:57:39,058
He's a real psychopath.

728
00:57:39,759 --> 00:57:40,958
My gosh.

729
00:57:59,848 --> 00:58:00,878
What's wrong?

730
00:58:02,648 --> 00:58:04,288
It's gas. Get out.

731
00:58:17,969 --> 00:58:19,239
Oh, no...

732
00:59:37,049 --> 00:59:38,648
What's this?

733
00:59:47,659 --> 00:59:50,128
What have you done?

734
00:59:50,589 --> 00:59:51,958
Okay.

735
00:59:52,958 --> 00:59:54,429
Starting now,

736
00:59:55,299 --> 00:59:57,429
we'll play a game.

737
00:59:59,098 --> 01:00:01,098
A sympathy game.

738
01:00:02,308 --> 01:00:05,339
A game to turn Dr. Shin...

739
01:00:05,739 --> 01:00:08,139
into a murderer.

Sympathize? With Dr. Brain?

Something must've happened.

Let's trace them.

What if I can't sympathize with him?

745
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:53,188
Then you'll all become murderers.

Dr. Brain is not like you.
