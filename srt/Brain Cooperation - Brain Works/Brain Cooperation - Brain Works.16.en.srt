Don't keep it to yourself. What is it?

28
00:03:05,173 --> 00:03:06,502
It's a neural coupling.

29
00:03:07,712 --> 00:03:09,811
When two people see or hear something,

30
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:11,342
the machine measures...

how similarly our brains react.

For example,

33
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:18,781
if you see a crying child...

34
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,842
and you both feel pity,

35
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:26,782
your brains will show the same pattern.

36
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,882
I don't get what that means.

37
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:31,833
Sounds like fun. I'm not afraid at all!

38
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,323
Let me put it simply.

39
00:03:35,773 --> 00:03:37,932
If you sympathize with each other,

40
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:40,812
the waves will show the same pattern,

41
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:42,432
and you two will win.

42
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:44,073
Sympathize?

43
00:03:46,312 --> 00:03:47,773
With Dr. Brain?

44
00:03:50,722 --> 00:03:53,143
That's right. Sympathize.

45
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:56,083
If you sympathize with each other...

46
00:03:56,222 --> 00:03:59,182
and the waves
are over 80 percent identical,

47

What if not?

49
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:10,263
Then the brain waves will not match...

50

and you'll all become murderers.

51

Instead of dying,

52

we become murderers?

we will turn off the water valve.

we'll keep the water running.

Because of his psychopathic brain,

Dr. Shin lacks emotional empathy.

Therefore, he can't win this game,

they'll all drown and die.

Look, I'll do whatever you say.
So please...

Please let them go, okay? No.

109

I'll die instead of them.

110
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:07,933
I'll die, so just let them go!

111
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:13,672
Dr. Shin, this man's brain
is completely different from yours.

112
00:08:13,712 --> 00:08:15,373
Because the two of you are so different,

113
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,822
you certainly won't win this game.

114

Fine.

- Mom.
- Yes.

It's okay. We're here together.

121
00:08:44,213 --> 00:08:45,933
Yes, Yi Na. Don't be scared.

122
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:47,883
We'll get out of here. Right, Ms. Kim?

123
00:08:47,883 --> 00:08:49,372
Yes, that's right!

124
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:56,482
Please...

125
00:08:57,723 --> 00:09:00,222
All right. I'll play a video...

126
00:09:00,363 --> 00:09:02,823
on this screen.

127
00:09:03,162 --> 00:09:04,963
And over here, the emotions you feel...

128
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:07,463
while watching the video will be
displayed as brain wave patterns.

129
00:09:07,532 --> 00:09:11,163
Then the match ratio between
your brain wave patterns...

130
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:13,193
will be displayed as a graph.

131
00:09:13,473 --> 00:09:15,412
If it's over 80 percent,

132
00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:17,173
your handcuffs will be unlocked.

133
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:21,043
All right.

134
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:23,372
Then let's now begin the Sympathy Game.

135
00:09:44,072 --> 00:09:45,262
They don't match!

136

138
00:10:04,192 --> 00:10:05,382
Gosh, sorry.

139
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:12,992
I wish we had something sharp.

140
00:10:13,103 --> 00:10:15,362
Ms. Kim, could you look? Yi Na, you too.

141
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:19,201
I don't see anything.

My hands...

143
00:10:21,013 --> 00:10:24,102
All right, then. Here's the next video.

144
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:41,752

What?

146
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:49,193
How does that make you feel?

147
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,463
Well...

148
00:10:50,973 --> 00:10:54,303
I'm not sure
how it's supposed to make me feel.

149
00:10:55,473 --> 00:10:57,972
Flinch! Didn't it make you flinch?

150
00:10:59,182 --> 00:11:00,372
Not really.

151
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:03,272
Why should I flinch?

152
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:06,012
How could you not flinch
after seeing that?

153
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:11,982
It's because of his psychopathic brain.

154
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,423
All right. The next one.

155
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:49,022
Help...

156
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:52,522
Please save us.

If you want me dead, go ahead and kill me!

161
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:07,253
Don't use such a dirty trick.

162
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:09,903
What? "A dirty trick?"

163
00:12:10,983 --> 00:12:13,552
You pretend to be one of them,

164

but you're no ordinary man...

165

because of your brain,
and I'm doing this to prove it.

00:12:27,273 --> 00:12:29,793
- Coming through.
- Ms. Jung, where is your husband?

170
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:31,833
The guitarist's case?

171
00:12:32,143 --> 00:12:33,333
Ms. Jung In Young?

172
00:12:34,312 --> 00:12:35,502
Ms. Jung In Young?

173
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:50,322
I managed to trace it.

174
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:52,192
It was turned off in Pyeongchang-dong.

175
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:53,413
In Pyeongchang-dong?

176
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:54,923
That's where they went.

177
00:12:56,032 --> 00:12:57,901
Something must've happened.

178
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,092
I should go there myself.

179
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:01,892
- I'll come with you.
- Sure.

180
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:09,362
Only 27 percent.

181
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:17,551
The two of you worked on the same case...

182
00:13:17,552 --> 00:13:19,913
but felt such different emotions.

183
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:22,583
You two are too different.

184
00:13:23,593 --> 00:13:25,863
You'll never win this game.

185
00:13:25,863 --> 00:13:27,053
Shut your mouth.

186
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:28,982
Show us the next image.

187
00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:30,852
Sure.

188
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:35,323
Okay, next.

189
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:24,012
Help us, sir!

190
00:14:24,023 --> 00:14:25,313
Please help us!

191
00:14:25,853 --> 00:14:27,073
Look, sir.

192
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:28,791
This is considered attempted murder.

193
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:31,523
If you just let us go...

194
00:14:31,523 --> 00:14:33,321
My husband is a cop.

195
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:36,183
If you get caught, you'll be in
deep trouble. Do you realize that?

196
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:37,522
Hey!

197
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:43,463
You're laughing? You lunatic!

198
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:02,742
Dr. Brain, what on earth do you feel?

199
00:15:04,123 --> 00:15:05,313
What about you?

200
00:15:06,162 --> 00:15:07,382
What do you feel?

201
00:15:08,863 --> 00:15:10,852
Don't fight.

202
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:14,193
Look at their faces for one last time.

203
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:17,463
With their deaths, I will prove...

204
00:15:17,743 --> 00:15:20,502
that Dr. Shin's brain is
wired differently from yours.

205
00:15:41,263 --> 00:15:43,892
It was turned off
within a 1km radius from here.

206
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:47,222
There are so many buildings here.
How will we find them?

207
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:51,402
Oh, how about we ask the detective
who was in charge of the case?

208
00:15:51,402 --> 00:15:52,603
We may be able to find some clues...

209
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:54,433
about the house.

210
00:15:54,973 --> 00:15:57,502
You're right. Yes.

211
00:15:57,942 --> 00:15:59,132
Yes.

212
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:03,142
Hey, Detective Yoon.

213
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:06,512
You know, the house where
the doctor couple was murdered.

214
00:16:06,723 --> 00:16:08,612
Right, that house in Pyeongchang-dong.

215
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:10,393
Do you remember where that house was?

216
00:16:10,393 --> 00:16:11,422
(Crystal Bathhouse)

217
00:16:11,422 --> 00:16:12,612
You don't remember?

218
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:15,522
Come on. See if you can remember
some things about the house.

219
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:18,293
How close was it to the subway
station? Was there a tree?

220
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:20,663
What? A window?

221
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:23,563
An arched window?

222
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:29,333
They don't match!

223
00:16:45,593 --> 00:16:46,982
Please help us.

224
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:50,622
Help!

225
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:52,522
Help.

226
00:16:52,902 --> 00:16:54,423
Help!

227
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,193
Yi Na...

228
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:11,143
Let's try to get on our feet.

229
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:13,873
We can't.
Not when we're tied up like this.

230
00:17:14,122 --> 00:17:15,343
Let's give it a try though.

231
00:17:15,592 --> 00:17:19,312
All right. On the count of three,

232
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:20,782
we'll stand.

233
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:22,683
Good.

234
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:26,322
One, two, three.

235
00:17:41,483 --> 00:17:43,643
Mom!

236
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:45,312
Mom.

237
00:17:46,753 --> 00:17:47,891
Help!

238
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:50,213
Mom, are you all right?

239
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,613
Mom?

240
00:17:53,723 --> 00:17:54,791
Mom!

241
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:55,982
Are you all right?

242
00:17:57,362 --> 00:17:58,593
Auntie...

243
00:18:05,842 --> 00:18:07,232
Take a good look at them.

244
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:11,302
You'll be responsible for their deaths.

245
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:18,272
He's wrong, Dr. Brain.
It won't be your fault.

246
00:18:18,552 --> 00:18:20,042
This is on him!

247
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,552
I gave you a chance.

248
00:18:26,993 --> 00:18:30,153
The brain of a murderer
that lacks sympathy.

249
00:18:30,562 --> 00:18:33,353
The issue lies with Dr. Shin's brain.

250
00:18:33,503 --> 00:18:36,423
Free will? Metacognition?

251
00:18:36,903 --> 00:18:39,062
It's all nonsense.

252
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:43,363
We humans can feel superior all we want,

253
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:49,072
but we will forever be poor beings
who let their brains control them.

254
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,643
Here you are proving that.

255
00:18:56,223 --> 00:18:57,453
What?

256
00:19:00,632 --> 00:19:01,853
Someone's here.

257
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:04,693
In here. Help!

258
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:06,292
Help!

259
00:19:06,703 --> 00:19:08,163
Help!

260
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:21,002
Well...

261
00:19:25,523 --> 00:19:26,852
No one seems to be home.

262
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:29,343
But there's the arch window.

263
00:19:29,693 --> 00:19:31,713
And the house seems old enough.

264
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:34,353
Let me see.

265
00:19:35,963 --> 00:19:38,462
The trees are trimmed,
so the house can't be abandoned.

266
00:19:38,463 --> 00:19:39,722
Could the owner be out?

267
00:19:51,812 --> 00:19:53,272
Help!

268
00:19:54,082 --> 00:19:55,802
Help!

269
00:19:56,683 --> 00:19:59,673
Cut the shouting and answer my question.

270
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:02,621
How did that photo make you feel?

271
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:03,843
What?

272
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:08,282
I felt bad, of course.
How could someone do that?

273
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:11,123
- Compassion?
- That's right.

274
00:20:11,862 --> 00:20:16,193
But I can't describe it
with just that one word though.

275
00:20:17,572 --> 00:20:18,762
Why do you ask?

276
00:20:19,142 --> 00:20:22,363
I know what those photos have in common.

277
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,732
What they have in common?

278
00:20:26,112 --> 00:20:29,502
Yes, the people in them were scared.

279
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:31,312
That's right.

280
00:20:31,582 --> 00:20:33,913
He knows that my brain doesn't react
to others out of fear...

281
00:20:33,923 --> 00:20:35,742
and chose those photos on purpose.

282
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:38,582
Since I now know how they made you feel,

283
00:20:38,592 --> 00:20:41,123
I'll consciously think
of those emotions too.

284
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:43,552
Then our brain waves
will be somewhat in sync.

285
00:20:43,663 --> 00:20:45,893
I'll trick my own brain.

286
00:20:46,602 --> 00:20:47,822
Really?

287
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:51,262
No one seems to be home.

288
00:20:51,872 --> 00:20:53,863
It's not like we can jump over the wall.

289
00:20:54,312 --> 00:20:55,732
This is frustrating.

290
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:00,732
The houses here look similar to me.

291
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:03,373
- We'll keep searching.
- Sure.

292
00:21:05,122 --> 00:21:06,312
Gosh.

293
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,390
We can beat the test
if he shows us a similar photo.

294
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:21,699
I hope we make it work.

295
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:31,070
Your colleagues were here,

296
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,610
but they left.

297
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,110
- Help us.
- Help.

298
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,460
Help.

299
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,998
Whatever. Get on with the game.

300
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:45,350
You sound desperate.

301
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,789
Fine.

302
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:52,300
Next.

303
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,910
Compassion.

304
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,080
- Compassion.
- Hey, kid.

305
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,689
Hey, kid.

306
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:20,519
Hey, kid.

307
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,759
Hey, kid.

308
00:22:25,739 --> 00:22:27,360
Hey, kid.

309
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,429
- Compassion...
- Hey, kid.

310
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,070
Compassion.

311
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,439
Seriously?

312
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,350
He made me relive a traumatic event...

313
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,850
to stop me from feeling compassion.

314
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,620
Darn it!

315
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,179
That house we were at.

316
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:21,350
No one came to the door,
but I saw the curtains move.

317
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,460
I want to head back there.

318
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,189
Okay, I'll check other places.

319
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:26,519
- Call me if anything happens.
- Sure.

320
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,289
An arch window.

321
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,759
Wait. There's one.

322
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,519
Detective Geum! Dr. Shin!

323
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,130
Captain Seul!

324
00:25:53,749 --> 00:25:55,300
Yes!

325
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,528
- Captain Seul.
- Captain Seul?

326
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,360
- Captain Seul.
- Captain Seul.

327
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,699
Captain Seul.

328
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,890
Captain Seul.

329
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,429
- Captain Seul.
- Captain Seul.

330
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,539
- Captain Seul.
- Captain Seul.

331
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,810
Captain Seul.

332
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,840
Captain Seul.

333
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,890
"Crystal Bathhouse."

334
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,989
The house the doctor couple was killed in.

335
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:53,039
In Pyeongchang-dong.

336
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,239
Do you remember where it was?

337
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,900
Try to remember.

338
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,499
You darn scumbag!

339
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,469
This will be the final problem.

340
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:11,580
I'll let you say goodbye.

341
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:19,129
Auntie.

342
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,160
Ha Ru? What's going on?

343
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:25,360
What are you doing?

344
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:30,079
Dad. Save me!

345
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:32,549
- Dad!
- Save us!

346
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:33,769
Wait, Yi Na.

347
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,880
I'll come for you, okay?

348
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,880
Hang in there!

349
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,439
Dad. Get here soon.

350
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:41,920
Be quick!

351
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,559
Okay, I'll be there!

352
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,380
Don't give up, Yi Na!

353
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,580
Yi...

354
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:50,850
You. Darn you, you psycho scumbag!

355
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:52,489
There.

356
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,120
You've got to say goodbye.

357
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:58,289
It's time for the final problem.

358
00:28:01,569 --> 00:28:03,429
I really don't like to say this,

359
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,330
but I must.

360
00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:08,439
I'm sorry.

361
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,039
For having a brain like this.

362
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,279
It's not on you.

363
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:18,479
Whatever the outcome,

364
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:20,719
it's not on you, so don't apologize.

365
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,749
It's all on that psycho!

366
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,130
Now,

367
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,999
here's the last problem.

368
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,439
Dr. Brain.

369
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,179
Pretend the dying man is your friend.

370
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:52,749
My friend?

371
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:55,279
My friend.

372
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,420
Algernon.

373
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:00,189
My only friend's a lab rat.

374
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,560
How come your only friend's a mouse?

375
00:29:06,739 --> 00:29:08,999
If you don't have a friend,

376
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,300
pretend that's me.

377
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,539
How would you feel if I died?

378
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,840
Dr. Shin...

379
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,679
wouldn't bat an eyelid even if...

380
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:26,120
the likes of you were to die before him.

381
00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:29,749
He has the brain of a murderer.

382
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,860
Don't you dare say that.

383
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:37,090
Dr. Brain's different
from complete trash like you.

384
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,839
He developed an affection
for human beings...

385
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,939
that the likes of you
will never understand.

386
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,170
Kill me. Kill me, and you'll find out!

387
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,640
That's a great idea.

388
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,539
Let's do that.

389
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,570
Dr. Brain.

390
00:30:22,579 --> 00:30:24,170
You poor man.

391
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,709
How did you end up
meeting a mad murderer like him?

392
00:30:59,349 --> 00:31:01,479
How about we say
today is our first day as a couple?

393
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,779
Help me, Dr. Brain!

394
00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:11,420
- Hold me tight.
- I will kill you.

395
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,650
No!

396
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,449
You'll become a murderer.

397
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:41,080
No, Dr. Brain.

398
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:44,449
No.

399
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:49,529
No.

400
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,900
What...

401
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:01,039
What...

402
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,249
We did it.

403
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,890
I can't hang on.

404
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:28,610
No, Yi Na.

405
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,729
Yi Na.

406
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,340
- Yi Na.
- Yi Na.

407
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,840
Wake up, Yi Na.

408
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,340
Don't fall asleep.

409
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,549
Yi Na.

410
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:41,610
Yi Na. No.

411
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,850
Yi Na!

412
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,910
- Yi Na.
- No.

413
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,219
Detective Geum.

414
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,660
My gosh.

415
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,360
Why didn't the water stop?

416
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,900
Was that a lie?

417
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,410
- No.
- Lift your head.

418
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
Lift your head.

419
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,620
Yi Na! Lift your head.

420
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,810
- Yi Na.
- Your...

421
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,949
Yi Na, lift your head!

422
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,550
Mister!

423
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,920
Please let my Yi Na go.

424
00:33:34,739 --> 00:33:35,870
Are you okay?

425
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,630
Yes. Goodness.

426
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:43,910
It's okay. The tap's off.

427
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,690
But where could that be?

428
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,349
I think I know where they are.

429
00:33:48,349 --> 00:33:51,279
I saw the bathhouse earlier. Let's go.

430
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,830
I'm freezing.

431
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:10,130
My pretty face is getting wrinkly.

432
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,610
- Run! Come on!
- Detective Geum.

433
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,980
Follow us!

434
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,470
What's going on?

435
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,010
Are we chasing or being chased?

436
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,780
- What happened?
- Where are they?

437
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,180
- My gosh.
- Oh, dear.

438
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:28,320
- Mom.
- Yes?

439
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:30,920
I can't do this anymore.

440
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:35,499
- My head hurts.
- No, Yi Na. Stay awake.

441
00:34:35,499 --> 00:34:38,159
Yi Na. The water stopped. Hang in there.

442
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,900
Yi Na.

443
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,269
Yi Na!

444
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:51,420
- Auntie!
- Get Yi Na!

445
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,610
Yi Na!

446
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,050
- Yi Na.
- Auntie!

447
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,119
- Yi Na.
- Are you okay?

448
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:57,119
Are you okay?

449
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,450
Dad's here.

450
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,888
- You're okay.
- Get Yi Na first.

451
00:35:01,889 --> 00:35:03,090
Detective Geum.

452
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:05,189
Yi Na.

453
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,429
They might get hypothermic.

454
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:07,570
Take them all to the ER.

455
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:10,260
- Okay.
- Get Yi Na first.

456
00:35:12,969 --> 00:35:15,130
- Dad.
- It's okay.

457
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,300
I'm here.

458
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:25,139
Get over here and help them out.

459
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:27,010
Can you drain the water?

460
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:29,079
- Are you all right?
- I can't do it!

461
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:30,849
(Incoming Call)

462
00:35:33,789 --> 00:35:35,249
Hey, kid.

463
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,289
It's time for the last game.

464
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:40,659
You know where I am, right?

465
00:35:45,469 --> 00:35:46,700
Detective Geum.

466
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:48,760
Take care of the rest here.

467
00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:49,999
Where are you going?

468
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:51,530
I have to go meet Hwang Dong Woo.

469
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,249
- Are you all right, Yi Na?
- What's going on?

470
00:35:57,249 --> 00:35:58,769
- Let's go.
- Let's get out of here.

471
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:12,849
Welcome.

472
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,189
You have a triumphant look on your face.

473
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:21,200
Of course.

474
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,369
I won the game
that you said I'd never win.

475
00:36:24,409 --> 00:36:26,030
It was very thrilling.

476
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,570
I should thank you for giving me
the chance to participate...

477
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,470
in such an incredible brain experiment.

478
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:34,139
I hope...

479
00:36:34,749 --> 00:36:38,619
you're not deluding yourself
into thinking that...

480
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:40,979
you were able to truly sympathize
with that detective.

481
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:42,880
You saw it with your own two eyes.

482
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,689
No.

483
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,590
You're incapable of doing that.

484
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,598
Your high IQ...

485
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,459
allowed you to trick your brain
for a moment.

486
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:56,099
You know that
your brain is incapable of sympathy.

487
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:57,369
No.

488
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,570
My brain has transcended its limitations.

489
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:07,579
We can never transcend
our own limitations.

490
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,610
You're wrong.
You can overcome your limitations...

491
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,550
the moment you connect with others.

492
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,450
Just like how Detective Geum...

493
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,920
helped me become a better person.

494
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:24,389
A better person?

495
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:30,269
Do you truly mean it?

496
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,639
- Of course, I do.
- Fine.

497
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,970
Then how about a fun game
of Truth or Dare?

498
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,490
We'll find out whether or not
you truly believe...

499
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,909
what you said.

500
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:48,989
If you believe it to be true,
it'll be a match.

501
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,820
If not, it'll say it doesn't match.

502
00:37:54,999 --> 00:37:58,090
Fine. What are we betting?

503
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:00,130
Our lives.

504
00:38:02,139 --> 00:38:04,329
One of us...

505
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,639
will die.

506
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,740
This is morphine.

507
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:18,280
The winner will inject
the loser with this.

508
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:22,979
What do you say? Are you in?

509
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,590
Sure.

510
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:33,900
We'll go inside
and search every nook and cranny.

511
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:35,669
We must catch them no matter what.

512
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,729
Yes, we'll catch them at all costs.

513
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,948
Hey, go with them and see a doctor.

514
00:38:48,949 --> 00:38:50,359
I'll wrap things up here
and meet you there.

515
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,849
- Okay.
- Hurry, Dad.

516
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,720
That man who was with us.
He's in on this too.

517
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,119
- Make sure you catch him too.
- Okay.

518
00:38:57,429 --> 00:39:00,720
Wait. Have you heard from Ha Ru yet?

519
00:39:12,424 --> 00:39:14,015
So?

520
00:39:14,794 --> 00:39:16,254
Should I go first?

521
00:39:17,495 --> 00:39:18,725
No.

522
00:39:19,564 --> 00:39:20,855
I'll go first.

523
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:22,554
All right, then.

524
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:29,335
Feeling connected to others...

525
00:39:30,305 --> 00:39:32,435
helps the brain
overcome its limitations...

526
00:39:33,174 --> 00:39:34,734
and helps us...

527
00:39:36,114 --> 00:39:38,174
become better people.

528
00:39:38,884 --> 00:39:40,105
I...

529
00:39:41,884 --> 00:39:43,444
proved it.

530
00:39:43,754 --> 00:39:48,384
As human beings,
we're all slaves to our brains.

531
00:39:49,165 --> 00:39:51,085
The human brain...

532
00:39:52,035 --> 00:39:54,625
can never transcend its limitations.

533
00:40:31,404 --> 00:40:33,964
Okay! I won.

534
00:40:38,245 --> 00:40:39,504
See that?

535
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:43,274
You're the one who doesn't
truly believe in what you say.

536
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:47,504
This can't be.

537
00:40:48,825 --> 00:40:50,645
Something went wrong.

538
00:40:51,725 --> 00:40:55,455
No. You may not want to believe it,

539
00:40:55,524 --> 00:40:57,154
but your brain does.

540
00:40:57,294 --> 00:40:59,455
The moment you saw
my brain sympathize with others,

541
00:40:59,694 --> 00:41:01,633
your brain realized it.

542
00:41:01,634 --> 00:41:04,495
"I was mistaken. I was wrong."

543
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:05,725
"I can..."

544
00:41:06,634 --> 00:41:08,565
"overcome my limitations."

545
00:41:09,345 --> 00:41:10,565
No.

546
00:41:11,614 --> 00:41:14,205
Something went wrong. I'm sure of it!

547
00:41:17,044 --> 00:41:18,245
Why?

548
00:41:18,984 --> 00:41:20,605
Are you afraid now that you have to die?

549
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:22,315
Of course not.

550
00:41:26,355 --> 00:41:27,614
In any case,

551
00:41:28,725 --> 00:41:30,054
you won.

552
00:41:32,665 --> 00:41:34,395
I shall die.

553
00:41:37,265 --> 00:41:38,495
Inject me.

554
00:41:38,774 --> 00:41:41,565
With that needle.

555
00:41:43,745 --> 00:41:45,605
Finally, you're getting your revenge.

556
00:41:55,285 --> 00:41:57,844
Injecting it in my neck
wouldn't be a bad idea either.

557
00:41:58,194 --> 00:41:59,923
Anyway, go for it.

558
00:41:59,924 --> 00:42:01,355
Let's do this in one go.

559
00:42:02,194 --> 00:42:04,214
Do a clean job.

560
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:08,654
That's how I killed your parents.

561
00:42:10,165 --> 00:42:13,995
Nice and clean. At once.

562
00:42:15,904 --> 00:42:17,295
Shut your mouth!

563
00:42:28,654 --> 00:42:30,344
Your beliefs are wrong.

564
00:42:33,024 --> 00:42:34,214
I am...

565
00:42:36,495 --> 00:42:38,085
not like you.

566
00:42:47,435 --> 00:42:48,795
Make your choice.

567
00:42:49,504 --> 00:42:50,935
You can either...

568
00:42:51,274 --> 00:42:53,765
rot in prison for the rest of your life...

569
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,234
or commit your last murder.

570
00:42:57,955 --> 00:43:00,705
There's only one person you can kill now.

571
00:43:02,355 --> 00:43:03,574
Yourself.

572
00:43:10,564 --> 00:43:11,785
Oh, right.

573
00:43:13,564 --> 00:43:15,694
Before you die,
you should at least know this.

574
00:43:16,064 --> 00:43:17,864
Do you know why we got such results?

575
00:43:18,705 --> 00:43:20,065
It's because...

576
00:43:20,904 --> 00:43:24,234
your brain desperately wanted
to feel such a connection.

577
00:43:42,325 --> 00:43:44,054
Dr. Brain! Are you all right?

578
00:43:45,794 --> 00:43:47,285
Hwang Dong Woo is inside.

579
00:43:47,805 --> 00:43:49,295
Go in and arrest him at once.

580
00:43:49,805 --> 00:43:52,265
Oh, you have to be careful though.

581
00:43:52,274 --> 00:43:54,225
He has a syringe filled with morphine.

582
00:43:54,475 --> 00:43:55,935
If he injects you with it, you'll die.

583
00:43:57,774 --> 00:43:58,964
Okay.

584
00:44:03,884 --> 00:44:06,475
I was never wrong.

585
00:44:06,714 --> 00:44:09,375
I do not want human connection.

586
00:44:34,984 --> 00:44:36,174
What the...

587
00:44:41,285 --> 00:44:43,074
Hwang Dong Woo!

588
00:44:55,205 --> 00:44:57,154
He seemed like a smart man.

589
00:44:57,265 --> 00:44:59,694
Why did he have to go out this way?

590
00:44:59,834 --> 00:45:01,404
Is it because his brain
was programmed this way?

591
00:45:01,404 --> 00:45:03,234
It's because he blamed
his brain for everything.

592
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:05,765
He thought too less of it.

593
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:10,515
Exactly. Someone with
a nasty brain like yours...

594
00:45:10,515 --> 00:45:11,975
can turn over a new leaf, so...

595
00:45:14,355 --> 00:45:16,074
My brain isn't nasty.

596
00:45:16,384 --> 00:45:18,245
It's exceptional.

597
00:45:18,694 --> 00:45:19,884
Fine.

598
00:45:19,955 --> 00:45:22,185
Dr. Brain with an exceptional brain.

599
00:45:22,424 --> 00:45:23,694
I was touched.

600
00:45:23,694 --> 00:45:26,185
The thought of me dying made you sad.

601
00:45:29,035 --> 00:45:31,594
Yes, I was upset.

602
00:45:32,435 --> 00:45:33,625
Really?

603
00:45:34,745 --> 00:45:36,145
I had to be the one to kill you,

604
00:45:36,145 --> 00:45:37,575
so you dying in another's hands...

605
00:45:37,575 --> 00:45:39,404
saddened me.

606
00:45:39,714 --> 00:45:42,574
You just had to ruin the moment,
didn't you?

607
00:45:43,584 --> 00:45:44,774
Do you get it?

608
00:45:45,154 --> 00:45:48,114
You can't die until I kill you myself.

609
00:45:48,524 --> 00:45:49,774
Keep that in mind.

610
00:45:52,095 --> 00:45:54,515
Is that a threat or a confession of love?

611
00:45:55,095 --> 00:45:56,915
I'm confused. Gosh, it's cold.

612
00:45:57,165 --> 00:45:59,225
Dr. Brain, wait for me.

613
00:45:59,395 --> 00:46:00,994
It's cold. Warm me up, will you?

614
00:46:00,995 --> 00:46:02,625
Get lost.

615
00:46:03,364 --> 00:46:04,535
I keep sticking to you.

616
00:46:04,535 --> 00:46:05,725
Get away from me.

617
00:46:06,705 --> 00:46:08,475
The cold brings me back to our time
in the freezer warehouse.

618
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:09,475
Get lost.

619
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,475
I'll be reminded of your warm embrace...

620
00:46:11,475 --> 00:46:13,015
every time it gets cold.

621
00:46:13,015 --> 00:46:15,015
Don't think about that incident.

622
00:46:15,015 --> 00:46:16,584
I can't help it.

623
00:46:16,584 --> 00:46:17,814
Stop it while I ask nicely.

624
00:46:17,814 --> 00:46:19,154
I can't hear you.

625
00:46:19,154 --> 00:46:21,145
Gosh, it's so warm.

626
00:46:21,384 --> 00:46:22,574
Stop it!

627
00:46:39,075 --> 00:46:42,665
Ji Hyung, I was about to contact you.

628
00:46:44,205 --> 00:46:45,634
I only want to know why.

629
00:46:46,975 --> 00:46:48,205
Why did you do it?

630
00:46:50,114 --> 00:46:52,004
It has been eating at me all this time.

631
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:56,515
I'm actually relieved...

632
00:46:57,685 --> 00:46:59,085
to come clean.

633
00:47:00,995 --> 00:47:02,185
That day,

634
00:47:03,064 --> 00:47:05,455
someone came by to see Jae Sung
while he was on the phone with me.

635
00:47:05,794 --> 00:47:08,355
I heard weird noises,
and then the call got disconnected.

636
00:47:09,305 --> 00:47:11,125
It didn't feel right,
so I hurried over there.

637
00:47:11,165 --> 00:47:12,575
Someone opened the front gate,

638
00:47:12,575 --> 00:47:14,665
so I thought all was well.

639
00:47:47,205 --> 00:47:48,395
Dr. Shin?

640
00:48:02,455 --> 00:48:04,315
- Professor?
- We should...

641
00:48:05,055 --> 00:48:06,415
talk.

642
00:48:06,694 --> 00:48:07,884
Why?

643
00:48:08,165 --> 00:48:09,415
How did this happen?

644
00:48:11,935 --> 00:48:14,924
His disrespectful attitude
left me with no choice.

645
00:48:15,004 --> 00:48:17,125
He brought this upon himself.

646
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:19,094
You know how he was.

647
00:48:19,134 --> 00:48:22,234
Dr. Shin has always been disrespectful...

648
00:48:22,975 --> 00:48:24,904
and arrogant.

649
00:48:25,975 --> 00:48:27,165
Ha Ru...

650
00:48:28,915 --> 00:48:30,134
What did you do to him?

651
00:48:31,614 --> 00:48:35,614
Oh, the perky young boy?

652
00:48:36,285 --> 00:48:37,975
Is his name Ha Ru?

653
00:48:39,955 --> 00:48:41,145
He's alive.

654
00:48:41,464 --> 00:48:43,415
Ha Ru, it's me!

655
00:48:45,134 --> 00:48:46,484
He's outside.

656
00:48:48,404 --> 00:48:51,024
If you wish to save the boy,

657
00:48:51,834 --> 00:48:53,024
you'll make...

658
00:48:54,805 --> 00:48:56,864
a deal with me.

659
00:49:00,674 --> 00:49:02,435
That dead woman over there.

660
00:49:03,845 --> 00:49:07,605
He's the son of the woman
you were secretly in love with.

661
00:49:12,424 --> 00:49:13,884
What is it that you want?

662
00:49:14,154 --> 00:49:16,415
Just do as I tell you.

663
00:49:17,095 --> 00:49:19,524
Then nothing will happen. Actually...

664
00:49:21,165 --> 00:49:24,154
Since Dr. Shin is no longer with us,

Of course.

832
00:58:19,134 --> 00:58:20,305
- Join us.
- Okay.

833
00:58:20,305 --> 00:58:21,495
Come on.

834
00:58:22,274 --> 00:58:24,435
Hurry up. Stand in a row.

00:58:25,814 --> 00:58:27,004
That's it.

The Neuroscientific Investigation Team.

No, the Brain Works Team.

838
00:58:32,785 --> 00:58:35,745
Smile.

839
00:58:36,825 --> 00:58:38,015
Yes.

840
00:58:39,254 --> 00:58:41,995
Why the weird faces?

841
00:58:41,995 --> 00:58:43,585
Were you all forced to be here?

842
00:58:43,995 --> 00:58:45,563
My gosh.

843
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:48,685
I guess I should take the lead, then.

844
00:58:49,165 --> 00:58:51,254
How about you all laugh like me?

845
00:58:58,975 --> 00:59:00,935
- Captain, laugh.
- Okay.

846
00:59:01,444 --> 00:59:02,674
Like this?

847

Oh, gosh. Where are you going, Dr. Brain?

Join the team for dinner.

No, thanks. Why would I join
when I'm not a cop?

You're on the Brain Works Team.

You got an award too, remember?

859
00:59:52,595 --> 00:59:54,855
I clearly said I'd quit.

860
00:59:54,895 --> 00:59:56,625
I just stayed on way too long.

861

It would be such a shame
if you were to leave like this.

Quit your disturbing attempts
to be cute...

Look at this.

It is.
