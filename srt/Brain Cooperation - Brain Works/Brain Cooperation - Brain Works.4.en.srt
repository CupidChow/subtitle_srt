You were lying on the floor with me,
holding me in your arms.

53
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:40,803

You're asking him questions right away?

61

Are you suspecting me?

62
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:15,563
It happened in your home,

63
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:17,533
so it's only rational that I suspect you.

64
00:04:18,814 --> 00:04:20,343
I was at a bar.

You can go there and ask them.

66
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,413
So you were drinking.

67
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:26,204
Then why did you suddenly show up
in the freezer room?

68
00:04:27,554 --> 00:04:31,053
I kept getting a bad feeling,
so I went there to take a look.

69
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:32,314
Okay, whatever.

70
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:34,713
We'll just check the security footage.

71
00:04:35,764 --> 00:04:37,583

72

I saw one.

73
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:40,954
Mr. Lee Jong Koo.

74
00:04:43,603 --> 00:04:44,793
Mr. Lee Jong Koo?

75

It's new, isn't it?

76

Yes, I put one up a few days ago.

77

Weird things have been happening,

78
00:04:52,114 --> 00:04:53,184
so I installed a camera.

79
00:04:53,184 --> 00:04:55,413
You only see brains.

80
00:04:55,413 --> 00:04:58,144
We, detectives, only see security cameras.

81
00:05:05,624 --> 00:05:07,314
Around 2 p.m...

82
00:05:12,694 --> 00:05:13,894
You see this, right?

83
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:15,254
I left.

84
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:16,934
Then you arrived.

85
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:18,663
Maybe you came back.

86
00:05:18,704 --> 00:05:20,033
Let's fast-forward.

87
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:24,603
Someone else came.

88
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:28,934
Who is that? I think it's a woman.

89
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:31,644
I don't recognize anyone. Who's that?

90
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:33,973
I think she's your sister-in-law.

91
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:36,314
Did she come to pick up some things?

92
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:38,644
She's looking after my daughter
at the moment.

93
00:05:39,153 --> 00:05:40,353
That's us.

94
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:42,413
This means...

95
00:05:42,523 --> 00:05:44,054
she was here when we were here.

96
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:47,293
Goodness. She hid,
so we'd think no one was here.

97
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:04,603
Stop watching that over and over.

98
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:09,074
I'm sure Thoung's sister fled
through the camera's blind spots.

99
00:06:10,424 --> 00:06:12,723
She turned off the freezer,
so we wouldn't freeze to death.

100
00:06:12,723 --> 00:06:14,653
Then Lee Jong Koo came, so she fled.

101
00:06:15,393 --> 00:06:18,054
That means
she had no intention of killing us.

102
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:19,593
Then why did she lock us in there?

103
00:06:19,593 --> 00:06:21,923
To buy time, I guess?

104
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:36,204
When Thoung's sister got to
the house to pick up something,

105
00:06:36,244 --> 00:06:37,444
we arrived there as well.

106
00:06:38,184 --> 00:06:41,374
She needed time to find something,
so she locked us in there.

107
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:43,413
Thoung must've sent her there.

108
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:48,554
Then Thoung's sister must know
that Thoung is alive too.

it was the police's job

00:23:55,084 --> 00:23:56,344
Oh, right.

327
00:23:56,483 --> 00:23:59,293
He can't distinguish faces. Jeez...

328
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:01,243
I find Thoung most suspicious.

329
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:03,614
We can't take her statement at face value.

330
00:24:03,793 --> 00:24:06,134
Right. They were close enough friends...

331
00:24:06,134 --> 00:24:07,784
that she took her on their honeymoon.

332
00:24:08,164 --> 00:24:10,753
Whoever did this to Hoai...

333
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:12,763
has to be brazen.

334
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:28,943
That Thoung's alive.

335
00:24:29,283 --> 00:24:31,814
Neither Loc or Lee Jong Koo know, right?

336
00:24:33,094 --> 00:24:35,413
We didn't tell them
about the investigation.

337
00:24:35,993 --> 00:24:37,683
Okay, nice.

338
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:39,354
Let's call them both in.

339
00:24:42,104 --> 00:24:43,493
Their brains...

340
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:46,594
will tell us who the culprit is.

341
00:24:55,513 --> 00:24:56,703
Yes.

342
00:24:57,213 --> 00:25:00,074
I understand. Bye.

Are you ready?

349
00:25:32,253 --> 00:25:34,703
This is a lie detector of sorts.

350
00:25:34,713 --> 00:25:37,574
Relax and answer the questions.

351
00:25:39,253 --> 00:25:41,114
Were you dating Hoai?

Yes.

Are you in touch
with your girlfriend Hoai?

No.

355

Do you think Hoai...

356
00:25:49,704 --> 00:25:51,294
killed her friend Thoung?

357
00:25:54,874 --> 00:25:56,064
Yes.

358
00:25:59,513 --> 00:26:01,804
I'll show you one of Hoai's friends.

359

Tell me if you've met her before.

Okay.

Thoung? What's going on?

What happened? Why are you alive?

363

Don't lie. You killed Hoai!

364
00:26:35,174 --> 00:26:36,604
You killed her!

365
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:39,274
No, I did not!

366
00:26:41,983 --> 00:26:45,074
Yes. We have a likely suspect.

367
00:26:46,124 --> 00:26:48,983
Is that true? You caught the killer?

368
00:26:50,323 --> 00:26:51,513
Now?

369
00:26:51,993 --> 00:26:53,183
Yes.

370
00:26:53,364 --> 00:26:54,624
Not at all.

371
00:26:55,263 --> 00:26:57,993
I must come. Yes, I'll be right over.

372
00:27:03,144 --> 00:27:05,042
We identified a suspect...

373
00:27:05,043 --> 00:27:07,304
and we'd like to know
if you saw him before.

374
00:27:07,874 --> 00:27:10,673
Even if I did, I can't recognize faces.

375
00:27:10,743 --> 00:27:12,104
How could I tell?

376
00:27:12,483 --> 00:27:15,644
Your eyes can't recognize him,
but your brain can.

377
00:27:18,184 --> 00:27:20,084
- Come inside.
- Okay.

378
00:27:24,023 --> 00:27:25,983
We'll show you two suspects.

379
00:27:27,694 --> 00:27:28,894
Send them in.

380
00:27:51,584 --> 00:27:54,513
Who's she? I don't know her.

381
00:27:58,733 --> 00:28:01,253
He really doesn't recognize her.

382
00:28:01,864 --> 00:28:05,124
He doesn't. It's fascinating
however many times I see it.

383
00:28:07,073 --> 00:28:08,263
You can leave.

384
00:28:14,374 --> 00:28:16,973
Here's the second suspect.

385
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:19,304
Send them in.

386
00:28:48,983 --> 00:28:52,134
Honey. How come...

387
00:28:52,813 --> 00:28:54,003
Why?

388
00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:56,443
Are you surprised
the person you killed is alive?

389
00:28:59,424 --> 00:29:00,784
No, it's just...

390
00:29:00,954 --> 00:29:02,144
You recognize...

391
00:29:02,924 --> 00:29:04,153
your wife, don't you?

392
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:05,884
It's more like...

393
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:09,094
her voice sounds familiar.

394
00:29:10,134 --> 00:29:11,324
No.

395
00:29:11,434 --> 00:29:14,493
Your brainwaves reacted
before you heard her voice.

396
00:29:15,174 --> 00:29:16,394
The moment...

397
00:29:18,144 --> 00:29:20,203
you saw those earrings.

398
00:29:23,184 --> 00:29:25,574
You didn't recognize her face,

399
00:29:25,684 --> 00:29:28,344
but you recognized
the earrings you bought her.

400
00:29:29,023 --> 00:29:31,374
They're the ones your wife wore often.

401
00:29:32,793 --> 00:29:33,983
The problem is,

402
00:29:34,053 --> 00:29:38,084
the day you went to the factory
to get your wife, these earrings...

403
00:29:40,094 --> 00:29:42,084
were in Hoai's ears.

404
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:47,993
She'd borrowed her friend's earrings.

405
00:30:00,713 --> 00:30:03,774
You mistook
your wife's friend for your wife.

406
00:30:04,884 --> 00:30:07,323
You saw her in a tight embrace with Loc...

407
00:30:07,323 --> 00:30:09,114
and got furious.

408
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,854

00:30:39,753 --> 00:30:41,344
I guess I killed her.

412
00:30:43,364 --> 00:30:45,584
I tried to just go home.

415
00:31:23,803 --> 00:31:26,024
She was wearing the earrings
that I bought for my wife,

416
00:31:26,503 --> 00:31:28,864
so I thought she was my wife.

417

Her face was right before your eyes
as you were strangling her,

yet you didn't recognize her?

No. These days,

my prosopagnosia keeps getting worse.

There are moments when I don't
even recognize myself in the mirror.

That can't justify the murder.

423
00:31:51,293 --> 00:31:54,183
You'll be charged with the murder of Hoai.

424

And you, with abuse of corpse.

425

Stop lying. You killed Hoai!

That's right.

The dead body you found...

was Hoai, not Thoung.

No. That can't be.

It was Hoai?

434

If it were Hoai, I would have known.

435

No. No way!

436
00:32:55,493 --> 00:32:58,183
It wasn't Hoai!

437
00:32:58,194 --> 00:32:59,884
I don't believe this.

438
00:33:01,463 --> 00:33:02,753
He's telling the truth.

439
00:33:04,864 --> 00:33:07,923
It seems that he really didn't know
Hoai was dead.

440
00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:09,864
If he killed her,

441
00:33:11,604 --> 00:33:13,334
the results would say that he lied.

442
00:33:15,114 --> 00:33:17,634
Then who...

443
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,713
It's all your fault.

444
00:33:24,084 --> 00:33:26,693
Because of you, I'll end up in jail too!

445
00:33:26,694 --> 00:33:28,924
I never forced you to do what
you did. Why are you blaming me?

446
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,814
Had I known you did it,

447
00:33:31,924 --> 00:33:33,554
I would've never done such a thing.

448
00:33:33,793 --> 00:33:35,732
If you go to jail,

449
00:33:35,733 --> 00:33:39,094
I can live with Sa Rang alone.
So why would I do such a thing?

450
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:41,263
What's Sa Rang going to do now?

451
00:33:41,904 --> 00:33:43,963
What are we going to do about Sa Rang?

452
00:33:52,313 --> 00:33:54,774
I pity their situation.

453
00:33:55,084 --> 00:33:56,973
I feel so bad for the baby.

454
00:33:57,854 --> 00:34:01,213
They made a bad judgment call
based on fragmentary knowledge.

455
00:34:01,293 --> 00:34:04,194
They're paying
for being enslaved to what they see.

456
00:34:04,194 --> 00:34:05,923
"Enslaved?" That's a stretch.

457
00:34:06,033 --> 00:34:07,934
I understand why they were mistaken.

458
00:34:07,934 --> 00:34:09,604
The husband suffers from prosopagnosia,

459
00:34:09,604 --> 00:34:12,803
and the wife saw her friend
fighting with her boyfriend.

460
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:15,464
People only see what they want to see,

461
00:34:15,673 --> 00:34:17,403
and they believe
what they see is everything.

462
00:34:17,403 --> 00:34:19,564
They're such fools.

463
00:34:19,673 --> 00:34:22,404
Knowing the truth won't change everything,

464
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,334
but you still need to make an effort.

465
00:34:24,644 --> 00:34:26,243
If you don't even try...

466
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:31,073
Then you'll just believe what you see...

467
00:34:31,254 --> 00:34:33,283
and let your imagination run wild
like they did,

468
00:34:33,624 --> 00:34:35,183
which will cause tragedy.

469
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:39,754
In short, what you see isn't everything.

470
00:34:39,794 --> 00:34:42,694
What goes on in your mind
is more important...

471
00:34:53,144 --> 00:34:54,363
Darn it.

472
00:34:55,613 --> 00:34:57,613
At a glance,
I can tell that you've got bad eyes.

473
00:34:57,613 --> 00:34:59,904
Be careful not to be a slave
to what you see.

474
00:35:00,283 --> 00:35:03,913
Your brain is wired for trouble.

475
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:14,233
What are you doing?

476
00:35:14,234 --> 00:35:16,854
I'm trying to see past
what my eyes can see.

477
00:35:16,863 --> 00:35:19,524
"Why is Dr. Brain provoking me again?"

478
00:35:19,704 --> 00:35:22,964
"What's the hidden meaning
behind Dr. Brain's behavior?"

479
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:25,533
The eyes of my mind are telling me...

480
00:35:26,414 --> 00:35:28,374
that we should go out for drinks tonight.

481
00:35:28,374 --> 00:35:31,612
We survived on the verge of death.
How about we go for a drink?

482
00:35:31,613 --> 00:35:33,944
I do not want to celebrate such a thing.

483
00:35:34,414 --> 00:35:36,343
Go drink all you want.

484
00:35:41,193 --> 00:35:43,883
With my eyes closed,
I can totally see his true colors.

485
00:35:44,823 --> 00:35:46,883
He has a personality disorder.

486
00:35:48,894 --> 00:35:50,493
That jerk...

487
00:36:01,513 --> 00:36:02,774
No.

488
00:36:04,084 --> 00:36:06,174
You know, right? You know me.

489
00:36:06,283 --> 00:36:08,374
I'd never rely on my eyes alone
and make the wrong judgment call.

490
00:36:10,553 --> 00:36:12,044
I'll give you more next month.

491
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:19,484
Maybe he's being blackmailed.

492
00:36:19,734 --> 00:36:21,383
Perhaps, he lied to the reporter.

493
00:36:21,693 --> 00:36:25,294
I'm sure he's a corrupt cop.

494
00:36:27,004 --> 00:36:28,863
I will be sure to find evidence.

495
00:36:29,743 --> 00:36:30,964
At all costs.

496
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,214
Gosh, my whole body was shivering.

497
00:36:36,214 --> 00:36:39,112
My body became rigid, like a frozen fish.

498
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,684
I thought,
"I might actually die at this rate."

499
00:36:40,684 --> 00:36:42,722
That moment, I said this to Dr. Brain.

500
00:36:42,723 --> 00:36:44,223
"We must live. Let's hug each other."

501
00:36:44,223 --> 00:36:45,383
"We'll keep each other warm."

502
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:47,693
- So? You hugged each other?
- Yes.

503
00:36:47,693 --> 00:36:50,183
Yes. He held me in his arms like this.

504
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:51,854
How did that feel?

505
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:54,593
How did it feel? Well...

506
00:36:54,593 --> 00:36:58,433
He looks slim,
but he actually has a broad chest.

507
00:36:58,434 --> 00:36:59,973
It felt nice to be held in his arms.

508
00:36:59,973 --> 00:37:01,993
Women must love him for that.

509
00:37:03,044 --> 00:37:06,663
Right. Now, I know why he's so twisted.

510
00:37:09,584 --> 00:37:11,234
He's been through a lot.

511
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:14,243
Trauma? Why?

512
00:37:15,454 --> 00:37:19,343
The doors got locked,
and you couldn't get out?

513
00:37:27,464 --> 00:37:29,084
Yes, that's what happened.

514
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:31,993
They managed to get me out,

515
00:37:33,204 --> 00:37:34,603
but I don't remember anything.

516
00:37:34,604 --> 00:37:35,794
Not a thing?

517
00:37:36,903 --> 00:37:39,064
I don't remember the accident itself.

518
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:43,674
I just remember seeing someone
banging on the car doors.

519
00:37:44,084 --> 00:37:45,573
I vaguely remember that.

520
00:37:46,653 --> 00:37:48,073
How old were you?

521
00:37:49,053 --> 00:37:50,343
I was six.

522
00:37:50,954 --> 00:37:52,374
What do your parents say about it?

523
00:37:52,993 --> 00:37:54,544
They passed away...

524
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:56,763
because of that accident.

525
00:37:56,763 --> 00:37:59,463
He was only six when that happened.

526
00:37:59,464 --> 00:38:01,193
He's been all alone ever since then.

527
00:38:01,193 --> 00:38:04,033
Well, I heard his aunt
took good care of him,

528
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:05,434
but he must've been so lonely.

529
00:38:05,434 --> 00:38:08,424
He fought his loneliness, studied
hard, and became a scientist.

530
00:38:09,644 --> 00:38:11,064
But he got fired because of me.

531
00:38:11,303 --> 00:38:13,633
Gosh, I feel so bad.

532
00:38:15,274 --> 00:38:17,303
My heart breaks for him.

533
00:38:18,184 --> 00:38:21,253
You see, he's always so obnoxious,

534
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:23,274
but I can't stop worrying about him
for some reason.

535
00:38:24,124 --> 00:38:26,883
Is that why his eyes look so sad?

536
00:38:31,524 --> 00:38:32,754
Oh, my.

537
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:35,854
I was craving this so much,

538
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,233
but I can't eat all this alone.

539
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:39,604
If you eat this the next day,

540
00:38:39,604 --> 00:38:42,093
it will taste awful.

541
00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:45,342
You should've called me
and told me you were eating jokbal.

542
00:38:45,343 --> 00:38:46,943
You can't finish this alone.

543
00:38:46,943 --> 00:38:49,234
Us eating jokbal together? We don't
have that kind of relationship.

544
00:38:50,214 --> 00:38:53,644
Why not? Divorced couples are
not allowed to eat jokbal together?

545
00:38:53,783 --> 00:38:55,073
Is it illegal?

546
00:38:55,454 --> 00:38:57,214
- Gosh.
- Come on.

547
00:38:58,153 --> 00:39:00,323
Let's be cool about it, okay?

548
00:39:00,323 --> 00:39:01,722
Look at Hollywood actors.

549
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:04,814
They stay friends
even after they get divorced.

550
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:08,223
- Can't we do that?
- No, you can't.

551
00:39:08,234 --> 00:39:10,334
This is Korea, not the US.

552
00:39:10,334 --> 00:39:11,993
And Dad is so Korean.

553
00:39:12,033 --> 00:39:13,303
Is that a compliment or an insult?

554
00:39:13,303 --> 00:39:14,934
You have no idea.

555
00:39:14,934 --> 00:39:17,402
Your dad could easily live in Hollywood.

556
00:39:17,403 --> 00:39:18,743
Is that a compliment or an insult?

557
00:39:18,743 --> 00:39:21,173
You're the weird one. Why are you
so old-fashioned? You're young.

558
00:39:21,173 --> 00:39:23,104
Mom, why can't you act your age?

559
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:24,214
You always do whatever you want.

560
00:39:24,214 --> 00:39:25,613
What are you talking about?

561
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,283
I just wanted to eat fried chicken
with you. What's wrong with that?

562
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,923
That's what you want. You never asked me!

563
00:39:30,923 --> 00:39:34,124
Gosh, that's enough. Don't fight.
Let's just eat.

564
00:39:34,124 --> 00:39:35,984
- We aren't fighting.
- We aren't fighting.

565
00:39:36,564 --> 00:39:38,754
- You're not fighting?
- No.

566
00:39:38,763 --> 00:39:40,683
We're having a conversation.

567
00:39:40,993 --> 00:39:43,903
Gosh, I don't even know anymore.
I don't understand you ladies.

568
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:46,593
Gosh, I'm already exhausted.

(Captain Seul)

570
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:57,774
Hello, Captain Seul. I heard you woke up.

571
00:39:58,044 --> 00:40:00,743
I meant to call you to check in on you.

572
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:02,874
How are you feeling?

573
00:40:04,323 --> 00:40:06,283
Thankfully, I'm totally fine.

574
00:40:08,093 --> 00:40:10,154
Thank you for your concern.

575
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:12,513
Yes, I'm fine.

576
00:40:14,263 --> 00:40:15,624
Detective Geum.

577
00:40:17,204 --> 00:40:20,503
I called to talk to you about
something. Come to the hospital.

578
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:21,723
Now?

579
00:40:24,704 --> 00:40:27,163
Oh, no problem.

580
00:40:29,684 --> 00:40:33,303
But is it really you, Captain Seul?

581
00:40:36,653 --> 00:40:38,374
I have to step out.
You two can finish the food.

582
00:40:38,484 --> 00:40:39,624
Where are you going at this hour?

583
00:40:39,624 --> 00:40:41,283
Something's come up. I have to go.

584
00:40:42,653 --> 00:40:43,854
Oh, right.

585
00:40:46,294 --> 00:40:48,164
Don't stay out late. Take a taxi home.

586
00:40:48,164 --> 00:40:50,294
- Text Yi Na the plate number.
- What...

587
00:40:54,604 --> 00:40:57,933
Gosh, he sure is a detective.

588
00:41:05,414 --> 00:41:08,573
Tell me about your dad.
Has he been weird lately?

589
00:41:11,723 --> 00:41:15,314
Actually, I think
he has a crush on someone.

590
00:41:16,053 --> 00:41:19,183
Right? I knew it.

591
00:41:19,363 --> 00:41:21,154
How did you find out? Did you see her?

592
00:41:21,394 --> 00:41:22,584
Yes.

593
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:24,493
Really? Who is it?

594
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:26,964
I bet she's also a police officer.
What does she look like?

595
00:41:29,303 --> 00:41:30,493
Like this.

596
00:41:32,204 --> 00:41:34,143
Wait. But it's a man.

597
00:41:34,144 --> 00:41:37,004
I think Dad has feelings for him.

598
00:41:37,084 --> 00:41:39,633
- What?
- Actually, I'm certain of it.

599
00:41:39,883 --> 00:41:41,504
He can't stop talking about this guy.

(Korea National University Hospital)

601
00:41:49,394 --> 00:41:51,794
We backed him into a corner
with his brainwave test results,

602
00:41:51,794 --> 00:41:52,834
and he confessed.

603
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:54,064
Lee Jong Koo and Thoung...

604
00:41:54,064 --> 00:41:55,964
were handed over to the prosecution...

605
00:41:55,964 --> 00:41:57,553
for murder and damage to a body,
respectively.

606
00:41:58,104 --> 00:41:59,453
You did well.

607
00:42:01,573 --> 00:42:04,263
Actually, you did most of the work.

608
00:42:04,973 --> 00:42:07,803
Thanks to you and Dr. Brain,

609
00:42:08,343 --> 00:42:11,314
we figured out that the body
was Hoai's, not Thoung's.

610
00:42:11,314 --> 00:42:12,854
She almost had us fooled.

611
00:42:12,854 --> 00:42:16,004
How did you figure it out though?

612
00:42:16,184 --> 00:42:17,374
Her wallet.

613
00:42:18,984 --> 00:42:21,113
The photo holder was clean.

614
00:42:21,653 --> 00:42:23,894
It usually collects dust
if there's nothing in it,

615
00:42:23,894 --> 00:42:25,823
but it seemed as though
a photo had been pulled out.

616
00:42:25,823 --> 00:42:28,624
I thought it could've been tampered with.

617
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:31,593
I went to collect
a sample of Hoai's DNA just in case,

618
00:42:31,704 --> 00:42:34,694
but I couldn't find a brush,
makeup tools, or a toothbrush.

619
00:42:35,973 --> 00:42:38,234
Because Thoung
placed them around her house.

620
00:42:39,443 --> 00:42:40,734
I thought it was weird,

621
00:42:41,173 --> 00:42:43,633
and the photo of them together
confirmed my theory.

622
00:42:47,414 --> 00:42:49,203
They had the same tattoo.

623
00:42:49,584 --> 00:42:52,223
It could've confused even the boyfriend.

624
00:42:52,223 --> 00:42:56,153
That attention to detail!
Gosh, you did a fine job.

625
00:42:56,153 --> 00:42:59,394
Thanks to you, we were able
to swiftly close the case.

626
00:42:59,394 --> 00:43:02,354
I've always been good at my job.
I just chose not to brag about it.

627
00:43:04,633 --> 00:43:07,064
Right, of course.

628
00:43:07,803 --> 00:43:10,464
I guess you're now going
to brag about your work.

629
00:43:14,414 --> 00:43:15,834
I'll let you get some rest.

630
00:43:16,073 --> 00:43:17,714
Where should I put these?

631
00:43:17,714 --> 00:43:19,604
You can leave it over there,
Detective Geum.

632
00:43:19,714 --> 00:43:22,404
Sure. Now that I have briefed you,
I'll get going.

633

Take care, Detective.

You were right.

That's right.

our connection. Why do you ask?

Out of the blue, he sent Ha Ru a letter.

It's good that you didn't.
He shouldn't read this.

666
00:45:40,055 --> 00:45:42,645
I only took it
because it gave me a bad feeling.

May I ask why?

668
00:45:46,455 --> 00:45:49,484
Because he's evil. He's destructive.

in contact with him for a while...

he encouraged two guards and
a few inmates to commit suicide.

675
00:46:11,885 --> 00:46:13,944
Because of that he was moved
to solitary confinement.

Guards are on constant rotation
for their own safety.

he'd be a bad influence on Ha Ru?

A brain remodeling.

806
00:54:29,845 --> 00:54:31,444
- A brain remodeling?
- A brain remodeling?

807
00:54:31,484 --> 00:54:34,344
That's the easy way of putting it.

808
00:54:35,124 --> 00:54:38,293
Some people suffer a change
in personality after brain trauma.

809
00:54:38,294 --> 00:54:41,515
The most famous case
is of American Phineas Gage.

810
00:54:42,024 --> 00:54:44,794
He was a railroad construction foreman,

811
00:54:44,794 --> 00:54:46,165
and an explosion...

812
00:54:46,165 --> 00:54:49,495
drove a rod in under his left eye
and out the top of his head.

813
00:54:50,064 --> 00:54:52,205
His left frontal lobe was badly damaged,

814
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,694
and he was blinded in one eye,
but he survived.

815
00:54:55,274 --> 00:54:57,174
However, after his miraculous recovery,

816
00:54:57,174 --> 00:55:01,035
his friends and colleagues
said this about him.

817
00:55:01,714 --> 00:55:04,075
"That's no longer Phineas Gage."

818
00:55:05,285 --> 00:55:07,455
The hard-working, kind man...

819
00:55:07,455 --> 00:55:09,484
had become fickle, temperamental,

820
00:55:09,484 --> 00:55:11,423
and impulsive.

821
00:55:11,424 --> 00:55:13,154
He'd become a pseudo-psychopath,

822
00:55:13,154 --> 00:55:16,214
a person with the characteristics
of a psychopath.

823
00:55:16,694 --> 00:55:18,955
Then the captain too...

824
00:55:20,395 --> 00:55:22,264
I'd say it's a similar case.

825
00:55:22,265 --> 00:55:25,294
The nail entered her prefrontal lobe,

826
00:55:25,774 --> 00:55:28,064
and that the part that manages fear.

827
00:55:29,874 --> 00:55:33,734
Her prefrontal lobe's cortex
is way less active than is normal.

828
00:55:34,274 --> 00:55:36,904
She's unable to judge
or acknowledge fearful situations.

829
00:55:37,544 --> 00:55:40,674
That's similar to what you'd see
in a psychopath's brain.

Captain Seul.

833
00:55:59,305 --> 00:56:01,294
She said she wanted to
live like someone else.

834
00:56:01,944 --> 00:56:03,535
Her wish came true.

835
00:56:04,174 --> 00:56:07,504
It could be temporary. Let's wait and see.

836
00:56:08,245 --> 00:56:10,335
What if it's not temporary?

837
00:56:10,745 --> 00:56:12,105
What if she doesn't recover?

838
00:56:13,814 --> 00:56:15,515
You'll have to be careful.

839
00:56:15,555 --> 00:56:18,193
If she turned into a real psychopath...

840
00:56:18,194 --> 00:56:19,294
it wouldn't end with a shoulder throw...

841
00:56:19,294 --> 00:56:21,855
or a report to Internal Affairs.
