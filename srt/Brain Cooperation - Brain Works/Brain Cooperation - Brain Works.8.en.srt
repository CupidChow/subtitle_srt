she touched the trophy

Then both of them
should be considered suspects.

Heo Bum Soo's motive though.

so he hit him with the trophy?

from Heo Bum Soo's running shoes.

He barged into his neighbor's home
with shoes on,

These are Kim Jae Sook's footprints.
She was wearing socks.

101
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:42,896
The problem is
the direction of these footprints.

102
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:47,166
The blood spatter was found
just next to where Heo was standing.

103
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,336
It doesn't match the angle at which
the neighbor's head was hit.

Heo Bum Soo loses it...

You see, I've been
under a lot of stress lately.

164
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:57,895
All of a sudden, I'm experiencing
these symptoms too.

165
00:11:01,935 --> 00:11:04,865
I cannot take a polygraph test...

166
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:06,265
in my current state.

167
00:11:07,646 --> 00:11:09,206
If you refuse to take the test,

168
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:11,085
you may seem suspicious.

169
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:12,846
Even if you suspect me,
it can't be helped.

170
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:16,415
At the moment, I'm in no condition
to take the test.

171
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:21,346
Sure, that's fine.

172
00:11:22,195 --> 00:11:23,486
I'll take the test.

173
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:31,326
We'll get started now.

174
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:37,535
Who hit him with the trophy?

175
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:46,005
Mr. Heo.

176
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:50,275
Who hit Mr. Lee Chang Yong
with the trophy?

177
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,615
It was me.

178
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,125
I did it.

179
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:18,405
It says he's telling the truth.

180
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,515
Goodness. What is going on?

182
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:31,716
Oh, boy. So he killed him?

183
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:34,385
You can certainly fool a polygraph.

184
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:36,335
It's easy to fool a machine,

185
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:37,795
but you can't fool your brain.

186
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,466
You see, the brain is...

187
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:44,436
Nice.

188
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,175
What are you doing here?

189
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:48,706
Hi, honey.

190
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,545
Hey, what is this?

191
00:12:50,546 --> 00:12:53,715
Oh. When I met her at the award ceremony,

192
00:12:53,715 --> 00:12:55,505
I asked her to come
and install this for us.

193
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:58,375
I wanted to take the burden off
Captain Seul's shoulders.

194
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,496
Good thinking, right?

What?

What is it?

00:13:08,465 --> 00:13:11,056
Oh, my. You're very handsome.

199

Hello, handsome neuroscientist.

200
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:18,945
At the award ceremony,
I didn't even see you leave.

201
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:22,165
You left very quickly.

202
00:13:24,146 --> 00:13:25,875
I didn't want to stay there.

203
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:33,346
Captain Seul as known as
Ms. Surrogate Drinker. Hello.

204
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:38,586
We'll see each other often from now on.

205
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:40,255
Why is that?

206
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,636
Oh, I guess you don't know.

207
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:46,435
These days,
water system field coordinators...

208

disinfect the filters
and check the machine regularly.

209

We're supposed to do it once a month.

210
00:13:51,945 --> 00:13:55,635
But since my ex-husband works here,

211
00:13:55,845 --> 00:13:58,706
you get special treatment.
I'll visit seven days a week!

212
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:02,626
What? So you'll come here every day?
What's this about? Forget it.

213
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:05,085
Hey, water system field coordinator.
If you're done, please leave.

214
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:06,526
I must do another check
to make sure it works.

215
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:09,195
It works fine. I checked
and made sure. Get going already.

216
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:10,725
- Enjoy the clean water...
- Go.

217
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,536
- Wait, I'll call you tomorrow.
- You need to leave.

218
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:16,165
- Hey, I'm doing my job!
- Goodness. Have you lost your mind?

219
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,236
This is my place of work.

220
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:18,536
So what if it is?

221
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:20,636
Can't your ex-wife
install your water purifier?

222
00:14:20,636 --> 00:14:22,236
- Is it against the law?
- It is.

223
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,845
It's absolutely illegal, so leave.

224
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:25,696
- Go.
- Honey.

225
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:27,936
- Honey.
- Get going.

226
00:14:28,246 --> 00:14:31,375
- Honey, let's hurry home.
- What are you doing?

227
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:33,375
We're going to watch an adult movie.

Come on.

229
00:14:36,786 --> 00:14:38,725
- Keep your eyes ahead.
- Let's go home.

230
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:40,724
- Unbelievable.
- Come on, let's...

231
00:14:40,725 --> 00:14:44,056
Chief Kim, couldn't you have
discussed this with me?

232
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:46,896
What's wrong? She gave us
the friends and family discount,

233
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:48,665
and it's cheaper than ordering bottles.

234
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,226
That's not what I mean.

235
00:14:51,536 --> 00:14:54,105
She's not even my wife. She's my ex-wife.

236
00:14:54,105 --> 00:14:56,776
Imagine how it would be
for me to see her at work.

237
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:58,406
Right, I guess it would be uncomfortable.

238
00:14:58,406 --> 00:15:00,306
That's an understatement!

239
00:15:03,616 --> 00:15:05,905
Should I tell you
the neuroscientific way...

240
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:07,606
to resolve the awkwardness?

241
00:15:08,386 --> 00:15:10,645
- Does such a thing exist?
- Of course.

242
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:13,986
Dr. Brain, you genius. What can I do?

243
00:15:15,626 --> 00:15:18,986
Get your brain to think that
she doesn't make you uncomfortable.

244
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:21,186
Have a good day.

245
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:25,465
Get my brain to think
she doesn't make things awkward?

246
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:26,506
What does he mean by that?

247
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:28,876
You should have your brain think that...

248
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:30,295
she doesn't make you uncomfortable.

249
00:15:30,605 --> 00:15:31,795
You know,

250
00:15:32,605 --> 00:15:34,075
anyone could've told you that,

251
00:15:34,075 --> 00:15:36,046
but he makes it sound insightful.

252
00:15:36,046 --> 00:15:37,336
You should work on it.

253
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:38,875
Maybe I should.

254
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:41,676
I don't find my ex-wife uncomfortable.

255
00:15:42,486 --> 00:15:43,816
I don't find her uncomfortable.

256
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:45,885
- She makes me uncomfortable.
- What?

257
00:15:45,886 --> 00:15:47,716
No, I should try harder.

258
00:15:47,955 --> 00:15:49,615
I don't find my ex-wife uncomfortable.

259
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:51,216
I don't find her uncomfortable.

00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:58,895
I don't find my ex-wife uncomfortable.

261
00:16:00,105 --> 00:16:02,295
I don't find her uncomfortable.

262
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,295
I don't find Mo Ran uncomfortable.

263
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:08,365
I don't find my ex-wife uncomfortable.

264
00:16:15,815 --> 00:16:17,955
- What's wrong?
- I want to get going.

265
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:19,655
When we're already here?

266
00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:21,054
I'm tired, that's all.

267
00:16:21,055 --> 00:16:23,385
I'm just not in the mood today.

268
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:26,396
- Let's talk inside.
- Why should I go inside?

269
00:16:26,396 --> 00:16:27,586
Why not?

270
00:16:28,036 --> 00:16:29,255
- We...
- Honey!

271
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:31,755
Honey?

272
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:34,795
Why you...

273
00:16:35,935 --> 00:16:38,046
Detective Geum, please hold back.

274
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:39,635
No, let me go.

275
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:44,905
I knew you'd come.

276
00:16:45,146 --> 00:16:47,275
- Unbelievable.
- That's him.

277
00:16:48,185 --> 00:16:50,756
Congratulations, Myung Se, darling.

278
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:52,115
Come on, get off me.

279
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:55,216
What do you say?

280
00:16:57,126 --> 00:17:00,726
How about a trip down memory lane?

281
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:03,726
Go, lady. Leave.

282
00:17:05,935 --> 00:17:08,495
I don't find my ex-wife uncomfortable.

283
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,265
I don't find Mo Ran uncomfortable.

284
00:17:16,345 --> 00:17:17,636
I don't...

285
00:17:19,216 --> 00:17:20,256
My ex-wife...

286
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:21,786
Darn, she makes me uncomfortable!

287
00:17:21,786 --> 00:17:25,146
The more I say it,
the more I think about her.

288
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:28,486
The image of her
keeps floating inside my head.

289
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:30,486
Dr. Brain...

290
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:32,416
Help me!

291
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:45,396
Okay, here's an empty space.

292
00:17:54,016 --> 00:17:55,206
What the...

293
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:58,545
Are you kidding me?

294
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:08,555
Dr. Brain, didn't you see
I was getting ready to park here?

295
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:12,956
I spotted a car dawdling
that didn't have its blinkers on.

296
00:18:13,575 --> 00:18:15,626
Shouldn't detectives be better drivers?

297
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,765
Why did I stop him from leaving?
I should've let him go his way.

298
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:23,575
I must've been insane.

299
00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:28,105
Look here, Dr. Brain. This is bad.

300
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:31,775
Why are you making a fuss
over a parking space?

301
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,416
No, I'm talking about something
that is really bad.

302
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:37,956
I can't stop thinking about my ex-wife.

303
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:43,165
I tried my best not to think
about her, but I couldn't,

304
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,334
and it's been haunting me.
What's going on?

305
00:18:45,335 --> 00:18:46,666
It's only natural.

306
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:49,275
Our brains...

307
00:18:49,276 --> 00:18:51,636
aren't familiar
with the concept of denial.

308
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:54,035
It's why you can't tell them
to stop doing something.

309
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:57,835
If you tell someone
not to think about elephants,

310
00:18:58,016 --> 00:19:00,176
that person will keep picturing elephants.

311
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:06,585
Exactly, and it's killing me!

312
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:09,886
Hold on a second.

313
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:12,295
Did you tell me that
knowing what it'd do to me?

314
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:13,855
Yes, exactly.

315
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:16,025
To mess with me?

316
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:18,095
You finally caught on.

317
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:20,736
It's a commonly known fact
in neuroscience,

318
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:21,966
but you didn't know.

319
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,696
Your lack of knowledge had you suffering.

320
00:19:28,815 --> 00:19:30,436
Why that little...

321
00:19:31,115 --> 00:19:33,706
Was I being played by him all night?

322
00:19:33,986 --> 00:19:35,176
Unbelievable.

00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:38,345

Forensics came back with the analysis...

325
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:42,325
on the next-door neighbor's phone.

326
00:19:42,325 --> 00:19:43,796
A strange photo was found.

327
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:45,156
A strange photo?

328
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:52,215
That phone was on
the next-door neighbor's phone?

329
00:19:53,765 --> 00:19:56,034
They were obviously having a fling.

330
00:19:56,035 --> 00:19:57,995
A fling like teenagers?

331
00:19:58,065 --> 00:19:59,755
This is adultery.

332

I meant that it disgusts me.

Whether it's a fling or adultery,

336
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:13,876
this is the motive for Heo Bum Soo.

337
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:17,416
It could also be Kim Jae Sook's motive.

338
00:20:17,855 --> 00:20:20,245
She killed him
to keep her affair a secret.

339
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:24,864
Ms. Kim seemed overwhelmed with guilt.

340
00:20:24,865 --> 00:20:28,235
It could be for killing the man
or for having the affair.

341
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:30,426
Cheating on your spouse
doesn't make you a killer.

342
00:20:30,436 --> 00:20:31,725
Gosh.

to find out who the killer is?

346
00:20:48,656 --> 00:20:49,906
There is.

347
00:20:50,726 --> 00:20:53,315
There's a neuroscientific way
to figure out...

348
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,186
why Ms. Kim is guilty.

349
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,365
We have clear evidence...

350
00:20:59,365 --> 00:21:01,156
that points to your husband's motive.

It wasn't like that between us.

While my husband
had an affair with Cherri,

354
00:21:13,476 --> 00:21:17,136
I got close to my neighbor
out of spite. That's all.

355
00:21:17,746 --> 00:21:20,514
Who knew my husband's affair
was the result of an illness?

00:21:20,515 --> 00:21:21,775
Right.

357

We understand the level of betrayal
you must've felt.

Why you cheated on your husband
isn't important here.

359

What matters is that we have proof
of your husband's crime.

360
00:21:34,136 --> 00:21:37,656
Your husband will be indicted
for the murder of Lee Chang Yong.

361
00:21:41,575 --> 00:21:44,636
How many years in prison
will he be sentenced to?

362
00:21:45,206 --> 00:21:48,535
At least 35 years.

Did you say 35 years?

364

No way.

That's absurd.

366
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:01,245
My husband isn't a brutal killer.

367
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:03,686
Self-defense.

368
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,755
That's right. It was self-defense.

369

There is no evidence...

370
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:12,656
that points to a struggle
between the two men,

371
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,995
and the victim didn't fight back.

372
00:22:15,676 --> 00:22:18,105
Mr. Lee was killed
due to being struck in the head...

373
00:22:18,105 --> 00:22:19,245
from behind.

374
00:22:19,246 --> 00:22:21,136
It can't be self-defense.

Your spasms seem severe.

is causing them.

00:30:19,156 --> 00:30:21,285
like blood, tissue, or DNA,

485
00:30:24,996 --> 00:30:26,856
was not found at all.

486
00:30:27,396 --> 00:30:30,485
Other than Ms. Kim's prints,
it was completely clean.

487
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:31,955
Very clean.

488
00:30:34,075 --> 00:30:36,605
You talked about it being murderous.

489
00:30:36,605 --> 00:30:38,235
You got ahead of yourself.

490
00:30:39,075 --> 00:30:40,916
You're the one who got excited,

491
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:43,205
calling it crucial evidence and what not.

492
00:30:45,216 --> 00:30:46,775
Not again.

493
00:30:50,055 --> 00:30:51,846
She threw out this trophy...

494
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:55,045
because seeing it tormented her.

495
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:57,586
She'd smashed the speakers.

496
00:30:57,795 --> 00:31:01,186
I think she flew into a rage
whenever she heard Cherri's voice.

497
00:31:01,966 --> 00:31:05,926
Ms. Kim's state suggests
she's under great duress.

498
00:31:09,275 --> 00:31:11,896
The NFS sent over
the trace analysis report.

499
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:17,406
They found a fiber underneath
the victim's fingernail.

500
00:31:18,886 --> 00:31:20,076
This is it.

501
00:31:26,555 --> 00:31:28,886
- Bye, then.
- Bye.

502
00:31:35,365 --> 00:31:37,626
Oh, I get it.

503
00:31:38,305 --> 00:31:40,725
What Ms. Kim left with that day.

504
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:51,636
The day you saw us outside,

505
00:31:51,886 --> 00:31:53,505
you left this at the dry cleaner's.

506
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:56,045
Though it looks like
you brought it with you...

507
00:31:56,256 --> 00:31:58,446
to throw away but not to have it washed.

508
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:01,186
Either way, I picked it up...

509
00:32:01,456 --> 00:32:04,386
and tested it with luminol
and found blood.

510
00:32:04,565 --> 00:32:06,555
In a straight line like this.

511
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,485
We compared the DNA,

512
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:10,785
and it was Lee Chang Yong's.

513
00:32:12,006 --> 00:32:14,255
It got on me when I was
standing next to him.

514
00:32:16,075 --> 00:32:19,696
Why didn't you hand this in
when we collected the evidence?

515
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:24,265
Gosh.

516
00:32:27,085 --> 00:32:28,275
I feel weird.

517
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:32,916
I think this arm went numb.

518
00:32:33,726 --> 00:32:35,215
Do you need medical help?

519
00:32:36,256 --> 00:32:38,386
Just a moment. Ms. Kim?

520
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,985
How about...

521
00:32:43,065 --> 00:32:44,326
I do this?

522
00:32:47,105 --> 00:32:48,626
What was that about?

523
00:32:49,976 --> 00:32:51,836
You evaded the pen.

524
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,765
Your arm isn't numb.

525
00:32:54,545 --> 00:32:56,505
I really can't move.

526
00:32:57,045 --> 00:32:58,235
Exactly.

527
00:32:58,545 --> 00:33:01,176
You feel like you're paralyzed.

528
00:33:01,555 --> 00:33:04,715
I think it's a conversion disorder.

529
00:33:05,156 --> 00:33:06,486
Sudden trauma,

530
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:09,215
psychological conflict, or duress...

531
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:11,416
can cause such symptoms.

532
00:33:11,795 --> 00:33:13,196
You feel numb,

533
00:33:13,196 --> 00:33:15,996
or your motor skills feel inhibited.

534
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:18,696
If it gets worse,
it could trigger a seizure too.

535
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:22,235
It's different from the common
paralysis and convulsions...

536
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:25,866
because the symptoms go away
once your anxiety disappears.

537
00:33:26,676 --> 00:33:27,965
In other words,

538
00:33:28,515 --> 00:33:30,965
the only remedy that can cure you...

539
00:33:31,815 --> 00:33:33,106
is the truth.

540
00:33:34,216 --> 00:33:37,576
Tell us the truth about that day.

541
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:41,586
It wasn't me.

542
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:46,455
As you can see, I'm not well.

543
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:49,025
I should get going.

544
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:54,866
Then we'll hand your husband over,
and the prosecutors will indict him.

545
00:33:55,305 --> 00:33:57,465
Are you okay with him being sent
to the detention center?

546
00:34:01,676 --> 00:34:04,246
Are you okay? Let me help you up.

547
00:34:04,246 --> 00:34:05,535
No.

548
00:34:06,446 --> 00:34:07,805
I can't get up.

549
00:34:08,815 --> 00:34:10,305
I can't move.

550
00:34:15,256 --> 00:34:18,786
You'll be able to get up
once you tell us the truth.

551
00:34:23,866 --> 00:34:26,295
Fine! It was me.

552
00:34:26,966 --> 00:34:29,426
I hit him with the trophy.

553
00:34:30,906 --> 00:34:32,835
I killed him.

554
00:34:35,245 --> 00:34:37,335
I killed him.

555
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:49,854
I ran into my neighbor
on my way home from my workout...

556
00:34:50,763 --> 00:34:52,763
at dawn.

557
00:34:55,944 --> 00:34:57,393
You see, I had made a mistake.

558
00:34:59,513 --> 00:35:01,073
I had been avoiding him ever since then.

559
00:35:01,073 --> 00:35:02,573
I didn't attend the club meetings either.

560
00:35:03,743 --> 00:35:06,604
Naturally, we started talking
about my husband.

561
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:09,643
What a bizarre disorder.

562
00:35:10,823 --> 00:35:13,013
You must've been very upset.

563
00:35:13,394 --> 00:35:15,183
What's even weirder is that...

564
00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:17,683
you have to have strong feelings
for someone...

565
00:35:17,894 --> 00:35:20,024
In other words, you have to love
that person very much...

566
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:22,604
for you to mistake them for someone else.

567
00:35:22,604 --> 00:35:24,723
For Cherri or an alien, for example.

568
00:35:27,403 --> 00:35:30,794
Then if you develop that condition,

569
00:35:31,403 --> 00:35:33,203
you could think I'm an alien.

570
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:36,703
Right?

571
00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:40,343
We had fun last time.

572
00:35:40,984 --> 00:35:43,873
Back then, I thought
my husband was cheating on me.

573
00:35:44,153 --> 00:35:45,714
That happened on the spur of the moment.

574
00:35:46,993 --> 00:35:50,984
It doesn't matter how it happened.
You two cheated on each other.

575
00:35:51,794 --> 00:35:54,453
Whether it was caused
by an illness or confusion.

576
00:35:55,064 --> 00:35:56,294
What are you doing?

577
00:35:56,734 --> 00:35:58,354
My husband will hear us.

578
00:35:59,234 --> 00:36:00,964
Come on.

579
00:36:03,504 --> 00:36:04,734
Honey.

580
00:36:07,144 --> 00:36:08,404
What are you two doing?

581
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:10,404
Honey, it's...

582
00:36:10,613 --> 00:36:11,904
What is going on?

583
00:36:12,283 --> 00:36:15,473
Goodness. You heard everything. Why ask?

584
00:36:16,624 --> 00:36:18,843
Fine, forget it.

585
00:36:20,354 --> 00:36:24,092
You cheated on her with Cherri too.

586
00:36:24,093 --> 00:36:25,354
So...

587
00:36:25,964 --> 00:36:27,854
just call it even, okay?

588
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:29,893
Call it even.

589
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:35,763
He followed him into his place,
and they started fighting.

590
00:36:36,703 --> 00:36:37,893
Hey!

591
00:36:38,774 --> 00:36:40,163
Darn it.

592
00:36:40,644 --> 00:36:43,143
Old habits die hard.
You hit on my wife, didn't you?

593
00:36:43,144 --> 00:36:45,044
All the neighbors know
that you're a philanderer.

594
00:36:45,044 --> 00:36:47,203
Look who's talking.
Didn't you cheat on her too?

595
00:36:47,314 --> 00:36:49,053
You cheated on her with Cherri.

596
00:36:49,053 --> 00:36:50,913
- Don't act all innocent.
- What can I do for you?

597
00:36:51,053 --> 00:36:53,183
That is not called cheating!

598
00:36:53,653 --> 00:36:55,183
I was ill.

599
00:36:55,894 --> 00:36:57,783
As if.

600
00:36:58,464 --> 00:37:00,584
- Oh, boy.
- You piece of...

601
00:37:01,464 --> 00:37:04,723
Gosh, what's your problem? You little...

602
00:37:05,164 --> 00:37:06,864
- What can I do for you?
- Shall I teach you a lesson?

603
00:37:08,473 --> 00:37:09,734
You see,

604
00:37:10,504 --> 00:37:12,864
this world is full of easy women
like your wife.

605
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,973
I can't believe
you fell for a virtual human.

606
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,914
What? Cherri?

607
00:37:17,914 --> 00:37:20,703
- What can I do for you?
- You fell in love with Cherri?

608
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:24,424
- Oh, there she is. Your girlfriend.
- What can I do for you?

609
00:37:24,424 --> 00:37:26,944
My goodness. You are...

610
00:37:27,153 --> 00:37:29,183
the biggest loser I've ever seen.

611
00:37:34,464 --> 00:37:37,663
He was ill. Don't you dare talk
to my husband in that manner!

612
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,964
Why you...

613
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:03,254
Honey, what do we do?

614
00:38:04,664 --> 00:38:05,884
What should we do?

615
00:38:07,933 --> 00:38:09,154
I think...

616
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,464
he's dead.

617
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:42,294
What are you doing?

618
00:38:42,604 --> 00:38:43,823
I did this.

619
00:38:46,174 --> 00:38:47,393
Honey.

620
00:38:51,073 --> 00:38:52,334
Listen carefully.

621
00:38:52,973 --> 00:38:54,364
I did this.

622
00:38:55,984 --> 00:38:57,604
It was all me!

623
00:38:58,444 --> 00:38:59,743
Okay?

624
00:39:00,383 --> 00:39:01,843
What are you talking about?

625
00:39:02,653 --> 00:39:04,214
When we got married,

626
00:39:04,823 --> 00:39:06,584
I promised to protect you
for the rest of my life.

627
00:39:08,524 --> 00:39:10,654
I will protect you.

628
00:39:15,294 --> 00:39:16,794
My husband...

629
00:39:18,763 --> 00:39:20,623
turned himself in to take the fall for me.

630
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:26,263
I was the one who hit him with the trophy.

631
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:28,803
I killed him.

632
00:39:32,653 --> 00:39:33,873
You can feel it too, right?

633
00:39:34,683 --> 00:39:38,274
Your symptoms are going away
now that you've told us the truth.

634
00:39:44,694 --> 00:39:45,884
Detective.

635
00:39:46,493 --> 00:39:47,823
Please...

636
00:39:48,863 --> 00:39:50,323
let my husband go at once.

637
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:54,823
Yes, okay.

638
00:40:07,814 --> 00:40:09,413
I'm okay.

639
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:12,984
Why did you do that?

640
00:40:13,723 --> 00:40:15,413
I said I'd protect you.

641
00:40:15,993 --> 00:40:18,913
I told myself I should stay strong
and stick to the story.

642
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:22,893
But the more I told myself that,
the harder it got.

643
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,354
My body refused it.

644
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:28,464
I feel much better now.

645
00:40:29,573 --> 00:40:33,433
Since I came here,
my spasms have completely gone away,

646
00:40:36,013 --> 00:40:37,703
and I can sleep comfortably at night.

647
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,604
I'm sorry.

648
00:40:43,553 --> 00:40:45,343
I developed such a bizarre disorder...

649
00:40:47,953 --> 00:40:49,413
and gave you the wrong idea.

650
00:40:52,164 --> 00:40:53,783
I ruined everything.

651
00:40:56,504 --> 00:41:00,093
No. Thanks to your condition,

652
00:41:01,703 --> 00:41:03,033
I realized...

653
00:41:04,144 --> 00:41:06,033
that we never saw eye to eye...

654
00:41:08,414 --> 00:41:09,973
although we truly care for each other.

655
00:41:15,283 --> 00:41:16,544
Why was it...

656
00:41:18,223 --> 00:41:19,984
so hard to say this?

657
00:41:23,664 --> 00:41:24,953
I'm sorry.

658
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,493
For...

659
00:41:31,964 --> 00:41:33,294
making you lonely.

660
00:41:51,823 --> 00:41:53,214
It's such a mystery.

661
00:41:54,894 --> 00:41:58,513
How did Heo Bum Soo
pass the polygraph test?

662
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:01,424
Because his brain believed
that it was true.

663
00:42:02,234 --> 00:42:04,323
If your brain completely deceives you...

664
00:42:04,464 --> 00:42:06,123
into believing that you killed someone,

665
00:42:06,374 --> 00:42:08,924
the polygraph could say it's true.

666
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:12,134
He loves her so much that he managed
to completely fool his brain.

667
00:42:13,314 --> 00:42:15,973
Even though they were
in a sexless marriage for years.

668
00:42:17,984 --> 00:42:21,544
To me, you are more of a mystery.

669
00:42:23,354 --> 00:42:24,823
He's someone who is beneath you...

670
00:42:24,823 --> 00:42:27,013
intellectually, financially, physically,

671
00:42:27,194 --> 00:42:29,354
and in every other way.

672
00:42:29,564 --> 00:42:30,894
On top of that,
he has a brat of a daughter...

673
00:42:30,894 --> 00:42:32,154
in middle school.

674
00:42:32,164 --> 00:42:33,884
But your love system activated for him.

675
00:42:34,334 --> 00:42:35,524
Was it that obvious?

676
00:42:36,533 --> 00:42:38,453
You make it seem obvious.

677
00:42:38,564 --> 00:42:39,893
Only a fool wouldn't know.

678
00:42:41,903 --> 00:42:43,834
Why hasn't Detective Geum
caught on though?

679
00:42:43,973 --> 00:42:45,234
Because he's a fool.

680
00:42:48,144 --> 00:42:49,334
He's a fool.

681
00:42:54,084 --> 00:42:55,973
How do I approach this fool, then?

682
00:42:58,354 --> 00:42:59,614
People like him...

683
00:43:00,024 --> 00:43:02,084
must hear it in words.

684
00:43:03,564 --> 00:43:04,884
I should confess my feelings?

685
00:43:04,924 --> 00:43:06,123
That's right.

686
00:43:06,863 --> 00:43:10,493
By the way, I can share
a neuroscientific way...

687
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:11,823
that will increase your odds.

688
00:43:12,504 --> 00:43:14,323
How much will it cost me?

689
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:16,364
Since it's my last day here,

690
00:43:16,774 --> 00:43:18,864
this one will be on the house.

691
00:43:20,613 --> 00:43:23,734
I feel terrible
when I think about Mr. Heo.

692
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:25,952
I get why he did it.

693
00:43:25,953 --> 00:43:29,203
Who knew you were such a romantic?

694
00:43:29,254 --> 00:43:32,052
Could you also take the fall
for your cheating spouse?

695
00:43:32,053 --> 00:43:33,413
That's not what I meant.

696
00:43:33,593 --> 00:43:36,294
I get why he fell in love
with a virtual person.

697
00:43:36,294 --> 00:43:38,053
I see.

698
00:43:38,723 --> 00:43:40,984
Even without that weird syndrome,

699
00:43:41,164 --> 00:43:44,093
I might be able
to fall in love with her as well.

700
00:43:44,703 --> 00:43:46,924
You can hear her voice
even from the rice cooker.

701
00:43:47,403 --> 00:43:50,294
I was scooping rice one day
when she told me...

702
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,243
to enjoy the food.

(Neuroscientific Investigation Team)

704
00:43:53,573 --> 00:43:55,533
I almost burst into tears.

705
00:43:56,183 --> 00:43:59,073
Only Cherri speaks to me
with that much warmth.

706
00:43:59,683 --> 00:44:01,453
In Japan,

707
00:44:01,453 --> 00:44:04,854
there are men who marry
virtual people like her.

708
00:44:04,854 --> 00:44:06,044
Is that so?

709
00:44:06,694 --> 00:44:09,664
Why don't I start obsessing
over Cherri, then?

710
00:44:09,664 --> 00:44:10,823
I urge you to hold back,

711
00:44:10,823 --> 00:44:12,964
or your wife might bash your head in.

712

Shall we?

713
00:44:20,674 --> 00:44:21,864
Hold on.

714
00:44:22,774 --> 00:44:26,634
What were you two secretly discussing?

715
00:44:27,343 --> 00:44:30,404
Something that you will
greatly appreciate.

the Neuroscientific Investigation Team.

718
00:44:35,683 --> 00:44:36,683
We set up a press conference...

719
00:44:36,683 --> 00:44:39,124
at which you will speak
on behalf of the team.

720
00:44:39,124 --> 00:44:40,544
- I refuse.
- Sorry?

721
00:44:41,354 --> 00:44:42,683
But why?

722
00:44:43,024 --> 00:44:44,823
You love to seem superior.

723
00:44:44,823 --> 00:44:46,354
How many times must I tell you...

724
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:48,683
that I don't seem superior? I just am.

725
00:44:49,433 --> 00:44:51,004
And like I said,

726
00:44:51,004 --> 00:44:53,464
now that the case has been wrapped up,

727
00:44:53,703 --> 00:44:55,024
I will get going.

But...

729
00:45:04,714 --> 00:45:06,814
Don't just stand there
and get him to stay.

730

Dr. Brain, come on.

00:45:16,194 --> 00:45:18,093
If there's anything you need,
just tell me.

734
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:20,093
I'll pay for it out of my own pocket.

(Keep Quiet)

736
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:23,694
There is something I want.

737
00:45:24,164 --> 00:45:25,703
What is it? Just tell me.

738
00:45:25,703 --> 00:45:28,663
I'll take out a loan in dollars
to get you what you want.

739
00:45:28,734 --> 00:45:30,564
I want you to leave.

740
00:45:31,703 --> 00:45:34,174
Hold on. Let me say this again.

741
00:45:34,174 --> 00:45:36,174
This is my place of work.

742
00:45:36,743 --> 00:45:39,873
If anyone should leave, it should be you.

743
00:45:40,183 --> 00:45:42,203
It's why I'm leaving. So what's the issue?

744
00:45:42,653 --> 00:45:43,973
You're a weird one.

745
00:45:45,453 --> 00:45:47,044
But that's not what I meant.

746
00:45:47,053 --> 00:45:48,544
Are you really leaving us?

747
00:45:48,794 --> 00:45:50,363
But we grew close while working together.

748
00:45:50,363 --> 00:45:51,524
How about a drink?

749
00:45:51,524 --> 00:45:53,064
If not, how about a meal?

750
00:45:53,064 --> 00:45:54,453
Beef. It'll be on me.

751
00:45:56,763 --> 00:45:59,194
He's just leaving
without even considering my offer.

752
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:00,773
He's going to turn around.

753
00:46:00,774 --> 00:46:02,064
He's going to turn around.

754
00:46:02,133 --> 00:46:03,464
Turn around.

755
00:46:03,573 --> 00:46:05,364
Turn around.

00:46:07,914 --> 00:46:09,104
(Keep Quiet)

757
00:46:10,243 --> 00:46:13,004
I can't believe he didn't
glance back in my direction.

758
00:46:16,653 --> 00:46:18,944
Could I have grown attached to him?

759
00:46:19,354 --> 00:46:20,984
Why am I sad to see him leave?

760
00:46:25,064 --> 00:46:26,254
Your last case?

761
00:46:28,093 --> 00:46:29,283
But why?

762
00:46:30,263 --> 00:46:31,263
Why not consult on more cases?

763
00:46:31,263 --> 00:46:32,433
You're the one who said it was weird.

764
00:46:32,433 --> 00:46:34,403
That was because you preached revenge,

765
00:46:34,403 --> 00:46:36,864
which wasn't like you at all.

766
00:46:37,144 --> 00:46:39,774
You seemed to be immersed
in solving cases these days,

767
00:46:39,774 --> 00:46:40,964
so why did you quit?

768
00:46:41,774 --> 00:46:43,104
I guess you're right.

769
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:45,543
I wouldn't have come across
someone with Capgras syndrome...

770
00:46:45,544 --> 00:46:47,803
had I been cooped up
at the research center.

771
00:46:48,754 --> 00:46:51,044
That reminds me. How did the case unravel?

772
00:46:52,484 --> 00:46:54,084
The wife was the killer.

773
00:46:55,493 --> 00:46:57,194
Her husband Heo Bum Soo,
who was the patient,

774
00:46:57,194 --> 00:46:59,023
took the fall for his wife.

775
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,384
I see.

776
00:47:02,064 --> 00:47:05,223
Mr. Heo must love his wife dearly.

777
00:47:07,303 --> 00:47:08,794
Not you too.

778
00:47:10,674 --> 00:47:13,033
Why is everyone going on about love?

779
00:47:13,274 --> 00:47:14,763
Love...

780
00:47:14,914 --> 00:47:18,112
is only an electric signal
exchanged between neurons.

781
00:47:18,113 --> 00:47:20,414
People let those signals take over
and fall head over heels for others.

782
00:47:20,414 --> 00:47:23,573
Then comes betrayal,
hatred, and suffering.

783
00:47:23,653 --> 00:47:25,973
But after all that, they repeat
the journey with someone new.

784
00:47:27,924 --> 00:47:29,183
How pathetic is that?

785
00:47:30,194 --> 00:47:31,384
Ha Ru.

786
00:47:33,194 --> 00:47:36,254
Do you know when those electric signals...

787
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,354
shine the brightest?

788
00:47:40,004 --> 00:47:42,093
You're asking that with an answer in mind.

789
00:47:42,174 --> 00:47:45,334
Exactly. It's when people are in love.

790
00:47:46,674 --> 00:47:50,734
Like you said, loving someone
ends painfully in a lot of cases.

791
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,973
However,

792
00:47:52,444 --> 00:47:54,414
the brain will forever remember...

793
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:56,573
how our neurons twinkled for someone else.

794
00:47:57,323 --> 00:47:58,513
And I believe...

795
00:47:59,223 --> 00:48:02,114
that those memories keep us going in life.

796
00:48:06,294 --> 00:48:07,484
Ha Ru,

797
00:48:08,294 --> 00:48:10,524
there's only one thing I wish for you.

798
00:48:15,433 --> 00:48:18,493
I want you to feel that blissful moment...

799
00:48:21,044 --> 00:48:22,533
once in your life.

800
00:48:25,644 --> 00:48:28,174
It's love.

801
00:48:29,314 --> 00:48:32,913
Love has you in pain.

802
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,654
How did you know that?

803
00:48:36,964 --> 00:48:39,013
There's no need to be surprised.

804
00:48:39,894 --> 00:48:43,524
It only took minor observation skills.

805
00:48:44,903 --> 00:48:47,964
You're no longer wearing your ring.

806
00:48:50,944 --> 00:48:54,663
My superiors ordered me
not to speak to you.

807
00:48:54,874 --> 00:48:56,774
Was it your girlfriend or your wife?

808
00:49:00,783 --> 00:49:02,343
My girlfriend.

809
00:49:02,723 --> 00:49:03,913
Then it's all good.

810
00:49:05,254 --> 00:49:07,952
You'd be in trouble if it was your wife.

811
00:49:07,953 --> 00:49:11,413
Because you'd have to lose something
that belongs to you.

812
00:49:12,093 --> 00:49:15,323
You might have to fight the urge
to beat her up.

813
00:49:16,064 --> 00:49:17,323
However,

814
00:49:18,263 --> 00:49:20,694
girlfriends are expendable.

815
00:49:23,473 --> 00:49:25,093
Love...

816
00:49:26,414 --> 00:49:29,513
is like a program
utilized by our brains...

817
00:49:29,513 --> 00:49:33,143
that was designed to help pass on our DNA.

818
00:49:33,953 --> 00:49:36,714
Another expendable girlfriend
will appear...

819
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:39,544
who'll serve as a medium for you.

820
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:43,183
So don't be too heartbroken.

821
00:49:46,694 --> 00:49:47,884
Sure.

822
00:49:50,033 --> 00:49:52,024
Those foolish...

823
00:49:52,604 --> 00:49:55,174
make a huge fuss as though love...

824
00:49:55,174 --> 00:49:57,933
is the world's most beautiful concept.

825
00:49:58,073 --> 00:49:59,334
But that isn't the case.

826
00:49:59,944 --> 00:50:02,343
Love is the root of all evil.

827
00:50:02,343 --> 00:50:03,904
Just think about it.

828
00:50:04,183 --> 00:50:08,004
Think of all the crimes
that are committed out of love.

829
00:50:10,984 --> 00:50:14,913
The love for a deity
leads to religious wars.

830
00:50:16,624 --> 00:50:20,123
Parental love leads to suicide...

831
00:50:21,694 --> 00:50:24,123
after murdering their innocent child.

832
00:50:25,703 --> 00:50:27,174
Some manically murder
their ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend...

833
00:50:27,174 --> 00:50:29,294
because they can't get over them.

834
00:50:30,104 --> 00:50:32,393
You hear of that often on the news.

835
00:50:33,274 --> 00:50:34,464
They killed...

836
00:50:34,973 --> 00:50:38,033
because they were deeply in love.

837
00:50:39,714 --> 00:50:41,854
Whether it was driven
by possessiveness or jealousy,

838
00:50:41,854 --> 00:50:44,143
love was at the heart of it.

839
00:50:47,653 --> 00:50:51,154
I also knew someone who was like that.

840
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,924
Someone who killed...

841
00:50:54,894 --> 00:50:56,593
in the name of love.

842
00:51:07,374 --> 00:51:08,964
I want to forget,

843
00:51:13,354 --> 00:51:14,674
but I can't.

844
00:51:22,354 --> 00:51:24,453
The memories have been
creeping up on me lately.

845
00:51:35,774 --> 00:51:36,964
I'm sorry.

846
00:51:40,914 --> 00:51:42,104
I'm sorry.

847
00:51:54,053 --> 00:51:56,183
Yi Na. Daughter?

848
00:51:57,093 --> 00:51:58,714
Yi Na?

849
00:52:02,593 --> 00:52:03,794
My daughter,

850
00:52:04,064 --> 00:52:05,334
you'll be late at this rate.

851
00:52:05,334 --> 00:52:08,524
Seriously? I messed it up because of you.

852
00:52:08,874 --> 00:52:10,644
- Where?
- Right here.

853
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:12,403
My eyebrows don't match!

854
00:52:12,403 --> 00:52:13,743
You ruined them.

855
00:52:13,743 --> 00:52:15,444
Nothing's ruined. They're the same.

856
00:52:15,444 --> 00:52:18,033
They look exactly the same,
so come and eat.

857
00:52:18,914 --> 00:52:20,683
- I'm late.
- You said you'd eat.

858
00:52:20,683 --> 00:52:22,253
I said I was late. Bye.

859
00:52:22,254 --> 00:52:24,484
If you skip classes,
I'll dock your allowance!

860
00:52:24,484 --> 00:52:26,913
Yes, of course. See you.

861
00:52:30,924 --> 00:52:32,413
She said goodbye, though.

862
00:52:41,004 --> 00:52:42,364
She said she'd eat.

863
00:52:45,473 --> 00:52:47,404
She said she'd eat.

864
00:52:49,714 --> 00:52:51,803
It's too much work.

865
00:52:52,144 --> 00:52:54,643
It's harder than catching killers.

866
00:52:57,953 --> 00:52:59,174
Jeez...

867
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,564
Dr. Brain.

868
00:53:20,473 --> 00:53:22,004
I wonder if he eats at all.

869
00:53:22,374 --> 00:53:24,433
He's such a jerk.

870
00:53:25,314 --> 00:53:27,774
He never called once since he quit.

871
00:53:28,084 --> 00:53:29,303
No.

872
00:53:29,354 --> 00:53:32,873
It's stupid of me
to even expect him to call.

873
00:53:35,194 --> 00:53:36,444
Shall I call him?

874
00:53:41,694 --> 00:53:44,854
No. Why bother a busy man?

875
00:53:46,374 --> 00:53:47,623
No.

876
00:53:48,803 --> 00:53:51,464
Won't he like it if I ask how he's doing?

877
00:53:52,544 --> 00:53:53,734
Yes.

878
00:54:02,683 --> 00:54:03,952
Hello, Captain Seul.

879
00:54:03,953 --> 00:54:05,843
Come on out. I'm outside.

880
00:54:13,763 --> 00:54:15,024
In hiking attire?

881
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:18,303
Yes. If you don't have any,
come out as is.

882
00:54:18,303 --> 00:54:20,424
I'll buy you a whole new outfit.

883
00:54:20,473 --> 00:54:22,694
No, I have hiking clothes.

884
00:54:22,803 --> 00:54:25,802
Why do you suddenly want to go hiking?

885
00:54:25,803 --> 00:54:27,864
You have five minutes. Be quick.

886
00:54:29,914 --> 00:54:31,933
Hello? Captain Seul?

887
00:54:34,453 --> 00:54:35,703
What was that about?

888
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,913
Why are we going hiking?

889
00:54:39,323 --> 00:54:41,444
Five minutes? Shoot.

890
00:54:46,093 --> 00:54:47,323
Darn it.

891
00:54:49,363 --> 00:54:51,424
Oh, no. Mister!

892
00:54:57,843 --> 00:54:59,334
Wait for me.

893
00:54:59,374 --> 00:55:00,564
Mister!

894
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:02,533
Wait.

895
00:55:04,743 --> 00:55:05,933
Mister!

896
00:55:07,613 --> 00:55:08,843
Darn it.

897
00:55:09,113 --> 00:55:11,714
I'll get penalty points if I'm late today.

898
00:55:13,124 --> 00:55:15,913
I can't breathe. I shouldn't have run.

899
00:55:28,573 --> 00:55:29,823
Geum Yi Na.

900
00:55:33,444 --> 00:55:35,134
Why are you grinning when we're late?

901
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:38,803
Thanks to being late,
I get to ride the best kind of bus.

902
00:55:39,783 --> 00:55:41,274
The bus you're on.

903
00:55:42,453 --> 00:55:44,714
What kind of pick-up line is that?

904
00:55:45,183 --> 00:55:46,884
It's corny, and I hate it.

905
00:55:47,153 --> 00:55:49,444
- What do you do after school?
- I have extra classes.

906
00:55:51,194 --> 00:55:52,683
Shall we watch a movie instead?

907
00:55:52,723 --> 00:55:54,754
The model student would do that?

908
00:55:54,894 --> 00:55:56,223
Yes or no?

909
00:55:57,664 --> 00:55:59,053
I can't go.

910
00:55:59,504 --> 00:56:02,194
My dad said he'd call to check on me.

911
00:56:03,803 --> 00:56:05,373
What will you watch?

912
00:56:05,374 --> 00:56:07,864
- Anything's fine.
- I can't be bothered.

913
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:09,933
Hey.

914
00:56:11,544 --> 00:56:12,734
Guys.

915
00:56:16,783 --> 00:56:18,143
Look at her grin.

916
00:56:18,524 --> 00:56:20,214
Who's the loser next to her?

917
00:56:26,964 --> 00:56:29,154
Oh, my gosh.

918
00:56:29,763 --> 00:56:31,254
Why do you suddenly...

919
00:56:31,803 --> 00:56:34,493
want me to watch my health?

920
00:56:34,973 --> 00:56:38,064
Why do you suddenly want to start hiking?

921
00:56:38,803 --> 00:56:40,464
Look at the view!

922
00:56:41,444 --> 00:56:44,134
I have a plan.

923
00:56:45,013 --> 00:56:46,234
What?

924
00:56:48,153 --> 00:56:50,274
What's the secret to...

925
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:52,044
a successful confession?

926
00:56:53,024 --> 00:56:55,593
Your chances improve if you confess
somewhere high and dangerous...

927
00:56:55,593 --> 00:56:57,154
when out of breath.

928
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:59,854
High up, dangerous, out of breath.

929
00:57:00,564 --> 00:57:02,484
All things that increase your heartbeat.

930
00:57:03,834 --> 00:57:05,053
That's right.

931
00:57:05,604 --> 00:57:07,194
Our brain...

932
00:57:07,533 --> 00:57:09,593
constantly monitors our body.

933
00:57:09,674 --> 00:57:12,834
If our heart races,
it tries to identify the cause.

934
00:57:13,104 --> 00:57:14,343
If you were to confess then,

935
00:57:14,343 --> 00:57:18,404
he'd think, "My heart's racing
because I like her."

936
00:57:21,814 --> 00:57:24,544
I have something to say.

937
00:57:24,723 --> 00:57:27,584
You have something to say? Go ahead.

938
00:57:27,624 --> 00:57:29,814
I need to sit down.

939
00:57:30,024 --> 00:57:32,164
I can't breathe, and my heart's pounding.

940
00:57:32,164 --> 00:57:33,823
- No, you can't.
- What?

941
00:57:34,964 --> 00:57:36,293
I must say it at the peak.

942
00:57:36,294 --> 00:57:39,363
We're almost there,
so let's run the last leg.

943
00:57:39,363 --> 00:57:41,493
- What?
- Come on. Let's run.

944
00:57:41,774 --> 00:57:44,374
I really wish you'd just say it here.

945
00:57:44,374 --> 00:57:46,163
Come on. Run.

946
00:57:46,544 --> 00:57:49,004
What do you want to say at the peak?

947
00:58:21,113 --> 00:58:22,734
You're still young.

948
00:58:22,914 --> 00:58:25,873
When you get married,
you'll understand how I feel.

949
00:58:25,944 --> 00:58:27,873
The eyes show if you've been in love.

950
00:58:30,584 --> 00:58:32,143
It's not the case for you.

951
00:58:32,453 --> 00:58:35,444
I want you to feel that blissful moment...

952
00:58:37,894 --> 00:58:39,384
once in your life.

953
00:58:45,303 --> 00:58:46,823
Love?

954
00:58:49,703 --> 00:58:50,933
Hey.

955
00:59:19,004 --> 00:59:20,194
My gosh.

956
00:59:24,703 --> 00:59:25,933
Here.

957
00:59:28,044 --> 00:59:29,334
Thank you.

958
00:59:33,883 --> 00:59:35,243
I feel much better.

959
00:59:35,714 --> 00:59:37,643
I have something to tell you.

960
00:59:38,254 --> 00:59:39,444
Go ahead.

961
00:59:39,653 --> 00:59:42,614
Shall we turn on the love system
Dr. Brain mentioned?

962
00:59:44,624 --> 00:59:48,183
You and I should give love a try.

963
00:59:49,194 --> 00:59:50,393
What?

964
01:00:01,044 --> 01:00:02,504
Detective Geum!

965
01:00:31,504 --> 01:00:33,604
(Brain Works)

966
01:00:34,573 --> 01:00:36,364
The suspect is addicted to playing games.

967
01:00:36,444 --> 01:00:38,613
A home-bound recluse
left home after five years...

968
01:00:38,613 --> 01:00:39,842
and committed murder?

969
01:00:39,843 --> 01:00:43,153
After a certain time, he asks
the same thing over and over.

970
01:00:43,153 --> 01:00:45,073
We call him Mr. Reset.

971
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:46,683
Stop.

972
01:00:46,683 --> 01:00:49,894
The assailant's memory
is reset every 30 minutes,

973
01:00:49,894 --> 01:00:51,794
so he shouldn't have
any memory of the murder.

974
01:00:51,794 --> 01:00:53,214
How did he call it in?

975
01:00:53,834 --> 01:00:56,424
We found the witness in the footage.

976
01:00:57,564 --> 01:00:59,154
It's definitely a lie.

977
01:01:00,334 --> 01:01:01,964
Why is he lying?

978
01:01:04,144 --> 01:01:06,334
