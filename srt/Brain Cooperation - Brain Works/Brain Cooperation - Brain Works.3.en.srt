00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:28,341
by a team of NYU researchers.

323
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:30,562
Surprisingly enough,
over 90 percent of the people...

324
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,961
couldn't tell that the photos
had been swapped.

325
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:35,421
We call it choice blindness.

326
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:37,561
What was more interesting...

327
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:39,632
is that people gave
a number of reasons as to why...

328
00:20:39,632 --> 00:20:41,661
they preferred the person
they didn't choose.

329
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:43,431
Just like you.

330
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:45,962
I meant what I said though.

331
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:49,062
Our brain...

332
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,831
makes up reasons when asked to elaborate.

333
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:53,681
Why do you like to drink alcohol?

334
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:56,052
Because it's a stress-buster.

335
00:20:56,052 --> 00:20:57,712
Why did you become a cop?

336
00:20:57,921 --> 00:20:59,712
To restore justice in society.

337
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,641
Why did you marry her?

338
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:03,991
Because I loved her.

339
00:21:03,991 --> 00:21:06,190
(Because I loved her.)

340
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:08,181
What you answered in your head...

341
00:21:08,262 --> 00:21:10,460
are reasons your brain came up with.

342
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:12,532
Humans are pitiful beings
who don't know...

343
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:14,161
that they lie all the time.

344
00:21:14,802 --> 00:21:16,670
Fine. Then,

345
00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:19,532
why did I actually marry my ex-wife?

346
00:21:20,372 --> 00:21:23,112
That decision was driven by
a thought deep inside your head...

347
00:21:23,112 --> 00:21:25,101
that even you didn't know about.

348
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:28,601
So don't consider marriage ever again.

349
00:21:29,082 --> 00:21:31,371
Because your brain is wired that way,

350
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,420
you will end up marrying
another version of your ex.

351
00:21:35,421 --> 00:21:36,982
Why you...

352
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:39,482
That's a startling way to scare someone.

353
00:21:39,691 --> 00:21:41,592
We have the phone call history.

354
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,822
Another suspect has come to light.

355
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:48,132
(Suspect Information: Tran Thi Hoai, 27)

356
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:50,131
Hoai, 29 in Korean age.

357
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:52,970
She's the victim's best friend
Mr. Lee told us about...

358
00:21:52,971 --> 00:21:54,562
and an illegal immigrant.

359
00:21:54,711 --> 00:21:56,181
She worked at the factory...

360
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:59,371
and was living in the container
where the victim's body was found.

361
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:00,582
Ever since the body was found,

362
00:22:00,582 --> 00:22:03,121
her phone has been turned off,
and she has been off the grid.

363
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:05,671
- Who are her acquaintances?
- She has a boyfriend.

364
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:07,651
He's also Vietnamese...

365
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:09,812
and was the one who found the victim.

366
00:22:09,891 --> 00:22:12,221
Nothing came up
during the initial questioning,

367
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:14,261
but he hasn't responded
to follow-up requests.

368
00:22:14,262 --> 00:22:16,901
According to his boss,
he suddenly disappeared.

369
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:19,262
Him being an illegal immigrant
is probably why he ran.

370
00:22:20,671 --> 00:22:23,331
He probably ran to his own people.

371
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:25,371
I'll have him brought in.

372
00:22:25,372 --> 00:22:27,871
You know that illegal immigrants
don't respond well to authority.

373
00:22:27,872 --> 00:22:28,911
Are you sure you can manage alone?

374
00:22:28,911 --> 00:22:30,641
Gosh, of course.

375
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,772
My experience in Violent Crimes
says it all.

376
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:35,202
I'll join you.

377
00:22:37,052 --> 00:22:41,042
Dr. Brain, your enthusiasm
is raising all kinds of red flags.

378
00:22:41,852 --> 00:22:43,720
I put in my best effort
no matter what I do...

379
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:45,681
which is probably hard
for tax thieves to understand.

380
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:50,992
The good work we'll do
to bring justice for the victim.

381
00:22:51,931 --> 00:22:53,231
Please make sure it's known to the public.

382
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:54,492
Of course.

383
00:22:55,132 --> 00:22:57,640
You don't miss a single chance, do you?

384
00:22:57,641 --> 00:22:58,970
Unbelievable.

385
00:22:58,971 --> 00:23:02,062
I also have something to tell you
on our way there.

386
00:23:06,382 --> 00:23:07,572
Hello.

387
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:10,371
How do you greet other guys?

388
00:23:11,352 --> 00:23:12,542
And women?

389
00:23:13,022 --> 00:23:14,341
How do you lighten the mood?

390
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:20,752
Okay, you're all set.

391
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:23,501
Will this actually work though?

392
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:26,391
The best way
to lower the guards of foreigners?

393
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:28,071
Speak their language.

394
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:29,072
Our brains are wired...

395
00:23:29,072 --> 00:23:31,072
to respond quickly to our first language.

396
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,601
Dr. Brain, I'm impressed!

397
00:23:34,641 --> 00:23:37,841
You're not consistent in your ways though.

398
00:23:37,842 --> 00:23:39,951
You wanted to chew me out,

399
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:42,551
but had me praised for a good deed,

400
00:23:42,552 --> 00:23:44,481
helped me score points
in performance ratings,

401
00:23:44,481 --> 00:23:45,890
and even taught me a foreign language.

402
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,881
I get it, Dr. Brain.

403

You're the type that women love.
A big softy on the inside.

See these goosebumps?

405
00:23:56,901 --> 00:24:00,562
My brain felt terror just now.

406

Again with the complaining.

407

You're a charming one.

408

It's not for you to be charmed,

409

so shut it.

Why did you follow me here, then?

Unbelievable.
Acting one way and then another way.

00:29:19,151 --> 00:29:21,242
My gosh...

487
00:29:23,322 --> 00:29:25,052
Hey, stop!

488
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:27,490
You're up to all sorts of no good.

489
00:29:27,491 --> 00:29:28,661
Can we stop this?

490
00:29:28,661 --> 00:29:30,961
Your friends have already beat me up.

491
00:29:30,961 --> 00:29:33,572
I hurt all over.
I can't climb up after you!

492
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,372
I don't know anything.

493
00:29:35,372 --> 00:29:38,591
Okay, fine. Come down so we can talk.

494
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:42,762
You can't climb any further anyway!

495
00:29:43,141 --> 00:29:44,512
Darn you.

496
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:47,512
Don't make me shoot you with this!

497
00:29:47,512 --> 00:29:49,382
This hurts really bad!

498
00:29:49,382 --> 00:29:50,582
Just shoot.

499
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:53,181
I don't want to be deported.
I have to work.

500
00:29:54,122 --> 00:29:56,292
We can talk about that later.

501
00:29:56,292 --> 00:30:00,181
Loc, you fool! I really will shoot!

502
00:30:00,661 --> 00:30:01,851
One!

503
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,792
Two!

504
00:30:04,862 --> 00:30:06,052
Two-and-a-half!

505
00:30:06,501 --> 00:30:07,691
Two-and-three-quarters!

506
00:30:08,832 --> 00:30:10,032
What?

507
00:30:14,941 --> 00:30:16,131
No!

508
00:30:18,842 --> 00:30:20,042
Hey.

509
00:30:20,181 --> 00:30:22,710
Loc, are you okay? Are you hurt?

510
00:30:22,711 --> 00:30:24,742
Gosh, it's nastier than I thought.

511
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:28,081
Are you out of your mind?

512
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:29,791
What have you done?

513
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:31,252
You asked me to get him.

514
00:30:31,421 --> 00:30:32,891
I just did, so why scream at me?

515
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:34,881
I'm out of hands yet again.

516
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,822
I held back twice.

517
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,351
I won't anymore!

518
00:30:40,532 --> 00:30:41,722
Get up.

519
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:45,831
Let's go.

520
00:30:54,181 --> 00:30:56,542
That night, I got this message.

521
00:30:58,082 --> 00:30:59,712
(Hoai)

522
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:09,851
Sorry. I'm going far away.

523
00:31:10,262 --> 00:31:11,591
Don't look for me.

524
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,091
I think Hoai did it.

525
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:23,302
Did they have any problems?

526
00:31:24,681 --> 00:31:25,871
Money.

527
00:31:26,582 --> 00:31:31,042
Thoung told Hoai
to give back the money she owed.

528
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:33,681
So she could divorce her husband.

529
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:35,411
And rent a place.

530
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,651
She wanted the money.

531
00:31:39,961 --> 00:31:42,522
So they fought.

532
00:31:56,411 --> 00:31:58,302
Hoai's witnesses are here.

533
00:32:04,421 --> 00:32:08,141
The witnesses are three high-school
students who live near the factory.

534
00:32:11,491 --> 00:32:12,881
Yes, it's this woman.

535
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:18,961
We can do that together... What is it?

536
00:32:18,961 --> 00:32:21,272
She walked so fast, I looked,
wondering if she was exercising.

537
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,371
- The woman in pink!
- Yes.

538
00:32:23,372 --> 00:32:26,042
We tracked her movements
based on the girls' statements...

539
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:27,802
and checked traffic cameras.

540
00:32:27,842 --> 00:32:31,171
We found her
leaving the neighborhood on foot.

541
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,782
She walked so she could avoid
leaving a trace.

542
00:32:33,782 --> 00:32:35,972
Follow as best you can
through other traffic cameras.

543
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:37,171
Okay.

544
00:32:37,382 --> 00:32:39,822
It's eyeball torture time.

545
00:32:39,822 --> 00:32:41,012
Keep up the good work.

546
00:32:45,622 --> 00:32:47,921
Captain Seul,
you need to pull your weight.

547
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:52,752
Don't just sit around
and freeload off others' hard work.

548
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:54,992
Right.

549
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:58,232
You know you're paid more, don't you?

550
00:32:58,272 --> 00:33:00,401
If you don't think
you can be worth your pay,

551
00:33:01,171 --> 00:33:02,831
get married.

552
00:33:02,911 --> 00:33:04,241
Tell your husband...

553
00:33:04,241 --> 00:33:05,431
Mr. Kim?

554
00:33:06,312 --> 00:33:08,401
Can you handle that comment of yours?

555
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:12,772
Do you pay Captain Seul?

556
00:33:13,022 --> 00:33:14,341
If you don't,

557
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,012
you could be sued.

558
00:33:16,822 --> 00:33:17,861
I could?

559
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:21,752
Sir. You can't say
stuff like that these days.

560
00:33:26,161 --> 00:33:27,621
It was a figure of speech.

561
00:33:28,302 --> 00:33:31,091
I can't say anything these days
without getting complained at.

562
00:33:34,141 --> 00:33:36,931
Why's he like that?

563
00:33:37,481 --> 00:33:40,181
Captain, you can't put up with it.

564
00:33:40,181 --> 00:33:42,151
Take him on one of these days.

565
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:43,751
Go all out, like a madman.

566
00:33:43,751 --> 00:33:45,012
If she could do that,

567
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,411
would she have put up with it this far?

568
00:33:49,052 --> 00:33:53,081
Shy brains like yours
react strongly to stress.

569
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:56,691
Something that wouldn't upset others
upsets you a great deal.

570
00:33:56,931 --> 00:33:58,762
It triggers
the sympathetic nervous system,

571
00:33:58,762 --> 00:34:00,661
and cortisol increases.

572
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,391
That causes the heart to race,
cold sweat to appear,

573
00:34:04,602 --> 00:34:06,032
and you blush too.

574
00:34:07,372 --> 00:34:08,901
You're almost psychic.

575
00:34:09,782 --> 00:34:12,171
What should I do, then?

576
00:34:13,481 --> 00:34:14,972
There's just one option.

577
00:34:15,411 --> 00:34:17,111
To remodel your brain.

578
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,811
Is that possible?

579
00:34:19,021 --> 00:34:20,211
It's not easy.

580
00:34:20,651 --> 00:34:22,381
That's why there's only one conclusion.

581
00:34:25,092 --> 00:34:26,682
Stay the way you are.

582
00:34:28,231 --> 00:34:29,421
Goodbye.

583
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:32,952
What the...

584
00:34:35,371 --> 00:34:37,461
How could he say something like that?

585
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:42,432
Captain, don't cry.

586
00:34:43,012 --> 00:34:44,332
Please don't...

587
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:46,682
That jerk always messes up...

588
00:34:46,682 --> 00:34:49,541
just when he was doing so well!

589
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,051
Here.

590
00:34:53,052 --> 00:34:56,311
Eat all you want and cheer up.
This is on me.

591
00:34:56,351 --> 00:34:57,981
It's to celebrate my being in the news.

592
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:00,082
No, this is on me.

593
00:35:01,831 --> 00:35:03,992
But be brutally honest with me.

594
00:35:04,231 --> 00:35:06,771
Do I give you a hard time...

595
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,101
when it comes to work?

596
00:35:09,101 --> 00:35:10,870
Not at all.

597
00:35:10,871 --> 00:35:12,642
The subsection chief knows that too.

598
00:35:12,642 --> 00:35:14,861
Would he have put you in charge
if you weren't good?

599
00:35:15,242 --> 00:35:17,731
Why do you think he's like that, then?

600
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:19,472
I'm not sure.

601
00:35:19,711 --> 00:35:23,142
He worked in the field his whole life.

602
00:35:23,351 --> 00:35:25,671
I think he looks down on office jobs.

603
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:29,892
"We're always out and about,
running around catching people,"

604
00:35:29,892 --> 00:35:31,992
"and all you do is sit still."

605
00:35:31,992 --> 00:35:34,322
He says that all the time.

606
00:35:34,362 --> 00:35:36,122
He doesn't mean it,

607
00:35:36,191 --> 00:35:37,822
so don't let it get to you.

608
00:35:39,831 --> 00:35:42,662
I get the impression
he dislikes me even more these days.

609
00:35:43,371 --> 00:35:44,861
I don't know what to do.

610
00:35:45,242 --> 00:35:47,432
He always had a fiery temper,

611
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:51,171
but even I wonder why
he yells even more these days.

612
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,981
Does he have marital problems?

613
00:35:53,981 --> 00:35:55,171
But then,

614
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,581
I must be frustrating to watch.

615
00:35:57,581 --> 00:35:59,311
Even I hate my personality.

616
00:35:59,481 --> 00:36:01,412
What? I hate mine too.

617
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,691
You? Why? Everyone praises you
for your personality.

618
00:36:04,691 --> 00:36:06,960
No, they're just being nice.

619
00:36:06,961 --> 00:36:08,852
Let's be honest. I'm such a pushover.

620
00:36:09,731 --> 00:36:12,322
"Why am I such a pushover?"

621
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:14,401
I beat myself up all the time.

622
00:36:14,401 --> 00:36:15,691
Me too.

623
00:36:16,202 --> 00:36:18,741
You know, some people
just do whatever they want.

624
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:20,861
People like Dr. Brain.

625
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:23,681
I envy them from time to time.

626
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,072
Me too.

627
00:36:25,912 --> 00:36:29,602
I'd love to live like that
even if I had to remodel my brain.

628
00:36:34,052 --> 00:36:35,941
It won't happen in this lifetime, right?

629
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:38,912
Probably not.

Brain tissue.

It's not like I don't know that.

635

Why is this here? Where did you get it?

No comment.

637

This can't be.

638
00:37:19,662 --> 00:37:22,322
Don't tell me it's from the lab...

639
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:25,091
By any chance, is it...

640
00:37:26,142 --> 00:37:28,561
No comment, Auntie Ji Hyung.

641
00:37:32,081 --> 00:37:34,702
If you make me say "No comment"
one more time,

642
00:37:34,782 --> 00:37:36,572
I won't let you come in here again.

643
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:38,811
I'll change the passcode
and my phone number too.

644
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,711
This will be my lab for the time being.

645
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:44,512
So don't show up whenever you want to.

646
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,822
I don't need to eat...

647

she was set on fire after she died.

to give back the money she owed.

According to the MRI, everything
looks fine with her brain.

hasn't regained consciousness.

That's why he missed Captain Seul's call.

Why don't you want my help?

810
00:50:39,934 --> 00:50:41,294
Stick to protocol,

811
00:50:41,294 --> 00:50:42,993
and don't just do
whatever you want to do to help me.

812
00:50:43,633 --> 00:50:45,303
I'm not a police officer,

813
00:50:45,303 --> 00:50:47,223
so why must I follow
the protocol for the police?

814
00:51:01,713 --> 00:51:03,524
He said he was a produce distributor.

815
00:51:03,524 --> 00:51:04,714
That must be why he has this.

816
00:51:04,883 --> 00:51:07,044
You and your poor imagination
strike again.

817
00:51:07,354 --> 00:51:09,484
Why would there only be produce in here?

818
00:51:11,764 --> 00:51:15,223
What could come to mind
for someone with a wild imagination?

819
00:51:16,104 --> 00:51:19,564
Since then, Thoung has
also disappeared without a trace.

820
00:51:21,073 --> 00:51:22,423
Don't you find that odd?

821
00:51:45,593 --> 00:51:47,323
What are you waiting for? Go on.

822
00:51:47,894 --> 00:51:49,084
Wait.

823
00:51:49,264 --> 00:51:51,233
Are you going to lock me in here and run?

824
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,693
That's an idea.

825
00:52:02,314 --> 00:52:03,343
We'll go in together.

826
00:52:03,343 --> 00:52:07,473
Should a detective be this scared?

827
00:52:25,633 --> 00:52:28,233
This reminds me
of the rubber container murder.

828
00:52:28,233 --> 00:52:30,374
The wife kept the bodies...

829
00:52:30,374 --> 00:52:32,704
of her husband and his girlfriend
stacked in one.

830
00:52:56,104 --> 00:52:57,394
Why were you startled?

831
00:52:57,903 --> 00:52:59,573
There was a frozen fish
instead of a dead body.

832
00:52:59,573 --> 00:53:01,104
The disappointment was shocking.

833
00:53:01,104 --> 00:53:03,763
This isn't the time for jokes, you know.

834
00:53:12,914 --> 00:53:14,104
What the...

835
00:53:15,084 --> 00:53:17,073
This isn't one of your games, is it?

836
00:53:17,883 --> 00:53:19,073
Darn it.

837
00:53:23,764 --> 00:53:24,954
What on earth?

838
00:53:25,093 --> 00:53:26,283
Wait.

839
00:53:26,463 --> 00:53:27,653
Darn.

840
00:53:40,073 --> 00:53:41,263
Hello?

841
00:53:43,544 --> 00:53:45,073
Is anybody there?

842
00:53:45,084 --> 00:53:47,004
We're in here!

843
00:53:47,553 --> 00:53:48,874
Hello?

844
00:53:49,624 --> 00:53:51,473
We're...

845
00:53:57,024 --> 00:53:59,954
The temperature controller is outside.

846
00:54:00,133 --> 00:54:01,323
Darn it.

847
00:54:06,403 --> 00:54:08,723
Let's call 119 or the office.

848
00:54:08,733 --> 00:54:09,934
Right.

849
00:54:12,713 --> 00:54:13,903
What?

850
00:54:14,514 --> 00:54:16,133
We should use your phone instead.

851
00:54:17,113 --> 00:54:18,413
The battery is at two percent.

852
00:54:18,414 --> 00:54:19,803
It'll die once the call goes through.

853
00:54:21,213 --> 00:54:22,213
I left mine in the car.

854
00:54:22,213 --> 00:54:24,843
Are you kidding me?

855
00:54:26,294 --> 00:54:28,343
Who should we call, then?

856
00:54:28,524 --> 00:54:30,354
The office? Or 119?

Yes!

859

Chief Kim, I was about to...

860
00:54:40,173 --> 00:54:42,223

Hello?

What on earth?

865
00:54:51,283 --> 00:54:52,903
"I was about to..."

866
00:54:55,854 --> 00:54:58,013
I get it. He was about
to get back on the road.

867
00:54:58,883 --> 00:55:00,113
He must be on his way back.

868
00:55:05,823 --> 00:55:07,423
"Help me!"

869
00:55:07,564 --> 00:55:10,233
Why did you yap on
when you could've said just that?

870
00:55:10,233 --> 00:55:11,524
Well, I thought...

871
00:55:14,073 --> 00:55:15,723
I'll say that now.

872
00:55:18,474 --> 00:55:20,033
Help me!

873
00:55:20,573 --> 00:55:22,434
Help us!

874
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:24,104
- Help me!
- My gosh.

875
00:55:27,883 --> 00:55:29,513
Okay.

876
00:55:33,593 --> 00:55:36,513
I don't think this will work.

877
00:55:37,093 --> 00:55:39,124
I think it's best we leave it alone.

878
00:55:39,124 --> 00:55:41,934
"One more experiment
is better than just thinking."

879
00:55:41,934 --> 00:55:43,254
That's my motto.

880
00:55:44,334 --> 00:55:45,593
Here goes.

881
00:55:45,934 --> 00:55:48,564
One, two,

three.

Hey. It worked.

884
00:55:55,673 --> 00:55:57,303
How nice.

885
00:56:02,014 --> 00:56:04,113
See? The importance of trying.

886
00:56:09,394 --> 00:56:10,584
Oh, no.

887
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:14,053
No, please don't.

Help!

889
00:56:17,264 --> 00:56:18,454
Shoot.

890
00:56:24,073 --> 00:56:25,493
Darn it.

891
00:56:26,044 --> 00:56:27,664
Come on.

892
00:56:27,673 --> 00:56:31,073
This isn't a silence lab!

893

If you have the time to yell,
find another frozen fish.

894
00:56:34,914 --> 00:56:36,883
There aren't any more.
You can look everywhere,

895
00:56:36,883 --> 00:56:39,073
and that was the only thing
you could stick in there!

896

I get a headache when I hear
repetitive banging noises.

You won't die of a headache.

This is your fault.

00:58:30,834 --> 00:58:33,624
Fine. Let's see who wins.

925
00:58:37,974 --> 00:58:39,193
Darn it.

Oh, gosh.

Okay, fine, time out.

928
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:53,243
That's enough.

929
00:58:54,854 --> 00:58:56,044
So,

930
00:58:56,894 --> 00:58:58,714
what are you really?

931
00:58:59,664 --> 00:59:00,984
Are you a doctor?

932
00:59:01,693 --> 00:59:05,153
Is that the best a detective can do?

933
00:59:18,713 --> 00:59:22,044
What was all that about anyway?

934
00:59:22,414 --> 00:59:24,173
Why does your head hurt?

935
00:59:24,954 --> 00:59:26,443
Would I be like this if I knew?

936
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,484
When did it start?

937
00:59:28,823 --> 00:59:30,184
In kindergarten.

938
00:59:30,963 --> 00:59:32,454
After a car accident.

939
00:59:33,963 --> 00:59:35,754
It's a trauma of sorts.

940
00:59:37,104 --> 00:59:38,323
Trauma?

Thank you.

944
00:59:56,053 --> 00:59:57,973
Our company decided...

945
00:59:59,024 --> 01:00:00,644
not to publish it.

946
01:00:03,724 --> 01:00:07,794
Publishing a murderer's book...

947
01:00:07,794 --> 01:00:09,823
can't be an easy feat.

948
01:00:11,633 --> 01:00:13,704
So I thought about it and...

949
01:00:13,704 --> 01:00:14,964
No.

950
01:00:16,544 --> 01:00:18,193
It's boring.

951
01:00:18,903 --> 01:00:21,934
It's not enough
to grab the public's attention.

952
01:00:22,213 --> 01:00:25,234
A doctor who killed people
with medication.

953
01:00:27,414 --> 01:00:29,204
It's hardly gripping.

954
01:00:30,954 --> 01:00:34,144
Perhaps you could mention cannibalism.

955
01:00:34,593 --> 01:00:37,354
We need something else.

Human flesh?

957
01:00:42,233 --> 01:00:44,954
That's some great advice.

958
01:00:47,233 --> 01:00:50,294
She should be leaving kindergarten soon.

I saw a photo of her,
and she looks so tender.

962
01:01:04,053 --> 01:01:06,883
A pretty little girl.

963
01:01:08,823 --> 01:01:10,714
You crazy old man.

964
01:01:11,024 --> 01:01:13,093
Did you look into me and my family?

965
01:01:13,093 --> 01:01:17,354
I know you're having an affair
with one of your colleagues.

966
01:01:17,664 --> 01:01:21,863
I also know your wife's fighting cancer.

967
01:01:22,903 --> 01:01:24,734
Before I dig in,

968
01:01:25,204 --> 01:01:27,633
I'll tell your daughter.

969
01:01:28,044 --> 01:01:31,184
That she's being eaten because...

970

her stupid hypocrite of a father...

971

chose to speak so flippantly.

You psycho!

973
01:01:44,024 --> 01:01:45,254
Darn it.

01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:47,624
Guard!

975
01:01:49,704 --> 01:01:51,024

I dislike disrespect more than murder.

I'll remember that.

I will.

Yes, hello.

Do you remember a Hwang Dong Woo?

It's the doctor who was sent
to prison for serial murder, right?

993
01:03:02,503 --> 01:03:03,763
Maybe.

994

Was that his name?

995
01:03:05,803 --> 01:03:08,244
He was sentenced for killing patients...

Sorry, Professor Shin.
I just got an urgent call.

Okay, you should get it.
