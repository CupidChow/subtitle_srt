My what? Gosh. Please, Captain.

163
00:11:51,202 --> 00:11:53,362
Goodness, just let me...

164
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:55,132
Oh, sir!

165
00:11:56,912 --> 00:11:59,902
What's going on here?
Is love in the air?

166
00:11:59,942 --> 00:12:01,732
Love, my foot.

167
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:04,102
What's going on
with the sect leader?

168
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:05,742
Is she cooperating
with the investigation?

169
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:07,272
She's been released.

170
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:09,041
- What? Already?
- Already?

171
00:12:09,351 --> 00:12:10,792
A hotshot lawyer showed up...

172
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:12,792
and got her out, saying the police
already verified her identity...

173
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:15,352
and that there was no flight risk.

174
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:17,421
Darn it.

175
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:21,122
She whipped me.
I can't believe this!

176
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:25,362
Captain, we should hurry.

177
00:12:26,532 --> 00:12:27,732
Yes, we should.

178
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:29,442
But let me apply
some ointment first.

179
00:12:29,442 --> 00:12:30,632
Gosh, seriously...

180
00:12:31,111 --> 00:12:32,301
Pull up your T-shirt.

181
00:12:32,611 --> 00:12:35,272
Here, knock yourself out.

182
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:45,192
- Madam Messenger!
- Peace from the heart.

183
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:47,891
- Peace from the heart.
- Protect us.

184
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:51,491
- Peace from the heart.
- Guard us.

185
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:53,152
So they aren't
at the police station.

186
00:12:53,532 --> 00:12:54,532
Did you find them?

187
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:55,791
I'm sorry. Not yet.

188
00:12:56,432 --> 00:12:58,001
Ji Yul's mother left her phone,

189
00:12:58,001 --> 00:12:59,362
so we can't track her down.

190
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:02,201
Where does that neuroscientist live?

191
00:13:02,202 --> 00:13:03,270
I'm trying to figure that out.

192
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:06,032
- Peace from the heart.
- Madam Messenger! Protect us.

193
00:14:05,672 --> 00:14:08,331
What if she causes a scene,
asking to be let out?

194
00:14:08,942 --> 00:14:10,132
She won't.

195
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:12,661
She believes that I'm the Savior.

196
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:20,742
You must stay here.

197
00:14:20,881 --> 00:14:23,041
For the sake
of Ji Yul's eternal salvation,

198
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:26,041
you must stay here.

199
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:30,681
Talk about good timing.

200
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:34,662
You showed up when Ji Yul was
about to get whipped and saved her.

201
00:14:34,662 --> 00:14:36,022
So of course, she believes you.

202
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:39,471
That was an emergency
for Yang Eun Jung,

203
00:14:39,471 --> 00:14:41,392
so she was ready to be deceived.

204
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:45,140
But of course, I ooze charisma...

205
00:14:45,141 --> 00:14:46,331
like the real Savior would.

206
00:14:46,912 --> 00:14:49,402
You've found your calling.
A cult leader.

207
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,341
Then what are you? A fanatic?

208
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:54,171
Sure, whatever.

209
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:57,612
Dear Savior. What's the next step?

210
00:14:58,621 --> 00:15:01,681
The second step to liberate
Yang Eun Jung's brain.

211
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:03,782
Emptying her brain.

212
00:15:04,231 --> 00:15:05,752
When the brain is...

213
00:15:05,832 --> 00:15:09,051
completely deprived of information,
it goes into starvation mode.

214

When the brain is
in starvation mode,

219
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:25,002
it wants to absorb
any kind of information.

220
00:15:25,812 --> 00:15:27,841
When a message is presented
to the brain in that state,

221
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:30,182
it can even change the person's
religion and faith,

222
00:15:30,182 --> 00:15:31,782
which is very hard to do.

223
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:36,062
I see.
Just like anything tastes good...

224
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:38,551
when you're starving.

225
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:43,961
Then shall we wait until her brain
goes into starvation mode?

226
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:47,431
Okay.

227
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:51,701
I found out
where that neuroscientist lives.

228
00:15:51,842 --> 00:15:54,241
Great. Watch his every move.

229
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:56,102
I will, Madam Messenger.

230
00:15:57,712 --> 00:16:01,242
Oh, look who's here!
You're that sect leader's manager.

231
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:03,642
You rats.

232
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:06,251
- How dare you show up here?
- My goodness.

233
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:08,112
You'd better not come here again.

234
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:10,382
Next time, I'll aim for the head!

235
00:16:10,991 --> 00:16:13,482
My gosh.

236
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:15,001
Captain Seul,

237
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:17,762
you're one of those
charismatic women I see on TV.

238
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:20,392
This is a personality
I never would've dreamed of having,

239
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:21,862
but I like it.

240
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:23,400
Congratulations.

241
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:24,412
Your brain was
successfully remodeled...

242
00:16:24,412 --> 00:16:25,862
which I hear is nearly impossible.

243
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:28,571
Exactly.

244
00:16:29,741 --> 00:16:32,541
I only hope that it happens fast
for Ji Yul's mom as well.

245
00:16:35,351 --> 00:16:36,541
Gosh.

246
00:16:53,032 --> 00:16:54,400
Is anyone there?

247
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:56,101
Please open this door. Ji Yul!

248
00:16:56,101 --> 00:16:58,362
Where's Ji Yul? Ji Yul!

249
00:16:58,611 --> 00:17:00,772
In here. Let me out...

250
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:05,772
Ji Yul!

251
00:17:10,282 --> 00:17:11,482
Are you all right?

252
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:13,881
Let me see. Are you hurt in any way?

253
00:17:17,332 --> 00:17:19,151
Who were you with?

254
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:20,992
Who took care of you?

255
00:17:21,502 --> 00:17:23,422
Were you with the Savior?

256
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:26,522
Really?

257
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:29,131
Where is the Savior?
Is he here right now?

258
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:40,341
Detective?

259
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:43,311
Hello.

260
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:49,282
The Savior is elsewhere.

261
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,851
I just came here to talk.

262
00:17:53,631 --> 00:17:55,522
Caring for Ji Yul
must've been a hassle.

263
00:17:55,961 --> 00:17:58,291
Your husband's job
kept you two apart on weekdays,

264
00:17:58,472 --> 00:18:00,061
and your mother is deceased.

265
00:18:01,002 --> 00:18:04,432
You were left to manage
your sick daughter,

266
00:18:05,472 --> 00:18:09,172
and I could clearly
imagine your pain.

267
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:15,841
When my daughter was six...

268
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:20,311
She was around Ji Yul's age
when I began to raise her on my own.

269
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:24,081
It was like
being thrown into the deep end.

270
00:18:25,992 --> 00:18:27,621
Getting her to eat...

271
00:18:28,461 --> 00:18:30,821
or brush her teeth was a nightmare.

272
00:18:34,302 --> 00:18:36,361
I wanted to be a good dad,

273
00:18:37,272 --> 00:18:38,662
but I didn't think I had it in me.

274
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:44,901
Gosh, I apologize.
It was silly of me to show tears.

275
00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:49,571
It's all right.

276
00:18:51,252 --> 00:18:54,512
I can fully relate
to what you went through.

277
00:18:56,661 --> 00:18:58,782
She has finally begun to open up.

278
00:18:59,631 --> 00:19:02,452
The third step
to liberating her brain...

279
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:04,222
is well on its way.

280
00:19:05,302 --> 00:19:08,361
We still have to wait and see
how she responds.

281
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:12,101
It was like that for me as well.

282
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:16,202
You have no idea
how often she came down with a bug.

283
00:19:17,141 --> 00:19:20,571
She first said her stomach hurt,
and then her back.

284
00:19:20,651 --> 00:19:22,172
Then it was her head.

285
00:19:24,552 --> 00:19:26,412
I called my husband,

286
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:29,252
but he would just tell me
to take her to a doctor.

287
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:30,952
Goodness.

288
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,051
My mom is gone,

289
00:19:34,002 --> 00:19:37,222
so all I could do was cry with Ji Yul
when she cried in pain.

290
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:42,131
Gosh, I see.

291
00:19:45,141 --> 00:19:46,601
When she cried,

292
00:19:49,742 --> 00:19:53,002
I even thought about
throwing her out the window.

293
00:19:55,582 --> 00:19:56,942
One day,

294
00:19:57,121 --> 00:20:00,041
I saw her standing
next to the window...

295
00:20:00,822 --> 00:20:02,412
which startled me.

296
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:06,422
It felt like her being sick...

297
00:20:07,232 --> 00:20:09,252
was due to
my inappropriate thoughts.

298
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:14,391
That I understand.

299
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:21,831
All I wanted
was to be a good mother.

300
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:26,571
Being a good dad
was all I ever wanted as well.

301
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:29,041
Brother.

302
00:20:29,222 --> 00:20:31,712
Sister!

303
00:20:37,931 --> 00:20:41,952
Detective Geum is outstanding
at empathizing with others.

304
00:20:43,802 --> 00:20:45,662
He isn't useless after all.

305
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:48,361
That's something I could never do.

306
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:56,601
I see.

307
00:20:57,342 --> 00:20:59,901
No wonder you were drawn to a cult.

308
00:21:02,582 --> 00:21:04,512
It isn't a cult though.

309
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:08,952
If Madam Messenger is wrong...

310
00:21:09,262 --> 00:21:10,682
about a wicked spirit
taking over Ji Yul,

311
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:13,351
what could be the cause
of her illness?

312
00:21:14,931 --> 00:21:17,391
I'm sure there is
another explanation for that.

313
00:21:27,681 --> 00:21:28,932
Savior.

314
00:21:30,951 --> 00:21:35,012
At the hospital, I will unmask
the so-called wicked spirit.

315
00:21:36,722 --> 00:21:38,742
If I do so,

316
00:21:39,421 --> 00:21:41,012
will you disclose
what happened on the rooftop?

317
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,269
There are no tumors,

318
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,860
and no abnormalities were found.

319
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,630
What's concerning is
the high white blood cell count...

320
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:01,400
shown from the spinal tap.

321
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,170
Does she have encephalitis?

322
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:05,351
What caused it?

323
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:07,210
We'll have to check her antibodies.

324
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:10,410
We must find out
what is causing this.

325
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,229
Encephalitis as in
the inflammation of the brain?

326
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,901
That's right. To see what caused it,

327
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:22,469
we will test her antibodies.

328
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,439
But it still might not show
what caused her illness.

329
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,890
What if it doesn't?

330
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,660
We'll have to expand
the scope of the search.

331
00:22:30,411 --> 00:22:33,200
Problems with other organs...

332
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:35,470
could lead to encephalitis.

333
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,081
She first said her stomach hurt,
and then her back.

334
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,960
- Auntie.
- Yes?

335
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:57,660
There's something I suspect.

336
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,960
Call gynecology for a consult.

337
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:22,321
I suspected as such,
and I was right.

338
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:24,851
Let's begin.

339
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:26,521
Sure.

340
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,291
We'll begin the operation. Scalpel.

341
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,120
It was even more serious
than I thought.

342
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:01,950
The child must've been suffering.

343
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,420
But I'm glad to know...

344
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,831
what the wicked spirit is.

(Operating center)

346
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,380
Hey.

347
00:24:24,821 --> 00:24:27,680
Did the wicked spirit show itself?

348
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,620
Yes.

349
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,690
The wicked spirit within Ji Yul...

350
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:36,720
was this.

351
00:24:38,401 --> 00:24:39,630
Goodness.

352
00:24:41,641 --> 00:24:44,160
It looks wicked, don't you think?

353
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:48,501
It's the teratoma
we removed from her ovary.

354
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:52,311
It's a tumor made up of
various types of cells and tissue.

355
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,110
Stem cells coded with DNA that
can make any part of our body...

356
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,650
went rogue within a tumor...

357
00:24:58,651 --> 00:25:00,821
forming teeth, eyeballs,

358
00:25:00,821 --> 00:25:02,920
and even hair.

359
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,529
The untreated teratoma
that caused her encephalitis...

360
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:09,491
seems to have given her aphasia
and a deranged mental state.

361
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:11,591
It's a very rare case...

362
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,331
which is why it was diagnosed
as a mental disease.

363
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,930
We got it out,

364
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:16,601
so the symptoms will disappear too.

365
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,930
No way.

366
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,801
I can't believe you...

367
00:25:21,581 --> 00:25:23,440
until I see her for myself.

368
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:27,011
There she is.

Are you awake?

00:25:37,561 --> 00:25:39,491
Ji Yul, if you hear me,

nod your head.

Ji Yul. You can talk now?
You can speak?

Yes.

My poor baby... Thank you.

379

She'll no longer see or hear
what isn't there.

380
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,351
If she gets treated,

381
00:26:12,631 --> 00:26:14,491
she'll go back to the old Ji Yul.

382

You saved her, doctor.

Thank you.

No.

Neither of you is fully saved yet.

I revealed the so-called
wicked spirit to you.

It's time you told me the truth.

what happened on the rooftop.

Was Ji Yul the only one you saw
on the rooftop?

391
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,180
Did Ji Yul...

392
00:26:44,161 --> 00:26:46,021
hurt her father?

393
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,831
Do you not want to be saved?

394
00:26:59,111 --> 00:27:00,301
I do.

Stay where you are.

You. What did you do to Ji Yul?

409

I performed a miracle.

I saved Ji Yul.

411

That's nonsense.

Madam Messenger.

413
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,920
Ji Yul speaks now.

414
00:27:54,401 --> 00:27:58,091
There was something
called a teratoma in her body.

415
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,141
I saw what they took out of her.

416
00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:02,460
Eun Jung, you need to
come to your senses.

417
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:05,101
The wicked spirit attacks the mind,

418
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,801
not the body.

419
00:28:07,141 --> 00:28:08,970
Just because
they found something in her...

420
00:28:09,081 --> 00:28:11,071
doesn't mean
the wicked spirit's gone.

421
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,271
Do not fall for their evil tricks.

422
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,011
I'm the Savior.
The evil one doing tricks...

423
00:28:19,121 --> 00:28:20,880
- is her.
- Shut it!

424
00:28:21,661 --> 00:28:22,920
You evil thing.

425
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,101
Ms. Yang, think about it rationally.

426
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:28,650
I made Ji Yul speak again.
Am I the wicked evil spirit,

427
00:28:28,661 --> 00:28:30,660
or is she the wicked evil spirit
for blaming Ji Yul...

428
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:32,390
for what she did?

429
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,860
You can tell, can't you?

430
00:28:35,371 --> 00:28:38,561
What did I say
is the first step of sin?

431
00:28:38,911 --> 00:28:40,470
Thinking about it.

432
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:43,250
Numbing your thoughts
and controlling your actions.

433
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,411
That's how religious sects
get to you.

434
00:28:45,411 --> 00:28:46,741
You must think.

435
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,440
Think for yourself.

436
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,020
Do not commit more sins.

437
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,741
It's not a sin to think!

438
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,380
Think for yourself.

439
00:28:53,621 --> 00:28:55,920
You can't fall for
his evil whispers.

440
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:59,760
Ji Yul will suffer again
to pay for your foolishness.

441
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,791
It's not your fault that she's sick.

442
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,331
It was the teratoma.

443
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:05,530
Don't fall for his evil tricks!

444
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:08,091
Who's the one
who made Ji Yul speak again?

445
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,360
Didn't you see
the miracle for yourself?

446
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,771
Stop, everyone!

447
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,081
Madam Messenger.

448
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:29,920
Yes.

449
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,051
Don't cry.

Yes.

00:29:52,821 --> 00:29:54,011
Welcome back.

455
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,241
Return to your family.

456

We're family.

457
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:01,281
Ji Yul needs a family.

458
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,220
Without us,

459
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,620
she'll get sick again...

460
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,450
and she'll kill again.

461
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,720
No.

462
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,360
I made her sick.

463
00:30:19,911 --> 00:30:21,700
By believing in you.

464
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,110
Ji Yul's not a murderer.

Madam Messenger...

469
00:30:42,631 --> 00:30:45,390
threatened me with a knife.

470
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:56,440
I tried to get away...

471
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,970
and I fell.

you and Ji Yul can live.

476
00:31:16,401 --> 00:31:17,920
Okay?

477
00:31:19,141 --> 00:31:21,630
Promise me.

The killer my husband named...

479
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,031
was her.

480
00:31:29,581 --> 00:31:31,111
Arrest her for me.

481
00:31:31,111 --> 00:31:33,170
- What is she saying?
- You traitor!

What are you talking about?

483
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,920
You're under arrest
for the murder of Han Sung Woo.

484
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,061
- No!
- Let her go!

485

Let go of us all
before I turn nasty.

487
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:55,491
Now Ji Yul...

488
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,761
is completely saved.

492
00:32:17,361 --> 00:32:18,551
I saw...

Madam Messenger.

494
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,331
On the rooftop, in a mirror.

495
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,660
Yes, I know.

496
00:32:30,571 --> 00:32:32,231
I'm sorry.

497
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:34,801
It's my fault.

498
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,970
I was so wrong.

499
00:32:48,121 --> 00:32:50,391
- Guard me in the Savior's name.
- Guard me in the Savior's name.

500
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:53,500
- Lead me in the Savior's name.
- Lead me in the Savior's name.

- We're saved in the Savior's name.

502
00:32:55,631 --> 00:32:57,301
- We're protected.

- Guard me in the Savior's name.

00:32:59,401 --> 00:33:02,270
- Lead me in the Savior's name.
- Lead me in the Savior's name.

Lee Jung Ja.

511
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,591
You manipulated Yang Eun Jung...

512
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:27,950
and turned Ji Yul into a murderer.

513
00:33:28,061 --> 00:33:30,690
Do you know what a grave sin
you're committing?

514
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,240
Answer the question
instead of threatening me.

515
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,860
You'll rot in purgatory.

516
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,061
You insulted the Deity's Messenger.

517
00:33:39,411 --> 00:33:40,900
You'll pay for it dearly.

518
00:33:41,581 --> 00:33:44,470
Not one of those curses again.

519
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,970
After all I've heard,
it's a miracle I'm still alive.

520
00:33:49,151 --> 00:33:53,110
Right. Dr. Brain
wrote my name in red.

521

I'm not dead yet.

Do you get immune
after a certain amount of curses?

523
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,450
I'm not scared at all,

524
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,291
so let's not waste our energy
and move on.

525
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,291

on the rooftop.

I went up onto the rooftop.

529
00:34:23,921 --> 00:34:25,381
Ji Yul was there.

Ji Yul!

Ji Yul.

What are you doing with a knife?

Madam Messenger!

537
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,631
You fool.

538
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,180
It was all for Ji Yul's sake.

Why don't you know that?

540

He is not your husband.

541
00:35:29,891 --> 00:35:32,581
He is an evil thing who came
to ruin Ji Yul's salvation.

542
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,120
He suddenly showed up...

543
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:36,680
and tried to kidnap Ji Yul.
I struggled to stop him.

544
00:35:57,811 --> 00:35:59,070
Ji Yul.

545
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,480
Ji Yul, where are you?

546
00:36:01,481 --> 00:36:04,081
Ji Yul. Han Ji Yul, where are you?

547
00:36:05,891 --> 00:36:07,180
Ji Yul, where are you?

548
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,921
Your husband is not dead.

549
00:36:52,271 --> 00:36:54,131
The wicked spirit was judged.

550
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:56,660
Your husband
will be resurrected soon.

551

This is all a good sign.

The wicked spirit who
didn't want Ji Yul to be cured...

is now gone.

Don't think about anything else.

555
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,140
Do not commit more sins.

556
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:12,811
You should be solely focused
on Ji Yul's ritual at the moment.

557
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,450
Only think about Ji Yul.

558
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:18,851
Who is
the most important person to you?

559
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,550
It's Ji Yul, isn't it?

560
00:37:22,661 --> 00:37:23,861
Then...

561
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,791
what about my husband?

562
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:28,291
Ji Yul was...

563
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,561
on the rooftop too, as you know.

564
00:37:33,481 --> 00:37:35,570
Since Ji Yul is a minor,

565
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,441
she said Ji Yul
wouldn't be punished in any way.

566
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,711
She told me everyone would live...

567
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:44,680
if I just did as she said.

568
00:37:46,561 --> 00:37:48,510
She said we'd all be saved.

569
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:51,481
That's why...

570
00:37:55,161 --> 00:37:56,421
After all,

571
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,831
I was the evil thing
that was ruining Ji Yul's life.

00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,361
I ruined everything.

Thank you for telling us the truth.

574

Is there any physical evidence
to prove that your husband fell...

575
00:38:14,351 --> 00:38:15,980
because
the Messenger threatened him?

576
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:18,111
A recording of a phone conversation.
It could be anything.

577
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,081
No, there's nothing.

578
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:23,820
As per her orders,

579
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,021
I got rid of
all the security footage...

580
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:32,220
and used a phone
without the call-recording feature.

581
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,811
Is there anything
you saw on the rooftop?

582
00:38:36,811 --> 00:38:38,631
Even something very little.
Please tell me.

583

I've been racking my brain
but can't think of anything.

584
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:48,811
Can we only charge her
with assault, then?

585
00:38:54,391 --> 00:38:57,180
There is evidence
for something else.

- Keep out!

589

Pick up the pace.
What are you doing?

590

- Goodness.

591
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,270
- Over there.
- Do you not know how to use it?

592
00:39:12,271 --> 00:39:14,141
Gosh, I haven't shoveled once...

593
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:15,800
since I completed
my military service.

594
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:19,601
I bet you got bullied there,
judging from the way you're shoveling.

595

Darn...

596
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,740
What? What's the matter?

597
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,481
I was suddenly reminded of
one of my seniors in the military.

598
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:31,550
Gosh, I wonder how he's doing.

599
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,600
I thought I'd run into him
at the police station,

600
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:35,921
but it hasn't happened yet.

601

Oh, what's that?

603
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:43,200

We found a human skeleton.

611
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,411
A human skeleton was found
in the forest behind a building...

612
00:40:17,411 --> 00:40:18,771
in Juryu-dong
owned by a religious organization.

613
00:40:18,771 --> 00:40:20,710
The police have launched
an investigation.

614
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:23,211
According to a tip we received,
the skeleton...

615
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:25,550
belonged to a teenage student
who lived in the church building...

616
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,080
with their mother.

617
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:29,280
The student died
during a salvation ritual,

618
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,510
which is like an exorcism ritual.

619
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,090
The leader of the organization,
Lee Jung Ja,

620
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,521
uploaded exorcism videos
on a video-sharing platform...

621
00:40:35,521 --> 00:40:37,021
to find followers.

622
00:40:37,161 --> 00:40:39,291
- Give us a comment.
- Release Madam Messenger at once!

623
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:41,191
- How do you feel?
- Release her!

624
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,720
I'm fine.

625
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,270
Wait and see. I will be revived.

626
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:51,141

- Peace from the heart!

627
00:40:51,141 --> 00:40:53,240
Don't take pictures.
I said, no pictures!

628
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,070
- No!
- Let them go!

629
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,081
- Stop!
- One comment, please!

630
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:07,061
Gosh, this cult has...

631
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:08,921
way more followers than I thought.

632
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:10,351
This is bad.

633
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:13,560
Cults will always exist
as long as humans live on this planet.

634
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:15,001
This happens...

635
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:17,320
because we, humans,
are imperfect and weak.

636
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,030
Emotional deficiency and anxiety.

637
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:22,361
Wanting to rely on someone
makes us weak.

638

Dr. Brain.

639
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,901
Do you experience emotional
deficiency and anxiety too?

640
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,671
Of course, I do.

641

Oh, someone sounds human today.
What's gotten into you?

00:41:33,851 --> 00:41:36,220
However, I have highly developed
metacognitive skills,

643
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,711
so I never let such emotions
shake me up.

644
00:41:39,421 --> 00:41:42,381
Oh, Metacognition...

645
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,860
allows you
to be aware of things like,

646
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,851
"I want to do this now
because I feel anxious."

647
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,590
It helps you refrain
from certain behavior.

648
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:54,441
Oh, I see.

649
00:41:54,441 --> 00:41:56,510
I don't really understand
what that means,

650
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:59,970
but you suddenly sound
so unapproachable. It's great.

651
00:42:01,581 --> 00:42:02,970
Yes, sir.

652
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,671
I'll work hard.

653
00:42:04,711 --> 00:42:06,271
Have a great day, sir!

654
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,211
Good work, all of you.

655
00:42:10,421 --> 00:42:13,251
The chief called me himself.

656
00:42:14,661 --> 00:42:17,421
I'll get
a stellar performance review!

657
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,421
Gosh, why am I crying?

658
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,820
You've been under a lot of stress.

659
00:42:25,831 --> 00:42:27,140
Congratulations, sir!

660
00:42:27,141 --> 00:42:30,001
The chief said you'd get an award.

661
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,501
Sorry? Why all of a sudden?

662
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,870
Oh, that thing?

663
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,370
The article about your good deed.
You sure deserve it.

664
00:42:37,481 --> 00:42:39,870
Gosh, an award?
That's not necessary.

665
00:42:41,581 --> 00:42:45,450
My gosh! Dr. Brain,
I'll get an award thanks to you.

666
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:47,791
This will be my very first award
after elementary school.

667
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:49,410
Thanks, Dr. Brain.

668
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,691
I told you.

669
00:42:51,691 --> 00:42:54,601
Dr. Brain is like
the team's lucky charm.

670
00:42:54,601 --> 00:42:56,521
- Even this case...
- Wait, stop.

671
00:42:58,331 --> 00:42:59,861
I'm off.

672
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:11,680
What's with him?
I was complimenting him.

673
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,251
I have no idea.

674
00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:15,340
We're not on his level,

675
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,381
so I can't figure him out.

676
00:43:17,621 --> 00:43:19,840
Sir, the press briefing
will take place shortly.

677
00:43:21,161 --> 00:43:22,811
Here is the report.

678
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:25,120
Okay.

679
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:27,720
Thanks, Captain Seul.

680
00:43:29,101 --> 00:43:32,160
Then I shall now go out there...

681
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:34,561
and soak up the spotlight.

682
00:43:37,171 --> 00:43:38,631
Let's go.

683
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:43,888
We also managed to uncover the other
crimes committed by Lee Jung Ja.

684
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:46,889
The Neuroscientific Investigation Team
went undercover.

685
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:48,949
The citizens are highly praising
your hard work.

686
00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:52,869
Thank you.

687
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:55,728
We're not afraid
to put our lives on the line...

688
00:43:55,768 --> 00:43:59,559
to serve and protect the people,
and we'll continue to do the same.

689
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:02,078
I heard the victim's daughter
who was framed for the murder...

690
00:44:02,078 --> 00:44:03,998
exhibited symptoms of aphasia...

691
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:06,549
because of a teratoma.

692
00:44:06,549 --> 00:44:07,969
What is a teratoma?

693
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:13,779
You see, this teratoma...

694
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:16,349
What is known as
"teratoma" in English...

695
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:19,478
is from a cell
that was abnormally divided...

696
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:21,529
- From a cell...
- Did you get it too?

697
00:44:21,529 --> 00:44:23,328
What is this?

698
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:24,599
Is this for real?

699
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,628
- No way.
- What is all this?

700
00:44:26,628 --> 00:44:29,099
- I can't believe it.
- What's going on?

701
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,139
Hold on a second. What is this?

702
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:32,969
- Gosh.
- No way.

703
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:34,909
Seriously? Take a look.

704
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:36,099
A salvation?

705
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:38,549
- Is this for real?
- Look.

706
00:44:38,549 --> 00:44:40,139
- Gosh.
- No way.

707
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:45,509
Chief.

708
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:49,048
The video of Dr. Brain
has gone viral.

709
00:44:58,069 --> 00:44:59,619
That concludes the briefing.

711

(Instagram, Issue, 1,568 comments)

712
00:45:14,049 --> 00:45:15,739
It's not a sin to think!

713
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:18,679
- Think for yourself.
- Check him out. I'm impressed.

714
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:21,619
It's not your fault that she's sick.
It was the teratoma.

715
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:24,148
Don't fall for his evil tricks!

716
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:26,579
Who's the one
who made Ji Yul speak again?

717
00:45:26,728 --> 00:45:29,518
Didn't you see
the miracle for yourself?

718
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:34,628
Ji Yul will suffer again
to pay for your foolishness.

719
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:38,298
Don't fall for his evil tricks!

720
00:45:39,009 --> 00:45:41,268
Numbing your thoughts
and controlling your actions.

721
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:43,308
That's how religious sects
get to you.

722
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:44,449
Press "like."

723
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:45,699
You must think.

724
00:45:46,078 --> 00:45:47,338
Think for yourself.

725
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:49,349
- Do not commit more sins.
- You're a pretty one.

726
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:50,949
It's not a sin to think!

727
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:52,139
Focus.

728
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,608
Think for yourself.

729
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:57,328
- Don't fall for his evil tricks!
- I was busy saving a young lamb...

730
00:45:57,328 --> 00:45:59,179
- from an evil sect.
- Ji Yul will suffer again...

731
00:45:59,429 --> 00:46:01,458
to pay for your foolishness.

732
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,159
- It's not your fault she's sick.
- You saved her?

733
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:04,268
It was the teratoma.

734
00:46:04,268 --> 00:46:06,398
Don't fall for his evil tricks!

735
00:46:06,398 --> 00:46:10,029
Do you believe
that you saved this woman?

736
00:46:10,498 --> 00:46:12,858
I liberated her
from the cult's spell.

737
00:46:13,339 --> 00:46:14,679
Of course I saved her.

738
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:17,208
Sure. You did liberate her.

739
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,438
But...

740
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:23,139
would she be happy?

741
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:28,708
That woman...

742
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:31,788
fell for the words of a cult...

743
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:34,018
because she was too afraid
to confront her problems.

744
00:46:35,828 --> 00:46:38,559
No one reaches paradise
by running away.

745
00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:42,858
To her, the cult was her paradise.

746
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:45,259
She found solace among those people.

747
00:46:48,509 --> 00:46:50,798
It wasn't genuine though.

748
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,699
Exactly.

749
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:56,139
Even words of comfort
that have no substance...

750
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:59,779
have some humans release
high levels of dopamine.

751
00:47:01,788 --> 00:47:05,719
From the beginning,
she was designed as a moron.

752
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:18,929
What is she facing after
exiting the shell she was in?

753
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:23,768
Her foolish acts
brought her husband's death,

754
00:47:23,779 --> 00:47:26,049
and now she has to live
in a dreaded world...

755
00:47:26,049 --> 00:47:28,869
where she's the sole carer
of her child.

756
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:35,648
From the second
she wakes up in the morning,

757
00:47:36,018 --> 00:47:37,489
she'll be stuck...

758
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:40,318
with the sickening taste
of her foolishness.

759
00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:44,318
What she'll be faced with
is a shuddering sense of shame.

760
00:47:45,728 --> 00:47:48,128
I can tell you with certainty...

761
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:52,498
that you have led her to her demise.

762
00:47:53,469 --> 00:47:55,529
But yet, you say that you saved her.

763
00:47:56,478 --> 00:48:01,509
If you ask me,
you sound like a megalomaniac.

You worked hard in order to save me.

I brought this for you all to enjoy.

This isn't something we can accept.

Please consider it as a token
of my gratitude and have some.

Let this be the last time
you offer us food though.

Strike that. There shouldn't be
a reason for you to come here.

The nightmare begins
the second I wake up in the morning.

787

I'm worried if I'll be able
to care for Ji Yul on my own,

788
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:46,179

First of all,

963
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:18,639
I thank you so much
for congratulating me.

964
01:01:25,549 --> 01:01:27,279
You're all so busy,

965
01:01:27,918 --> 01:01:30,679
and you still came by
to congratulate me...

966
01:01:30,889 --> 01:01:32,079
Your school uniform.

967
01:01:32,429 --> 01:01:33,748
Right here.

968
01:01:34,589 --> 01:01:35,818
How much?

969
01:01:36,058 --> 01:01:38,058
Short is three hours, 150 dollars.

970
01:01:38,058 --> 01:01:39,858
Long is eight hours, 250 dollars.

971
01:01:40,668 --> 01:01:43,489
Okay. Let's go for the long deal.

972
01:01:43,739 --> 01:01:44,989
Sure.

973
01:01:46,668 --> 01:01:49,339
- What's that?
- Is he with a kid?

974
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:51,768

976
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:37,017
It looks like we have
another interesting case.

977
01:02:37,018 --> 01:02:40,188
He really appeared as a human being
and hurt the wife?

978
01:02:40,188 --> 01:02:42,398
You can't do this!

979
01:02:42,398 --> 01:02:45,048
Dr. Brain, you can
see inside the head,

980
01:02:45,268 --> 01:02:47,259
but the eyes of one in love
are different.

981
01:02:47,529 --> 01:02:50,929
I know of such a person too.

982
01:02:52,768 --> 01:02:56,099
One who killed for love.

983
01:02:56,679 --> 01:02:57,898
Why would you do that?

984
01:02:58,179 --> 01:03:00,708
- I warned you.
- Darn you.

985
01:03:00,708 --> 01:03:02,668
Hit me only if you can handle
what comes next.
