00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:10,439
(Episode 10. Though Memories Fade, feat. How to Forget Bad Memories)

2
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:12,109
Okay, then.

3
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:15,138
Think of the appearance...

4
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:19,179
of the culprit who walked past smelling of a swimming pool.

5
00:00:29,418 --> 00:00:31,219
On the back of his hand.

6
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:35,458
There's blood.

7
00:00:37,598 --> 00:00:38,598
And...

8
00:00:50,108 --> 00:00:51,539
There's a scar.

9
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:29,218
The smell of a pool.

10
00:01:30,718 --> 00:01:31,949
The scar on the back of the hand.

11
00:01:33,548 --> 00:01:34,748
The killer's the younger brother...

12
00:01:36,158 --> 00:01:37,259
Kim Ho Young.

13
00:02:27,738 --> 00:02:28,738
Hello?

14
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,479
Hello, is this Ho Young?

15
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:34,009
I am Geum Myung Se, the detective in charge of your mother's case.

16
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:36,918
We discovered a new clue regarding your mother's case.

17
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:40,388
Okay, what is it?

18
00:02:41,548 --> 00:02:42,659
Well...

19
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:45,758
We should talk in person.

20
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,789
Where are you now?

21
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:50,499
At the swimming pool.

22
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:53,798
My gosh, it's getting late. You're still training?

23
00:02:54,268 --> 00:02:56,638
When will you be done? I'll come and pick you up.

24
00:02:56,898 --> 00:02:58,469
No, that's...

25
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:11,719
Goodness. High schoolers these days are such brats.

26
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:13,618
Hey, I'm a police detective.

27
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:15,458
How could you lie to me?

28
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,159
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:18,559
It just felt like a hassle.

30
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:20,529
Right, I get it.

31
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:22,398
It must feel like such a nuisance.

32
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:24,398
Oh, right. Have you eaten yet?

33
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,598
I know you have no one looking after you now,

34
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,167
but make sure you eat well. You're still growing, you know?

35
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,608
That way, your mother up above won't worry so much.

36
00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:37,638
Let's go.

37
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:39,878
Let's have a bowl of noodles. It'll warm you up.

38
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:40,879
We'll eat first, then talk.

39
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:45,648
Can I go inside quickly and get changed?

40
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:48,319
Let's just go. I'm a busy man.

41
00:03:50,059 --> 00:03:51,618
Then let me just drop off my bag.

42
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:56,229
Why?

43
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:58,629
Is there something important inside?

44
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:02,699
I guess there is.

45
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:04,569
There's something.

46
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,909
Hey, Kim Ho Young!

47
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:15,249
Kim Ho Young! Stop!

48
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:22,218
Hey, stop!

49
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:26,088
Kim Ho Young! Stop right there!

50
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:28,388
Hey, Kim Ho Young!

51
00:04:30,059 --> 00:04:31,059
Hey...

52
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:32,528
That punk. Why is he so fast?

53
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:34,999
Hey.

54
00:04:40,638 --> 00:04:41,738
Are you all right? Hey.

55
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,739
Ye Jun!

56
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:57,759
Ye Jun, no!

57
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:03,759
Thank you.

58
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:05,429
It's all good. Please calm down.

59
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:07,168
Thank you so much, seriously.

60
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:08,467
Please calm down.

61
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:10,137
Thank you so much.

62
00:05:10,138 --> 00:05:12,038
No problem. Gosh, it must've given you such a scare.

63
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,109
Where did this punk go?

64
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:19,809
Shoot.

65
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:22,619
Darn it.

66
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:30,558
I've confirmed that he went this way.

67
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:33,528
We're analyzing the security footage to figure out where he went.

68
00:05:34,328 --> 00:05:35,328
You're incompetent.

69
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:37,598
We would've caught him had I tagged along.

70
00:05:38,929 --> 00:05:41,827
I lost him because I had to help the lady with the stroller.

71
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:43,468
You should've caught him before that.

72
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:45,439
You're a cop, yet you can't even run.

73
00:05:45,768 --> 00:05:47,938
Look, Dr. Brain. You didn't see him run.

74
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:49,077
Don't even get me started.

75
00:05:49,078 --> 00:05:51,439
He can run as fast as Usain Bolt.

76
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,009
I thought he was a swimmer, not a sprinter.

77
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:57,347
Either way, he is an athlete!

78
00:05:57,348 --> 00:05:58,548
An energetic teenager at that!

79
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:00,588
I would've caught him, no matter how energetic or fast he was.

80
00:06:01,148 --> 00:06:02,158
That's enough.

81
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,458
Drop it, you two.

82
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:08,699
Dr. Brain, you have the perfect mindset to be a competent cop.

83
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:11,258
What do you say? How about you quit your brain research...

84
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:12,597
and join the force?

85
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:13,598
No, thanks.

86
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:17,699
I thought your enthusiasm was what was keeping you here.

87
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:20,439
Oh, right. Let me make this one thing clear.

88
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:22,707
I'm helping out with this case as a consultant...

89
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,838
on the condition that Detective Geum donates his brain...

90
00:06:26,148 --> 00:06:27,549
We got a call from the credit card company.

91
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:30,277
A transaction was made using Choi Jung Yoon's credit card.

92
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:32,788
I'm certain that her son, Kim Ho Young, is using her card.

93
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,208
Nice.

94
00:06:57,408 --> 00:07:00,708
I've confirmed that he bought cup noodles, two giant sausages,

95
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:03,148
and a beverage here. He also took out a cash advance.

96
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:05,688
I thought Captain Seul had already verified that.

97
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:07,018
Keep listening.

98
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:10,158
That part-timer saw where he went.

99
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:13,359
Let's go to Motel Rose.

100
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,038
Last night, a young guy came in, wearing his hood like this.

101
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:30,179
He checked in alone.

102
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:31,908
Is he still here?

103
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:33,348
Well...

104
00:07:34,148 --> 00:07:35,478
Yes.

105
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,639
What? She said she didn't see him leaving.

106
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,208
Is it not this room?

107
00:08:34,738 --> 00:08:35,738
It is this room.

108
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,179
The cup noodles and the giant sausages.

109
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:41,149
Exactly what Kim Ho Young bought at the convenience store.

110
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,248
I think he stepped out for a moment.

111
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,218
I guess we're going on another stakeout.

112
00:09:52,588 --> 00:09:53,718
I thought you were asleep.

113
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:57,019
Why are you so quiet? This is very unlike you.

114
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:03,159
Gosh, my chest feels heavy.

115
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,269
My traumatic memories are coming back again.

116
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:09,998
Trauma?

117
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:12,838
That does not suit you.

118
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:18,949
What is it?

119
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:21,507
Forget it.

120
00:10:21,508 --> 00:10:24,378
Talking about it will only make me more depressed.

121
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:29,689
I could teach you how to erase painful memories.

122
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:32,258
Does such a thing exist?

123
00:10:32,728 --> 00:10:36,358
Right. You do seem like someone who'd know of a way.

124
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:38,828
Then, tell me.

125
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,669
I can't tell you for free.

126
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:47,539
Forget it, then.

127
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,679
What the... Fine, it'll be on the house.

128
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:56,878
Only three people know about this incident.

129
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:04,019
It was about 10 years ago. A rapist with 13 convictions...

130
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,727
struck again...

131
00:11:05,728 --> 00:11:07,689
right after being released from prison.

132
00:11:07,858 --> 00:11:09,958
We found out that he was hiding at a motel,

133
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:11,929
and we were waiting for him in the parking lot.

134
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:21,868
(10 years ago)

135
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:29,779
When was the last time you went home?

136
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:32,078
Your wife must be worried.

137
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:35,019
That's the life of a detective's wife.

138
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:39,029
I told her to go to her parents' place.

139
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:44,358
Darn it. We need to catch him already.

140
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,699
This is exhausting,

141
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,338
and I miss my daughter like crazy.

142
00:11:51,338 --> 00:11:52,539
How old is she now?

143
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:54,368
She's six.

144
00:11:54,868 --> 00:11:57,238
I call her a pie. Sweetie-pie.

145
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:02,179
- Do you want to see a photo? - Sure.

146
00:12:14,258 --> 00:12:15,289
What is it?

147
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:18,598
- What's wrong? - Maybe next time.

148
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:20,798
- Why? - I'll get going.

149
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,838
- Go where? - I'm not feeling it today.

150
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:31,007
- Hold on. - What the... What is it?

151
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:33,008
Stay like this for a little while.

152
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:34,708
What's going on?

153
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:37,877
It's nothing, so just stay in that position.

154
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:39,318
Why you...

155
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:42,419
Darn it. What do you think you're doing?

156
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:55,938
I want to get going.

157
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:57,597
When we're already here?

158
00:12:57,598 --> 00:12:58,868
I'm tired, that's all.

159
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:00,269
Let's talk inside.

160
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:02,779
Detective Geum.

161
00:13:04,108 --> 00:13:05,108
Detective Geum!

162
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,449
There's nothing wrong...

163
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,779
- What is it? - Honey.

164
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:13,049
Honey?

165
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:17,819
Why you...

166
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:20,627
Detective Geum.

167
00:13:20,628 --> 00:13:22,428
- Please hold back. - Let go.

168
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:24,728
- Who are you, you punk? - Detective Geum!

169
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,698
- No, don't. - Let go of me!

170
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:28,029
Please don't.

171
00:13:30,238 --> 00:13:32,168
My memories are a little fuzzy after that,

172
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:33,468
but I saw red...

173
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,669
and crushed his car.

174
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:38,279
Good for you.

175
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,149
A compliment from you is a first.

176
00:13:43,378 --> 00:13:45,578
I'm one to compliment those who deserve it.

177
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:49,559
I would've been prouder of you had you crushed the jerk as well.

178
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:51,088
What happened to him?

179
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:55,488
They were discussing whether to go inside the motel.

180
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:59,168
Nothing happened, so he claimed that it wasn't an affair.

181
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:00,169
He had the audacity to say...

182
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,899
that I should pay for the damage to his car.

183
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:05,299
Don't tell me you gave in to his request.

184
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:08,238
Not even the biggest pushover would give in to that.

185
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:11,077
I said he should sue me...

186
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:13,978
and that I'd rather go to prison for what I did.

187
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:17,118
That intimidated him, and he backed off.

188
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:20,419
Ever since then, motel neon signs...

189
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:24,159
have been making me sick in the stomach.

190
00:14:26,228 --> 00:14:28,659
Of course. I can see why.

191
00:14:30,228 --> 00:14:33,098
Do you perhaps have an equally nauseating memory?

192
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:35,328
- I don't. - I see.

193
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,038
Your life must've been full of rainbows and butterflies.

194
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,139
As if.

195
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:43,279
I lost both my parents at the age of six.

196
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:46,149
Right. Sorry.

197
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,448
I just control myself in a way...

198
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:51,878
so that I'm not impacted by negative memories.

199
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:56,289
It's foolish to let past memories hold you back.

200
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,159
No way. Is such a thing possible?

201
00:14:59,728 --> 00:15:02,328
I'm impressed. You truly are impressive.

202
00:15:02,598 --> 00:15:03,928
What's your secret?

203
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:06,598
Wait. You said you'd teach me how to erase painful memories.

204
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:12,367
Is it a memory you actually wish to erase?

205
00:15:12,368 --> 00:15:13,467
Of course.

206
00:15:13,468 --> 00:15:16,179
I'd let you open my skull if it were possible to erase it.

207
00:15:17,238 --> 00:15:19,178
We have an emergency. The suspect, Kim Ho Young,

208

is attempting suicide on the roof of the motel.

He should come back down.

211
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:35,827
He should think of his parents.

Cut the nonsense and get lost.

You little brat. That's no way to talk to a grownup.

Okay, fine. You do the talking if you don't want to listen.

Come down from there so we can hear you out.

I'm sure you had a good reason.

What about your brother? His name should at least be cleared.

233

Do you know what he first does...

234
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:39,627
after his memory resets every 30 minutes?

235

He always asks how you're doing.

Don't you feel bad for him when he still cares for you...

Dr. Brain!

249

Consider that you just died and go live your life again.

- Must you be excessive? - Speak for yourself!

Are you out of your mind? Why did you do that?

Do you have many lives to spare?

I did it knowing I wouldn't die.

I'm not as reckless as you, you know.

Even with the inflatable mattress, it was still risky!

Why are you yelling at me when you weren't the one taking the risk?

you should've talked him into going.

She didn't get him any help?

325
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:05,715
She feared he'd regain his memory.

326
00:22:07,614 --> 00:22:09,424
If he remembered what happened,

327
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,195
her abuse would come to light.

328
00:22:16,124 --> 00:22:18,995
It started off as typical child abuse.

329

He stayed in his room...

00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,064
because the headaches got bad.

331
00:22:23,664 --> 00:22:25,235
Then he turned weird...

332
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:28,705
and became a reclusive loner.

333
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:30,674
What about your dad?

334
00:22:31,374 --> 00:22:32,414
Did he not know?

335
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:33,644
Dad...

336
00:22:36,414 --> 00:22:37,745
believed Mom.

337
00:22:39,614 --> 00:22:42,015
That Joon Young was a reclusive loner and game addict.

338
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:45,795
He was always busy and rarely at home.

339
00:22:47,255 --> 00:22:48,255
It's possible...

340
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:50,525
he was like me.

341
00:22:51,295 --> 00:22:52,695
He knew and turned a blind eye.

342
00:22:55,864 --> 00:22:56,864
I don't know.

343
00:22:58,535 --> 00:23:00,475
I never talked about it with him.

344
00:23:04,245 --> 00:23:05,914
Did the abuse get worse...

345
00:23:06,314 --> 00:23:07,844
after your father died?

346
00:23:09,015 --> 00:23:10,015
That's when...

347
00:23:12,045 --> 00:23:13,814
Mom started to act weird.

348
00:23:22,864 --> 00:23:23,864
She mixed...

349
00:23:25,465 --> 00:23:27,394
cleaning solution into Joon Young's food.

350
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:38,805
I should've told her not to.

351
00:23:43,445 --> 00:23:44,715
But I couldn't stop her.

352
00:23:46,654 --> 00:23:48,185
All I could do...

353
00:23:55,154 --> 00:23:57,795
Don't ever eat the food Mom gives you.

354
00:23:58,424 --> 00:24:00,035
You'll die if you keep eating this.

355
00:24:00,894 --> 00:24:03,104
- Why? - Just don't eat it!

356
00:24:03,705 --> 00:24:04,705
Do as I say.

357
00:24:07,935 --> 00:24:08,945
Eat only this.

358
00:24:09,404 --> 00:24:10,505
Only what I give you.

359
00:24:11,174 --> 00:24:12,174
Okay?

360
00:24:12,545 --> 00:24:13,545
Do you understand?

361
00:24:15,574 --> 00:24:16,745
He kept forgetting,

362
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,455
so I had to tell him every day,

363
00:24:20,414 --> 00:24:23,225
but he seemed to remember what I'd said, which was odd.

364
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:29,225
That memory...

365
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:31,995
made him refuse the short rib soup.

366
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,205
You don't have much of an appetite?

367
00:24:41,975 --> 00:24:42,975
No.

368
00:24:44,404 --> 00:24:45,404
That's it.

369
00:24:47,074 --> 00:24:49,384
Your brother liked bread and milk.

370
00:24:50,844 --> 00:24:52,114
His memories were gone,

371
00:24:53,015 --> 00:24:54,654
but his emotions remained.

372
00:24:56,985 --> 00:24:58,455
I was worried about him.

373
00:25:01,624 --> 00:25:02,624
When I got home,

374
00:25:02,965 --> 00:25:05,995
Mom was screaming at him, telling him to eat.

375
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,295
I'd had enough.

376
00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:12,235
I plucked up the courage to yell.

377
00:25:13,475 --> 00:25:16,445
Will you stop it? You'll end up paying for this!

378
00:25:18,045 --> 00:25:19,045
I'll pay?

379
00:25:21,414 --> 00:25:23,015
How could you say that to your mom?

380
00:25:24,644 --> 00:25:26,285
Who do you think I'm doing this for?

381
00:25:26,914 --> 00:25:28,715
Why do you think I'm doing this?

382
00:25:30,225 --> 00:25:32,285
I'm doing it for you.

383
00:25:33,555 --> 00:25:36,664
If you're to have everything, he needs to go.

384
00:25:39,735 --> 00:25:40,735
What?

385
00:25:40,965 --> 00:25:42,934
Why do you think I married his dad...

386
00:25:42,935 --> 00:25:45,465
and put up with the man so far?

387
00:25:46,775 --> 00:25:47,775
It was for you.

388
00:25:48,374 --> 00:25:50,144
So you could have it all.

389
00:25:50,404 --> 00:25:51,874
I'm doing this for you.

390
00:25:53,574 --> 00:25:55,074
If not for you,

391
00:25:55,644 --> 00:25:57,614
I could go on pretending to be a good mom.

392
00:25:59,985 --> 00:26:01,314
Don't use me as an excuse.

393
00:26:11,094 --> 00:26:12,094
I spent the night...

394
00:26:13,795 --> 00:26:15,195
at an internet cafe.

395
00:26:21,574 --> 00:26:23,505
You're moving into a dorm tomorrow.

396
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:28,275
I don't want to.

397
00:26:30,285 --> 00:26:31,285
Why not?

398
00:26:32,854 --> 00:26:34,854
So you can feed your brother bread?

399
00:26:38,485 --> 00:26:39,495
Mom.

400
00:26:42,025 --> 00:26:44,525
You dare do this behind my back?

401
00:26:45,765 --> 00:26:48,035
Think of the years I spent groveling for you.

402
00:26:49,634 --> 00:26:50,863
My life wouldn't have...

403
00:26:50,864 --> 00:26:53,705
become a mess if I hadn't gotten pregnant with you!

404
00:26:54,475 --> 00:26:57,545
I wouldn't have had to turn so nasty!

405
00:26:59,245 --> 00:27:00,475
That's when I thought...

406
00:27:02,114 --> 00:27:03,414
I should die.

407
00:27:44,525 --> 00:27:45,525
What?

408
00:27:47,555 --> 00:27:49,124
You want to stab me?

409
00:27:49,995 --> 00:27:50,995
No.

410
00:27:54,664 --> 00:27:55,904
I'll kill myself.

411
00:27:56,805 --> 00:27:58,235
You always blame me.

412
00:27:58,604 --> 00:28:00,205
You said I made you unhappy...

413
00:28:01,074 --> 00:28:03,205
and I was the reason you became a monster!

414
00:28:05,574 --> 00:28:06,945
It'll be fine if I disappear.

415
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,985
You're just as immature as your father.

416
00:28:11,715 --> 00:28:12,715
Fine.

417
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:14,455
Do it.

418
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:17,555
But...

419
00:28:18,485 --> 00:28:20,124
if you want to kill yourself,

420
00:28:20,955 --> 00:28:21,955
kill me first.

421
00:28:23,594 --> 00:28:24,594
Let go!

422
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:26,935
- Let go! - Kill me!

423
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,795
Kill me first!

424
00:28:29,404 --> 00:28:30,404
Let go!

425
00:28:47,654 --> 00:28:49,185
The blood scared me,

426
00:28:50,525 --> 00:28:52,955
and I ran off.

427
00:28:55,624 --> 00:28:57,725
If she was cut in a skirmish,

428
00:28:58,495 --> 00:28:59,564
it's not murder.

429
00:29:00,894 --> 00:29:02,195
It's manslaughter.

430
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:06,634
One thing doesn't make sense.

431
00:29:07,374 --> 00:29:10,374
If you wanted to die to escape your monstrous mom,

432
00:29:11,404 --> 00:29:13,344
why did you frame your brother?

433
00:29:15,174 --> 00:29:16,185
I didn't.

434
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:19,045
It wasn't me.

435
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:22,653
Are you saying Joon Young...

436
00:29:22,654 --> 00:29:24,485
volunteered to take the fall for it?

437
00:29:27,295 --> 00:29:28,324
Yes.

438
00:29:36,664 --> 00:29:38,904
Ho Young, what happened?

439
00:29:39,275 --> 00:29:40,435
Did you get into a fight with someone?

440
00:29:41,935 --> 00:29:43,445
I killed that woman.

441
00:29:47,045 --> 00:29:48,545
You don't remember anything.

442
00:29:50,314 --> 00:29:51,515
Good for you.

443
00:29:52,654 --> 00:29:54,314
In a few minutes, you'll forget everything you heard.

444
00:29:56,084 --> 00:29:57,285
I wish...

445
00:29:58,785 --> 00:30:00,394
I could forget everything too, like you.

446
00:30:02,154 --> 00:30:03,225
I keep...

447
00:30:04,664 --> 00:30:06,035
I keep thinking about what happened.

448
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:12,364
Ho Young.

449
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,404
Take this off and wash up.

450
00:30:16,674 --> 00:30:17,805
Go wash up.

451
00:30:18,745 --> 00:30:20,614
I'll take care of everything.

452
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:23,245
Ho Young.

453
00:30:56,045 --> 00:30:57,144
I just...

454
00:30:58,015 --> 00:31:00,384
lied down, tried not to think about it, and fell asleep.

455
00:31:01,614 --> 00:31:03,124
Then cops showed up at our house.

456
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:07,695
I thought they'd arrest me,

457
00:31:09,094 --> 00:31:10,795
but they said Joon Young turned himself in.

458
00:31:12,894 --> 00:31:14,564
That was when I found out that he turned himself in...

459
00:31:16,164 --> 00:31:17,364
to take the fall for what I did.

460
00:31:54,275 --> 00:31:55,735
Hello, what is your emergency?

461
00:31:56,505 --> 00:31:57,574
Police, right?

462
00:31:59,814 --> 00:32:01,374
I killed that woman.

463
00:32:04,745 --> 00:32:06,185
I'm the one who killed her.

464
00:32:13,424 --> 00:32:15,094
When I heard that my brother had turned himself in,

465
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,164
I thought I might be able to get away with it.

466
00:32:21,195 --> 00:32:22,364
So without even realizing it,

467
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:24,935
I pretended to know nothing.

468
00:32:26,775 --> 00:32:28,475
I didn't frame him intentionally.

469
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:31,975
I really didn't know he'd turn himself in to take the fall for me.

470
00:32:33,475 --> 00:32:34,914
Why did he do such a thing?

471
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:37,545
I don't get it.

472
00:32:39,285 --> 00:32:40,555
Because of his memories.

473
00:32:43,624 --> 00:32:45,225
When we were questioning him,

474
00:32:45,785 --> 00:32:47,195
we asked him...

475
00:32:48,255 --> 00:32:50,195
what his happiest memory was.

476
00:32:51,364 --> 00:32:52,424
I was an only child.

477
00:32:54,435 --> 00:32:57,505
My mom was ill, so I was always lonely.

478
00:32:58,064 --> 00:33:00,104
Shortly after my mom passed away,

479
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,475
I met my stepmother and brother.

480
00:33:04,074 --> 00:33:05,544
My stepmother was scary,

481
00:33:07,645 --> 00:33:09,245
but I really adored my little brother.

482
00:33:11,415 --> 00:33:13,055
He always listened to me.

483
00:33:14,154 --> 00:33:17,884
We were like friends despite the age gap.

484
00:33:20,855 --> 00:33:22,254
For the first time in my life,

485
00:33:23,594 --> 00:33:25,294
I felt like I finally had someone on my side.

486
00:33:27,435 --> 00:33:29,464
We took swimming lessons together.

487
00:33:36,605 --> 00:33:39,205
One, two, three!

488
00:33:42,245 --> 00:33:45,415
I felt the happiest when we were in the water together.

489
00:33:46,555 --> 00:33:48,585
I didn't have to hear my stepmother's angry voice.

490
00:33:49,555 --> 00:33:51,455
It felt like we were the only ones left in the world.

491
00:33:53,254 --> 00:33:54,495
It was such a happy moment.

492
00:33:58,125 --> 00:33:59,835
I think of that moment whenever I'm stressed out.

493
00:34:01,935 --> 00:34:05,065
I feel at ease when I think of my brother.

494
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:13,674
Your brother volunteered to take the fall...

495
00:34:14,944 --> 00:34:16,714
to protect the person who is so dear to him.

496

It's not.

663
00:45:46,963 --> 00:45:48,132
I actually don't remember it.

664
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:52,932
All I remember is someone pounding on the door...

665
00:45:52,933 --> 00:45:54,672
in order to rescue me.

666
00:45:55,072 --> 00:45:56,572
It's the only memory I have.

667
00:45:58,713 --> 00:45:59,713
Nothing else?

668
00:46:01,012 --> 00:46:02,583
What happened right before the accident?

669
00:46:03,612 --> 00:46:04,813
I don't remember that either.

670
00:46:07,683 --> 00:46:11,583
How odd. A memory that intense...

671
00:46:12,023 --> 00:46:14,453
usually traumatizes the brain.

672
00:46:15,393 --> 00:46:18,222
The trauma must've led me to forget.

673
00:46:19,063 --> 00:46:20,463
Don't you want to remember what happened?

674
00:46:22,262 --> 00:46:23,262
No.

675
00:46:23,862 --> 00:46:25,402
I believe in my own brain.

676
00:46:25,902 --> 00:46:27,972
My brain must've erased that memory...

677
00:46:28,132 --> 00:46:30,242
because it was more beneficial to my survival.

678
00:46:31,242 --> 00:46:33,913
There's no reason for me to dig up that memory.

679
00:46:49,722 --> 00:46:53,362
You will come across a reason to dig it up.

680
00:47:22,893 --> 00:47:23,893
Hey, kid.

681
00:47:27,433 --> 00:47:28,433
Kid!

682
00:47:33,873 --> 00:47:34,873
What the...

683
00:47:35,172 --> 00:47:36,172
Darn it.

684
00:47:42,983 --> 00:47:43,983
"Hey, kid."

685
00:47:50,152 --> 00:47:51,523
It isn't like you...

686
00:47:51,853 --> 00:47:53,123
to mess up like that.

687
00:47:53,222 --> 00:47:54,322
Tell me about it.

688
00:47:55,353 --> 00:47:57,422
My mind jumped back to the car accident,

689
00:47:57,922 --> 00:47:59,192
and I lost my concentration.

690
00:47:59,362 --> 00:48:00,393
The car accident?

691
00:48:02,163 --> 00:48:04,762
Yes, from when I was trapped in the car.

692
00:48:05,572 --> 00:48:07,373
Why did you suddenly think of that?

693
00:48:07,532 --> 00:48:08,532
Well...

694
00:48:09,402 --> 00:48:11,472
I talked about it with someone today.

695
00:48:12,842 --> 00:48:14,773
It must've stimulated my hippocampus and amygdala.

696
00:48:18,882 --> 00:48:20,012
Speaking of...

697
00:48:21,213 --> 00:48:22,683
The day of the accident.

698
00:48:24,253 --> 00:48:26,322
Was it Director Park who got me out?

699
00:48:26,853 --> 00:48:30,563
Could my memory have been distorted?

700
00:48:32,532 --> 00:48:34,362
Why would you suddenly ask?

701
00:48:36,632 --> 00:48:40,203
I remembered him calling out to me. "Kid."

702
00:48:40,773 --> 00:48:42,503
That's what he said.

703
00:48:43,103 --> 00:48:46,643
But there's no way Director Park would call me that.

704
00:48:47,273 --> 00:48:49,213
He'd have said, "Ha Ru."

705
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:53,683
I'm not sure.

706
00:48:56,123 --> 00:48:59,353
Could that be the distorted memory?

Why did he suddenly remember that?

He said he talked about it with someone during the day.

710

You don't know whom he met?

711
00:49:36,992 --> 00:49:40,032
I don't. I couldn't grill him.

712
00:49:40,262 --> 00:49:41,532
He'd catch on.

713
00:49:43,203 --> 00:49:44,233
Could it be...

714

715
00:49:47,003 --> 00:49:50,302
It's not him. He promised never to meet.

716
00:49:51,543 --> 00:49:53,442
I'll look into it, though.

717

I told you to come early. What took you so long?

Why should I do as you say?

Can you not be like that?

723

You promised to tell me...

how to forget bad memories.

(Hotel)

728
00:50:43,163 --> 00:50:44,922
I asked you to erase it for me,

729
00:50:45,322 --> 00:50:46,963
not remind me of it.

730
00:50:47,362 --> 00:50:50,031
The first step to erasing a bad memory.

731
00:50:50,032 --> 00:50:52,103
It's to get used to it through exposure.

732
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:55,842
Exposure makes it possible for a med student...

733
00:50:55,902 --> 00:50:57,301
who fainted at his first autopsy...

734
00:50:57,302 --> 00:50:59,442
to be able to eat intestine soup next to a corpse.

735
00:51:00,913 --> 00:51:04,083
Now summon the bad memory.

736

- What's wrong? - I want to get going.

Detective Geum.

739
00:51:18,023 --> 00:51:19,563
The next step is what's important.

740
00:51:19,793 --> 00:51:21,963
Activate the frontocortical.

741
00:51:23,032 --> 00:51:25,132
Activating the frontocortical...

742
00:51:25,362 --> 00:51:27,471
means viewing the memory as a third person,

743
00:51:27,472 --> 00:51:30,742
objectively and rationally, minus the emotions.

744
00:51:31,543 --> 00:51:33,472
View the memory in that manner.

745
00:51:33,742 --> 00:51:36,483
You're witnessing a woman have an affair.

746
00:51:37,483 --> 00:51:38,842
I'm tired, that's all.

747

- Let's talk inside. - No. I'm tired.

748
00:51:43,353 --> 00:51:45,083
- We're already here. - Bye.

749
00:51:46,453 --> 00:51:48,893
What do you think about the husband...

750
00:51:49,222 --> 00:51:50,463
who didn't see this coming?

751
00:51:50,722 --> 00:51:52,393
"What a moron."

752
00:51:53,063 --> 00:51:54,293
"The pathetic fool."

753
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:56,933
That fool met his wife outside the motel.

754
00:51:57,103 --> 00:51:59,603
As a spectator, what does this make you think?

755
00:51:59,902 --> 00:52:01,632
"Seriously, he must be so angry."

756
00:52:01,672 --> 00:52:03,902
- And? - "Darn angry."

757
00:52:04,543 --> 00:52:08,373
I told you to be objective and rational and exclude emotions.

758
00:52:09,342 --> 00:52:11,313
Oh, okay.

759
00:52:12,782 --> 00:52:14,012
"He must be furious."

760
00:52:15,652 --> 00:52:17,023
"But it's for the better."

761
00:52:18,422 --> 00:52:19,492
Why is that?

762
00:52:20,222 --> 00:52:22,152
If he hadn't seen what he did,

763
00:52:22,492 --> 00:52:25,163
he'd have been led on for much longer.

764
00:52:25,692 --> 00:52:27,192
The betrayal would be greater.

765
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:29,802
It was bound to come out one day.

766
00:52:31,032 --> 00:52:33,002
What was bound to come out came out.

767
00:52:33,003 --> 00:52:35,602
Whose loss is it if he keeps tormenting himself over it?

768
00:52:35,603 --> 00:52:37,072
It's his loss.

769
00:52:38,442 --> 00:52:40,172
The woman betrayed the man.

770
00:52:40,242 --> 00:52:42,512
If he lets this trauma stop him from finding love,

771
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:43,842
whose loss is it?

772
00:52:44,882 --> 00:52:46,282
It's his loss.

773
00:52:47,213 --> 00:52:49,222
What you saw that day shook you,

774
00:52:49,353 --> 00:52:51,253
but someone else asked you out.

775
00:52:51,623 --> 00:52:54,192
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

776
00:52:55,123 --> 00:52:57,492
I don't know. Is it good?

777
00:52:59,293 --> 00:53:00,733
It is. It's good.

778
00:53:03,703 --> 00:53:06,703
What just happened? I think it helped.

779

Each time you remember that day,

780
00:53:09,572 --> 00:53:11,372
if you think of it rationally,

781
00:53:11,373 --> 00:53:13,112
the negative feeling will subside.

00:56:31,543 --> 00:56:33,112
Thank you so much...

828
00:56:34,143 --> 00:56:37,442
for seeing that and making the first move.

829
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:01,833
Show yourself.

830
00:57:14,813 --> 00:57:16,623
I don't think you took anything.

831
00:57:17,023 --> 00:57:19,152
If you leave quietly, I'll let you off.

832
00:57:19,922 --> 00:57:21,793
If you so much as swing that,

833
00:57:23,822 --> 00:57:25,523
it'll get worse, and that would be no fun.

834
00:57:47,813 --> 00:57:49,052
Dr. Brain?

835
00:57:49,922 --> 00:57:51,782
He taught you that too?

836
00:57:51,853 --> 00:57:52,853
Yes.

837
00:57:52,854 --> 00:57:55,722
For me, love used to be a bad memory.

838
00:57:55,953 --> 00:57:58,463
But he let me create a new memory over that.

839
00:57:59,463 --> 00:58:02,092
Dr. Brain's a pretty nice guy.

840
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,901
Since Dr. Brain helped you create a new memory,

841
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,442
how about we create a thrilling memory?

842
00:58:13,543 --> 00:58:14,543
What...

843
00:58:15,572 --> 00:58:17,183
Oh, my.

844
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,043
What is this, all of a sudden?

845
00:58:19,242 --> 00:58:21,353
Goodness. Isn't this too sudden?

846
00:58:43,802 --> 00:58:45,873
Gosh, I'm sorry.

847
00:58:47,112 --> 00:58:48,643
Darn it.

848
00:58:50,612 --> 00:58:52,341
I don't need to take this call.

849
00:58:52,342 --> 00:58:53,453
It's okay. Answer it.

850
00:58:54,012 --> 00:58:55,683
- No, I'll call back later... - No.

851
00:58:56,152 --> 00:58:57,152
Answer it now...

852
00:58:57,382 --> 00:58:59,382
and confidently tell her that you're out on a date now.

853
00:59:03,092 --> 00:59:04,092
Okay.

854
00:59:06,092 --> 00:59:09,433
Myung Se! Help me! I've got a big problem.

855
00:59:09,603 --> 00:59:10,733
What is it now?

856
00:59:11,163 --> 00:59:12,933
- I'm out on a date... - There is...

857
00:59:13,103 --> 00:59:15,233
a dead body in front of me right now.

858
00:59:15,532 --> 00:59:17,873
I'll take a picture and send it to you.

859
00:59:27,683 --> 00:59:28,713
My gosh...

860
00:59:35,793 --> 00:59:36,793
It is indeed a dead body.

861
00:59:38,523 --> 00:59:39,592
It's a murder case.

862
01:00:08,552 --> 01:00:11,463
(Brain Works)

863
01:00:11,963 --> 01:00:15,532
Something's definitely up. That I know for sure.

864
01:00:16,063 --> 01:00:18,532
My gut tells me that Dr. Shin is their target.

865
01:00:18,733 --> 01:00:20,472
Are you saying the person who broke into my home...

866
01:00:20,532 --> 01:00:22,972
is the murder suspect?

867
01:00:23,302 --> 01:00:25,003
One thing at a time.

868
01:00:25,302 --> 01:00:27,512
Just do as I say.

869
01:00:28,172 --> 01:00:29,782
Is there something I don't know?

870
01:00:29,983 --> 01:00:32,413
The defense counsel is bringing him in as a witness.

871
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:36,083
The game has begun, at last.

872
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:39,992
Things won't go according to your plan.
