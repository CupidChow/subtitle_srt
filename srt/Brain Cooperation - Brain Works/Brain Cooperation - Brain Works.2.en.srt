The detective called me

You look much nicer
in real life than on screen.

46

I saw you on that program.

We'd love the help of someone famous,

51

are watching closely.

What?

62
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:26,914
- You wanted to collaborate.
- You said no.

just to mess with me?

You glanced to the top right corner.

66
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,194
According to neuroscience, you're lying.

67
00:03:39,194 --> 00:03:40,854
You look left when you lie.

164
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:20,414
You have no idea how temperamental he is!

165
00:08:20,414 --> 00:08:21,604
What the...

166
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,205
My gosh.

167
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:25,145
He's a dirty cop.

168
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:27,715
I'll get evidence on him, humiliate him,

169
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,314
and then get him dismissed.

170
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,554
I can realize social justice...

171
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:32,814
and get my revenge too.

172
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:34,484
Two birds with one stone.

173
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:35,684
I see.

174
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:39,165
- Investigate!
- Investigate!

175
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:43,133
Investigate Kim Jae Won's
murder case thoroughly!

176
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:45,104
- Investigate!
- Investigate!

177
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:47,324
- Investigate!
- Investigate!

178
00:08:47,374 --> 00:08:52,064
We urge you to investigate Jung In Young!

179
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:54,114
- We urge you to investigate!
- We urge you to investigate!

180
00:08:54,114 --> 00:08:56,434
- We urge you to investigate!
- We urge you to investigate!

181
00:08:56,484 --> 00:08:59,384
- Investigate Kim Jae Won's...
- You're wasting taxpayers' money.

182
00:08:59,384 --> 00:09:00,455
murder case thoroughly!

183
00:09:00,455 --> 00:09:02,555
- Investigate!
- Investigate!

184
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:04,685
Come on. My day is just starting.

185
00:09:04,685 --> 00:09:06,254
Why are you so hostile toward me?

186
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,994
You live off taxpayers' hard-earned money.

187
00:09:08,994 --> 00:09:10,825
- How could you smoke...
- We urge you to investigate!

188
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:12,535
- while working?
- We urge you to investigate!

189
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:13,535
Look over there.

190
00:09:13,535 --> 00:09:15,734
His fans are desperately hoping that...

191
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:17,435
his case gets closed
as quickly as possible.

192
00:09:17,435 --> 00:09:19,575
- Can't you see that?
- Investigate!

193
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:21,305
Listen. Dr. Brain.

194
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:23,175
You see, my brain can't function...

195
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:24,504
unless I smoke after my meals.

196
00:09:24,504 --> 00:09:26,945
You should have smoked
before you started your shift.

197
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:28,945
- We urge you to investigate!
- We urge you to investigate!

198
00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:30,945
So this is how you're going to torture me?

199
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,354
You know what? Forget it.

200
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:34,505
I won't smoke it. You're so petty.

201
00:09:37,484 --> 00:09:39,115
Withdrawing from it won't be easy.

202
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:41,864
Your nicotine-craving brain
will desperately want it.

203
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:43,964
Come on. Don't be so petty.

204
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:45,935
Decide. Hang up your badge.

205
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:47,655
Or endure my immature comments.

206
00:09:48,565 --> 00:09:49,935
You leave me no choice.

207
00:09:49,935 --> 00:09:51,364
I'm good at enduring things...

208
00:09:51,364 --> 00:09:53,194
as it's in my DNA to be patient.

209
00:09:53,904 --> 00:09:56,045
Let me buy you lunch
as a way to show you my support.

210
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:58,774
Choose. Korean food,
Chinese food, or western food.

211
00:09:58,774 --> 00:09:59,914
What do you want?

212
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:02,035
What's up with this random offer?

213
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:03,334
Just pick one.

214
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:05,475
I don't know. Chinese?

215
00:10:05,884 --> 00:10:07,054
Pick one.

216
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:08,714
Jjajangmyeon, jjamppong, or fried rice.

217
00:10:09,124 --> 00:10:11,245
The restaurant's jjajangmyeon is good.

218
00:10:11,854 --> 00:10:14,314
But I'm craving some spicy broth
at the same time.

219
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:16,023
I need to cure my hangover.
So I'll go with jjamppong.

220
00:10:16,024 --> 00:10:18,755
Choose. The clear broth or the red broth.

221
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:21,824
I'm not sure.
Jjamppong with the clear broth?

222
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,435
Gosh. You know what?

223
00:10:23,435 --> 00:10:25,335
The broth should be red
for jjamppong. Red broth.

224
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:27,534
Choose. Seafood or beef brisket?

225
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:30,164
I'm not sure. I like both. Beef brisket?

226
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:32,005
Choose.

227
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:34,274
Lee Yeon Bok's jjamppong
or Paik Jong Won's jjamppong.

228
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:37,275
Come on. What are you doing right now?

229
00:10:37,285 --> 00:10:38,514
I'm asking you to make a choice.

230
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:40,354
Why do you keep pestering me
with these choices?

231
00:10:40,354 --> 00:10:42,674
It's not even lunchtime yet.
You're giving me a headache.

232
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:46,115
Do you know why you have a headache?

233
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:49,795
All right. Let me give you a piece
of information about brain science.

234
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:51,385
You see, let me compare...

235
00:10:51,494 --> 00:10:53,494
our brains to the cell phone battery.

236
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:56,655
Our brains can only make
a limited number of good choices.

237
00:10:56,734 --> 00:10:59,225
Regardless of the importance level,
once our brains used them up,

238
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:01,175
we may end up making a bad decision.

239
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:03,365
Jjamppong or jjajangmyeon?

240
00:11:03,675 --> 00:11:06,765
Making a series of useless choices...

241
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,445
reduces our ability
to control our impulses...

242
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:10,875
and also lowers our chances
of making good judgments.

243
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:13,114
Not to use our brain power
for useless things,

244
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:16,844
Steve Jobs wore the same outfit.
That's a famous story.

245
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:18,145
I see.

246
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:22,615
That's why that rich guy
always wore the same outfit.

247
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,165
Because he had to make
dozens of decisions...

248
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:26,355
that could change
his company's future every day.

249
00:11:26,795 --> 00:11:27,985
But...

250
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:29,855
what is this?

251
00:11:30,104 --> 00:11:31,705
You didn't exactly use your brain power.

252
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:34,094
You already have a headache
from choosing your lunch menu.

253
00:11:34,104 --> 00:11:36,143
As your brain capacity is very low,

254
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:38,605
your brain must be overloaded
with making a few choices.

255
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:40,505
To compare your brain to a computer,

256
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:42,704
it must be one from the 80s.

257
00:11:45,884 --> 00:11:47,074
Gosh, that little...

258
00:11:47,354 --> 00:11:48,884
He's so annoying.

259
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:50,074
(Seobu Police Station)

260
00:11:50,724 --> 00:11:51,854
- Salute.
- Hello.

261
00:11:51,854 --> 00:11:53,124
- Gosh.
- What?

262
00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:54,253
What's up with his hair?

263
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:56,264
- Did you see his hair?
- Did you see it?

264
00:11:56,264 --> 00:11:57,454
My hair.

265
00:11:57,864 --> 00:12:00,255
Come on! Good grief.

266
00:12:03,364 --> 00:12:04,554
You're here.

267
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:09,574
Gosh. Captain.

268
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:11,175
What are you doing all by yourself?

269
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:13,834
The office was a bit messy.

270
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:16,505
I could tell Dr. Shin was bothered by it.

271
00:12:21,014 --> 00:12:22,214
Geez.

272
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:30,914
You figured out my preferences right away.

273
00:12:31,394 --> 00:12:33,454
That's a great talent for investigators.

274
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:36,604
To thank you
for your willingness to cooperate,

275
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:39,004
I will use all of my knowledge
to close this case...

276
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:41,424
with a result as clean as this office.

277
00:12:41,575 --> 00:12:43,434
Thank you.

278
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:46,804
All right.

279
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:48,635
Let's start the briefing for the case.

280
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:51,235
Okay.

281
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:57,074
What a nutcase.

282
00:12:57,825 --> 00:13:00,844
According to the autopsy results,
the DBS electrodes burned.

283
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:03,714
The cerebral hemorrhage started
where the DBS electrodes were.

284
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:04,864
It's confirmed that...

285
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:07,155
he died due to the heat
from the high-frequency devices.

286
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:09,205
I checked Kim Jae Won's phone...

287
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,134
which had an app,
connected to high-frequency devices.

288
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:13,324
Around 8 p.m.,

289
00:13:13,374 --> 00:13:15,365
which was around the time
the victim collapsed,

290
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,694
the output reached its highest point.

291
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:19,845
Kim Jae Won asked her to kill her...

292
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:22,475
and gave his phone to her
before getting on the stage.

293
00:13:22,514 --> 00:13:24,614
Then his wife complied with his request.

294
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:26,245
That's what she said
during her confession.

295
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:31,515
That confession...

296
00:13:32,555 --> 00:13:34,645
Can you be sure she's telling the truth?

297
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:41,184
Did you summon his wife?

298
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:43,355
When will she get here?

299
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:45,503
- There she is.
- She's here!

300
00:13:45,504 --> 00:13:47,725
- She's here!
- Look!

301
00:13:48,604 --> 00:13:49,794
Murderer!

302
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:51,845
- Get out of the car!
- Get out now!

303
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:53,175
- Hey.
- Come on out!

304
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:54,274
- Step back.
- You!

305
00:13:54,274 --> 00:13:55,735
Come on out!

306
00:13:55,984 --> 00:13:57,174
Take that!

307
00:13:57,415 --> 00:13:58,955
You're a murderer!

308
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:01,944
How could you kill him? You murderer!

309
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:08,115
- Step back.
- Get out!

310
00:14:23,874 --> 00:14:25,294
This must be hard on you.

311
00:14:25,445 --> 00:14:28,664
Asking questions is
part of the investigation process.

312
00:14:28,815 --> 00:14:30,005
Please be understanding.

313
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,975
I thought you were going to question her.

314
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,285
Let me ask you again.

315
00:14:41,624 --> 00:14:44,855
Why did you run the high-frequency app?

316
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:48,424
Jae Won...

317
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:53,834
wanted to die when he was shining
the most brightly on stage.

318
00:14:53,835 --> 00:14:56,135
You didn't try to stop him?

319
00:14:58,974 --> 00:15:00,765
I wanted to stop him.

320
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:05,405
I said I didn't want to do it.

321
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:11,015
I told him I couldn't do it.

322
00:15:11,384 --> 00:15:14,515
But why did you run the app then?

323
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:22,225
I don't know.

324
00:15:23,065 --> 00:15:24,725
I don't know why I did it.

325
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:27,404
I don't know.

326
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:28,625
Ms. Jung.

327
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:30,175
You just committed to...

328
00:15:30,175 --> 00:15:31,644
contract killing. Are you aware of that?

329
00:15:31,644 --> 00:15:34,605
That's enough. Ms. Jung already
admitted to all the charges...

330
00:15:43,685 --> 00:15:44,875
Ms. Jung.

331
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:46,645
Have you been well?

332
00:15:53,134 --> 00:15:54,554
He seems familiar.

333
00:15:54,695 --> 00:15:56,725
I'm Neuroscientist Shin Ha Ru.

334
00:15:57,205 --> 00:16:00,164
We met at a wrap party after
the rock festival on Jara Island.

335
00:16:04,805 --> 00:16:06,105
Right.

336
00:16:08,644 --> 00:16:10,334
You've been well, right?

337
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,035
Of course.

338
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:15,044
I was meaning to call you.
But I never got around to it.

339
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:19,424
Right. You introduced me
to one of your friends that day.

340
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:20,454
What was the name?

341
00:16:20,455 --> 00:16:21,645
A Young?

342
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:25,155
Right. A Young.

343
00:16:25,864 --> 00:16:27,054
Is she well?

344
00:16:27,364 --> 00:16:28,534
Yes.

345
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:31,454
A Young wanted to see you.

346
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:42,105
- That was all a lie?
- That was all a lie?

347
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:45,235
Yes. I had never met her before today.

348
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:46,555
What about meeting her on Jara Island?

349
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:47,844
I've never been there.

350
00:16:47,915 --> 00:16:50,185
Then what about the girl, A Young?

351
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:51,615
I've never heard of her.

352
00:16:52,254 --> 00:16:54,814
So Ms. Jung really made everything up?

353
00:16:55,465 --> 00:16:57,554
Yes. And she did it...

354
00:16:57,624 --> 00:17:01,184
because she's suffering
from Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

355
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:02,704
Wer...

356
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:04,625
Wernicke...

357
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:07,603
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome...

358
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:10,064
is a memory disorder,
caused by brain damage.

359
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:11,805
WKS patients are sensitive
to implications...

360
00:17:11,805 --> 00:17:14,914
and show signs of confabulation.
It's a rare neurological disorder.

361
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:16,235
Confabulation.

362
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:18,874
So she makes up stories?

363
00:17:19,315 --> 00:17:20,413
Yes.

364
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,644
That's why she thought we had met
when I mentioned meeting her.

365
00:17:23,654 --> 00:17:26,384
And she made up a story to fit my story.

366
00:17:26,894 --> 00:17:29,915
Then running the application...

367
00:17:32,164 --> 00:17:35,185
Ms. Jung probably made it up.

368
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:40,894
Gosh. But why do I get the feeling
you're the one with made-up stories?

369
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:43,444
What if those are the facts?

370
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:44,634
What else?

371
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:47,334
I'll dish out a compliment.

372
00:17:48,174 --> 00:17:51,143
Are you sure you can handle that promise?

373
00:17:51,144 --> 00:17:53,775
Yes, I'll handle it for sure.

374
00:17:55,085 --> 00:17:57,275
Okay. Let's confirm that it's true.

375
00:18:00,795 --> 00:18:03,314
(Korea National University Hospital)

376
00:18:04,924 --> 00:18:07,194
Bleeding and damage in the hypothalamus.

377
00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:09,633
What I'm seeing
are general signs of brain atrophy.

378
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:12,364
I suspect a severe thiamin deficiency.

379
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:15,965
She's suffering from
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

380
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:21,005
I wonder what caused
her thiamin deficiency.

381
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:23,334
It's not common.

382
00:18:24,245 --> 00:18:25,705
Hand tremors,

383
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:28,604
short breaths and hyperventilation,

384
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,844
and spider veins on her nose.

385
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:33,644
Mr. Oh.

386
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:36,485
Ms. Jung is an alcoholic, isn't she?

387
00:18:40,864 --> 00:18:42,054
Yes, she is.

388
00:18:45,164 --> 00:18:47,603
She suffers from alcohol dependence...

389
00:18:47,604 --> 00:18:50,435
which caused her thiamin deficiency.

390
00:18:50,904 --> 00:18:52,775
That is why her previous confession...

391
00:18:52,775 --> 00:18:56,114
which was made up due to her having
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome...

392
00:18:56,114 --> 00:18:57,535
can't be admissible as evidence.

393
00:18:57,745 --> 00:19:00,344
You'll have to reinvestigate.

394
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,969
The case will be investigated
from the very beginning.

395
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:16,640
Right, I'm glad.

396
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,850
We'll get going, then. Please be in touch.

397
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,729
And now we suddenly have a long way to go.

398
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,630
Let's go.

399
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:41,340
Where do you think you're going?

400
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,578
Let me see you be someone admirable
who keeps his promises.

401
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:47,680
Go ahead. Compliment me.

402
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,589
You can't be serious
when I meant it as a joke.

403
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:55,049
But it wasn't funny.

404
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:57,650
Go ahead. Compliment me.

405
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,090
Dr. Shin, people are watching.

406
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,430
I'm used to people watching.

407
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,590
They gaze in awe
and also as a form of criticism.

408
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:09,400
I've experienced it all
and am not fazed by it.

409
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,570
Sure, I'll do it.
A compliment isn't a big deal.

410
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,110
Darn it.

411
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,779
Dr. Shin,

412
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:29,779
you...

413
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,019
You're...

414
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,489
I can't do it. Hit me instead.

415
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,160
Take that.

416
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,900
Shouldn't a police officer be better
at keeping promises?

417
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,570
Gosh, it's crimson red. Are you all right?

418
00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:52,670
No, the humiliation is enough to kill me.

419
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,920
Why you little... What on earth was that?

420
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,779
You should've just slapped me instead.

421
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:04,230
Get away from him before he slaps you.

422
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,249
- You crazy little...
- Crazy?

423
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:08,959
- Can you handle what you just said?
- I sure can.

424
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,489
Why you...

425
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:22,340
You're upset, aren't you?

426
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,840
The disciplinary committee
was hard on him.

427
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,080
Something is better
with old age, you know.

428
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:33,680
My amygdala...

429
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,180
isn't as sensitive as it used to be
to negative stimuli.

430
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,860
I'm thinking more positively now.

431
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:44,019
Ha Ru will pull through.

432
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,830
That being said,

433
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:49,130
I hear there's a position at UC Irvine.

434
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,330
Actually,

435
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:54,499
he wishes to return to Brain Hub.

436
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,840
- He wants to come back?
- That's right.

437
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,840
He will no matter what.

438
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:05,449
I'm sure you want him
to come back as well.

439
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,650
I'd be more than happy to have him back.

440
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,680
Are you kidding me?

441
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:45,559
Stop annoying me with your pacing and sit.

442
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:48,459
I walk counterclockwise
whenever I'm thinking.

443
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,860
Get used to it.

444
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,299
Is there a particular reason
as to why you walk counterclockwise?

445
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,570
Your brain actively thinks harder
when the body is moving around.

446
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:02,070
Join me.

447
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,279
Unbelievable.

448
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,299
People who lack scientific thinking,
rationality, and logical reasoning,

449
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,160
but won't even work hard
to make up for it...

450
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,620
are those I detest.

451
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,559
Detest me all you want.

452
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,759
Why don't I join you?

453
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,199
Unbelievable.

454
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,950
So you believe
that there's another person...

455
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,809
who activated Mr. Kim's
high-frequency bracelet.

456
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:42,279
The educated has spoken.

457
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,460
Even an elementary school kid
would know that.

458
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,989
We haven't been fooling around, you know.

459
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,160
We looked into all the staff members...

460
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,729
that were filmed, but nothing came up.

461
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,769
Not one of them even knew
that Mr. Kim had been diagnosed...

462
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,489
with Parkinson's disease.

463
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,529
Actually, someone
was aware of his illness.

464
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:07,699
Two were aware of it.

465
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,670
Mr. Oh, at the time of the incident,

466
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,180
you were on the phone in the parking lot.

467
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,279
That's right. I was talking to my wife.

468
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:22,588
I went to the parking lot
to get away from the noise.

469
00:24:22,589 --> 00:24:24,549
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

470
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:27,620
Can't that be confirmed
by security footage?

471
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,860
Gosh.

472
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:34,459
Yes, we have you right here.

473
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,529
There's a log of the call you made
which makes a clear alibi.

474
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:42,140
Would you be willing
to turn in your phone?

475
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,509
Sure. Here you go.

476
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:54,449
By the way, weren't you aware
that Ms. Jung was suffering...

477
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,749
from Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome?

478
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,519
Never before had I heard of
such an illness.

479
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:03,230
Then, do you believe that Ms. Jung...

480
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,160
knowingly turned on the app?

481
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:11,670
Jae Won and In Young...

482
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:14,170
were like family to me.

483
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:17,809
I just hope that it's not true.

484
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,390
The phone was turned over to Forensics.

485
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:37,798
We just need to confirm
if the app was ever installed,

486
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,330
so it won't take long.

487
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:42,059
I doubt we'll find anything.

488
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,229
Tell me about it.

489
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,710
Him turning it over so easily
makes you wonder.

490
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,199
Do you think he did it or not?

491
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,969
Choose.

492
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:54,019
He did it. No, he didn't.

493
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,949
Actually, I can't say that he didn't.

494
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,509
We're still investigating, so...

495
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:01,259
Darn it. Stop making me choose, will you?

496
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,259
You're giving me that response
after one single choice?

497
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:04,850
Your brain capacity must have shrunk.

498
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:07,559
What about you, then?

499
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:10,160
You claimed that even the eyes
were a dead giveaway,

500
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:12,160
so why have you been glaring
at the footage?

501
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,600
Maybe I should glare at you instead.

502
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:19,070
Guys, please. We have one more suspect.

503
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,529
That reminds me.

504
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,110
Is there someone on the force
that can read lips?

505
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,850
I've been wanting
to meet you in person, Dr. Shin,

506
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,650
and here we are.

507
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:41,630
As you know, the recent scandal...

508
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,900
has me wandering like a stray cat.

509
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,160
Places will line up
to hire you soon enough.

510
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,199
You're the best neurologist of all.

511
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:51,529
Did you hear that?

512
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,199
I know you're busy,
but we have a few questions.

513
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,370
Come this way.

514
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,549
Quite a few videos from that day
are going around.

515
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:11,549
We noticed something interesting
in one of them.

516
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:18,529
What did you say?

517
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:21,959
I'm not sure. I was pretty frantic.

518
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,630
I don't remember.

519
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,570
We consulted a lip-reader.

520
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,900
You said...

521
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,799
You killed him.

522
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:32,570
"You killed him."

523
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,039
It sounded like you were sure
Jung In Young had killed him.

524
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,549
It was just a resentful comment.

525
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,180
I knew the couple fought a lot
over her alcoholism.

526
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,650
Jae Won suffered a lot because of that.

527
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,920
"He died because
you gave him a hard time."

528
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,690
That's what I meant.

529
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:57,330
Perhaps you knew Ms. Jung
had Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome...

530
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,100
and spoke suggestively.

531
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,539
So she would believe
she'd killed her husband.

532
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:08,239
I didn't know Ms. Jung had
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

533
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,850
You were close enough to know
she was an alcoholic.

534
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:13,709
Did you really not know?

535
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,150
I could tell right away
when I saw her eyes...

536
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:19,549
and gait on the TV news.

537
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:24,289
I'm not as great a neurologist as you are.

538
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:25,529
It's a great pity.

539
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:32,729
Come on. You're way too humble.

540
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:35,600
You're the best doctor...

541
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,799
at Yuil University Hospital.

542
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,269
Even if I did know,

543
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,009
why would I make Ms. Jung look guilty?

544
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,110
For love.

545
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,180
Dr. Shin.

546
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,850
You crossed the line.

547
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,489
Of course I love him.

548
00:28:58,539 --> 00:28:59,729
As a fan.

549
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,299
I loved Jae Won as a fan.

550
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,370
My gosh.

551
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,269
What's that about?

552
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,110
Stop it. Let's go.

553
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:14,779
Stand up.

554
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,420
Let's go. Get up.

555
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:31,759
Come along.

556
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:36,839
Do you know that patient?

557
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:39,370
He's one of mine. He can't speak.

558
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:48,009
Then...

559
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,039
you must know...

560
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,080
what his laughter meant.

561
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:03,090
I have nothing to do with Jae Won's death.

562
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,899
I have patients to see.

563
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,390
- Excuse me.
- Oh, sure.

564
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,229
I'm sorry if you were offended.

565
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:09,559
Goodbye.

566
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,619
What did his laughter mean?

567
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:28,180
They seemed to know something.
What was it?

568
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,779
Like I said,

569
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,890
it means Jae Won and his doctor...

570
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:33,949
had a relationship.

571
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,360
The man lost his ability to speak.

572
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,989
Some of them become great lie detectors.

573
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:44,130
As a fan. I loved Jae Won as a fan.

574
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,509
They lose their speech
but gain the ability...

575
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:51,039
to sense the awkwardness in one's voice,
expression, and aura.

576
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,239
Oh, that's amazing. Is that true?

577
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,220
"Your mouth may lie,"

578
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,449
"but your face tells the truth."

579
00:30:58,789 --> 00:30:59,979
Nietzsche said that.

580
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:03,249
Sorry.

581
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,989
You're probably closer
to nakedness than Nietzsche.

582
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:08,049
Was that talk too hard to keep up with?

583
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:12,500
Hey, I got it too, okay?

584
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,090
We were going so well.

585
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:17,109
Anyway, some who lose their speech...

586
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:20,330
end up being human lie detectors
is the point of the day.

587
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:23,039
Then did the doctor lie?

588
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,269
Why do I get the impression you're lying?

589
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,680
Okay. Let's bet.

590
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:34,209
For a slap.

591
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,689
Act cute.

592
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,880
Act sweet.

593
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,150
One, two.

594
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:58,151

595
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,509
Yes.

596
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,809
The two were close.

597
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,880
I knew.

598
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,449
Oh, that...

599
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,559
must've upset you.

600
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,360
No.

601
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,789
I couldn't live if I got upset over that.

602
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,259
So many women threw themselves
at my husband.

603
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:35,140
They all were passing fancies.

604
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,539
In the end, Jae Won...

605
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,239
was mine.

606
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:50,850
It's true. I knew as well.

607
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:52,930
I guess Jae Won relied on her...

608
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,890
when his illness took a toll on him.

609
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,590
They ended it shortly after.

610
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,390
I think the doctor...

611
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,699
got a bit obsessive after they broke up.

612
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:06,499
To be honest,
I think the doctor's the killer.

613
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:09,969
This happened yesterday.

614
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:11,739
Take a look.

615
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,610
I had a bad feeling about her,

616
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,050
so I followed her around.

617
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,349
Didn't she get rid of it
because she felt guilty?

618
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,969
(Details of suspect: Kim Hee Ju, 43)

619
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:36,340
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

620
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,908
She won't pick up...

621
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,670
or reply to the message.

622
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,300
This smells so suspicious.

623
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,740
I'll bring the doctor in.

624
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:51,539
I'll tag along.

625
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,909
Listen, Dr. Brain.

626
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,889
A consultant's joining me in the field?

627
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:57,329
Aren't you overstepping your boundaries?

628
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:59,828
I'd love to see you bring in a suspect.

629
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:02,159
We're short on time,
and I can be of assistance.

630
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,559
There's something I'm good at.

631
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:16,940
Darn you!

632
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,518
This car isn't as nice as yours!

633
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,750
It'll break down at this speed!

634
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,750
It's nice and thrilling
to drive a ratty car for once.

635
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,789
Hey! Come on!

636
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:27,849
Stop, pull over!

637
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,720
Can you pull over before we crash?

638
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,059
I feel like throwing up.

639
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:41,340
I bet we got
a million tickets for speeding.

640
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,999
What'll you do about that?

641
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,700
I'll pay for them all.

642
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:48,499
Is this what people do
to flaunt their riches?

643
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,240
The government can use the money wisely.

644
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,409
You can't understand
how creatively I pay my taxes.

645
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:56,539
Ring the doorbell.

646
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,510
Darn you.

647
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:01,720
Gosh.

648
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:05,329
You were home, Ms. Kim.

649
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,849
Why didn't you answer...

650
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,599
Excuse me?

651
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:36,079
Who are you?

652
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,659
Ms. Jung.

653
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:51,130
Please step back.

654
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,769
Stay back.

655
00:36:56,309 --> 00:36:58,200
They put handcuffs on her.
What's going on?

656
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:02,079
My goodness. What happened?

657
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:04,740
- What's going on?
- What?

658
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:13,119
Gosh. She didn't seem
strong enough to hold a knife.

659
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,050
Why did she suddenly
do something like this?

660
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,760
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome
probably fed her delusion.

661
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,940
She probably thought...

662
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,738
his doctor might have killed her husband.

663
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,659
Then at one point,
she believed that to be true.

664
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,570
Then did she kill her husband
because of her delusion?

665
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,200
Let's not commit
a hasty generalization fallacy.

666
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,409
Right. We can't know that yet.

667
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,880
Was it his wife or his lover?

668
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:38,880
It must be one of them.

669
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,179
Ms. Kim Hee Ju will pull through.

670
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,119
I finished questioning her
in the hospital room.

671
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,099
She didn't want her relationship
with the victim to come to light,

672
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:47,349
so she threw away her phone.

673
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,999
I think Ms. Kim is our prime suspect.

674
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,868
She has the most knowledge regarding DBS.

675
00:37:54,869 --> 00:37:57,630
And it's odd that
she just threw away her phone.

676
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,909
Considering the circumstances,

677
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:00,939
wouldn't Ms. Jung be our prime suspect?

678
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,079
Just look at how violent she was
against Ms. Kim.

679
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:06,010
I bet she didn't have a problem
harming her husband.

680
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:09,409
If she had hurt her husband
out of rage or jealousy,

681
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,709
she wouldn't have turned herself in.

682
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,380
No. She would have.

683
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,249
She probably felt hopeless.

684
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:17,579
I'm not sure about that.

685
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:22,920
To make that conclusion,
we need a lot more evidence.

686
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,170
Besides, they weren't exactly happy...

687
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,469
together...

688
00:38:27,469 --> 00:38:29,469
Kill him.

689
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:32,039
Given the circumstances...

690
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:34,229
You never had to deal with
a cheating spouse, right?

691
00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:36,599
Then you can't possibly talk about...

692
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,349
(Yi Na's mom)

693
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:41,670
Gosh. Can't be more perfect than this.

694
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,110
Come on.

695
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:46,709
Did she install a spy app?

696
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,999
(Yi Na's mom)

697
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,659
Come on!

698
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:05,229
What?

699
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,809
Let's go. We need to go somewhere.

700
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,289
Don't cook. I don't have time to eat that.

701
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:18,650
We end up throwing out half of it.

702
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,550
It's not for you. It's for Yi Na.

703
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,820
Is something up with her?

704
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:25,260
She hasn't been returning
my calls or texts.

705
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,019
Gosh. I'm so jealous.
I wish I could do the same.

706
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,289
It's not possible for you.
She takes after me.

707
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,959
She's home. Bye.

708
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:39,099
Yi Na.

709
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,369
Why didn't you answer your phone?
I was worried.

710
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,209
Let's go out. I got paid.

711
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,320
Let's get some tasty food.
It's been a while.

712
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,320
How about some new clothes?

713
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,459
I don't need them.

714
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,720
Why not? Girls around your age
love wearing pretty clothes.

715
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:01,500
When I was your age,
your grandma never bought me...

716
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,389
Unlike you, I don't have any guys
I want to impress.

717
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,360
I don't need them.

718
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:09,130
What did you mean by that?

719
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,809
That's no way to talk to your mother.

720
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:13,429
What about having an affair?
Is that how a mom should behave?

721
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,400
Are you even paying Dad child support?

722
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,440
Well,

723
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:23,940
on some days, I have work.

724
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:26,288
And on other days, I don't have work.

725
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:27,709
I feel awful for Dad.

726
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,920
Wait.

727
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,490
Yes. That's a piece of cake these days.

728
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,959
That's very doable.

729
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,590
Okay. Great.

730
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,138
Did you figure out who the culprit is?

731
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:47,630
Yes. I finally figured out...

732
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:50,269
who killed Kim Jae Won.

733
00:40:53,072 --> 00:40:56,092
- Investigate!
- Investigate!

734
00:40:56,093 --> 00:40:58,033
- Investigate Kim Jae Won's case...
- There he is.

735
00:40:58,033 --> 00:40:59,834
- thoroughly.
- He's coming out.

736
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:01,263
Hey.

737
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:04,941
We discovered new information
about Ms. Jung In Young.

738
00:41:04,952 --> 00:41:06,822
So we're investigating the case
from square one.

739
00:41:06,822 --> 00:41:08,111
What did you discover about her?

740
00:41:08,521 --> 00:41:12,211
Well, I can't tell you
due to privacy reasons.

741
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:13,992
Is it true that she's using...

742
00:41:13,992 --> 00:41:16,182
her alcohol addiction
to reduce her sentence?

743
00:41:16,262 --> 00:41:19,051
There are rumors that
Ms. Jung has a secret lover.

744
00:41:19,731 --> 00:41:21,452
Can you take responsibility
for such accusations?

745
00:41:26,102 --> 00:41:28,432
That would make
a perfect case for slander.

746
00:41:29,602 --> 00:41:31,111
- Wasn't that Dr. Shin?
- Dr. Shin?

747
00:41:31,111 --> 00:41:32,512
- That was him, right?
- I think so.

748
00:41:32,512 --> 00:41:33,841
- What's he doing here?
- What is Dr. Shin doing here?

749
00:41:33,841 --> 00:41:36,682
Well, Dr. Shin...

is a consultant for
Neuroscientific Investigation Team.

751
00:41:39,182 --> 00:41:40,822
- Really? Dr. Shin.
- That was him.

752
00:41:40,822 --> 00:41:43,412
- Dr. Shin!
- Dr. Shin!

753
00:41:53,702 --> 00:41:55,392
Did they just walk right past me?

754
00:41:58,401 --> 00:41:59,821
Is that dust in my eyes?

755
00:42:00,702 --> 00:42:02,091
Why are there tears?

We should go catch the culprit.

- Clint Eastwood.
- Choose.

Yoo Jae Ha or Cho Yong Pil.

788
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,242
Cho Yong Pil.

789

Choose.

Why...

Why are you asking me
such ridiculous questions?

00:45:19,731 --> 00:45:21,662
You must have lied only for one reason.

800
00:45:22,742 --> 00:45:25,262
Just in case I connected
Kim Jae Won's death...

801
00:45:25,311 --> 00:45:27,731
to celebrities who died young,

802
00:45:28,441 --> 00:45:29,872
you were worried.

803
00:45:32,111 --> 00:45:35,111
And this. It's yours.
Why couldn't you pick your phone?

804
00:45:35,722 --> 00:45:37,322
I see.

805
00:45:37,322 --> 00:45:41,182
You must have been flustered
at how we found this.

806
00:45:43,122 --> 00:45:45,522
I don't think I follow.

807
00:45:46,802 --> 00:45:48,691
How is that my phone?

808
00:45:49,702 --> 00:45:50,892
This specific model...

809
00:45:51,771 --> 00:45:54,492
can be used for deep brain stimulation.

810
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:56,591
It's the same model Mr. Kim had.

811
00:45:59,941 --> 00:46:01,432
I wonder why you bought this.

812
00:46:02,111 --> 00:46:04,512
Probably to copy his phone...

813
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,671
and access the high-frequency app on it.

814
00:46:08,052 --> 00:46:09,671
At the time,

815
00:46:10,052 --> 00:46:12,312
I was on the phone with my wife.

816
00:46:13,421 --> 00:46:14,611
That's right.

817
00:46:14,921 --> 00:46:18,452
You were using earbuds
to talk to your wife.

818
00:46:19,731 --> 00:46:22,551
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

819
00:46:22,802 --> 00:46:25,792
All while accessing the app
on your phone. So...

820
00:46:26,302 --> 00:46:28,131
which phone did you use to call your wife?

821
00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:36,801
You called your wife first
and pocketed the phone.

822
00:46:36,912 --> 00:46:38,151
Then, you talked to her...

823
00:46:38,151 --> 00:46:40,272
where a security camera
had a clear view of you.

824
00:46:40,782 --> 00:46:42,772
Yes, I'm at the arena.

825
00:46:43,452 --> 00:46:45,412
To give yourself the perfect alibi.

826
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:51,421
While on the phone,

827
00:46:51,461 --> 00:46:54,292
I looked up news articles
related to the show.

828
00:46:54,302 --> 00:46:56,952
That must've given you the wrong idea.

829
00:46:58,432 --> 00:47:00,492
Forensics will be able...

830
00:47:00,771 --> 00:47:02,691
to easily access
your Internet search history.

831
00:47:03,372 --> 00:47:04,562
All right.

832
00:47:05,372 --> 00:47:08,231
They'll even tell us
whether this is yours or not.

833
00:47:09,782 --> 00:47:11,150
Do as you wish.

834
00:47:11,151 --> 00:47:13,372
We'll call you
once the test results come back.

835
00:47:13,682 --> 00:47:14,872
Shall we?

836
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:36,840
I'm getting a bad feeling about this,

837
00:47:36,841 --> 00:47:38,872
which isn't ideal.

838
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:41,131
I don't think we'll get anything on him.

839
00:47:41,211 --> 00:47:42,401
Choose, detective.

840
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:44,452
Would you rather be incompetent
or anxious?

841
00:47:44,452 --> 00:47:47,171
Again with those darn choices!

842
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:51,412
Your brain capacity
is shrinking close to zero.

843
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:54,481
What the...

844
00:48:19,952 --> 00:48:22,272
How dare they fool me!

845
00:48:24,921 --> 00:48:26,412
Oh, dear.

846
00:48:26,921 --> 00:48:29,312
Talk about a proper brain overload.

847
00:48:29,591 --> 00:48:32,051
You led us to the evidence yourself.

848
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:52,301
You weren't kidding about
being a judo athlete.

849
00:48:54,751 --> 00:48:56,512
He might be able to end the detective.

850
00:49:25,251 --> 00:49:27,542
Did you just pick up a tool?

851
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:37,751
You are under arrest
for the murder of Kim Jae Won.

852
00:49:48,102 --> 00:49:49,572
You were worried that Ms. Jung...

853
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:52,602
wouldn't be able to activate
the high-frequency app.

854
00:50:03,282 --> 00:50:05,512
It's why you took matters
into your own hands.

855
00:50:09,322 --> 00:50:11,032
You turned up the frequency...

856
00:50:11,032 --> 00:50:12,722
with the phone you had cloned in advance.

857
00:50:13,392 --> 00:50:15,702
After finding out
about Ms. Jung's medical condition,

858
00:50:15,702 --> 00:50:17,461
you also tried to frame her.

859
00:50:20,401 --> 00:50:21,591
That's not true.

860
00:50:21,901 --> 00:50:23,162
It's not.

861
00:50:24,012 --> 00:50:26,242
I only did it for Jae Won's sake.

862
00:50:26,242 --> 00:50:28,131
It wasn't an easy decision for me.

863
00:50:29,282 --> 00:50:30,472
The fans...

864
00:50:30,782 --> 00:50:33,501
want the artist
to always be at his or her best.

865
00:50:33,881 --> 00:50:36,182
Do you know
how many fans turn their backs...

866
00:50:36,182 --> 00:50:39,082
because of the smallest mistake and flaws?

867
00:50:39,251 --> 00:50:42,551
Jae Won's pride was his everything.

868
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:44,852
He didn't want his fans...

869
00:50:44,961 --> 00:50:48,892
to see his body stiffening
and him becoming more helpless.

870
00:50:49,032 --> 00:50:50,872
Rather than letting them see him weak,

871
00:50:50,872 --> 00:50:52,562
he wanted to die.

872
00:50:52,771 --> 00:50:54,691
He wanted to shine forever...

873
00:50:54,771 --> 00:50:56,992
in the moment he shined the brightest.

874
00:50:57,572 --> 00:50:59,572
I knew him better than anyone,

875
00:50:59,572 --> 00:51:01,772
and I knew how he felt.

876
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,151
In Young agreed to do it,

877
00:51:04,151 --> 00:51:05,452
but I knew she'd hesitate.

878
00:51:05,452 --> 00:51:06,642
That's why...

879
00:51:07,782 --> 00:51:10,042
I wanted to grant him that wish.

880
00:51:12,191 --> 00:51:14,281
Because I was the one who made him shine.

881
00:51:14,591 --> 00:51:17,251
I believed it was my duty to end it.

882
00:51:19,932 --> 00:51:22,392
I did it out of the love I had for him.

883
00:51:26,532 --> 00:51:29,361
Not everyone has to live
looking their best.

884
00:51:34,142 --> 00:51:35,702
"Even if you're not the brightest star,"

885
00:51:36,082 --> 00:51:37,901
"there are people
who will still love you."

886
00:51:38,082 --> 00:51:40,272
"You have me and In Young."

887
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:43,841
"Everyone else might walk away,
but we'll be here for you."

888
00:51:44,651 --> 00:51:46,841
"Because our lives shine the brightest..."

889
00:51:47,392 --> 00:51:51,182
"when we have you here
breathing among us."

890
00:51:56,361 --> 00:51:58,722
Shouldn't you have said
something like that?

891
00:51:59,671 --> 00:52:01,861
If you truly cared for Mr. Kim, I mean.

892
00:52:02,671 --> 00:52:06,901
You only saw him as a means
to fatten your bank account.

893
00:52:07,182 --> 00:52:08,381
Even in death,

894
00:52:08,381 --> 00:52:10,412
you saw him as an ATM machine...

895
00:52:10,412 --> 00:52:12,472
that would spit out money.

896
00:52:14,151 --> 00:52:17,142
The computer confiscated
from your office...

897
00:52:17,322 --> 00:52:18,981
gave us something intriguing.

898
00:52:22,262 --> 00:52:24,360
Freddie Mercury, Yoo Jae Ha,

899
00:52:24,361 --> 00:52:26,352
and a posthumous commemoration business.

900
00:52:26,662 --> 00:52:28,461
You were researching the projects...

901
00:52:28,461 --> 00:52:30,622
that you'd be spearheading
after Mr. Kim dies.

902
00:52:30,972 --> 00:52:32,472
In order for your business to blossom,

903
00:52:32,472 --> 00:52:35,602
you needed Mr. Kim
to die in a dramatic fashion.

904
00:52:35,602 --> 00:52:38,731
You could've goaded him
down a suicidal path...

905
00:52:39,111 --> 00:52:41,540
by promising him the title of a legend.

906
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:44,772
The one who couldn't bear
to see Mr. Kim succumb to weakness?

907
00:52:44,881 --> 00:52:46,341
That was you.

908
00:52:46,582 --> 00:52:48,872
So don't give us this nonsense about love.

909
00:52:49,521 --> 00:52:51,682
You're giving it a bad name.

910
00:53:00,231 --> 00:53:02,861
- Kim Jae Won!
- Find justice!

911
00:53:02,861 --> 00:53:04,771
- Investigate!
- Justice for Kim Jae Won!

912
00:53:04,771 --> 00:53:07,771
Oh Sang Ki, the new suspect
in the Kim Jae Won Murder Case,

913
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:09,472
propelled the investigation...

914
00:53:09,472 --> 00:53:11,241
by confessing to the crimes.

915
00:53:11,242 --> 00:53:12,642
Oh Sang Ki, Mr. Kim's long-term manager...

916
00:53:12,642 --> 00:53:15,611
and CEO of Hwal Entertainment,
murdered Mr. Kim...

917
00:53:15,611 --> 00:53:17,811
who had been suffering
from a medical condition...

918
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:20,272
by utilizing a cloned phone.

919
00:53:21,021 --> 00:53:22,441
Out of the way!

920
00:53:22,981 --> 00:53:24,711
(A man was wrongfully killed.)

921
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:26,082
Out of the way!

922
00:53:27,021 --> 00:53:28,211
Clear a path!

923
00:53:31,492 --> 00:53:32,781
Make way.

924
00:53:37,061 --> 00:53:38,562
There she is.

925
00:53:39,702 --> 00:53:40,892
Wait.

926
00:53:42,341 --> 00:53:44,332
Out of the way, please!

927
00:53:44,742 --> 00:53:46,801
You can't do that.

928
00:53:46,841 --> 00:53:48,102
Out of the way.

929
00:53:49,941 --> 00:53:51,142
You!

930
00:53:53,582 --> 00:53:54,772
Move!

931
00:53:56,052 --> 00:53:57,242
Let her through.

932
00:53:57,591 --> 00:53:59,142
Out of the way.

933
00:54:03,021 --> 00:54:04,222
Find justice!

934
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:23,832
I wonder who'll be by my side
when I'm weak and pathetic.

935
00:54:24,651 --> 00:54:25,841
Beats me.

936
00:54:26,582 --> 00:54:28,841
You have your daughter.

937
00:54:29,682 --> 00:54:31,941
Oh, right. I do have a daughter.

938
00:54:32,691 --> 00:54:34,622
Does he? You have more than two.

939
00:54:34,622 --> 00:54:36,852
Gosh, I can't stand your lame jokes.

940
00:54:39,131 --> 00:54:41,321
I have a bizarre daughter...

941
00:54:41,461 --> 00:54:43,231
who thinks she grew up all by herself...

942
00:54:43,231 --> 00:54:45,091
when I spent many years
changing her diapers.

943
00:54:46,472 --> 00:54:49,541
She'll acknowledge that once she's older.

944
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:52,531
Actually, I don't need her
to acknowledge my hard work.

945
00:54:52,572 --> 00:54:54,571
I feel guilty enough...

946
00:54:55,142 --> 00:54:57,372
that I'm nothing but a lame dad to her.

947
00:55:02,421 --> 00:55:06,352
Mr. Brain, as a celebrity figure yourself,

948
00:55:06,352 --> 00:55:09,251
you would've been able
to relate to this case.

949
00:55:16,762 --> 00:55:17,901
I only say this...

950
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:19,861
because you still haven't
grasped my character.

951
00:55:20,532 --> 00:55:22,792
I don't care if we're admirable or lame.

952
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:24,932
Why must someone be there for us?

953
00:55:26,111 --> 00:55:29,501
A weakling who needs someone by his side?

954
00:55:30,082 --> 00:55:31,272
That isn't me.

955
00:55:34,452 --> 00:55:35,642
Are you leaving?

956
00:55:35,682 --> 00:55:37,751
You helped immensely in solving this case.

957
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,582
Maybe we could grab a beer...

958
00:55:42,322 --> 00:55:45,361
One shot of malt whiskey
on Saturdays. I forgot.

959
00:55:45,361 --> 00:55:46,781
I apologize.

960
00:55:47,561 --> 00:55:48,792
Bye, then.

961
00:55:50,131 --> 00:55:51,861
See you tomorrow.

962
00:55:56,501 --> 00:55:58,602
I hate his guts.

963
00:56:03,111 --> 00:56:04,972
All human beings go through life alone.

964
00:56:04,981 --> 00:56:07,202
Can you please not whine?

965
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,211
I really hate him.

966
00:56:14,822 --> 00:56:16,812
Okay, so...

967
00:56:17,361 --> 00:56:18,961
Jung In Young's false confession...

968
00:56:18,961 --> 00:56:21,151
made under the influence of an illness...

969
00:56:21,432 --> 00:56:23,622
caused us some difficulty at first.

970
00:56:23,832 --> 00:56:27,131
The Neuroscientific Investigation Team...

971
00:56:27,131 --> 00:56:29,372
that I insisted we create
did some good work,

972
00:56:29,372 --> 00:56:30,871
and that's how we caught
the actual killer.

973
00:56:30,872 --> 00:56:33,972
Is the illness called
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome?

974
00:56:33,972 --> 00:56:35,012
What are the symptoms?

975
00:56:35,012 --> 00:56:39,142
Okay, so, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome...

976
00:56:39,582 --> 00:56:41,221
(Seobu Police Station)

977
00:56:41,222 --> 00:56:43,621
- is when a damaged brain...
- It's Dr. Shin Ha Ru!

978
00:56:43,622 --> 00:56:45,822
- Doctor, just a moment.
- Doctor, wait.

979
00:56:45,822 --> 00:56:47,861
- Wait, doctor. I have a question.
- Wait.

980
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:50,151
- Just a moment, doctor.
- Please stop.

981
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:57,522
I hate him.

982
00:56:59,702 --> 00:57:00,992
So much.

983
00:57:01,202 --> 00:57:04,310
Dr. Shin, how did you join the team?

984
00:57:04,311 --> 00:57:06,432
- Did the briefing go okay?
- I didn't join.

985
00:57:06,611 --> 00:57:08,372
I'm a temporary consultant.

986
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:11,972
It's a surprising decision.
What influenced you?

987
00:57:12,182 --> 00:57:15,772
Did you have a change of heart
after you got fired?

988
00:57:16,881 --> 00:57:18,111
That's mean.

989
00:57:19,591 --> 00:57:20,812
Yes.

990
00:57:21,622 --> 00:57:24,731
I regret pushing too hard
and going too far...

991
00:57:24,731 --> 00:57:26,551
to advance my research.

992
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:29,332
To show my remorse,

993
00:57:29,332 --> 00:57:32,501
I decided to offer
what little help I could to the police...

994
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:34,861
who are trying to keep us safe.

995
00:57:35,271 --> 00:57:37,541
And it just so happened
that I was asked to consult...

996
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:39,262
on Kim Jae Won's case.

997
00:57:39,512 --> 00:57:40,541
When I heard...

998
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:42,581
the Neuroscientific Investigation Team
was created,

999
00:57:42,582 --> 00:57:45,901
I decided they'd benefit the most
from my expertise.

1000
00:57:45,952 --> 00:57:49,111
My gosh. He's a born actor.

1001
00:57:54,091 --> 00:57:55,452
Darn you!

1002
00:58:01,762 --> 00:58:03,892
I suddenly want to believe him.

1003
00:58:03,961 --> 00:58:05,401
Why did you need...

1004
00:58:05,401 --> 00:58:07,892
Kang Sung Ha's brain so much
to even forge a document?

1005
00:58:09,171 --> 00:58:11,432
I needed it
for one of my projects called...

1006
00:58:11,771 --> 00:58:14,531
the Psychopathic Brain Rebuilding Project.

1007
00:58:14,682 --> 00:58:16,901
Rebuilding a psychopath's brain?

1008
00:58:16,981 --> 00:58:19,481
Are you saying you want to remodel it?

1009
00:58:19,481 --> 00:58:21,381
- "Remodel?"
- Is that possible?

1010
00:58:21,381 --> 00:58:23,412
- What is that?
- I don't get it.

1011
00:58:23,481 --> 00:58:25,941
Instead of saying "remodel,"

1012
00:58:26,421 --> 00:58:28,012
you could say "cure."

1013
00:58:29,591 --> 00:58:31,421
Can it be cured?

1014
00:58:32,532 --> 00:58:36,191
We're learning the brain is behind
some cruel crimes.

1015
00:58:36,302 --> 00:58:37,932
Studying them at the molecular level...

1016
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:41,022
can help cure violence
through neurobiology,

1017
00:58:41,102 --> 00:58:43,332
which is what my project aims to do.

1018
00:58:45,242 --> 00:58:46,801
Child.

1019
00:58:47,372 --> 00:58:49,472
You have grown up well.

1020
00:58:54,111 --> 00:58:55,512
Guard.

1021
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,122
Yes, doctor.

1022
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:03,812
I need Dr. Shin Ha Ru's number.

1023
00:59:04,122 --> 00:59:05,381
Got it.

1024
00:59:21,512 --> 00:59:23,832
To what do I owe the honor of this call?

1025
00:59:25,952 --> 00:59:27,202
Right now?

1026
00:59:34,662 --> 00:59:37,631
Hey. Your serves are a tad angry.

1027
00:59:37,631 --> 00:59:39,881
- Does it show?
- Let's take a break.

1028
00:59:43,501 --> 00:59:44,861
A police consultant?

1029
00:59:45,472 --> 00:59:46,691
My gosh.

1030
00:59:47,271 --> 00:59:48,572
What are you up to?

1031
00:59:48,572 --> 00:59:52,162
It worked. You called me right away.

1032
00:59:53,811 --> 00:59:56,671
I can't avoid seeing you
because every channel is...

1033
00:59:57,441 --> 00:59:59,542
talking about the bright new investigator.

1034
00:59:59,582 --> 01:00:01,941
It was all part of my plan.

1035
01:00:04,691 --> 01:00:06,822
I'm looking for a way
to salvage your career.

1036
01:00:06,822 --> 01:00:08,361
Serve the community for now.

1037
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:10,281
I'll call you back
when the consensus turns favorable.

1038
01:00:10,992 --> 01:00:12,381
Don't do anything silly.

1039
01:00:13,262 --> 01:00:14,492
Okay.

1040
01:00:15,102 --> 01:00:16,302
How about another game?

1041
01:00:16,302 --> 01:00:19,321
I'll play nice as a thank-you.

1042
01:00:19,401 --> 01:00:20,591
Okay.

1043
01:00:34,082 --> 01:00:35,341
Let's eat.

1044
01:00:36,322 --> 01:00:37,512
Okay.

1045
01:00:38,822 --> 01:00:42,921
You did a great job
solving your first case,

1046
01:00:42,921 --> 01:00:45,222
so lunch is on me.

1047
01:00:47,131 --> 01:00:48,321
Yes.

1048
01:00:48,461 --> 01:00:49,921
Let's go.

1049
01:00:52,872 --> 01:00:55,492
- Welcome.
- Hello.

1050
01:00:55,841 --> 01:00:58,102
- Three tripe and intestine soups.
- Okay.

1051
01:01:00,811 --> 01:01:03,901
Captain, you have something else.

1052
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:05,501
There's raw beef bibimbap.

1053
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:08,512
Raw beef bibimbap, ten dollars?

1054
01:01:09,552 --> 01:01:11,312
Ask if cops get a discount.

1055
01:01:11,392 --> 01:01:13,341
It's not like we're celebrities.

1056
01:01:13,552 --> 01:01:15,920
Asking for a discount
is darn embarrassing.

1057
01:01:15,921 --> 01:01:18,852
What? Embarrassing? Are you buying?

1058
01:01:19,061 --> 01:01:20,582
I don't mind.

1059
01:01:21,262 --> 01:01:22,852
I'll have tripe and intestine soup.

1060
01:01:23,532 --> 01:01:24,792
Good.

1061
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:27,122
Let's enjoy ourselves.

1062
01:01:48,591 --> 01:01:51,682
Captain, you pretend to eat
more than you actually eat.

1063
01:01:52,861 --> 01:01:54,421
No, I ate a lot.

1064
01:01:55,032 --> 01:01:56,952
When you eat out as a team,

1065
01:01:56,961 --> 01:02:00,892
you need to eat spoonfuls together
and keep the spirits high.

1066
01:02:01,202 --> 01:02:03,440
If the captain doesn't eat,
it sours the mood.

1067
01:02:03,441 --> 01:02:06,301
What? Are you upset I bought you
something cheaper by two dollars?

1068
01:02:09,711 --> 01:02:11,702
Hey, captain.

1069
01:02:12,481 --> 01:02:15,111
Violent Crimes Two needs you. It's urgent.

1070
01:02:17,481 --> 01:02:19,981
- You should go.
- Oh, okay.

1071
01:02:21,191 --> 01:02:23,682
- Excuse me.
- Go, run.

1072
01:02:24,892 --> 01:02:27,781
Why did they contact you to ask for her?

1073
01:02:28,602 --> 01:02:30,702
- Oh, here's a huge chunk.
- Why?

1074
01:02:30,702 --> 01:02:32,492
Open wide.

1075
01:02:52,452 --> 01:02:53,912
You should eat.

1076
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:56,082
I saw you eat this last time.

1077
01:03:00,231 --> 01:03:01,591
Thank you.

1078
01:03:03,102 --> 01:03:06,162
You lied to cover for me too.
Thanks so much.

1079
01:03:07,202 --> 01:03:09,572
I should pay you for the sandwich.

1080
01:03:09,572 --> 01:03:13,361
No, it's fine. I can afford that much.

1081
01:03:13,941 --> 01:03:15,171
Sorry.

1082
01:03:16,041 --> 01:03:18,001
I'll take this outside.

1083
01:03:57,722 --> 01:03:59,021
I'll get you more next month.

1084
01:03:59,021 --> 01:04:02,512
Look at that.
He has more than a few contacts.

1085
01:04:03,061 --> 01:04:04,412
For bribes.

1086
01:04:04,662 --> 01:04:06,321
You need to do well yourself.

1087
01:04:12,771 --> 01:04:14,361
- Go on.
- Okay.

1088
01:04:17,001 --> 01:04:18,501
What are you doing here?

1089
01:04:19,242 --> 01:04:22,272
The police station parking lot was full.

1090
01:04:22,611 --> 01:04:26,142
What were you doing in this shady corner?

1091
01:04:26,381 --> 01:04:29,142
"Shady?" My gosh.

1092
01:04:29,852 --> 01:04:32,281
You've never been to a really shady place.

1093
01:04:34,961 --> 01:04:36,251
Who was that?

1094
01:04:36,762 --> 01:04:40,381
Mr. Yang? He owns a street stall nearby.

1095
01:04:41,061 --> 01:04:43,921
Did someone make a complaint?
Why'd you meet up?

1096
01:04:45,972 --> 01:04:47,591
It was a private matter.

1097
01:04:48,642 --> 01:04:49,742
I'm sure it was.

1098
01:04:49,742 --> 01:04:50,992
(Police ID, Geum Myung Se)

1099
01:04:51,671 --> 01:04:53,162
A private matter.

1100
01:04:56,041 --> 01:04:58,571
You must be trying to pick a fight.

1101
01:04:58,582 --> 01:05:00,301
I've decided that...

1102
01:05:00,352 --> 01:05:02,481
rather than waste time arguing with you,

1103
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:04,711
I'd have one more drink.

1104
01:05:05,191 --> 01:05:06,812
You call that a decision?

1105
01:05:07,452 --> 01:05:11,211
You'll have time to drink
a whole bucket. Don't worry.

1106
01:05:12,231 --> 01:05:13,452
Goodbye.

1107
01:05:20,032 --> 01:05:22,832
What was that about?
What's wrong with him?

1108
01:05:30,481 --> 01:05:32,801
Yes, Reporter Park. How are you?

1109
01:05:34,622 --> 01:05:36,851
I called to give you a story.

1110
01:05:36,852 --> 01:05:38,582
I even created the headline for you.

1111
01:05:39,722 --> 01:05:41,952
"Police Still Take Bribes."

1112
01:05:43,492 --> 01:05:44,711
That's right.

1113
01:05:45,392 --> 01:05:46,751
This report is about a dirty cop.

1114
01:05:47,392 --> 01:05:48,622
Something feels off.

1115
01:05:49,162 --> 01:05:51,892
He's been snickering these days.

1116
01:05:53,401 --> 01:05:55,332
The way he looks at me...

1117
01:06:04,751 --> 01:06:06,242
"You're doomed."

1118
01:06:06,352 --> 01:06:07,642
That's what it looks like.

1119
01:06:07,782 --> 01:06:09,711
I have no idea what he's plotting.

1120
01:06:10,352 --> 01:06:12,812
He's probably plotting to bring you down.

1121
01:06:13,521 --> 01:06:14,711
Probably, right?

1122
01:06:17,861 --> 01:06:19,051
Come on.

1123
01:06:19,432 --> 01:06:21,182
Don't sound so indifferent.

1124
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:24,162
I got mixed up with this nuisance
because of you.

1125
01:06:24,162 --> 01:06:26,421
Gosh. Sorry about that.

1126
01:06:27,231 --> 01:06:28,432
This is on me.

1127
01:06:28,841 --> 01:06:30,062
- Happy now?
- No.

1128
01:06:30,341 --> 01:06:32,262
You're paying for the third round
at a very expensive place.

1129
01:06:33,142 --> 01:06:35,301
Sure. I'll buy you drinks
at the next bar too!

(Reporter Park Jin Young)

1131
01:06:54,392 --> 01:06:56,792
I posted the article about
the dirty cop you told me about.

1132
01:06:56,802 --> 01:06:57,802
From Reporter Park Jin Young.

1133
01:06:57,802 --> 01:07:00,762
Okay. That was quick.

1134
01:07:05,671 --> 01:07:06,861
What?

1135
01:07:07,412 --> 01:07:08,932
Come on.

1136
01:07:10,242 --> 01:07:12,171
Gosh.

1137
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,441
Goodness. What?

1138
01:07:24,992 --> 01:07:26,622
What is this nonsense?

1139
01:07:29,662 --> 01:07:32,262
Gosh. What just happened?

(Brain Works)

1141
01:07:57,521 --> 01:07:59,481
You're the fantastic duo.

1142
01:08:01,602 --> 01:08:03,061
Help me, Dr. Brain!

1143
01:08:03,061 --> 01:08:04,061
Catch him!

1144
01:08:04,061 --> 01:08:05,262
I'm going to shoot!

1145
01:08:05,702 --> 01:08:06,702
Gosh. Hey!

1146
01:08:06,702 --> 01:08:07,932
Stick to the protocol.

1147
01:08:07,932 --> 01:08:09,602
Don't just do
whatever you want to do to help me.

1148
01:08:09,602 --> 01:08:11,631
Why must I follow
the protocol for the police?

1149
01:08:11,742 --> 01:08:13,602
I found something odd.

1150
01:08:14,541 --> 01:08:16,381
What on earth did she find out?

1151
01:08:16,381 --> 01:08:17,731
You should be careful.

1152
01:08:18,582 --> 01:08:21,671
- What?
- What if he became a psychopath?

1153
01:08:21,682 --> 01:08:23,472
Who on earth are you?

1154
01:08:24,151 --> 01:08:25,341
Are you really a doctor?
