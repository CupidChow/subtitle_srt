00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:15,295

(Defendant, Counsel)

10
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:03,575
Witness, you are the author of this book?

11
00:01:04,504 --> 00:01:05,504
Yes.

12
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:08,045
In this book, you say...

13
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:11,244
there's a definite genetic component to psychopathy.

14
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:14,353
But it's greatly affected by one's environment...

15
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:15,825
and how they're brought up.

16
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:19,125
When a child with the genes of uncontrollable impulses...

17
00:01:19,224 --> 00:01:21,354
grows up in a poor environment,

18
00:01:22,095 --> 00:01:25,795
those genes manifest, turning them into a psychopath.

19
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:28,035
Do you maintain that stance?

20
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:30,104
Yes.

21
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:32,935
Then do you think Kang In Ho's struggle...

22
00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:37,344
to survive as he grew up with an alcoholic mother...

23
00:01:37,345 --> 00:01:39,613
contributed to the manifestation...

24
00:01:39,614 --> 00:01:41,675
of his psychopath genes?

25
00:01:43,244 --> 00:01:46,985
Yes, I think it definitely had an effect.

26
00:01:47,114 --> 00:01:50,785
Witness. Your family is very wealthy.

27
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:51,925
Yes.

28
00:01:51,926 --> 00:01:55,825
Then because grew up in more affluent settings,

29
00:01:56,295 --> 00:02:00,394
your psychopath genes might not have manifested.

30
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:04,603
It's true that I grew up in a wealthy household,

31
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:05,704
but...

32
00:02:06,935 --> 00:02:09,604
I lost both parents when I was six.

33
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:13,375
What a pity.

34
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:16,085
- Poor guy. - That's sad.

35
00:02:18,544 --> 00:02:20,884
For a child who had everything...

36
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:23,884
to lose both parents before his eyes.

37
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:27,254
Could anything be more stressful than that?

38
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:32,095
Even to this day, I can't remember the accident.

39
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:35,065
My brain suffered so much stress...

40
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:37,065
that it erased the memory.

41
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:40,503
The shock was so great that his brain erased the memory.

42
00:02:40,504 --> 00:02:42,704
- That's how painful it was. - Right?

43
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:46,473
My client worked in a less than ideal environment.

44
00:02:46,474 --> 00:02:50,084
As a prison guard, he was constantly exposed...

45
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:51,314
to hardened criminals.

46
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:54,115
In order to study the psychopathic brain,

47
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:56,924
I also met with many criminals.

48
00:02:57,085 --> 00:03:00,224
Their brazen shamelessness often gave me the urge to kill.

49
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,595
Once, I was almost strangled by a murderer.

50
00:03:07,664 --> 00:03:10,134
Having a psychopathic brain...

51
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,574
is never reason enough to kill.

52
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:14,104
I am...

53
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,674
proof of that.

54
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:23,585
Right. Not all weirdos end up killing.

55
00:03:24,185 --> 00:03:26,585
- It's only a few. - The evil ones.

56
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:29,655
That's all.

57
00:03:34,724 --> 00:03:36,164
Witness, you are excused.

58
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:50,245
Gosh.

59
00:03:52,074 --> 00:03:53,644
What? Are you afraid?

60
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:54,774
Would I be?

61
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:57,145
I knew long ago you were a psychopath.

62
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:58,944
Then why did you wince?

63
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:02,585
I don't really know. I can't help it.

Were you surprised?

69

No. I once shouted at you.

That scumbag.

Not really.

75

I get yelled at a lot.

I'm sure you do.

77
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:22,934
I sometimes wondered if he were a psycho.

78
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:25,863
And each time you did, I said to myself...

79

"How did he know? He's smarter than I thought."

80

Do you think you'll be okay?

Word will have gotten out by now.

- Doctor! - Dr. Shin.

86
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:50,794
Is it true you just admitted in court to being a psychopath?

87
00:05:50,994 --> 00:05:52,465
I'm not a psychopath.

88
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:55,234
I have a brain with psychopathic tendencies.

89
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:59,164
Doesn't having that tendency mean you can turn psycho at any time?

90
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:01,373
It's possible.

91
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:04,575
Then could you become a murderer at any given time?

92
00:06:06,845 --> 00:06:09,043
When people think of a psychopath,

93
00:06:09,044 --> 00:06:12,014
they imagine someone who goes around clubbing people to death.

94

That's not the case.

95

They're just more likely to do such a thing compared to those...

with no psychopathic tendencies.

97
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:20,494
The probability of murder is still higher, right?

98

Are you asking the probability that I'll commit murder?

Yes.

If I were ever to become a murderer,

101

it would've happened when I was fired from the lab.

how publicly I was humiliated.

104

But my developed metacognitive skills...

105

prevent me from ruining my life with foolish choices.

No, I didn't say anything.

He's on the team. Of course, we should protect him.

Oh! Hey, Dr. Brain.

Don't your ears itch? We were bad-mouthing you.

Of course. You're on another level, even with getting bad-mouthed.

Working closely with two psychopaths.

For me, it's three. I deserve the most pity.

there was a hurricane in my heart.

They work like magic.

I had gained a lot of weight during my pregnancy.

00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:30,371
Please let me know if you want something from me.

331
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:34,241
Women want men to figure it out themselves,

332
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,110
but men don't know unless they're told.

333
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,510
There's only one thing I want.

334
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,881
Not breaking up.

335
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:46,290
My gosh.

336
00:23:46,991 --> 00:23:48,491
I can't believe that's what she said.

337
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,701
Not breaking up is all that she wants.

338
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:06,610
It's what I want as well.

339
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:23,721
Dad's acting strange.

340
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,560
I think he has lost it.

341
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,829
That is not something you should say about your dad.

342
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,830
What?

343
00:24:32,161 --> 00:24:33,201
That's odd.

344
00:24:34,871 --> 00:24:36,040
I repent.

345
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:39,171
While suffering from an unwanted impulse,

346
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:41,741
I fooled around...

347
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,981
with one man after another.

348
00:24:45,911 --> 00:24:48,921
However, there has never been a moment...

349
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,221
where I did not care...

350
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:54,290
about Yi Na and her father.

351
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,621
If I'm given a second chance,

352
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:04,431
I will devote my life to my family.

353
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,600
My mom's acting strange as well.

354
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:11,599
Out of the blue, she started taking Dad's side.

355
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,810
It's ridiculous.

356
00:25:13,711 --> 00:25:17,040
Could the two of them be back together?

357
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,880
That explains your dad's good mood...

358
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:21,350
and your mom taking his side.

359
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,880
No way. I think you're right.

360
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:25,080
How do you feel...

361
00:25:25,451 --> 00:25:27,951
about your parents getting back together?

362
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,391
I'm not sure.

363
00:25:31,721 --> 00:25:32,790
Geum Yi Na!

364
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,201
You've got to be kidding me.

365
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,310
Did you reject me to date this loser instead?

366
00:25:46,871 --> 00:25:48,241
We're not together.

367
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,840
There's nothing going on between me and Yi Na.

00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:59,651
Who said you could butt in though?

371
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,691
Do you want to be taught a lesson?

372
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,090
Unbelievable. You dared to dodge.

373
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,600
He really needs to be taught a lesson.

Didn't you hear the bell ring?

Get to your classes!

That's it. He'll soon see what's coming.

Don't you know that her dad's a cop?

Love?

409

Yes. When our brain...

falls in love,

it spews out love-related hormones.

412

If you scan the brain of someone in love,

413
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,780
surprisingly, the reward center is activated and that's...

the part of the brain that lights up when an addict takes drugs.

00:33:00,641 --> 00:33:02,470
A small change in the brain...

496
00:33:02,471 --> 00:33:04,010
turns you into a completely different person.

497
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,610
You're right.

498
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,351
Then the reason I acted so promiscuously...

499
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,920
was not my fault...

500
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:12,851
but my brain's?

501
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,320
It's not what your brain did, it's what you ingested.

502
00:33:16,721 --> 00:33:17,860
It was a medical accident.

503
00:33:19,661 --> 00:33:20,661
You're right.

504
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,331
A medical accident.

505
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:25,701
Did you hear that?

506
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
It was an accident.

507
00:33:31,001 --> 00:33:33,411
You're right. It was a medical accident.

508
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,570
Then...

509
00:33:36,811 --> 00:33:37,840
Myung Se.

510
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:40,751
Will you...

511
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:43,081
forgive me?

512
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,471
She wants forgiveness?

It's what you ingested.

00:34:50,251 --> 00:34:51,351
It was a medical accident.

forgive me?

519
00:34:59,561 --> 00:35:01,661
This is driving me insane.

520
00:35:04,431 --> 00:35:06,300
No wonder...

521
00:35:18,141 --> 00:35:19,811
Shall I put on the fall foliage scene?

522
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,780
You like red leaves.

523
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,980
Forget it.

524
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,221
It'll make me feel worse.

525
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,260
Why? Did Mom say something?

526
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,201
Why? Did Mom say something?

527
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,670
I'm quick to notice stuff, you know.

528
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:46,541
Yes.

529
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:49,141
You should know.

530
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:53,010
Where am I supposed to start?

531
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,319
Yi Na, so...

532
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,320
I say yes.

533
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:00,521
What?

534
00:36:00,522 --> 00:36:02,690
I say yes to you and Mom getting back together.

535
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,190
Don't mind me and get back in the groove.

536
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
Good luck.

537
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:25,541
Myung Se.

538
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,610
Will you...

539
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:29,581
forgive me?

540
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,530
I'm sorry to interrupt.

541
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,030
You interrupt too often.

542
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,100
As your coordinator, my duty...

543
00:36:51,101 --> 00:36:53,140
My coordinator visits just once a month.

544
00:36:53,141 --> 00:36:54,440
Oh, really?

545
00:36:54,811 --> 00:36:57,980
Then you should cancel that contract and sign with me.

546
00:36:58,411 --> 00:37:01,050
I'll visit five times a week.

547
00:37:02,751 --> 00:37:05,050
Are your ears stuffed up? Aren't you hearing me?

548
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,120
Don't use the water dispenser as an excuse to visit.

549
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:09,860
Are you that slow to get the hint?

550
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,790
Don't you see I'm using it as an excuse to see my ex?

551
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:14,760
Detective Geum's no longer your man to manage.

552
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,460
He's mine.

553
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:19,601
Are you two...

554
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,530
dating?

555
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,670
Yes.

556
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,241
We're dating.

557
00:37:25,741 --> 00:37:26,741
Okay.

558
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,610
Well,

559
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,380
I totally get it.

560
00:37:32,411 --> 00:37:33,751
I messed up.

561
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:37,121
If I go back to normal,

562
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,721
he'll understand.

563
00:37:40,951 --> 00:37:42,021
Wake up.

564
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:44,721
Your affairs broke up your family, and now you want to be understood?

565
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,991
You don't know anything, so keep your mouth shut.

566
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,760
Before I smack you.

567
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,561
Smack me if you want.

568
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Go on.

569
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,971
- Smack me! - Why you...

570
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,510
Oh, my. Captain Seul really likes you?

571
00:38:00,971 --> 00:38:02,010
Well, yes.

572

My goodness. I feel so bad for my lifesaver.

I know that I wronged you. But you see,

I didn't do those things because I hated you. I just...

I wasn't myself.

609

It was all because of those pills.

It was a medical accident.

That's what Dr. Brain said.

How could you be so shameless? You cheated on him.

627
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:23,411
There was a reason.

628
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,050
It happened because of the side effects of my weight-loss pills.

629
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,851
I don't take those pills anymore,

630
00:41:31,351 --> 00:41:33,251
so I'm back to being myself.

What kind of nonsense is this?

I'm telling you the truth.

633

You can ask Myung Se... No, ask Dr. Brain!

634
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:44,260
Anyway, get up. Get up, and we'll talk.

635
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,800
I heard you hurt your head too.

636
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,601
Do you think your feelings for him are sincere?

637
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,840
You may be letting your fleeting feelings...

638
00:41:52,271 --> 00:41:55,670
rob someone's family of the only chance to be reunited.

639
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,181
Please give up on Myung Se.

640
00:42:24,101 --> 00:42:25,300
There you are.

641
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:30,339
Well, I'm sorry.

642
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,110
I should've told her to quit her field coordinator job long ago.

643
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,680
Is it really true?

644
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:38,581
The side effects of her pills.

645
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:41,420
Yes.

646
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:43,860
Dr. Brain told me...

647
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:46,420
to run a formulation analysis on her weight-loss pills,

648
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:50,001
and such ingredients were actually found.

649
00:42:52,161 --> 00:42:53,971
I have to say, I thought it was really weird.

650
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,630
She was never like that in the past.

651
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:05,141
Anyway, enough about that. Let's talk about us.

652
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,510
About the camping trip.

653
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:10,351
The leaves will all fall soon.

654
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,050
Oh, did they fall already?

655
00:43:12,581 --> 00:43:13,851
How about this weekend?

656
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:17,161
- Sure. - Perfect.

657
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:20,161
Then we should get ready quickly.

658
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,221
Please help me so that my family can be together again.

659
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,351
I beg you.

660

Yes, I looked into it...

are slim.

I'm sorry.

Your brain is filled with greed, not murderous thoughts.

It's nice and relaxing...

to sit out here like this.

826
00:54:15,308 --> 00:54:17,009
I should've done this sooner.

827
00:54:19,379 --> 00:54:20,379
Detective Geum.

828
00:54:21,948 --> 00:54:22,948
Yes?

829
00:54:23,649 --> 00:54:25,049
I have something to tell you.

830
00:54:26,518 --> 00:54:29,658
Go ahead. I'm all ears.

831
00:54:31,158 --> 00:54:33,299
I went on a blind date recently.

832
00:54:34,498 --> 00:54:35,498
Sorry?

833
00:54:38,728 --> 00:54:39,739
Right.

834
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:44,209
He's a decent man with a decent job...

835
00:54:45,268 --> 00:54:46,739
who also has a house to his name.

836
00:54:46,978 --> 00:54:49,038
He hasn't been married either.

837
00:54:56,189 --> 00:54:57,848
Being with him made me rethink...

838
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:00,759
my feelings...

839
00:55:03,089 --> 00:55:06,299
for a man who has an ex-wife and a daughter in middle school.

840
00:55:07,799 --> 00:55:09,868
I realized I wasn't in my right mind.

841
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:18,368
I think this is where we end things.

842
00:55:20,978 --> 00:55:23,109
Captain Seul, this is out of the blue.

843
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,919
Is it because of your argument with my ex-wife?

844
00:55:27,549 --> 00:55:29,017
I already told you...

845
00:55:29,018 --> 00:55:30,448
that my recent blind date changed my mind.

846
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,169
I'd like to go back to being good colleagues.

847
00:55:44,629 --> 00:55:45,899
But Captain Seul...

848

I'll see you at the office, then. Bye.

Dr. Brain, I'm glad you're here.

851
00:56:38,689 --> 00:56:40,219
Detective Geum is a mess.

852
00:56:42,189 --> 00:56:44,689
My heart aches as if it's about to burst.

853
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,899
I'm finding it hard to breathe.

854
00:56:48,399 --> 00:56:49,399
They broke up,

855
00:56:49,828 --> 00:56:50,828
and he must be in shock.

856
00:56:52,399 --> 00:56:54,169
I'm dying.

857
00:56:55,299 --> 00:56:57,238
It's a heart attack, right?

858
00:56:57,239 --> 00:56:59,578
I should call the paramedics.

859
00:57:00,509 --> 00:57:03,279
Forget that and give him some painkillers instead.

860
00:57:03,609 --> 00:57:04,649
What?

861
00:57:09,689 --> 00:57:11,919
Nice one, Dr. Brain.

862
00:57:12,288 --> 00:57:13,489
I feel much better.

863
00:57:14,189 --> 00:57:16,129
That's amazing.

864
00:57:16,658 --> 00:57:18,728
You cured a heart attack with painkillers?

865
00:57:18,888 --> 00:57:20,459
It wasn't a heart attack.

866
00:57:21,158 --> 00:57:22,728
It was broken heart syndrome.

867
00:57:24,728 --> 00:57:26,138
When our brain...

868
00:57:28,969 --> 00:57:32,069
suffers a breakup, it spews out stress-related hormones.

869
00:57:32,669 --> 00:57:35,307
That greatly reduces your heart's capacity,

870
00:57:35,308 --> 00:57:37,548
causing pain and the feeling that it'll explode.

871
00:57:37,549 --> 00:57:40,248
It also makes it much harder to breathe.

872
00:57:40,549 --> 00:57:43,288
Those are exactly my symptoms.

873
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:45,618
Here's an interesting fact.

874
00:57:45,948 --> 00:57:48,189
When you scan the brain of someone suffering a breakup,

875
00:57:48,388 --> 00:57:49,827
the sections that light up...

876
00:57:49,828 --> 00:57:52,629
are the same places that activate when one suffers a physical injury.

877
00:57:53,158 --> 00:57:56,927
A brain registers physical pain and emotional pain the same way.

878
00:57:56,928 --> 00:58:00,569
That's why the painkillers made you feel better.

879
00:58:01,498 --> 00:58:04,169
What now? Should he stay on meds forever?

880
00:58:05,308 --> 00:58:09,109
Fortunately, our brain knows how to overcome breakups.

881
00:58:09,649 --> 00:58:12,879
Really? That's good to know. What do I need?

882
00:58:13,219 --> 00:58:16,518
Time, peace, and a change of surroundings.

883
00:58:18,888 --> 00:58:20,118
He needn't show off...

884
00:58:21,158 --> 00:58:22,788
to list what everyone knows.

885
00:58:23,259 --> 00:58:26,498
Yes. Time heals all wounds, right?

886
00:58:28,029 --> 00:58:29,629
- Oh, dear. - Where are you going?

887
00:58:30,399 --> 00:58:31,698
To change my surroundings.

888
00:58:35,669 --> 00:58:37,109
Should someone follow him?

889
00:58:37,638 --> 00:58:39,408
No. He's not a child.

No.

drop tears on the page, will you?

I might.

She came and then left so abruptly.

908
00:59:44,538 --> 00:59:46,138
It messed with my mind.

my brain changed.
