Victim, Han Sung Woo. Age 45.

He suffered multiple
external injuries caused by a fall.

A shallow stab wound
was found on his stomach,

and a knife was found at the scene.

climbed up the railing...

The six-year-old daughter is
the main suspect?

147
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:17,831
Correct. Her name is Han Ji Yul.

148

She suffers from aphasia,

She suffers from aphasia?

151
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:28,111
Then how did we get
a confession out of her?

152
00:10:28,722 --> 00:10:32,652
Because of his wife Yang Eun Jung's
statement. She found the victim.

Before her husband breathed his last,
he told her it was Ji Yul.

When she went up there,

155

she saw Ji Yul
with the knife in her hand.

156
00:10:44,141 --> 00:10:46,971
Ji Yul's fingerprints were the
only prints lifted off the knife.

157
00:10:46,972 --> 00:10:51,041
The victim was under a lot of stress
because of her aphasia,

158
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,981
so he exhibited abusive behavior
toward her.

159
00:10:52,982 --> 00:10:54,542
Was he ever reported
for child abuse?

No, never.

for us to suspect child abuse.

321
00:19:53,752 --> 00:19:56,482
that Madam Messenger
is saying her prayers?

322
00:19:56,492 --> 00:19:57,891
I'll wait, then.

323
00:19:57,891 --> 00:19:59,492
It's not like she'll pray all night.

324
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:00,660
Come back some other time.

325
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:03,062
Then let's at least
settle on a date.

326
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:04,591
When should I be back?

327
00:20:05,661 --> 00:20:07,200
We'll be in touch.

328
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:11,091
Come on. I don't appreciate
ambiguous answers like that.

329
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:13,072
- Let's settle on a date.
- No can do.

330
00:20:13,072 --> 00:20:15,061
We said that it wasn't possible.

331
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:18,282
If you could give me
a few available dates...

332
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:19,631
We can't.

333
00:20:19,641 --> 00:20:21,181
What part of this
can't you understand?

334
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:23,702
We said that it wasn't possible.

335
00:20:32,661 --> 00:20:34,561
If not the Madam Messenger,

336
00:20:34,562 --> 00:20:37,081
maybe I can talk to you instead.

337

Gosh, my legs.

338
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:42,891
My knees are not like
how they used to be.

339
00:20:44,072 --> 00:20:46,042
How about we sit down and...

340
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:47,462
- No.
- You can't.

341
00:20:48,342 --> 00:20:51,011
Must you be this brusque?

342
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:53,772
I only have a few questions
related to Ji Yul's case.

343
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:56,972
Yang Eun Jung is a believer,
isn't she?

344
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:00,322
I know that she is.

345
00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:01,792
We can't say.

346
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:05,190
It's like I'm conversing
with a wall!

347
00:21:05,191 --> 00:21:07,292
Why can't you tell me
if she's a member or not?

348
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:08,682

Death brings sorrow,
but we know better.

We know that the Savior
redeemed his soul.

359
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:48,201
The Savior blessed him
with eternal life,

360
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:50,492
and that is something
we must celebrate together.

I will ask Madam Messenger.

Let us drink while we talk.

383
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:43,340
I feel terrible about
what happened to Ji Yul.

384
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,779
One only hopes for her to be saved
from the wicked spirit...

385
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:48,049
as soon as possible.

386

How can you prove
that she is possessed?

387
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,360
Wicked spirits commit evil
while staying hidden.

388
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,620
Thus, there cannot
be tangible evidence.

389
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,170
Too many phenomena in this world
can't be comprehended...

by the knowledge of mankind.

391
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,529
We shouldn't deny
the existence of evil...

392
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,170
just because science
can't explain it.

393
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,469
You must think I'm talking nonsense
and that this is a cult.

394
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,640
It's all right.

395
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:21,479
I've gotten used
to being called a cult.

396
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:24,180
Even the truth
of grave importance...

397
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,989
is meaningless unless one believes.

398
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,719
We don't force
our sisters and brothers to believe.

399
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:32,229
Maybe it's money
you force them to pay.

400
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,970
Ms. Yang put her building
on the market...

401
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,559
to cover the cost
of the salvation ritual.

402
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,779
It led to a heated argument
with her husband.

403
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:42,100
Ninety-nine percent of the cost
is donated to those unfortunate.

404
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:44,750
The most powerful force
that casts evil away...

405
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,170
comes from acts of good.

406
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,220
The donations...

407
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,239
are our way of presenting the Savior
with our will to do good.

408
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,749
It was to heal Ji Yul.

409
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,460
I had no idea that her mother...

410
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,549
went as far as to sell the house
to cover the cost.

411
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:04,259
I will gently dissuade her
from doing so.

412
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,289
It is now time for our prayers.

413
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:10,559
I have just one more question.

414

Where were you
on the day of the incident?

I don't know why you'd ask me that,

416

but I'll tell you.

417
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,279
I was with the Savior.

418
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:26,809
I was in prayer.

419

You must put their souls to rest.

They must be saved.

She even mentioned your parents.

I said many times on TV
that I'm an orphan.

435
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,500
Does knowing about someone
as famous as me...

count as a special ability?

of making me feel bad.

for that?

Why would you postpone
when you were given the signs?

I was with the Savior.

All my sisters are my witnesses.

482
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:13,140
It's a nonverbal cue
that she was most likely lying.

483
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,709
Could the Messenger
have been at the scene?

484
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,910
- Security cameras.
- Nothing to prove that.

485
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,410
There are zero cameras
and zero witnesses.

486

We looked until our eyes
almost bled and found nothing yet.

Okay.

489

That means the kid
was alone on the rooftop.

490
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:35,930
Did the sect leader brainwash
the kid into threatening her dad?

491
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,719
Kids are more vulnerable
to brainwashing.

492
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,750
From what I saw, it's very possible.

493

She speaks calmly and quietly.

494
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:55,309
She didn't feel at all like
the weird sect leaders we knew.

495
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,088
She even talked about Dr. Brain.

496

If not for me,
you would've been sold.

498
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:07,459
Exactly. How easy would it have been
for her to brainwash little Ji Yul?

499
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:11,069
No. Ji Yul's
a slightly different case.

500
00:30:11,069 --> 00:30:14,070
I said aphasia patients
are great lie detectors.

501
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,840
It means their brains
aren't susceptible to lies.

502
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:21,140
Then, like the girl said,
was it really a wicked spirit?

503
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,709
That's right. We can get her
to describe the wicked spirit.

Ji Yul most definitely witnessed
the wicked spirit.

507
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:36,320
She'll be able to describe it.

508
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,519
She can't speak.

509
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:40,989
She could write, but she's young...

510

She won't use her lips.

Her brain will do
the describing for us.

the day before the incident.

635
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,920
But she left.

636
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,179
When? What time did she leave?

637
00:39:57,789 --> 00:39:59,920
Well, that's...

638
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:05,468
She left late at night.
Very late at night.

639
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:08,360
She drank, so she left her car
and took a taxi instead.

640
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,159
The manager came later
and picked up her car.

641
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,269
Wasn't that caught on camera?

642
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,409
Yes, it was.

643
00:40:20,949 --> 00:40:22,709
Why didn't you tell us right away?

644
00:40:22,949 --> 00:40:26,179
I didn't want Madam Messenger
to get roped into this.

645
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:28,360
She wasn't there
on the day of the incident.

646
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,820
Why should I tell you?

647
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:32,690
You're lying. Lee Jung Ja
was at your place that day.

648
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,099
She was at the scene.

649
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,469
No, she was not.

650
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:39,198
- Ms. Yang.
- I told you she wasn't there!

651
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:41,059
Look, Ms. Yang Eun Jung!

652
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,139
Ms. Yang,
please think carefully about this.

653
00:40:54,449 --> 00:40:57,610
Ji Yul can avoid punishment
since she's a minor.

654
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:01,110
But she'll live the rest of her life
as someone who killed her father.

655
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,489
The stigma will follow her
for the rest of her life.

656
00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:04,880
Do you want that?

657
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,340
Around this spot
on the second floor, we found...

658
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,800
many footsteps that belong
to your husband and Ji Yul.

659
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:22,400
After escaping the house
with Ji Yul, your husband...

660
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,450
He hid his daughter here
and went back up to the rooftop.

661
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:43,260
He wanted to lure the person
who was after them to protect her.

662
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,200
Then while trying
to avoid someone with the knife,

663
00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:53,369
the accident happened.

664
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,279
Your husband died while
trying to save your daughter,

665
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,539
yet you...

666
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,470
are trying to turn your daughter
into a murderer.

667
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,579
Well...

668
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:21,329
May I call Madam Messenger?

669
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,450
(Approachable and Friendly Police,
Seobu Police Station)

670
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,530
My goodness.
They're guarding her on all sides.

671
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:56,329
They won't let anyone come near her.
Oh, boy.

672
00:42:57,969 --> 00:42:59,739
Cults isolate members
from their families and society...

673
00:42:59,739 --> 00:43:03,578
to make them dependent.
It's what cults do.

674
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:04,800
Gosh.

675
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:07,470
Even if she's obsessed
with the cult,

676
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,988
how could she try to turn
her own child into a murderer?

677
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:16,050
I bet Ms. Yang's
serotonin receptor levels are low.

678
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:19,420
A brain like that is susceptible
to anxiety and depression.

679
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,429
The brain
would try different things...

680
00:43:22,429 --> 00:43:24,230
to shake off
such unpleasant feelings.

681
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,869
If you call for a cult
at that stage,

682
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,690
you'll end up like Yang Eun Jung.

683
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:30,169
I see.

684
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:33,340
I bet the Messenger
and her followers comforted her...

685
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:36,670
and confidently promised her
that she would be cured and saved.

686
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:39,280
Every time they comforted her
and gave her hope,

687
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,179
her brain produced happy hormones...

688
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:44,549
such as serotonin, dopamine,
and oxytocin.

689
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,610
The moment that happens,
it's game over.

690
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:50,488
That's because it gives you a deep
sense of security and pleasure.

691
00:43:50,489 --> 00:43:51,989
When belonging to a group
gives you such feelings,

692
00:43:51,989 --> 00:43:54,529
you can't leave the group even if
you know something's wrong.

693
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:55,990
You become their slave.

694
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,570
Your brain knows smoking is bad for you,
you still can't quit.

695
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,630
It's just like that.

696
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,630
Gosh, seriously.

697
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:06,200
Good analogy. I totally get it now.

698
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:10,170
People do quit smoking, so I'm sure
she can get out of brainwashing.

699
00:44:10,409 --> 00:44:11,610
Is there a way?

700
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,849
She has to realize
that her faith is wrong...

701
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:15,480
for her to change her behavior.

702
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,340
That's the purpose
of cognitive behavioral therapy.

703
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,558
Great.

704
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:23,920
If we go that route,
it'll take about six years.

705
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:30,559
Right. It's been ten years since
I started saying I'd quit smoking...

706
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:33,860
Goodness. This won't work.
We have no hope.

707
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,059
We have some hope.
There's a saying like this.

708
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:40,599
"Only a pastor can help someone
who is obsessed with a monk."

709
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:43,499
We could try to change
the object of her faith.

710
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,650
That's right. Just like using
nicotine patches to quit smoking.

711
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:51,840
Then we need someone
who can act as our nicotine patch.

712
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:53,659
Do you know of a religious leader?

713
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:55,789
I do. A cult leader.

714
00:44:55,789 --> 00:44:59,150
He conned a bunch of people.
I arrested him.

715
00:44:59,289 --> 00:45:00,490
Oh, right.

716
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:03,030
Why don't we get him on board
and put on a show?

717
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:05,400
He's in jail again.
He molested one of his followers.

718
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,538
Already?

719
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:08,889
Unbelievable. Darn criminals.

720
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:14,369
I got it.

721
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,599
I know how we can free
Ms. Yang's mind.

722
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,289
(Seobu Police Station)

723
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,940
That's absurd.

724
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:30,650
You're barking nonsense.
You want me to go undercover...

725
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,690
and join the cult...

726
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:35,090
so that I can find out when
Ji Yul's ritual will take place?

727
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,630
Is undercover
a lost concept for you guys?

728
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,300
They know our faces.

729
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,469
They know I'm a cop,
so how can this work?

730
00:45:41,469 --> 00:45:43,840
You'll be fine since
you don't have a memorable face.

731
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,010
Human memory
isn't that impressive, you see.

732
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,309
On top of that,
you were with someone...

733
00:45:47,309 --> 00:45:49,700
who always steals the attention,

734
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,010
so how could they remember you?

735
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,570
All roads lead to you bragging.

736
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,050
Unbelievable.

737
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:55,269
Choose, Detective.

738
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:56,949
Agree to the plan...

739
00:45:56,949 --> 00:45:58,090
or leave.

740
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:00,219
This is my place of work.

741
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:02,349
You're the one who should leave.

742
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,429
You should choose.

743
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,979
Would you rather work with him
who lacks intelligence...

744
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,829
- and fails to act promptly?
- What?

745
00:46:08,829 --> 00:46:10,699
Captain Seul, you want someone...

746
00:46:10,699 --> 00:46:12,929
who gives you a bang for your buck.
I solved the death of Kim Jae Won...

747
00:46:12,929 --> 00:46:15,429
and neatly wrapped up
the prosopagnosia case.

748
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,429
Wouldn't you rather work with me
who has been elevating the status...

749
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:19,829
of the Neuroscientific
Investigation Team?

750
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:30,209
Aren't you embarrassed
to brag about yourself so bluntly?

751
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,110
Why would I be embarrassed
of speaking the facts?

752
00:46:33,389 --> 00:46:34,579
It's been decided.

753
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:36,450
We'll do it
since there's no other way.

754
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,050
Chief Kim!

755
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,050
How about this, then?

756
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,789
I'll go undercover.

757
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,289
The Messenger doesn't know my face.

758
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,170
Detective Geum can't handle it,

759
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:49,440
so I'll have to do it by myself.

760
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,309
I'll risk another crack
of the skull...

761
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,840
as long as we can save the child
and arrest the killer.

762
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,539
How can the police sit idly by...

763
00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:57,999
and let a child
be accused of murder?

764
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:00,840
Exactly.

765
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,380
In your mind, picture
how terrified Ji Yul was.

766
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:24,329
I hate you all.

767
00:47:40,289 --> 00:47:43,010
I don't know
how his paralysis happened.

768
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,880
We had him tested
from his spine to his brain,

769
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,749
but no one could
figure out the cause.

770
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,389
It only put us through the wringer.

771
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:54,659
But then, I came across...

772
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,059
a video of you online
performing a miraculous act.

773
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:03,579
A salvation ritual, is it?

774
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:04,840
You minx.

775
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:07,369
You two...

776
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:09,409
You're not married.

777
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:14,010
But trying to fool others
that you are...

778
00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:15,479
is why you're being punished.

779
00:48:17,659 --> 00:48:19,349
I am terribly sorry.

780
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:22,490
How did you know?

781
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,659
Seeing who you are isn't my ability.

782
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:29,030
I only pass on
what the Savior tells me.

783
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:32,559
Then,

784
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:36,470
could he tell you
how I can help him?

785
00:48:36,579 --> 00:48:37,769
Of course.

786
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,470
The Savior speaks.

787
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:45,280
"Wash away your sins."

788
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,450
What can we do?

789
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,659
Will performing
a salvation ritual...

790
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:56,220
wash away our sins?

791
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:04,659
"Yes," says the Savior.

792
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:08,570
Thank you so much.

793
00:49:09,139 --> 00:49:12,999
Please help him get better.
I don't care how much it costs.

794
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:16,869
I'm afraid...

795
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,309
something isn't right.

796
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,650
His thighs are muscular...

797
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,920
for someone
with long-term paralysis.

798
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:36,929
He has always been that way.

799
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:41,769
But what good does it do
when he feels nothing?

800
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,039
Allow me to inspect.

801
00:50:22,179 --> 00:50:23,369
Sorry about that.

802
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,400
My gosh!

803
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:52,240
The cup looks expensive.
Allow me to pay for the damage.

804
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:53,840
It's all right.

805
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,880
Let me clean this up, then.

806
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,110
Leave it be.
You don't want to cut yourself.

807
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,880
We'll clean it up instead.

808
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:02,280
Manager!

809
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:09,389
Thank you.

810
00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:14,389
That was close.

811
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:19,429
It's burning.

812
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:21,929
The pain was excruciating!

813
00:51:22,909 --> 00:51:25,139
Tears rolled down my eyes.

814
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:27,110
Never have I cried...

815
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:29,119
trying to stop myself
from cracking up.

816
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,679
Was it that hard to keep your cover?

817
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,110
She could be on to us
thanks to your poor acting.

818
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:37,050
You try and bear the pain.

819
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:39,829
I'll start with a massage
that is inappropriate at best.

820
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:41,619
Do you want your wrists cut off?

821
00:51:43,929 --> 00:51:45,119
What is all this?

822
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:47,260
Did you come here to bicker?

823
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:52,400
She couldn't tell
we were in disguise,

824
00:51:52,539 --> 00:51:54,909
but she seemed to be on high alert.

825
00:51:54,909 --> 00:51:56,769
She's not your average person.

826
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,240
She immediately knew
that we weren't married.

827
00:52:00,449 --> 00:52:01,869
That surprised me too.

828
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:05,940
I know I looked at him
with love dripping from my eyes.

829
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:10,349
Gosh.

830
00:52:14,929 --> 00:52:16,349
That must be the reason.

831
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,868
Married couples
don't look at each other that way.

832
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:22,530
"He's like my sworn enemy
who ruined my life."

833
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,190
That's the emotion
you should've displayed.

834
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,809
No way. How did you know that
when you haven't been married?

835
00:52:27,809 --> 00:52:29,170
There's nothing I don't know about.

836
00:52:29,639 --> 00:52:32,340
Anyway, what's done is done.

837
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,280
The issue at hand is that
it won't be long...

838
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,010
before Ji Yul's salvation ritual
is performed.

839
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,240
You see...

840
00:52:41,289 --> 00:52:44,610
Even while flaring my nostrils,
I saw what I needed to see.

(Monthly Event Schedule)

842
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,420
It's next Saturday for sure.

843
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,420
What's worse though
is that not anyone can attend.

844
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:54,990
You must be a member of
a certain status.

845
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,159
A neuroscientific way
to quickly climb up the ladder?

846
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,170
There is one.

Madam Messenger.

851
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,789
Welcome.

852
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,760
Has this always been your car?
Wasn't it a different one?

853
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,110
I have a few of them,

854
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,130
and I drive
whatever calls out to me that day.

855
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,999
How wise of you.

856
00:53:39,909 --> 00:53:41,300
Shall we, sister?

857
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:42,909
Let us go inside.

858
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:50,679
You wish to move up the date
of his salvation ritual?

859
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,950
That's right.

860
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,019
My love...

861
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:57,690
I wish to liberate him from his pain
as soon as possible.

862
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:00,199
In order to do so,

863
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:02,059
you need to have performed
a lot of good deeds.

864
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:07,800
Is there any way to speed things up?

865
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:12,070
Shall I make a donation? A huge one?

866
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:14,170
A huge one?

867
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:17,110
That's a great idea.

868
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,150
Then how much...

869
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:24,450
It will need to be
at least one large check.

870
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:28,950
By one large check,
do you mean a million dollars?

871
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,559
Yes. A million dollars.

872
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:38,729
Then please give me about two weeks.

873
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:43,130
I'll sell some shares
and bitcoins to get the cash.

874
00:54:43,809 --> 00:54:45,300
You do that.

875
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:50,170
I do have one request, though.

876
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:54,150
I'd like to see
the salvation ritual for myself.

877
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:57,510
That will help
prepare myself spiritually.

878
00:55:00,659 --> 00:55:04,090
You were right.
I got leveled up right away.

879
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:07,019
I have permission
to attend Ji Yul's ritual.

880
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:10,130
Well done. Bye.

881
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:17,429
Aren't you working a bit too hard
on a ploy to improve your image?

882
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,670
This case bothers me.

883
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:23,940
The child in trouble has aphasia.

884
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,610
I did at one point too.

885
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,550
Ha Ru.

886
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,990
It's Auntie. Do you remember me?

887
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:43,260
You don't want to talk?

888
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,300
Then...

889
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,030
you can't talk?

890
00:55:50,739 --> 00:55:52,200
Your mouth is stuck?

891
00:56:05,059 --> 00:56:08,019
People must've thought because
I was mute that I was deaf too.

892
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,590
"He was the only survivor.
Isn't that suspicious?"

893
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,459
"He should've died
with his parents."

894
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:16,659
"It's such a shame
he's left on his own."

895
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:18,630
I overheard all sorts of things.

896
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,030
But I was lucky.

897
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:24,970
I had a capable and skilled aunt...

898
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,840
and she got me
the necessary treatment.

899
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:29,409
But this kid...

900
00:56:30,449 --> 00:56:32,550
has a mom
who's deeply devoted to a sect.

901
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:34,740
What she needs is help,

902
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,380
but she's called wicked
and a murderer.

903
00:56:38,489 --> 00:56:39,979
It's not fair.

904
00:56:41,289 --> 00:56:42,690
And I feel bothered.

905
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:47,630
Of course, I'm also curious
as to whether we can shift...

906
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:49,090
the kid's mom's beliefs.

907
00:56:51,969 --> 00:56:53,159
So?

908
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:55,869
What's the plan?

909
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:59,400
A head-on battle.

910
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,010
Here's a video
of the salvation ritual.

911
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:08,079
The Savior commands you.

912
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,479
Leave, wicked spirit!

913
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:11,590
Oh, dear.

914
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:13,619
Leave, wicked spirit!

915
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,490
Leave, wicked spirit!

916
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,800
Why is she beating him?

917
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,829
It's psychological domination
disguised as salvation.

918
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,769
Exposure to violence
makes you feel intimidated.

919
00:57:24,769 --> 00:57:26,940
Forget intimidation.

920
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,429
A kid like Ji Yul could end up dead.

921
00:57:34,679 --> 00:57:36,539
Will you use a whip?

922
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:39,118
Ji Yul is too young.

923
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:41,340
She saw my face.

924
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,189
The sin of seeing what you must not.

925
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:46,489
She must pay for it.

926
00:57:46,489 --> 00:57:48,889
Prepare a Host
that's most effective.

927
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,530
Let's relieve
Ji Yul's mother's suffering.

928
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:54,590
Very well. I understand.

929
00:57:58,869 --> 00:58:00,700
The Savior commands you.

930
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:02,679
- Leave, wicked spirit!
- Wait.

931
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:05,970
The old man's reacting oddly
for someone who's getting beaten.

932
00:58:06,579 --> 00:58:08,670
His eyes look glazed.

933
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:11,340
He'll be under the influence
of a hallucinogenic.

934
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:16,249
That's great.
I think we can use this against them.

I'm so sorry.

961
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:38,720
He must not feel well. I apologize.

962
01:00:38,869 --> 01:00:41,289
He's allergic to wheat flour.

963
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,530
He cannot partake in the Host?

964
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:49,879
No. I'm sorry but he can't.

965

Even if he can't partake
in the Host, he can be saved.

Let's do this.

We'll do Mr. Moon's ritual
tonight instead.

No, today's ritual is for Ji Yul.

969
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,889
I decide the order.

970
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:15,340
I can't cut in line
when I haven't even...

made the donation yet.

01:01:17,739 --> 01:01:18,959
Why?

973
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:22,329
Do you not wish
for your husband to be saved?

974
01:01:23,139 --> 01:01:25,869
Is there another reason you're here?

975
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,110
No.

976

I'll show you
the real wicked spirit.

01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:16,659

- Save him?

Stop!

992
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:24,619
You pushed that woman
into a pit of fire.

993
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:26,499
The moment
the wicked spirit came up,

994
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,420
she looked terrified.

995
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:31,659
Who's this?

01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:34,829

I have a plan for everything.
