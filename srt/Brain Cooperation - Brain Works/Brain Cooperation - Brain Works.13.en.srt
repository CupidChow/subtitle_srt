I'm not destined to be in love.

I didn't believe it from the start.

9
00:00:54,894 --> 00:00:59,093
Still, I got the chance to drink with Dr. Brain.

10
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:01,433
It's not bad.

11

It's not, is it? It's nice, you and me together.

12
00:01:13,743 --> 00:01:15,683
- It's not bad. - Right?

13
00:01:16,314 --> 00:01:18,614
No, I don't need love.

14
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:20,853
I just need you, Dr. Brain.

15
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:24,424
I'm saying the food isn't bad.

16
00:01:24,553 --> 00:01:25,553
What?

17
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,594
Oh, right. That's it.

18
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:34,334
Mister, can you give him a bit more of this?

19
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:35,763
Just a moment.

20
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:37,963
It's nice. I like it.

21
00:01:38,403 --> 00:01:39,474
Hey.

22
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,103
Dr. Psycho.

23
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:49,444
You're a psychopath?

24
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:53,084
Do you want to kill people?

25
00:01:56,153 --> 00:01:59,493
Listen. You had a lot to drink.

26
00:02:00,224 --> 00:02:01,454
I'm drunk.

27
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:05,024
And since I am, I want to ask for a favor.

28
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:14,603
Can you please take a look at my kid?

29
00:02:18,244 --> 00:02:19,413
My kid.

30
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,013
I think he's a psychopath.

31
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:24,913
What is he on about?

32
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,453
I have this boy,

33
00:02:28,724 --> 00:02:32,624
and he flies into a rage all the time and for no good reason.

34
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:35,564
He locks himself in his room and refuses to talk.

35
00:02:35,564 --> 00:02:38,323
I don't know what he does all night, but he sleeps all day.

36
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:41,434
I pay so much for his extra classes and tutors.

37
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:44,934
I, his poor dad, just so I can pay for his classes,

38
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:47,333
tiptoe around my boss and get yelled at.

39
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:50,504
He doesn't care one bit.

40
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:54,413
He has zero empathy.

41
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:58,083
Doesn't that make him a psychopath?

42
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,613
I don't expect or even hope for empathy.

43
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,083
When I see my daughter,

44
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,624
I wonder if an alien's pretending to be her.

45
00:03:05,624 --> 00:03:06,624
Totally.

46
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:10,663
There were moments when I doubted if he really was my son,

47
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:14,163
but he looks just like his father.

48
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:16,833
Dr. Shin.

49
00:03:17,904 --> 00:03:21,404
He must have a psychopathic brain, right?

50
00:03:24,474 --> 00:03:25,474
No.

51
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:27,643
He does not have the psychopathic trait.

52
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,643
What he has is a teenage brain.

53
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:34,784
Both your body and brain mature during the teenage years.

54
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:37,383
But the brain is...

55
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,863
The backside of the brain matures first.

56
00:03:43,124 --> 00:03:46,233
So during the teenage years, this part right here.

57
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:48,964
The frontal lobe is the immature part of the brain.

58
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:52,603
The frontal lobe controls rational thinking and judgment...

59
00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:55,203
in addition to regulating behavior and emotions.

60
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:58,673
So when you're a teen, your frontal lobe is still immature,

61
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:01,013
which means you can't control your impulses...

62
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:02,883
or emotions.

63
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:04,284
So they tend to act on their instincts...

64
00:04:04,284 --> 00:04:05,953
and can experience excitement or despair easily...

65
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:08,254
while being unable to grasp the overall situation clearly.

66
00:04:08,513 --> 00:04:10,784
- I see. - Oh, my.

67
00:04:11,323 --> 00:04:14,054
So the conflicts between you and your teenage children...

68
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,393
are really no one's fault.

69
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,564
When you don't understand why your kid is acting a certain way,

70
00:04:20,164 --> 00:04:23,564
just tell yourself that your kid's brain is confused...

71
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:24,833
because the frontal lobe is maturing.

72
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,174
That's why teens sometimes do absurd things.

73
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:28,234
If you see it that way,

74
00:04:28,874 --> 00:04:30,573
you'll have fewer problems with them. Don't you think?

75
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:32,914
Oh, he's right.

76
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:34,414
Yes, you're absolutely right.

77
00:04:35,044 --> 00:04:36,044
It's so true!

78
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:40,814
I have one more question.

79
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:42,424
How can I...

80
00:04:43,223 --> 00:04:45,453
communicate with my children?

81
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:51,393
When you're talking to teenagers, you should speak clearly,

82
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:53,333
repeatedly, and slowly.

83
00:04:53,564 --> 00:04:56,463
I get so angry when I see them!

84
00:04:57,734 --> 00:05:01,333
How can I speak clearly and slowly?

85
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:03,174
Goodness.

86
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:05,143
That's enough!

87
00:05:08,013 --> 00:05:10,083
My goodness. I should grab another drink elsewhere.

88
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,083
That was like Dr. Brain's special lecture.

89
00:05:13,254 --> 00:05:14,883
Dr. Brain, let's go.

90
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,323
No, I'll pass.

91
00:05:16,453 --> 00:05:20,093
Come on. We barely drank because of your lecture.

92
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:21,953
I want another drink.

93
00:05:22,294 --> 00:05:23,424
Do you know why that is?

94
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:27,364
It's because alcohol changed your brain.

95
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,804
It stimulates the release of dopamine and uplifts your mood.

96
00:05:30,804 --> 00:05:32,203
It also affects the amygdala...

97
00:05:32,203 --> 00:05:34,174
and helps you forget about your worries and anxiety.

98
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,843
But if you keep on drinking like that,

99
00:05:36,843 --> 00:05:38,304
the brain develops a tolerance to alcohol...

100
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,614
and gets to a point where it can't function without it. Then...

101
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:43,744
- Then what? - An alcoholic.

102
00:05:44,184 --> 00:05:45,583
You'll become an alcoholic.

103
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,383
Goodness. You just can't stop talking about the brain.

104
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:50,823
I'll be all ears, so let's go have just one more drink.

105
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:51,823
Where shall we go?

106
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,593
Somewhere quiet. Yes, that's right!

107
00:05:53,694 --> 00:05:55,823
My place! Let's go to my place.

108
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,864
No, thanks. Just be honored that I hung out with you until now.

109
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,864
Ouch!

110
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,033
Darn you!

111
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:06,403
Goodness.

112
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:14,174
Oh, boy...

113
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:23,023
Hey, you could freeze to death.

114
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:25,924
Get up.

115
00:06:26,723 --> 00:06:27,723
Get up.

116
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:29,164
You won't get up?

117
00:06:30,893 --> 00:06:31,994
Fine, I'm leaving.

118
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:40,133
Oh, dear! My friend is ditching me.

119
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:44,143
He really is a psychopath.

120
00:06:44,473 --> 00:06:46,843
He's ruthlessly ditching his friend.

121
00:06:46,843 --> 00:06:49,783
- Goodness. - He should take his friend home.

122
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:51,044
He's so mean.

123
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:52,883
He's a psychopath, you know.

124
00:06:52,883 --> 00:06:55,354
Come on. He hasn't actually left yet.

125
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:56,854
Let's see what he does.

126
00:06:56,854 --> 00:06:59,924
The worst that could happen is me freezing to death here.

127
00:06:59,924 --> 00:07:02,523
We're all going to die anyway.

128
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:06,963
Gosh.

129
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:09,333
Oh...

130
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,864
- Detective Geum. - Oh, boy.

131
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:14,604
Let's go. I'll take you home.

132
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:15,604
Oh, dear.

133
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:19,213
See that? He may have a psychopathic brain,

134
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:21,573
but he's not a total weirdo.

135
00:07:22,044 --> 00:07:25,083
You're right. He cares about his friend.

136
00:07:26,453 --> 00:07:28,513
Hey, friend. Where do you live?

137
00:07:28,513 --> 00:07:29,523
Me?

138
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,124
Over there.

139
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:32,794
It's that way.

140
00:07:34,823 --> 00:07:35,823
Let's go!

141
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,164
Off we go!

142
00:07:43,403 --> 00:07:45,304
I should've just ditched you.

143
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:46,773
You said we were almost there. Where is it?

144
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:50,744
Over there.

145
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:53,544
What is wrong with you? Speak clearly, will you?

146
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:55,573
Over there.

147
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,643
That building over there. On the third floor.

148
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:00,013
Goodness.

149
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,653
What? You're not drunk?

150
00:08:05,924 --> 00:08:07,593
I am.

151
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:09,893
But I'm not that drunk.

152
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:14,434
This is ridiculous. Do you think you can handle the consequences?

153
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:17,804
I can, but I don't think your bladder can handle it.

154
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:21,773
You said you had to pee. Use my bathroom.

155
00:08:22,674 --> 00:08:24,703
Don't hold it and pee your pants on your way home.

156
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:26,513
Hey, look.

157
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:29,144
We really are almost there. Right there, the third floor.

158
00:08:37,723 --> 00:08:39,593
Come in, Dr. Brain.

159
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:41,753
It's okay. Come on in.

160
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:43,493
Come in.

161
00:08:47,963 --> 00:08:49,333
Oh, my.

162
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:54,873
Come on in. The bathroom is right here.

163
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,674
I'm here to use the bathroom.

164
00:08:56,674 --> 00:08:58,274
I didn't want to come here.

They started arguing while drunk,

333
00:20:21,194 --> 00:20:22,523

so we left.

336

They started arguing, so we left.

337
00:20:34,303 --> 00:20:35,473
Eun Ho probably fell to the ground...

339

How did you know that Eun Ho fell to the ground?

340
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:45,114
I never mentioned that.

Well...

It's my headcanon.

343
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:16,313
They're all obviously lying.

344
00:21:17,283 --> 00:21:18,944
I know. They matched up their stories.

345
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,253
What will happen to Yi Na?

346
00:21:21,453 --> 00:21:23,424
No evidence points to Yi Na hurting the boy.

347
00:21:23,884 --> 00:21:26,053

They'll soon be exposed,

so don't worry too much.

350
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:34,963
Yi Na and Eun Ho argued,

351
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:38,263
and the boys were talking nonsense while drunk.

352
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:43,174
I was so annoyed that I left first with Min Ji.

Around 9pm.

355
00:21:48,513 --> 00:21:50,313
But Yi Na texted me while I was heading home.

356
00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:54,313
She confessed to me that she had done it.

357

Can I see the text?

358

He kept coming at me, so I pushed him away.

But he hit his head,

and now he won't get up.

368

That's ridiculous.

Did Yi Na say anything about this text?

370

I should check for myself.

I was curious how it was all going.

So? What's happening?

496
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:13,814
What do you think?

497
00:32:14,514 --> 00:32:16,284
I want to trust my daughter,

498
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:18,614
but now that the evidence has turned up,

499
00:32:19,415 --> 00:32:22,185
I don't know what to do. All I can do is sigh.

500
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:25,824
Dr. Brain, what would you do if you were me?

501
00:32:27,094 --> 00:32:28,995
If I were you,

502
00:32:29,294 --> 00:32:31,935
I'd carefully examine the forensic details again.

503
00:32:32,594 --> 00:32:34,264
Isn't that your job as a police detective?

504
00:32:34,665 --> 00:32:35,705
Why?

505
00:32:36,064 --> 00:32:38,774
Are you afraid it'd only confirm that Yi Na actually did it?

506
00:32:39,705 --> 00:32:41,175
Dr. Brain, you're good.

507
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:44,114
You really can read me like a book.

508
00:32:44,915 --> 00:32:45,975
You're right.

509
00:32:46,844 --> 00:32:49,754
I think that's why this is so hard for me.

510
00:32:50,655 --> 00:32:53,185
I suppose it's natural for you to feel that way as her parent.

511
00:32:53,284 --> 00:32:54,725
Although I can't really relate to it.

512

Anyway, the second questioning will take place tomorrow, right?

513
00:32:58,725 --> 00:33:00,524
I have to stop by somewhere on the way,

so please have the forensic results...

Look here.

Yi Na sent the message at 9:12pm.

Then she called 911 at 9:30pm.

Thirty minutes later, she frantically called her friends.

542

To find out what happened, I suppose.

543
00:36:16,694 --> 00:36:18,455
But none of her friends picked up.

544
00:36:18,525 --> 00:36:21,025
Yi Na said she called 911 as soon as she woke up.

I think we can believe her.

So Yi Na was unconscious when the message was sent.

Hey, come here.

00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:41,384
Hey, look!

554
00:36:46,315 --> 00:36:47,424
I sent it.

555
00:36:48,185 --> 00:36:49,824
- Got it! - It's possible they sent it.

556
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:53,054
What time did those boys leave?

557
00:36:53,424 --> 00:36:56,424
Based on the security footage, we believe they left at around 9:20pm.

558
00:36:57,134 --> 00:37:00,335
It means they were with Yi Na when that message was sent.

559
00:37:01,034 --> 00:37:03,205
We can certainly suspect that they were the ones who sent it.

560
00:37:04,005 --> 00:37:06,275
If they left the chat room right after sending the message,

561
00:37:06,275 --> 00:37:07,505
the chat room would be gone.

562
00:37:07,674 --> 00:37:10,145
So Yi Na had no idea that such a message was sent from her phone,

563
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:12,475
which is why she confidently asked for a forensic analysis.

That's exactly what I'm talking about.

565

I considered reaching out to the Women and Youth Division,

566
00:37:16,214 --> 00:37:18,884
but I didn't want to meddle in the investigation, so I was torn.

00:37:18,884 --> 00:37:22,324
Right. Since you're her dad, they could get the wrong idea.

00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:36,786
Whoever takes the case will come to a similar conclusion,

657
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:39,283
but Yi Na will feel more pressured.

658
00:43:40,913 --> 00:43:43,352
Today, she'll be giving her last statement at this station.

659
00:43:43,752 --> 00:43:44,752
That's right.

660
00:43:44,852 --> 00:43:47,393
Then we should find the smoking gun today.

661
00:43:48,422 --> 00:43:49,422
Who's up first?

662
00:43:57,332 --> 00:44:00,172
Around what time did you come to?

663
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,172
Around 9:30pm.

664
00:44:03,803 --> 00:44:06,542
After I came to, I immediately called for an ambulance.

665
00:44:06,542 --> 00:44:09,413
You made the call at 9:30pm,

666
00:44:10,013 --> 00:44:12,982
but you texted Hye Young at 9:12pm.

667
00:44:13,212 --> 00:44:15,852
Are you saying you weren't awake at the time?

668
00:44:20,553 --> 00:44:22,223
Don't humiliate yourself...

669
00:44:23,692 --> 00:44:24,692
and think wisely.

670
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,332
Yi Na.

671
00:44:30,633 --> 00:44:31,732
I'll ask again.

672
00:44:32,332 --> 00:44:33,602
That text.

673
00:44:35,772 --> 00:44:36,772
Did you send it?

674
00:44:43,942 --> 00:44:44,942
Well...

675
00:44:51,652 --> 00:44:53,522
Yi Na's highly agitated.

676
00:45:04,033 --> 00:45:05,633
You said you didn't text her.

677
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:08,272
It's why you confidently turned in your phone.

678
00:45:11,703 --> 00:45:12,712
Yi Na.

679
00:45:14,672 --> 00:45:15,683
You have to answer me.

680
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,352
I think I sent it.

681
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,133
But you said you came to at around 9:30pm.

682
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:36,203
How could you have texted her at 9:12pm?

683
00:45:38,263 --> 00:45:39,473
I don't know.

684
00:45:48,442 --> 00:45:51,413
That's absurd. Why has she been lying, then?

685
00:45:51,843 --> 00:45:53,883
Maybe she only lied just now.

686
00:45:55,113 --> 00:45:56,922
Her attitude shifted drastically.

687
00:45:57,982 --> 00:46:00,022
My guess is that something happened.

688
00:46:11,462 --> 00:46:13,933
(Seobu Police Station)

689
00:46:13,933 --> 00:46:15,002
It's all right.

690
00:46:17,573 --> 00:46:19,542
Let's go home. It's okay.

691
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:23,042
Yi Na...

692
00:46:23,212 --> 00:46:26,113
She lied about texting that message.

693
00:46:27,482 --> 00:46:28,953
Even I could've told you that.

694
00:46:30,252 --> 00:46:32,692
There must be a reason she went back on her word.

695
00:46:32,692 --> 00:46:34,493
Why isn't she talking to me though?

696
00:46:34,493 --> 00:46:36,062
How can I help her when she won't say anything?

697
00:46:37,062 --> 00:46:39,133
I'm sure there's a reason for that as well.

698
00:46:57,312 --> 00:46:59,752
According to the CCTV footage around the corner of Yi Na's house,

699
00:47:00,082 --> 00:47:02,183
you left her place at 9:18pm.

700
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:03,453
So?

701
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:06,093
Talk faster, will you?

702
00:47:10,223 --> 00:47:13,033
Yi Na texted Hye Young at 9:12pm.

703
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:14,363
Were you with her...

704
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:16,832
at the time?

705
00:47:18,663 --> 00:47:19,672
Yes.

706
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:21,533
Did you see Yi Na texting on her phone?

707
00:47:24,743 --> 00:47:25,743
No.

708
00:47:26,973 --> 00:47:27,973
But you were with her at the time.

709
00:47:28,143 --> 00:47:29,643
Yi Na was in her room,

710
00:47:30,283 --> 00:47:31,683
and I was taking a dump.

711
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:32,683
What the...

712
00:47:38,252 --> 00:47:41,622
Me? I was there smelling his poop.

713
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:44,493
That's disgusting!

714
00:47:46,692 --> 00:47:47,692
Quiet!

715
00:47:50,703 --> 00:47:51,703
Aren't you the ones...

716
00:47:53,502 --> 00:47:54,803
who texted Hye Young?

717
00:48:03,783 --> 00:48:05,513
The circumstances give me reasonable doubt...

718
00:48:05,513 --> 00:48:06,613
that you could've texted her yourself.

719
00:48:08,383 --> 00:48:09,383
Do you have proof?

720
00:48:10,252 --> 00:48:12,553
Get me the proof, and then we'll talk,

721
00:48:13,252 --> 00:48:14,252
lady.

722
00:48:20,033 --> 00:48:22,433
She has a rough job for someone so old.

723
00:48:29,002 --> 00:48:30,573
Can you turn in your phones?

724
00:48:30,803 --> 00:48:31,803
I don't want to.

725
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:34,712
You don't have to turn yours in.

726
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:36,312
It can't be an issue.

727
00:48:36,712 --> 00:48:37,712
I don't want to.

728
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:39,812
I don't have a phone, you see.

729
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,323
Must I turn mine in though?

730
00:48:43,323 --> 00:48:45,792
It's not like I'm trying to be difficult.

731
00:48:46,022 --> 00:48:47,622
There's just a lot of porn on it.

732
00:48:49,562 --> 00:48:51,192
I can't hand over mine...

733
00:48:51,263 --> 00:48:52,663
since my teacher has it.

734
00:48:53,562 --> 00:48:55,263
If it annoys you,

735
00:48:55,493 --> 00:48:57,402
get my teacher to give it to you.

736
00:48:59,902 --> 00:49:01,033
Is that so?

737
00:49:01,732 --> 00:49:04,002
I could issue a warrant and take them legally.

738
00:49:05,172 --> 00:49:06,613
My goodness.

739
00:49:07,013 --> 00:49:08,442
- Gosh. - Is that so?

740
00:49:12,013 --> 00:49:13,752
Then take them from us.

741
00:49:14,212 --> 00:49:15,212
But if you do,

742
00:49:16,723 --> 00:49:18,283
I'll kill myself.

743
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:24,263
If I die, it'll be on you.

744
00:49:31,133 --> 00:49:32,832
Look at him.

745
00:49:33,232 --> 00:49:34,433
What are you doing? Stop.

746
00:49:35,533 --> 00:49:37,542
- Look. - No way.

747
00:49:37,872 --> 00:49:39,712
- Did you see that? - That's hilarious.

748
00:49:40,573 --> 00:49:41,573
Guys. Look.

749
00:49:42,982 --> 00:49:44,482
- Stop. - Let go!

750
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:45,712
Let go of me!

751
00:49:46,013 --> 00:49:47,913
Let go of me!

752
00:49:48,113 --> 00:49:49,122
Let go!

753
00:49:50,723 --> 00:49:52,053
What a joke.

754
00:49:52,053 --> 00:49:53,652
Let go of me!

755
00:49:59,232 --> 00:50:02,363
Going through something like that drains all your energy.

756
00:50:04,663 --> 00:50:06,073
I'm scared.

757
00:50:06,973 --> 00:50:08,573
What if he really commits suicide?

758
00:50:11,973 --> 00:50:13,513
I don't want to deal with him anymore.

759
00:50:14,343 --> 00:50:15,573
I'm turning the case over to the prosecution.

760
00:50:16,582 --> 00:50:18,013
With Yi Na as the suspect?

761
00:50:19,352 --> 00:50:22,082
All the evidence and statements point to that.

762
00:50:22,823 --> 00:50:24,053
She even confessed.

763
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:27,393
There must be a reason she changed her story.

764
00:50:28,752 --> 00:50:29,763
Captain Seul,

765
00:50:30,263 --> 00:50:32,062
are you interfering with my investigation?

766
00:50:33,462 --> 00:50:34,933
Of course not.

767
00:50:35,562 --> 00:50:36,562
I'm sorry.

768
00:50:40,732 --> 00:50:44,102
I really thought you were going to smash your head.

769
00:50:44,102 --> 00:50:46,042
I needed it to bleed.

770
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:47,312
Does it hurt?

771
00:50:47,743 --> 00:50:48,942
Of course. Must you ask?

772
00:50:52,652 --> 00:50:53,652
Hey.

773
00:50:54,113 --> 00:50:55,252
It's that psychopathic scientist.

774
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:56,752
What is it?

775
00:50:57,252 --> 00:50:58,252
Do you have something to say?

776
00:50:58,482 --> 00:51:00,152
There's one thing you should know.

777
00:51:01,493 --> 00:51:03,422
I'm in a really bad mood today.

778
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,533
I lost a valued treasure.

779
00:51:07,562 --> 00:51:09,163
What's he saying?

780
00:51:09,902 --> 00:51:11,033
So you'd better...

781
00:51:11,863 --> 00:51:13,872
think carefully before answering my question.

782
00:51:15,402 --> 00:51:16,703
Are you blackmailing Yi Na?

783
00:51:20,513 --> 00:51:21,542
No.

784
00:51:23,082 --> 00:51:24,513
Why would we blackmail her?

785
00:51:25,743 --> 00:51:27,352
We're not such bad kids.

786
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:30,022
Did we show her just one photo?

787
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:31,953
Yes.

788
00:51:35,922 --> 00:51:37,692
Don't you want to know what photo it was?

789
00:51:39,593 --> 00:51:41,493
Give me a call if you do, Mr. Psycho.

790
00:51:45,462 --> 00:51:47,772
He's so scary. Must be because he's a psycho.

791
00:51:48,832 --> 00:51:49,973
I almost wet myself.

792
00:51:50,803 --> 00:51:53,643
He got kicked out of the lab for having a nasty temper.

793
00:51:54,042 --> 00:51:55,042
I see it.

794
00:51:55,643 --> 00:51:57,712
He stole a corpse to dig out the brain.

795
00:51:58,442 --> 00:51:59,913
How charismatic.

796
00:52:06,852 --> 00:52:07,922
This is terrible.

797
00:52:08,652 --> 00:52:10,663
Will prosecution send her to Juvenile Court?

798
00:52:11,163 --> 00:52:13,763
It'll be aggravated assault if the boy doesn't wake up.

799
00:52:14,093 --> 00:52:15,863
She might end up in actual court.

800
00:52:16,163 --> 00:52:17,902
That'll be really hard on her.

801
00:52:25,272 --> 00:52:26,573
I must ask her...

802
00:52:27,442 --> 00:52:28,812
why she changed her statement.

803
00:52:30,743 --> 00:52:32,953
I'll ask her. Where is she?

804
00:52:33,812 --> 00:52:34,812
At home.

805
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,953
Leave it. I should ask her.

806
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:38,823
Some things are hard to tell a parent.

807
00:52:41,022 --> 00:52:42,993
He's right. She's very agitated and sensitive.

808
00:52:43,692 --> 00:52:46,332
Yes. This sounds much better.

809
00:52:54,502 --> 00:52:55,902
Help me out, Dr. Brain.

810
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:58,143
If things go wrong, I might go off the rails.

811
00:52:58,473 --> 00:53:00,942
I'll bring in the kid and torture him until he confesses.

812
00:53:11,982 --> 00:53:14,252
What? Do you think I shouldn't?

813
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,263
My daughter's life is at stake.

814
00:53:17,593 --> 00:53:21,363
No. Let me do the torturing for you.

815
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:24,433
In a very cruel manner.

816
00:53:37,513 --> 00:53:38,513
Yi Na.

817
00:53:39,812 --> 00:53:41,013
I'll help you.

818
00:53:43,122 --> 00:53:44,652
But you must be honest.

819
00:53:45,283 --> 00:53:46,352
Are they...

820
00:53:47,823 --> 00:53:49,292
threatening you with photos?

821
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:02,033
Don't cry.

822
00:54:04,172 --> 00:54:05,442
They committed the crime.

823
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:08,243
Not you.

824
00:54:09,883 --> 00:54:11,183
They committed the crime.

825
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:13,982
Not you.

826
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:17,553
They committed the crime.

827
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,453
Not you.

828
00:54:23,962 --> 00:54:24,993
Okay?

829
00:54:29,363 --> 00:54:32,973
Good. You shouldn't cry. Not when it wasn't your fault.

830
00:54:34,033 --> 00:54:36,672
You might want to cry because you feel wronged.

831
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:38,573
But you still shouldn't.

832
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:43,143
If you do, they'll think even less of you.

833
00:54:44,613 --> 00:54:45,643
Okay.

834
00:54:49,312 --> 00:54:50,752
You must act dignified.

835
00:54:51,422 --> 00:54:53,122
"This is what they did to me."

836
00:54:53,953 --> 00:54:55,192
You must speak up.

837
00:54:56,462 --> 00:54:57,593
Only then can we help.

838
00:55:00,332 --> 00:55:01,332
Now,

839
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:05,232
will you tell me what happened?

840
00:55:14,013 --> 00:55:15,743
I didn't send that message.

841
00:55:17,283 --> 00:55:20,812
When I told her to hand in her phone to the police,

842
00:55:21,582 --> 00:55:23,323
she threatened me with a photo.

843
00:55:25,152 --> 00:55:27,953
She said she took weird photos that day.

844
00:55:30,522 --> 00:55:31,522
Did you see them?

845
00:55:32,292 --> 00:55:33,893
I only saw one.

846
00:55:35,133 --> 00:55:36,462
She said there were lots more.

847
00:55:38,232 --> 00:55:40,602
She asked if I didn't mind if Dad's friends saw them.

848
00:55:41,902 --> 00:55:44,672
If I didn't want that, I should say I was responsible.

849
00:55:46,672 --> 00:55:49,613
If I didn't, she said she'd send the photos out.

850
00:55:55,553 --> 00:55:57,553
I'd been trying to avoid them,

851
00:55:58,352 --> 00:56:00,022
but we met a few days ago.

852
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:02,223
And...

853
00:56:03,422 --> 00:56:05,122
Fifty dollars per photo.

854
00:56:05,622 --> 00:56:08,332
I have 20 photos, so that's 1,000 dollars.

855
00:56:11,033 --> 00:56:13,033
I don't have that much money.

856
00:56:15,433 --> 00:56:18,442
You don't? Then we should earn some.

857
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:20,872
I'll ask for...

858
00:56:21,872 --> 00:56:23,283
fifty cents per photo.

859
00:56:26,482 --> 00:56:27,683
Look.

860
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:30,622
My gosh.

861
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:34,022
I don't know what to do.

862
00:56:40,562 --> 00:56:42,363
I'll sort it all out for you.
