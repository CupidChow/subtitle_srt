No, don't. I won't do it.

You got attacked out of the blue?

It must be someone who holds a grudge against you.

00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:05,593
A grudge?

95
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:10,004
I'm sure you can't think of just one person because there are too many.

You're good at saying the right things in such an annoying way.

You're good at giving compliments in such a scary way.

Stop talking nonsense.

99

Did you call it in?

100
00:09:24,884 --> 00:09:25,884
Yes.

101
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:27,654
They said they'd look into it and call me,

102
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:28,654
but I don't trust them.

103
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:32,563
So you want us to contact that station and give them a little push?

104
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:33,963
Okay.

105
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:36,864
A close friend of mine works there. I'll look into it for you.

106
00:09:36,864 --> 00:09:39,933
Oh, do you want a smart watch just in case?

107
00:09:40,264 --> 00:09:42,303
You know, the one with the button you can press to call the police.

108
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:44,473
You should wear one at all times.

109
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,244
Goodness. I only suggested it out of concern.

110
00:09:48,244 --> 00:09:50,374
Worry about your poop first,

111
00:09:50,473 --> 00:09:52,544
so you won't have to frantically look for a restroom.

112
00:09:53,544 --> 00:09:56,213
My goodness. You're even worried about my poop now?

113
00:09:56,213 --> 00:09:58,514
Thank you very much.

114
00:10:00,453 --> 00:10:01,453
Hi.

115
00:10:02,183 --> 00:10:03,193
Everyone's here.

116
00:10:03,624 --> 00:10:04,624
Let's start the meeting.

117
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:13,134
Name, Cho Na Young. Age, 27.

118
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:14,203
She's a makeup artist.

119
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:16,803
It is speculated that she was killed in her studio apartment...

120
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:19,103
where she lived alone and was abandoned on the street.

121
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,874
The cause of death was asphyxia by manual strangulation.

122
00:10:21,874 --> 00:10:23,544
The security footage from the building...

123
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:25,644
shows how the suspect entered her apartment.

124
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:30,053
He used a smoke bomb designed for cockroaches.

125
00:10:30,683 --> 00:10:32,453
He made it look like a fire had broken out...

126
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:34,524
and barged into the apartment when she opened the door.

127
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:35,794
Then the next day...

128
00:10:38,553 --> 00:10:40,923
The footage shows the suspect carrying Cho Na Young's dead body...

129
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:42,124
out of the apartment.

130
00:10:42,264 --> 00:10:45,234
One thing to note is that her phone was powered off at the scene,

131
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:46,364
then disappeared.

132
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,963
The suspect probably took it.

133
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,603
We went through her social media photos...

134
00:10:50,603 --> 00:10:52,774
and found out the make and model of her phone.

135
00:10:54,544 --> 00:10:56,573
Keep an eye on it and see if the phone turns on.

136
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:57,943
Have you checked her call history?

137
00:10:58,144 --> 00:10:59,583
We've reached out to the service provider.

138
00:11:00,443 --> 00:11:01,443
Anything on the suspect?

139
00:11:01,614 --> 00:11:03,154
We haven't been able to identify the suspect.

140
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:05,213
It was her day off, so she didn't go out.

141
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:07,953
She had a boyfriend but didn't see him that day.

142
00:11:08,524 --> 00:11:10,894
Hold on. Something's odd here.

143
00:11:11,923 --> 00:11:14,024
Why did we get a case that has nothing to do with the brain?

144
00:11:14,394 --> 00:11:16,864
A strange handwriting was found at the scene.

145
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:18,063
- Show him. - Yes, sir.

146
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:23,103
(I did what my brain told me to.)

147
00:11:25,103 --> 00:11:26,404
Well, you see...

148
00:11:26,404 --> 00:11:29,813
I'm sure they're targeting us.

149
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:32,443
They're challenging us, the Neuroscientific Investigation Team.

150
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,083
Don't you think so, Dr. Brain?

151
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:41,654
I do. Yes, you're right. A challenge.

152
00:11:42,423 --> 00:11:43,593
You never let me down, Dr. Brain.

153
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:46,894
So I strongly insisted that we should work on this case.

154
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:48,394
That's how we got the case.

155
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:51,164
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

156
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,364
We're not thrilled to work on this case either,

157
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:57,433
but the suspect got caught on the security footage,

158
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:58,803
and there are witnesses too.

159
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:00,144
It's only a matter of time before we catch him.

160
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:01,603
Guys, don't worry.

161
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:12,414
You didn't see him?

162
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:15,583
He was standing right there when you ran out of your apartment.

163
00:12:16,524 --> 00:12:17,593
I'm not sure.

164
00:12:18,193 --> 00:12:19,264
I didn't see this man.

165
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,433
I didn't see anyone.

166
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,634
Was it because of all the smoke?

167
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:30,933
What?

168
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:32,544
But...

169
00:12:35,544 --> 00:12:38,173
He must've stood out. How did they not see him?

170
00:12:38,514 --> 00:12:41,443
The four neighbors who walked by him all said they didn't see him.

171
00:12:41,443 --> 00:12:43,553
Does it even make sense to you? Are they duping us together?

172
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:46,884
No, it's possible.

173
00:12:48,524 --> 00:12:51,593
My lab conducted an experiment related to this in the past.

174
00:12:54,463 --> 00:12:56,794
We showed this video to the participants...

175
00:12:57,034 --> 00:13:00,463
and told them to count the number of passes made by those wearing red.

176
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:02,463
Once they finished watching the video,

177
00:13:02,603 --> 00:13:05,904
we asked them if they saw a person wearing a mask.

178
00:13:06,173 --> 00:13:08,803
More than half of them said they didn't,

179
00:13:09,614 --> 00:13:12,984
even though you can clearly see the horse mask right here.

180
00:13:14,884 --> 00:13:17,914
My gosh. How did they not notice this?

181
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:20,553
Because of the way the brain works,

182
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,894
we don't recognize even big changes happening...

183
00:13:22,894 --> 00:13:25,553
right before our eyes when we're preoccupied with something.

184
00:13:25,553 --> 00:13:27,394
It's called "change blindness."

185
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,494
It's the secret behind many magic tricks.

186
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:33,933
I see. When they saw all the smoke,

187
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:35,463
that was all they could think about.

188
00:13:35,463 --> 00:13:37,234
So they didn't even notice the helmet guy.

189
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:38,874
Yes, it's possible.

190
00:13:40,044 --> 00:13:42,374
Darn it. I thought we'd be able to catch this guy soon.

191
00:13:43,044 --> 00:13:45,173
Goodness. This will be a headache.

192
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:50,614
My eyes will be exhausted again.

Oh.

195
00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:29,124
You should take a break.

196
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:32,193
No, we need to catch this punk as soon as possible.

197
00:14:32,193 --> 00:14:34,864
We'll catch him in no time if we can just track him down.

198
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:39,134
Gosh, I'm all tense.

199
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,264
Let me give you a shoulder massage.

200
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,274
Oh, no. It's okay.

201
00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:47,244
I have a sports massage license.

Gosh, be gentle.

- There. The other way. - Captain Seul, please be gentle.

Oh.

208
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:07,294
What's going on, you two?

209
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,193
You've gotten this close?

210
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,494
No, this was...

211
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,494
That's right.

212
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:13,933
Is there a problem?

213
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:18,303
No, not at all. There are no problems.

214
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:20,603
Keep doing what you were doing.

215
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:27,284
Well, I should get back to this.

216
00:15:28,114 --> 00:15:29,553
I'll help you.

217
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:55,103
Captain Seul, it's getting really late. You should go home.

218
00:15:57,914 --> 00:15:59,073
Staying late paid off.

219
00:15:59,843 --> 00:16:02,244
I got him. He stopped by a convenience store.

220
00:16:02,853 --> 00:16:03,853
What?

221
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:07,923
Yes, it's him.

222
00:16:08,624 --> 00:16:09,624
Where is this?

223
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,553
Oh! Yes.

224
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:14,264
He was here.

225
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:16,634
I got nervous when he walked in wearing the helmet.

226
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:19,664
What did he buy?

227
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,063
Packing tape.

228
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:23,973
How did he pay for it?

229
00:16:24,534 --> 00:16:25,534
With cash.

230
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:30,473
Did you notice anything else? Is there anything you remember?

231
00:16:31,843 --> 00:16:32,843
Yes, there is.

(Packing Tape, Regular)

00:16:40,654 --> 00:16:41,654
It's a dollar.

234
00:16:43,923 --> 00:16:45,323
He looked suspicious, so I took a closer look.

235
00:16:46,164 --> 00:16:48,764
He was wearing some kind of uniform inside his jacket.

236
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:50,864
He looked like a cop.

237
00:16:52,164 --> 00:16:53,164
A cop?

238
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:56,173
The part-timer said she saw some kind of badge on his chest.

239
00:16:56,173 --> 00:16:57,504
It's very likely that he is a cop.

240
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:01,073
The pants look like a part of the uniform too.

241
00:17:01,274 --> 00:17:03,274
Did the victim personally know a cop?

242
00:17:04,613 --> 00:17:06,413
Yes, she did. Her boyfriend.

243
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:09,714
Im Young Hoon. Age, 29.

244

He's in Mobile Force Two at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

It was my day off, so I stayed home.

247

It was Na Young's day off too.

248
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:30,903
You'd been seeing each other for a month...

249
00:17:30,903 --> 00:17:33,373
but didn't meet on your day off? That's odd.

For hitting your ex-girlfriend.

I sued her too, for making a false accusation.

The case is on trial now.

Did Na Young know about it?

No.

261
00:18:05,774 --> 00:18:07,403
Perhaps she found out that day?

262
00:18:09,143 --> 00:18:10,174
No.

263
00:18:11,244 --> 00:18:14,843
Cho Na Young found out that your ex-girlfriend had sued you...

264
00:18:15,113 --> 00:18:16,613
and wanted to break up.

265
00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:18,413
Maybe you went after her out of rage.

266
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:19,583
I didn't.

267
00:18:22,383 --> 00:18:24,123
Are you interested in the brain?

Sorry? What do you mean by that?

269

The brain. This right here.

00:18:34,034 --> 00:18:35,034
Why do you ask?

Dr. Brain, what's your take on this guy?

273
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,784
The fact that he didn't register the word "brain" quickly...

274
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:56,024
tells me he isn't interested in it.

275

"I did what my brain told me to."

276
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:00,794
I don't see him as someone who'd write that.

277
00:19:00,863 --> 00:19:03,034
But he keeps insisting that...

278
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:06,333
we check cell towers for his alibi, which seems fishy.

279
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,563
What about her cell phone log?

280
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,803
It matches his statement.

281

Her last call was with Im Young Hoon,

282
00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:14,474
and cell towers put him in his neighborhood.

283
00:19:15,044 --> 00:19:17,643
He seemed too collected for someone who lost a girlfriend.

284
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,383
And don't get me started on his previous assault charge.

285
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,553
Nothing went missing, so we can rule out a robbery.

286

She wasn't sexually assaulted either.

287
00:19:26,383 --> 00:19:28,424
Murder following a bad breakup seems most likely.

is also the murder suspect?

he took off on a motorcycle from the park.

306

The helmet he wore is the same one that our helmet guy had.

307
00:21:13,168 --> 00:21:15,168
Did he change his clothes, then?

308
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:18,009
That jacket he's wearing.

309
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:20,039
That particular design was released last year,

310
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,239
and it's reversible.

311
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:23,749
To sum it up,

312
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,578
the helmet guy who disposed of Ms. Cho's body...

313
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:30,118
turned his jacket inside out, got on a motorcycle,

314
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:33,189
came to the park in my neighborhood, took his helmet off,

315
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:34,559
and broke into my house?

316
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:35,959
That's it.

317
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,299
Could it be the boyfriend Im Young Hoon?

318
00:21:39,358 --> 00:21:43,068
They seem to have similar figures, but I can't be sure.

Have you met Im Young Hoon before?

Not that I remember.

the Neuroscientific Investigation Team.

00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:56,178
He broke into your house...

324
00:21:56,178 --> 00:21:59,019
and left a message stating that his brain told him to kill.

325
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:01,878
I think this person is challenging Dr. Shin.

326
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:05,989
I don't know who he's challenging,

327
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:09,729
but something unusual is going on for sure.

Right.

Doctor.

This is a surprise.

I doubt you came because you missed me.

I had something to ask.

Did you meet Ha Ru?

I wonder what made you think that.

Please answer my question.

No, I haven't met him.

Who was he here to meet?

Dr. Brain, a penny for your thoughts.

I'm thinking of a way...

I'm associated with an inmate there.

I should check if it's him.

They must be flustered by now.

374

I'm sure they're curious as to why the phone was turned on.

How does it feel...

What's wrong? Does it scare you?

No.

It's just that I'll miss this.

00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,769
She betrayed me and met some other guy.

496
00:34:33,499 --> 00:34:35,368
That's not called betrayal.

497
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:38,669
That's called a break-up.

498
00:34:43,908 --> 00:34:46,319
You said you wanted to teach me pain.

499
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,118
Why?

500
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:52,048
Because you seem like a smart guy...

501
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:54,988
who has everything.

502
00:34:55,158 --> 00:34:57,559
You're weird and crooked.

503
00:34:58,189 --> 00:34:59,899
Why did you break into my place?

504
00:35:00,928 --> 00:35:02,298
I just wanted to look around.

505
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:04,669
Oh, yes,

506
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:06,169
because I'm a fan.

507
00:35:15,008 --> 00:35:16,008
You said...

508
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:19,618
"Kid. You should come too..."

509
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,249
to me.

510
00:35:23,118 --> 00:35:24,118
What did you mean?

511
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,919
I meant you should rejoin your parents.

512
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,028
Why did you call me "kid?"

513
00:35:33,428 --> 00:35:35,059
To me, you look like a kid.

514
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:42,039
Did Dr. Hwang Dong Woo send you?

515
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,508
No.

516
00:35:47,638 --> 00:35:48,908
I did what my brain said.

517
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:58,589
What is...

518
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:01,118
your brain like?

519
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:08,059
You'll find out soon enough.

520
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,908
Do you think Hwang Dong Woo made him do it?

521
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:21,638
It's very likely.

522
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,879
We recently discussed my parents' car accident.

523
00:36:25,348 --> 00:36:26,649
What's weird is...

524
00:36:27,078 --> 00:36:30,319
how he knew about the kid part of my memory.

525
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,189
It's either a coincidence...

526
00:36:33,988 --> 00:36:35,059
or he's the culprit.

527
00:36:38,028 --> 00:36:39,798
Didn't you say it was a car accident?

528
00:36:42,499 --> 00:36:44,499
Can I look into the case files?

529
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:45,828
When did it happen?

530
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:46,839
About 28 years ago.

531
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:47,939
The files are gone, then.

532
00:36:48,238 --> 00:36:50,169
We destroy even big case files after ten years.

533
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,238
Car accident files are never kept.

534
00:36:56,749 --> 00:36:58,479
The killer is a prison guard,

535
00:36:58,709 --> 00:37:02,979
and he worked in the wing where the worst criminals are.

536
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,919
The public is concerned...

537
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:07,959
for the guards' welfare and psychological health.

538
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:10,359
The penitentiary...

539
00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:12,388
has not released an official statement yet.

540
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:15,999
It's been confirmed that the killer and the victim dated in the past.

541
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:19,298
He has been meeting with Dr. Hwang Dong Woo on a regular basis.

542
00:37:19,939 --> 00:37:22,339
It is Dr. Shin Ha Ru.

543
00:37:34,548 --> 00:37:37,819
(Korea National University Hospital)

544
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:39,789
They met?

545
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:41,758
The correctional officer confirmed it.

546
00:37:42,488 --> 00:37:44,059
I should've looked into it sooner.

547
00:37:44,258 --> 00:37:47,698
It's my own fault for believing Professor Hwang, that evil man.

548
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:49,559
Why did he lie?

549
00:37:50,528 --> 00:37:52,729
Because he thought I wouldn't let him see Ha Ru.

550
00:37:52,899 --> 00:37:55,069
Why was he so determined to meet Ha Ru?

551
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:58,508
I told you that he was a destructive person.

552
00:37:58,508 --> 00:38:01,638
Right. But why is he targeting Ha Ru?

553
00:38:02,709 --> 00:38:04,278
He does these things for no reason!

554
00:38:05,548 --> 00:38:07,919
That correctional officer too. He got played by that scumbag...

555
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:09,149
and ruined his own life.

556
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:15,618
What is Ha Ru up to these days?

557
00:38:17,189 --> 00:38:19,859
All I did was tell him...

558
00:38:20,658 --> 00:38:22,658
to prove his love.

559
00:38:24,828 --> 00:38:27,138
Then he went there and got himself into such trouble.

560
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:29,839
Why did you send him to my place?

561
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:33,578
Did he say I sent him?

562
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:37,709
I did not.

563
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:40,649
I guess he's a fan of yours.

564
00:38:43,078 --> 00:38:45,048
A fan would never barge in with a knife in his hand.

565
00:38:47,488 --> 00:38:49,488
My parents' accident.

566
00:38:50,988 --> 00:38:52,328
Is there anything you know about it?

567
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,999
Tell me.

568
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:09,539
You said it was something you didn't want to remember.

569
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:14,919
Forget it.

570
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:19,218
I don't want to fatigue my brain.

571
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:27,499
If you want to know, just tell me anytime.

572
00:39:43,379 --> 00:39:44,379
Algernon.

573
00:39:45,778 --> 00:39:46,919
My parents' accident...

574
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,189
Is there something I don't know?

575
00:39:53,718 --> 00:39:54,718
Are you asleep?

576
00:39:55,618 --> 00:39:57,689
I have so much on my mind now. How could you sleep?

577
00:39:58,528 --> 00:40:01,459
Gosh, you little brat. You aren't even interested.

578
00:40:14,209 --> 00:40:16,649
I should just ask. About that day.

579
00:40:17,778 --> 00:40:19,309
I'll ask the person who knows the most.

580
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:22,650
I said I'd visit you.

581
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,689
Don't worry about it. I haven't visited you in a long time...

582
00:40:26,689 --> 00:40:28,030
and wanted to talk to you about something.

583
00:40:34,729 --> 00:40:36,229
I heard you met Professor Hwang Dong Woo.

584
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:38,670
How did you know?

585
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,670
I know him. I heard he met you.

586
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:45,110
I hear he makes you visit him, using the brain donation as an excuse.

587
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,110
Yes.

588
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,079
Well, visiting him is fine.

589
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,220
But he kept insinuating that he knew something I didn't remember...

590
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:57,420
about my parents' accident.

591
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:02,659
My parents.

592
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:05,260
Was it not a normal accident?

593
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,240
Ha Ru.

594
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:13,439
That man... He's pure evil.

595
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,809
If you spend too much time with him,

596
00:41:16,209 --> 00:41:19,340
you'll either become a murderer or take your own life.

597
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,510
Look at the correctional officer who killed his girlfriend.

598
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,920
I heard he was in charge of Professor Hwang.

599
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,990
I also think that he was controlling that guy.

600
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,659
You think? It is the truth. I'm sure of it!

601
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:34,030
Do not let him get to you.

602
00:41:35,189 --> 00:41:37,400
I'm not such an easy target.

603
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,700
You're already letting it happen. You are curious about him.

604
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:46,970
It was just...

605
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:50,380
It was a normal car accident.

606
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:55,180
That man is using your flawed memory...

607
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,349
to cook up a ruse to shake you to your core.

608
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,789
But why do such a thing?

609
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:02,150
He taught me...

610
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,189
and your father as our professor.

611
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,630
He was the Professor of Neurosurgery...

612
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,099
at Korea National University Hospital,

613
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:12,200
so I thought that must've been the case.

614
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:16,900
He and your father didn't get along.

615
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,840
He knows you're his son. That's why he's doing all this.

616
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,139
Just because...

617
00:42:24,439 --> 00:42:26,010
of my father?

618
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:27,650
He does these things for no reason.

619
00:42:27,909 --> 00:42:30,019
He just loves destruction.

620
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:35,349
So do not fall for his tricks. Do you understand?

621
00:42:40,459 --> 00:42:41,530
Yes.

622
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,530
Let me ask you one thing.

623
00:42:51,139 --> 00:42:53,209
Is there anything you're hiding from me?

624
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:00,680
No.

625
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,320
You already know everything.

626
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,590
He's lying.

627
00:43:15,729 --> 00:43:17,499
- Go back inside. - Okay.

628
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,709
He's clearly lying.

629
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,709
But why is he lying?

630
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:44,959
Dr. Shin Ha Ru.

631
00:43:53,229 --> 00:43:55,430
Prosecutor Han Yeon Hee. What brings you here?

632
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:58,300
I'm here to see you, officially.

633
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:05,680
Also, he tried to kill me.

634
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,809
Please make sure you get him locked up for decades.

635
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:11,780
He broke into my home. That will be added to his charges, right?

636
00:44:11,979 --> 00:44:15,550
Yes. Murder, attempted murder, and breaking and entering.

637
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:18,420
We want to request the death penalty,

638
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,430
but the defense attorney is making an absurd claim.

639
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,990
So I'm here for your advice.

640
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:28,030
They submitted Kang In Ho's brain MRI scan as evidence.

641
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:30,400
They're saying his brain exhibits psychopathic tendencies.

642
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,409
They said such tendencies should be considered an illness...

643
00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:36,010
and a mitigating factor.

644
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,950
Psychopathic tendencies should be considered an illness?

645
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:44,249
Many medical and scientific experts do believe...

646
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:46,180
that it is caused by biological factors.

647
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,789
Although there are still heated controversies surrounding it.

648
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,889
They're going to insist that it's an illness...

649
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,159
so that they can get his sentence reduced.

650
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,030
I bet this was the plan from the get-go.

651
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:59,329
"I did what my brain told me to."

652
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:01,070
That's why he wrote that at the scene.

653
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,070
Who's the attorney that's making such an absurd claim?

654
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,840
Cha and Jung Law is representing him.

655
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,409
What? That law firm is very expensive.

656
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,340
Is Kang In Ho's family well off?

657
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:16,409
In his statement, he said he struggled with poverty as a child.

658
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:21,019
That's strange. How did he hire such an expensive law firm?

659
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,990
Psychopathy is usually considered an aggravating factor.

660
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:29,130
Why is that high-profile law firm making such an absurd claim?

661
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:33,329
But there's a neuroscientist who supports this claim.

662
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:35,999
Who?

663
00:45:36,769 --> 00:45:39,200
The defense counsel is bringing him in as a witness.

664
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,439
His name is Hwang Dong Woo.

665
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:44,010
Have you heard of him?

666
00:45:44,439 --> 00:45:47,010
A neurosurgeon who murdered his own patient years ago.

667
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,220
Yes, I know him very well.

668
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,420
When is the trial?

669
00:45:54,689 --> 00:45:59,420
(Court)

670
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:13,670
Of course.

671
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,539
The air at the penitentiary doesn't even come close.

672
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:28,789
Let us go.

(Court)

674
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:38,729
This image of Kang In Ho's brain shows...

675
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:40,769
that his ventromedial prefrontal cortex...

676
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:43,300
and the gray matter at the front of his head...

677
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,439
are only 15 percent of the size of the average person.

678
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:47,909
His amygdala is also reduced in size.

679
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:50,209
His prefrontal cortex, amygdala,

680
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:52,680
and hippocampus lack connectivity.

681
00:46:53,209 --> 00:46:55,979
It is the brain of a typical psychopath.

682
00:46:56,479 --> 00:46:59,950
This biological finding proves that Kang In Ho...

683
00:47:00,249 --> 00:47:03,249
has an impaired brain.

684
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:06,119
Anyone can say that he suffers from an illness.

685
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,059
But unlike other illnesses,

686
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:09,829
having the brain of a psychopath...

687
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,459
isn't grounds for a reduced sentence,

688
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,970
which I find to be unfair.

689
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,939
Even domestic experts agree that psychopaths...

690
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:21,510
are those suffering from an impaired brain...

691
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:22,670
with issues to the frontal cortex.

692
00:47:23,709 --> 00:47:24,709
Your Honor,

693
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:26,709
the defense is misleading the truth...

694
00:47:26,709 --> 00:47:28,680
by claiming that these facts...

695
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,150
are backed by ambiguous figures.

696
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,880
Right. It is why...

697
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,050
I brought an expert witness to answer medical questions.

698
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,559
I call to the stand Hwang Dong Woo,

699
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:40,959
a former scientist...

700
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:41,959
at the Korea National University Hospital.

701
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,260
He doesn't seem well.

702
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:19,760
It's all a show.

703
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:22,700
I bet that he's even healthier than you are.

704
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,209
The witness will take the oath.

705
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:28,470
I swear...

706
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:30,510
by my conscience...

707
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:32,979
that I shall give the truth, the whole truth,

708
00:48:32,979 --> 00:48:35,010
and nothing but the truth.

709
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,349
Should there be any falsehood,

710
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:41,849
I will accept the charges of perjury.

711

(Witness)

717
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:59,900
After being arrested for seven counts of murder,

718
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,670
I have been incarcerated...

719
00:49:03,269 --> 00:49:05,840
in Jangwon Penitentiary on death row.

720
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:09,249
- What? - On death row?

721
00:49:09,249 --> 00:49:11,119
- Seriously? - How can he be an expert witness?

722
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,220
Prison?

723
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,320
No way.

724
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,889
The expert witness...

725
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:19,260
was once a renowned neurosurgeon...

726
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,559
in this country.

727
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:22,789
You were a respected doctor,

728
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:25,999
and rumor has it that you were also wealthy.

729
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:30,470
Why did someone like you, who had fame and fortune,

730
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,599
suddenly commit those murders?

731
00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:36,539
Because...

732
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:43,280
I am a patient...

733
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:46,519
with a psychopathic brain.

734
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:48,749
- What? - A psychopathic brain?

735
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,360
- Unbelievable. - So he's a psychopath?

736
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,930
- Darn. - I can't believe it.

737
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,289
How can he be an expert witness, then?

738
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:57,900
Do you agree...

739
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,769
that a psychopath suffers from a disorder to the frontal cortex?

740
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,240
In other words, do you agree...

741
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:07,539
that psychopaths are those with a mental illness?

742
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:11,039
I do.

743
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:13,309
And I...

744
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:16,110
am proof of it.

745
00:50:16,749 --> 00:50:17,749
Then,

746
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:22,150
since Kang In Ho suffers from the same disorder as you,

747
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,689
do you believe that he has the free will...

748
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:29,059
not to commit murder when facing a stressful situation?

749
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,499
We are sick patients.

750
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,470
We don't have the free will...

751
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,340
to stop ourselves from committing murders.

752
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,840
Did you hear that?

753
00:50:44,479 --> 00:50:46,280
I can't believe it.

754
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,809
So they can't help it?

755
00:50:48,209 --> 00:50:49,380
What the...

756
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:52,150
That's absurd.

757
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,150
That is all.

758
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,150
They're psychopaths.

759
00:50:54,349 --> 00:50:55,490
Unbelievable.

760
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:57,689
I can't believe he just said that.

761
00:50:57,689 --> 00:50:58,860
Order.

762
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,360
Prosecution, you may question the witness.

763
00:51:01,789 --> 00:51:02,789
Right.

764
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,300
Dr. Hwang.

765
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,939
You are claiming that psychopathy is a mental illness.

766
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:17,740
Those with mental illnesses have no control over their actions.

767
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,979
In a nutshell, their judgment is impaired.

768
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,119
That's right.

769
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:25,920
But psychopaths...

770
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:29,189
are well aware of their actions.

771
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:31,920
They commit crimes...

772
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:33,689
knowing what will happen.

773
00:51:34,729 --> 00:51:35,729
That...

774
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:40,200
is the difference between psychopathy and mental illness.

775
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:41,599
You're wrong.

776
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:46,070
Knowing what will happen?

777
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,970
Look at how I've been caught...

778
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,909
and see how it's ruined my life.

779
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:53,539
Not being able to foresee that...

780
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:58,019
is the same as having impaired judgment.

781
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,320
I guess.

782
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,150
He's not wrong.

783
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,150
Right?

784
00:52:02,849 --> 00:52:05,260
I guess he has a point.

785
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:09,260
If you think about it, it makes sense.

786
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:12,260
- I agree. - He has a point.

787
00:52:13,499 --> 00:52:14,869
Let's say that you're right...

788
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:17,170
and call psychopathy a mental illness.

789
00:52:17,999 --> 00:52:19,470
Can you tell me...

790
00:52:19,939 --> 00:52:23,070
if there's a way to cure psychopathy?

791
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,309
There is no medical treatment...

792
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:32,050
that will fundamentally cure an adult's psychopathic brain.

793
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,389
Yes, my point exactly.

794
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:39,119
Curing psychopaths is considered a conundrum.

795
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,689
Since they can't be cured or reformed,

796
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,499
for the safety of our society,

797
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,200
psychopaths should be removed from the streets...

for as long as possible.

799
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,970
Psychopathy isn't grounds for a reduced sentence.

800
00:52:53,809 --> 00:52:55,809
It is the reason for an aggravated one.

801
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,610
- She's right. - She has a point.

803

I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

824
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:36,139
Dr. Brain, what if you didn't take the stand?

825
00:54:37,979 --> 00:54:39,309
Detective Geum's right.

826
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:40,579
By the looks of it,

827
00:54:40,579 --> 00:54:42,309
he's trying to provoke you.

828
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:43,780
Let him.

829
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,880
Okay, found it.

830
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,950
I know how I can...

831
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:51,820
discredit his claims.

832
00:54:57,729 --> 00:55:00,360
Dr. Shin, please take the stand.

834
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:29,659
Dr. Shin,

835
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:31,400
briefly inform us...

836
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,400
on your Psychopathic Brain Rebuilding Project.

837
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,300
Externally and internally,

838
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,709
I am looking for a way to cure a psychopathic brain.

839
00:55:40,709 --> 00:55:43,209
Is the research applicable?

840
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,780
No, it's still in the research stage.

841
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,380
I see.

842
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,880
You have received...

843
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,519
a lot of government funding for this project.

844
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:54,920
Isn't it because there's a chance...

845
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,559
that psychopathy is curable?

846
00:55:58,119 --> 00:55:59,119
That's right.

847
00:55:59,619 --> 00:56:02,030
Do you believe that psychopathy...

848
00:56:02,689 --> 00:56:05,729
is an illness of some sort?

849
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:11,970
Yes. I think it's a disease.

(Prosecution)

851
00:56:20,709 --> 00:56:24,519
In that case, do you agree that Kang In Ho...

852
00:56:24,979 --> 00:56:26,320
who has the brain...

853
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:28,349
of a psychopath is ill and therefore...

854
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,959
should be given a shorter sentence?

855
00:56:30,959 --> 00:56:32,360
(Counsel)

856
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:35,889
No.

857
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,329
Witness.

858
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:43,269
You just said you believed psychopathy was a disease.

859
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:45,200
Yes.

860
00:56:45,439 --> 00:56:48,869
But not all who are afflicted...

861
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,439
become murderers.

862
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,490
Many people with a psychopathic brain...

863
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:05,159
manage to live ordinary lives,

864
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:07,459
and some even enjoy success and high social status.

865
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:10,760
Of course, I have heard the talk that...

866
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,459
many CEOs are psychopaths.

867
00:57:12,459 --> 00:57:14,400
There was even a rumor...

868
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,229
that Steve Jobs was a psychopath.

869
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:21,209
But have you seen any of their brain scans?

870
00:57:21,769 --> 00:57:22,769
No.

871
00:57:23,209 --> 00:57:27,309
Doesn't that make it an assumption made by the public?

872
00:57:28,409 --> 00:57:31,619
No. I have proof.

873
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,519
- What? Proof? - He has something?

874
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:36,490
- What does he have? - I don't know.

875
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:43,789
You have proof?

876
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:46,360
Can we see it now?

877
00:57:46,659 --> 00:57:47,700
Yes.

878
00:57:48,229 --> 00:57:51,900
Please pull up the functional MRI I have of a psychopath's brain.

879
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,780
What you see on the monitor...

880
00:57:59,139 --> 00:58:00,780
is a brain scan...

881
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:03,280
taken when the person was shown a photo...

882
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,650
of a gruesome crime scene.

883
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:09,550
You can see the two brains showed a different response.

884
00:58:10,689 --> 00:58:12,990
The amygdala of one shows almost no reaction,

885
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:15,860
and there's very little connection between it and the prefrontal lobe.

886
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,059
The amygdala itself is smaller too.

887
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:21,130
Even more so than the defendant Kang In Ho's.

888
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:24,939
Based on these photos alone,

889
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:28,010
this person is an even worse psychopath.

890
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:32,039
But the owner of the brain in this photo...

891
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:34,409
is someone you know well.

892
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:47,019
Do you want to know whose brain this is?

893
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:50,159
- Yes. - Yes.

894
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:51,559
What's he up to now?

895
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:53,499
Is this an award ceremony or what?

896
00:58:53,499 --> 00:58:55,170
Why's he upping the ante?

897
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:57,840
The owner of this brain,

898
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:00,840
the person with the psychopathic brain is...

899
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:02,139
It is...

900
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:04,709
It is...

901
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:15,519
It's me.

(Brain Works)

904
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:07,909
Are you asking the probability that I'll commit murder?

905
01:00:07,909 --> 01:00:11,380
He's not the murderous psychopath you're thinking of.

906
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:12,510
I'm confident.

907
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,510
Confident that I can control my brain.

908
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:17,950
I wonder if you really are.

There's only one thing I want.

910
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,720
To not break up.

911
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,189
I beg of you.

912
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:25,090
Please let me keep my husband.

913
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,729
You must really want to see me.

914
01:00:27,959 --> 01:00:30,329
That is just too rude.
