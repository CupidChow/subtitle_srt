2
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:15,094
You and I should give love a try.

3
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:17,404
What?

4
00:00:28,143 --> 00:00:29,414
Detective Geum!

5
00:00:36,984 --> 00:00:38,054
Are you all right?

6
00:00:39,594 --> 00:00:41,353
What? Oh, yes.

7
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:44,164
I mastered the act of landing, you see.

8
00:00:48,234 --> 00:00:49,433
Oh, my gosh.

9
00:00:49,804 --> 00:00:52,833
I thought you'd fallen to your death.

10
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:56,274
I almost did. How could you...

11
00:00:56,444 --> 00:00:58,914
say something so insane somewhere so dangerous?

12
00:00:59,514 --> 00:01:03,243
Are you trying to assassinate me?

13
00:01:03,484 --> 00:01:06,154
Why would you say that? I'm serious.

14
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:09,923
To say you're serious, don't you think this location...

15
00:01:09,924 --> 00:01:12,794
and situation's way too out of balance?

16
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:15,863
I put a lot of thought into it.

17
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:18,594
Dr. Brain coached me.

18
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:22,233
He said you'd be more likely to say yes if we were...

19
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:24,463
somewhere dangerous and your heart was racing.

20
00:01:24,464 --> 00:01:26,734
That darn Dr. Brain.

21
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:29,544
Dr. Brain!

22
00:01:36,113 --> 00:01:37,314
It has been a long time.

23
00:01:38,954 --> 00:01:41,154
Do you know who I am?

24
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,223
Long time no see, Han Yeon Hee.

25
00:01:45,124 --> 00:01:46,624
How's life as a prosecutor?

26
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:48,424
So-so.

27
00:01:49,264 --> 00:01:52,294
I got nervous, thinking you wouldn't recognize me.

28
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:54,392
I kept running past you.

29
00:01:54,393 --> 00:01:56,434
How could you not even say hi?

30
00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:59,633
I was busy thinking and didn't see you.

31
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:01,633
Are you still thinking about brains?

32
00:02:02,803 --> 00:02:03,944
No.

33
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:07,113
For the first time in my life, I was thinking about love.

34
00:02:07,944 --> 00:02:09,044
And you showed up.

35
00:02:14,754 --> 00:02:15,754
I...

36
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:23,724
Are you busy?

37
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:25,794
How about some tea?

38
00:02:26,664 --> 00:02:29,433
Sorry. I don't have the time.

39
00:02:29,903 --> 00:02:32,273
Oh. You're busy.

40
00:02:33,674 --> 00:02:34,833
Some other time, then.

41
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:38,143
Sure. It was nice to see you. Take care.

42
00:02:39,014 --> 00:02:40,143
Bye.

43
00:02:44,284 --> 00:02:45,414
He's just the same.

44
00:02:49,424 --> 00:02:50,954
And you're still racing.

45
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:54,153
I have no pride at all.

46
00:03:17,843 --> 00:03:19,083
You're okay?

47
00:03:19,653 --> 00:03:21,954
Oh, yes. I'm just fine.

48
00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:24,083
I had a rough childhood.

49
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:26,694
Falling off a cliff's nothing.

50
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:29,164
You saw how I landed, didn't you?

51
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:30,724
I'm alive.

52
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:37,802
Since you're alive, I'd like an answer.

53
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:39,433
Is it yes or no?

54
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:44,704
Captain Seul. You can't ask someone out so interrogatively.

55
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:47,514
I'm impatient.

56
00:03:48,343 --> 00:03:51,113
I don't know when I'll go back to my old, timid self,

57
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:53,653
so I want to make things sure while I'm out of it.

58
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:57,354
This is just... Listen, Captain Seul.

59
00:03:58,324 --> 00:04:02,764
I really, I just don't get it.

60
00:04:03,764 --> 00:04:05,163
Why me?

61
00:04:05,164 --> 00:04:07,592
You're better educated than me you're my superior,

62
00:04:07,593 --> 00:04:09,103
and you're much better looking.

63
00:04:09,104 --> 00:04:10,363
Why fall for me?

64
00:04:11,604 --> 00:04:12,933
It's your smell.

65
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:16,144
My smell? I don't use cologne.

66
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:18,644
Do I...

67
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:24,883
- Is it... - No. The smell of warmth.

68
00:04:27,953 --> 00:04:30,924
When I was unconscious in hospital,

69
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:34,093
I couldn't see, sounds rang in my ears,

70
00:04:34,094 --> 00:04:35,823
and I couldn't speak.

71
00:04:36,464 --> 00:04:38,323
But I could smell so well.

72
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:40,992
Whenever a certain someone came in,

73
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:43,503
I smelled something nice and warm.

74
00:04:53,214 --> 00:04:55,243
I felt at ease when that person was there.

75
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,753
"This person's really worried about me."

76
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:04,753
"This person likes me." I could feel it.

77
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:09,863
At first, I thought it was a nurse.

78
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:13,262
I realized the truth when you came up to me after I got back.

79
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:17,203
"Oh, it's the smell from when I felt that warmth."

80
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:24,974
You stayed to nurse me all night until my mom came, didn't you?

81
00:05:25,943 --> 00:05:28,313
Well, yes, but that was...

82
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:32,914
I wasn't asking you to like me.

83
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:34,952
We were colleagues,

84
00:05:34,953 --> 00:05:37,154
and you were there all alone.

85
00:05:37,524 --> 00:05:39,294
I stayed because I was worried.

86
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:40,822
Then do you dislike me?

87
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:42,593
No, what am I to dislike you?

88
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:43,763
Then what's the problem?

89
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:47,563
Well... Captain Seul.

90
00:05:48,063 --> 00:05:51,933
You know what a huge mess my life is right now.

91
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:53,132
You don't?

92
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,033
Then don't even go there.

93
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:56,073
I know.

94
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:58,844
I know you have a disobedient middle-school senior daughter.

95
00:05:59,044 --> 00:06:00,413
I also know you have an ex...

96
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:03,413
with a hard-to-handle personality who still likes you.

97
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:04,414
I know all that...

98
00:06:04,943 --> 00:06:07,353
and still asked because I'm confident I can take it,

99
00:06:07,354 --> 00:06:09,123
so think about it and get back to me.

100
00:06:10,524 --> 00:06:12,693
Will a week do?

101
00:06:16,664 --> 00:06:17,763
Jeez...

102
00:06:24,503 --> 00:06:25,603
Thank you.

103
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:28,872
Be sure to throw out the first bowl and drink from the second on.

104
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:32,273
- I will. - Goodbye, then, sir.

105
00:06:32,274 --> 00:06:33,644
- Thank you. - Sure.

106
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:38,613
It's his day off.

107
00:06:39,214 --> 00:06:40,753
He'll be alone at home.

108
00:06:41,654 --> 00:06:43,453
Shall I ask him out for lunch?

109
00:06:45,953 --> 00:06:46,953
No.

110
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:50,063
Let's get something and barge in.

111

If you're going to keep this up, just die!

168
00:09:57,114 --> 00:09:59,553
I don't need a son who does nothing but play video games!

169
00:10:09,894 --> 00:10:12,463
I told you to take a break and eat something. You need to eat!

170
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,473
You even skipped your dad's funeral to play video games. Who does that?

171
00:10:20,374 --> 00:10:21,573
Just die!

172
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:43,394
Tell your brother to eat something.

173
00:10:44,864 --> 00:10:47,333
If not, I'll pull this down. Tell him he'd better come out.

174
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:51,063
You're being like this too?

175
00:10:51,364 --> 00:10:52,904
Do you want to see me drop dead?

176
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:55,404
Enough is enough, please.

177
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:42,254
It's okay.

178
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:44,853
I can do it. I'll persuade him to eat something.

179
00:11:45,453 --> 00:11:47,223
I'll be sure to make him eat something today.

What's your relationship with Ms. Choi Jung Yoon?

182
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,384
Are you her son?

183
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:25,453
- Yes. - Your mother...

184
00:13:25,553 --> 00:13:27,424
was found stabbed on a hiking trail.

185
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:31,624
Are you Kim Joon Young?

186
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:35,794
No, that's my brother.

187
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,364
Is he inside?

188
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:41,233
Yes.

189
00:13:42,374 --> 00:13:43,544
Why do you ask?

190
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:45,773
He is the main suspect...

No, wait!

194
00:13:53,284 --> 00:13:55,713
That can't be. There's no way it was my brother.

195
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:58,822
He's a homebound recluse who never goes out.

196
00:13:58,823 --> 00:14:01,823
He's been stuck in his room for years. How could he have done this?

197
00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:05,323
He called it in himself.

Did the Neuroscientific Investigation Team get this case?

220

It's none of my business.

221
00:15:33,284 --> 00:15:35,353
Choi Jung Yoon, age 57.

222
00:15:35,553 --> 00:15:37,153
The preliminary autopsy report states that she died...

223
00:15:37,154 --> 00:15:39,024
from excessive bleeding from the stab wound to the neck.

224
00:15:39,384 --> 00:15:41,193
Her husband died recently.

225

She has two sons.

226

Her elder son, Kim Joon Young,

227
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:47,364
called the police and confessed.

228
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:50,034
Police, right?

229
00:15:50,504 --> 00:15:52,004
Yes, how may we help you?

230
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:54,433
I killed that woman.

231
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:56,644
I'm the one who killed her.

232
00:15:57,174 --> 00:15:59,813
Pardon me? You killed someone?

233
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:01,813
Yes.

234
00:16:02,073 --> 00:16:04,614
Who is "that woman?" Who did you kill?

235
00:16:07,754 --> 00:16:08,754
My mom.

236
00:16:09,254 --> 00:16:11,583
Where did this happen? At home?

237
00:16:13,193 --> 00:16:15,693
No, not at home.

238
00:16:16,424 --> 00:16:18,024
At first, they thought it was a prank call.

239
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:20,433
But the mother's body was found on the hiking trail.

240
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:23,433
She left home early to go hiking. He followed her out and killed her.

241
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,733
He was caught on security cameras?

242
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:26,833
Yes.

243
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:31,203
Gosh. I can't tell who's who because of the masks these days.

244
00:16:31,443 --> 00:16:32,703
It looks like the same hoodie.

245
00:16:33,544 --> 00:16:36,044
From the height to the physique, that does look like him.

246
00:16:36,943 --> 00:16:39,313
Oh, there's a witness.

247
00:16:40,213 --> 00:16:41,553
Yes, they're looking for her.

248
00:16:41,914 --> 00:16:43,784
- What about the murder weapon? - They're looking for that too.

249
00:16:44,524 --> 00:16:45,723
What was his motive?

250
00:16:46,294 --> 00:16:48,053
The suspect is addicted to playing games.

251
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:51,664
A recluse who doesn't leave his room when someone else is home.

252
00:16:51,963 --> 00:16:54,593
He's been stuck in his room for about five years.

253
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:55,794
Five years?

254
00:16:56,664 --> 00:16:58,863
A homebound recluse left home after five years...

255
00:16:58,864 --> 00:16:59,874
and committed murder?

256
00:17:00,473 --> 00:17:01,473
But why?

257
00:17:01,474 --> 00:17:04,304
His brother said he and his mom had a fight the day before the incident.

258
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:09,114
Mom told him to just die instead of living like that.

259
00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:11,614
She threw hurtful words at him.

260
00:17:13,013 --> 00:17:14,554
I thought she had gone too far,

261
00:17:15,914 --> 00:17:17,554
and maybe my brother retaliated.

262
00:17:20,523 --> 00:17:22,323
We have physical evidence and a confession,

263
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:25,164
so why was the case forwarded to our team?

264
00:17:25,564 --> 00:17:27,094
They couldn't get him to cooperate.

265
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:29,394
His brain seems to be damaged in a way.

266
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,232
You don't become a reclusive loner due to a brain disorder.

267
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:33,604
It's mostly psychological.

268
00:17:34,604 --> 00:17:35,674
Well,

269
00:17:36,404 --> 00:17:38,844
he keeps claiming to be 17.

270
00:17:39,943 --> 00:17:41,043
Seventeen?

271
00:17:41,743 --> 00:17:44,513
What? But he was born in 2001.

272
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:48,084
Wait a second. That makes him 22.

273
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:49,453
Hence the mystery.

274
00:17:51,324 --> 00:17:52,723
I guess we must talk to him.

275
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:02,878
All right. Name, Kim Joon Young.

276
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:04,878
Age...

277
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:08,249
I'm 17.

278
00:18:09,918 --> 00:18:11,019
You're 17?

279
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,688
Did you just say that you're 17?

280
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:17,799
That's right.

281
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:22,069
Did being in your room all day make you lose track of time?

282
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:25,408
What's your resident registration number?

283
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:31,608
It's 010811-3004197.

284
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,709
I see you don't have that mixed up.

285
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,948
If you were born in 2001, that makes you 22 this year.

286
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:42,519
You're wrong.

287
00:18:43,918 --> 00:18:45,628
I'm 17.

288
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:56,039
Why am I at a police station?

289
00:18:58,569 --> 00:18:59,868
Ho Young.

290
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:03,579
Where's my younger brother?

291
00:19:18,428 --> 00:19:20,688
Mr. Kim, what's the matter?

292
00:19:20,928 --> 00:19:22,098
Take your seat.

293
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:32,269
When did I get so old?

294
00:19:41,918 --> 00:19:45,079
He really seems to believe that he's 17, but how?

295
00:19:47,249 --> 00:19:48,959
I don't know why or how,

296
00:19:49,658 --> 00:19:51,759
but I don't think he's a reclusive loner.

297
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:03,999
What can he be if he's not a reclusive loner?

298
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,569
Why does he keep asking the same question?

299
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,938
It's like his memories keep resetting to when he was 17.

300
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:12,148
A reset?

301
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,749
Maybe my memories were reset as well.

302
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,779
Why else is he popping into my head?

303
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:21,319
Tell me about it. I'm thinking about him too.

304
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,559
Same here. There's someone I recall as well.

305
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:42,039
This is boring.

306
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:51,918
Hello?

307
00:20:52,588 --> 00:20:54,019
Dr. Shin.

308
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:57,958

solving the reclusive loner case?

310
00:21:02,398 --> 00:21:04,358
Goodness, Dr. Hwang.

311
00:21:05,158 --> 00:21:06,397
Even though you're in prison,

312
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,069
you know what's happening in the world.

313
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:11,138
But I guess you didn't receive this information though.

314
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:13,539
I am no longer a consultant for the police.

315
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:15,908
Oh, dear.

316
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,607
Why would you have quit...

317
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:20,249
what is obviously an interesting gig?

318
00:21:21,408 --> 00:21:23,479
Those police cases form a repository of neuroscience...

319
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:27,588
that you can rarely access in a lab.

320
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:31,489
But I guess that's for you to decide.

321
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,029
Anyway, I hope you haven't forgotten about our upcoming meeting.

322
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:39,668
I'll look forward to it.

323
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:52,509
It's finally time for me to get down to business.

324
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:03,888
A repository of neuroscience?

325
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:06,588
He's right.

(The reclusive loner case)

(Reclusive Loner Murders Mother)

330
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:22,608
There being no updates...

331
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:24,878
must mean that they're lost.

332
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:30,348
Whatever. As if I care.

333
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:39,489
Dr. Brain.

334
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:45,368
Dr. Brain!

335
00:22:48,198 --> 00:22:50,069
What was that? Am I hearing things?

336
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:52,638
Dr. Brain!

337
00:22:59,408 --> 00:23:00,479
It's me.

338
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:03,148
What is this? Why are you here?

339
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:05,319
According to you, moving around...

340
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:07,048
helps the brain function better.

341
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:08,319
It's why I'm exercising.

342
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:11,519
What I don't get is why you're here.

343
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:14,759
I was hoping to run into you.

344
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,258
And I did!

345
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:19,499
What a coincidence.

346
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:21,499
Coincidence, my foot.

347
00:23:22,638 --> 00:23:24,799
Aren't you going to exercise? Why are you heading back?

348
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,368
Because it's obviously not in the cards for me.

349
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,578
That's great, then. Let's head inside and talk.

350
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:31,279
We came across another weird case.

351
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:34,579
Forget it. It's none of my business anymore.

352
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:38,218
A reclusive loner who stayed home for five years...

353
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:40,687
followed his mom who went on a hike and hurt her.

354
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:42,358
Is that so?

355
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:44,718
He claims he's 17 though.

356
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:47,028
He's 22, but he claims that he's 17.

357
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:48,829
And he seems to actually believe that.

358
00:23:49,358 --> 00:23:51,258
Also, after some time passes,

359
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:53,498
he asks the same question over and over again.

360
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,539
It's why we're calling him Reset Man.

361
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:58,739
There seems to be an issue with his memories.

362
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:00,469
Could he have dementia?

363
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:04,709
Well, I do have a theory in mind.

364
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:07,147
Really? No way.

365
00:24:07,148 --> 00:24:10,479
I knew you'd immediately know. What could be wrong with him?

366
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:14,848
That...

367
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,459
I can't tell you for free.

368
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,097
What? Come on, Dr. Brain.

369
00:24:22,098 --> 00:24:24,127
Must you do this? Dr. Brain!

370
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:26,628
Okay, fine. I'll get you a gift.

371
00:24:30,438 --> 00:24:32,338
Dr. Brain, I come bearing a gift.

372
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:37,979
Ta-da. Here's your gift.

373
00:24:40,209 --> 00:24:43,049
Flowers have never been this creepy before.

374
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,448
Get lost.

375
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:47,319
Okay, fine. It'll be for real this time.

376
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,959
Here. My brain.

377
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:53,828
I'll donate it.

378
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:56,529
You're crazy for brain donations.

379
00:24:57,459 --> 00:25:00,569
I'm not exactly crazy for them.

380
00:25:01,698 --> 00:25:03,338
Do you need my help that badly?

381
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:05,608
Yes, of course.

382
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,137
You should sound more desperate.

383
00:25:08,138 --> 00:25:10,138
Must you be this petty?

384
00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:12,079
Strike that.

385
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:15,979
Dr. Shin, we are in need of your assistance.

386
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,088
I will allow you access to my brain.

387
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:24,559
Okay. But first, we have somewhere to be.

388
00:25:25,688 --> 00:25:26,729
What?

389
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:35,799
All right. Here you go.

390
00:25:36,198 --> 00:25:38,068
This must not have been an easy decision,

391
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,968
so I thank you for your donation.

392
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:41,408
There's no need to thank me.

393
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:44,338
I've always been interested in organ donation.

394
00:25:44,438 --> 00:25:46,078
But I made the choice out of the blue...

395
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,979
just to get Dr. Shin on my case.

396
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:53,049
You heard him. I'm the reason he decided to donate his brain.

397
00:25:53,448 --> 00:25:56,318
I'm sure you haven't forgotten that my contribution has been key...

398
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:58,829
to Brain Hub receiving the most brain donations.

399
00:25:59,188 --> 00:26:01,059
Yes, I'm aware of it, Dr. Shin.

400
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:04,627
Now, how about a photo to commemorate the day?

401
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:05,667
- Sure thing. - Right.

402
00:26:05,668 --> 00:26:07,969
- Can you stand there with the form? - Got it.

403
00:26:14,168 --> 00:26:16,178
Are you all ready?

404
00:26:16,739 --> 00:26:19,108
One, two, three.

405
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:22,519
We're done.

406
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,447
You two should take a photo too.

407
00:26:24,448 --> 00:26:25,448
- Sure. - No.

408
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:27,387
Come on, don't be like that.

409
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:30,058
- Let's celebrate my donation. - Forget it.

410
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:31,059
- Come on. - One,

411
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:32,059
- two, - Don't you dare.

412
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,059
three.

413
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,329
Did you get it?

414
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:36,559
Yes.

415
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:43,569
I'll send this photo to Detective Geum.

416
00:26:43,838 --> 00:26:44,838
Goodbye.

417
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:48,009
What is it?

418
00:26:49,638 --> 00:26:50,978
Bye, then.

419
00:26:50,979 --> 00:26:52,279
- Thank you. - Sure.

420
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,079
Sorry.

421
00:26:59,388 --> 00:27:00,618
Oh, my gosh!

422
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:05,829
Look.

423
00:27:06,888 --> 00:27:07,888
What the...

424
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:11,098
He's a talented photographer.

425
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:18,937
Oh Joon Seo, that fool.

426
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,969
I totally see why he rushed off.

427
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:24,309
Delete it now.

428
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,708
What for? It's a humiliating shot of a celebrity.

429
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:28,378
I'll hand it down to my grandkids.

430
00:27:28,608 --> 00:27:29,647
Give that to me.

431
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,388
No. I'll look at it and laugh whenever I'm in a funk.

432
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:35,819
Our Dr. Brain is here.

433
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,088
Hello.

434
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:39,289
Dr. Brain, you're back!

435
00:27:40,088 --> 00:27:42,729
It's good to see you. I missed you.

436
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,968
I knew you'd help. Come and sit down.

437
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:47,769
Come into the meeting room.

438
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:51,069
The meeting will be more fun with you around.

439
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:52,709
Let's start!

440
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,579
I brought him back. It was me.

441
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:58,108
Don't they see me?

442
00:28:01,678 --> 00:28:03,348
Why am I at a police station?

443
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:07,719
Ho Young.

444
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:10,819
Where's my younger brother?

445
00:28:12,088 --> 00:28:14,028
He keeps asking about his brother...

446
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:15,959
and insists he's 17 years old.

447
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:19,499
Shall we first see if he's Reset Man?

448
00:28:28,168 --> 00:28:29,209
Where am I?

449
00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:35,209
A police station?

450
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:38,418
Why am I here?

451
00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:42,289
These people.

452
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:44,989
Who are they?

453
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:46,959
Policemen?

454
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:48,858
Mr. Kim?

455
00:28:49,598 --> 00:28:50,598
Who are you?

456
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:54,698
Hello.

457
00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:58,039
I'm Shin Ha Ru, a neuroscientist.

458
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:05,308
I'm Detective Geum Myung Se with Seobu Police Station's...

459
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:06,678
Neuroscientific Investigation Team.

460
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:14,789
Why am I at a police station?

461
00:29:15,858 --> 00:29:16,858
My brother.

462
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,819
Where's Ho Young?

463
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:21,388
Your brother's at home, safe and sound.

464
00:29:22,188 --> 00:29:25,098
We're investigating your mother's murder.

465
00:29:25,628 --> 00:29:26,628
My...

466
00:29:27,698 --> 00:29:28,698
My mom...

467
00:29:31,638 --> 00:29:33,009
She's dead?

468
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:10,739
Why am I here?

469
00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:16,749
My brother.

470
00:30:17,678 --> 00:30:18,719
Where's Ho Young?

471
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:22,888
Your brother's at home, safe and sound.

472
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,628
We're investigating your mother's murder.

473
00:30:27,588 --> 00:30:28,989
My mom...

474
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:32,928
Is my mom dead?

475
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:40,309
Yes.

476
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:42,269
Mr. Kim?

477
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,739
I need to take you somewhere.

478
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:48,108
(Korea National University Hospital)

479
00:31:00,428 --> 00:31:04,397
A large amount of hemosiderin accumulated in the hippocampus.

480
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:05,999
It's an old bleeding site.

481
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,928
He suffered brain damage and bled a long time ago.

482
00:31:09,838 --> 00:31:10,838
Then...

483
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:13,838
that must've caused his symptom.

484
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:16,877
Based on the symptoms we've seen so far,

485
00:31:16,878 --> 00:31:18,878
he seems to have anterograde amnesia.

486
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,248
It's a rare brain condition where after an accident...

487
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:22,448
new memories fail to form.

488
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,917
Time stopped for Mr. Kim...

489
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:27,447
some time when he was 17.

490
00:31:27,448 --> 00:31:29,088
He's been living in that period.

491
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:32,019
A lot like the main character of the movie "Memento."

492
00:31:40,229 --> 00:31:41,229
Take your time.

493
00:32:02,918 --> 00:32:03,918
A hospital?

494
00:32:07,128 --> 00:32:08,158
Why am I here?

495
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:17,039
He forgets everything every 30 minutes.

496
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,969
His memory remains at a certain point when he was 17.

497
00:32:20,469 --> 00:32:21,769
When he comes to,

498
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:24,309
his family members suddenly look different,

499
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:26,249
and he finds himself in unfamiliar settings.

500
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:29,219
This frightened you, and you refused to leave your room.

501
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:31,049
He became a reclusive loner.

502
00:32:31,979 --> 00:32:32,989
So,

503
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:37,088
did you really have no idea he had...

504
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:38,759
a memory issue?

505
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,489
I did think something was odd.

506
00:32:45,198 --> 00:32:47,198
He kept asking me how I'd grown so tall.

507
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:50,438
I didn't think he was sick.

508
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:53,938
Why didn't you take him to a doctor?

509
00:32:56,638 --> 00:32:58,009
I told Mom, but she said...

510
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:00,979
it couldn't be helped because he wouldn't leave home.

511
00:33:05,948 --> 00:33:07,848
Your brother's last memory...

512
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:09,919
is of you and your mom...

513
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:12,629
scolding him for missing a swimming lesson.

514
00:33:17,198 --> 00:33:19,428
Do you remember that incident.

515
00:33:22,098 --> 00:33:23,798
He got told off so many times...

516
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:25,839
for missing a swimming lesson.

517
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:36,848
Wouldn't it be the day you hurt the back of your hand?

518
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:39,488
I got this...

519
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:41,718
trying to cook ramyeon.

520
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:46,758
Around that time, was your brother...

521
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,629
hit on the head...

522
00:33:49,298 --> 00:33:50,559
or pushed into a wall?

523
00:33:54,428 --> 00:33:55,468
I don't know.

524
00:33:57,238 --> 00:33:58,238
I don't remember.

525
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:03,578
What was your brother's relationship with your mom like...

526
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:05,238
when he was 17?

527
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:08,609
It wasn't...

528
00:34:09,718 --> 00:34:10,979
great.

529
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:13,588
Joon Young was rebellious and...

530
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:14,618
She was a stepmother?

531
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,359
Yes.

532
00:34:22,698 --> 00:34:24,399
How did you two get on?

533
00:34:25,298 --> 00:34:26,298
Just fine.

534
00:34:28,968 --> 00:34:30,039
We were half-brothers,

535
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:32,399
but he was like a real brother to me.

536
00:34:35,008 --> 00:34:37,709
Ho Young, I'll ask you once more.

537
00:34:39,749 --> 00:34:42,408
That your brother had lost his memory.

538
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,218
Were you aware of it?

539
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:49,919
No.

540
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:52,859
I wasn't.

541
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:00,028
Liar.

542
00:35:01,198 --> 00:35:03,999
Based on Ho Young's nonverbal signals,

543
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:05,899
he's most likely lying.

544
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,438
Do you have to make it so fancy?

545
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,738
Anyone could tell he was lying.

546
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:16,548
He knew his brother could remember only the last 30 minutes...

547
00:35:16,678 --> 00:35:18,048
and pretended not to.

548
00:35:18,379 --> 00:35:19,388
Why?

549
00:35:20,388 --> 00:35:21,919
To frame his brother?

550
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:26,829
Because his brother can't remember what he did anyway.

551
00:35:28,129 --> 00:35:30,198
It makes him a perfect victim to frame.

552
00:35:30,899 --> 00:35:33,698
Wait. Doesn't it say somewhere they aren't full brothers?

553
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:35,729
They're half-brothers.

554
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,398
When Joon Young was ten, the victim...

555
00:35:38,399 --> 00:35:40,638
married his dad and brought her five-year-old son.

556
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:43,508
The suspect on camera is suspicious too.

557
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:48,309
He heads toward the house with zero hesitation.

558
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,118
An anterograde amnesiac whose memory resets every 30 minutes...

559
00:35:52,419 --> 00:35:55,648
who, on top of that, has never left home in five years?

560
00:35:55,649 --> 00:35:56,658
Could he do this?

561
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,728
He does seem more like the younger brother.

562
00:36:00,729 --> 00:36:02,728
He hasn't forgotten all his memories.

563
00:36:02,729 --> 00:36:03,959
He recognizes his brother.

564
00:36:04,598 --> 00:36:06,968
He'd remember the neighborhood if there wasn't much of a change.

565
00:36:08,868 --> 00:36:11,738
Here's the most important thing. What is the motive?

566
00:36:11,968 --> 00:36:14,808
As for Kim Joon Young, he didn't get along with his stepmother.

567
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:17,178
But Ho Young had no reason to kill his real mother.

568
00:36:17,908 --> 00:36:19,709
According to the neighbors...

569
00:36:20,448 --> 00:36:21,908
The lady who lives there...

570
00:36:22,678 --> 00:36:26,649
My gosh, she took such good care of her son.

571
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:30,388
She always tried so hard to get him to eat something.

572
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:34,388
If I were her, I'd just let him starve himself to death.

573
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,798
The younger one? He's very sweet.

574
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:40,468
He always greets the neighbors politely.

575
00:36:41,629 --> 00:36:42,839
My gosh.

576
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:46,839
Ms. Choi was very enthusiastic about her children's education.

577
00:36:47,568 --> 00:36:49,979
It's not easy to support professional swimmers as a parent,

578
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:52,178
but I never once saw her frown.

579
00:36:52,979 --> 00:36:54,348
And Ho Young always listened to his mother.

580
00:36:55,209 --> 00:36:56,979
That family's only worry...

581
00:36:58,318 --> 00:36:59,618
was Joon Young, Ho Young's brother.

582
00:37:00,789 --> 00:37:04,387
Kim Joon Young has a clearer motive than his brother does.

583
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,658
I believe it was probably Kim Joon Young.

584
00:37:06,888 --> 00:37:09,697
When he called it in, he referred to his stepmother as "that woman."

585
00:37:09,698 --> 00:37:11,198
That shows hostility.

586
00:37:14,028 --> 00:37:16,237
Due to his anterograde amnesia, Kim Joon Young...

587
00:37:16,238 --> 00:37:19,138
kept reminding himself of the bad memories of his mother.

588
00:37:19,669 --> 00:37:21,169
How much longer will you keep this up?

589
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:23,638
I can't take this anymore.

590
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,678
If you're going to keep this up, just die!

591
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:29,379
I don't need a son who does nothing but play video games!

592
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:35,749
You even skipped your dad's funeral to play video games. Who does that?

593
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:37,189
Just die!

594
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,558
The day before the incident, he was harshly scolded.

595
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:42,588
That probably triggered his pent-up anger and violent tendencies.

596
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:44,098
It can happen subconsciously.

597
00:37:44,798 --> 00:37:46,868
I agree with Captain Seul.

598
00:37:52,138 --> 00:37:54,968
Then why did he call it in? He didn't have to confess.

599
00:37:55,408 --> 00:37:57,178
He wanted to turn himself in before he forgot.

600
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:01,048
So he knows about his memory problems?

601
00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:03,019
I'm sure he has an idea.

602
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:06,218
Hold on.

603
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:08,218
It's odd.

604
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:11,289
The police received the call...

605
00:38:11,818 --> 00:38:13,589
at 6:29am.

606
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:16,258
We suspect that the incident took place at 5:30am,

607
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:18,959
which means the call was made about an hour after the incident.

608
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:23,237
The assailant's memory is reset every 30 minutes,

609
00:38:23,238 --> 00:38:25,238
so he shouldn't have any memory of the murder.

610
00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:27,068
How did he call it in?

611
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:32,609
We can't assume that he forgets everything every 30 minutes.

612
00:38:33,548 --> 00:38:34,809
I tested it.

613
00:38:35,109 --> 00:38:38,118
His memory resets every 30 minutes.

614
00:38:38,718 --> 00:38:40,749
Some memorable memories could stick around.

615
00:38:41,448 --> 00:38:44,758
That's right. The tests we ran weren't exactly memorable.

616
00:38:47,189 --> 00:38:49,289
Okay, fine.

617
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:52,498
Let's run another test to find out whether or not...

618
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:53,797
his memory resets every 30 minutes.

619
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,169
This time, we'll do something very memorable.

620
00:39:13,946 --> 00:39:15,417
Sorry we kept you waiting.

621
00:39:15,616 --> 00:39:18,087
My gosh. It's way past dinnertime.

622
00:39:18,227 --> 00:39:19,687
What do you feel like eating?

623
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:21,087
How about some short rib soup?

624
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,826
Sure, anything's fine.

625
00:39:24,256 --> 00:39:25,667
Okay. Short rib soup, it is.

626
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,377
All right. Here's your food.

627
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:42,917
Oh, wait.

628
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:47,886
Allow me to season your soup for you.

629
00:39:52,027 --> 00:39:53,127
Wait.

630
00:39:54,187 --> 00:39:55,497
It'll be too salty.

631
00:39:55,656 --> 00:39:57,556
Oh, I'm sorry.

632
00:39:57,756 --> 00:40:00,567
I should make it less salty for you.

633
00:40:00,897 --> 00:40:02,636
Hold on. Oh, boy.

634
00:40:05,306 --> 00:40:07,406
Gosh, here.

635
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:09,877
My goodness. It stinks.

636
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:12,006
I haven't gone home in three days.

637
00:40:12,306 --> 00:40:14,346
My, it's fermented to perfection.

638
00:40:15,317 --> 00:40:18,317
You see, this can do something very special.

639
00:40:22,216 --> 00:40:23,317
My, look at this.

640
00:40:24,116 --> 00:40:26,286
Nice. Soak it all up.

641
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:32,667
This fermented sock...

642
00:40:32,826 --> 00:40:35,536
will soak up all the salt.

643
00:40:37,036 --> 00:40:38,267
I should dunk it all the way in.

644
00:40:38,707 --> 00:40:41,636
Oh, my. This is perfect.

645
00:40:47,977 --> 00:40:51,017
What do you think of this test? Are you satisfied?

646
00:40:51,886 --> 00:40:54,687
Yes, it's certainly memorable.

647
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,156
My gosh.

648
00:40:57,716 --> 00:41:01,087
There. The salt is all gone now.

649
00:41:02,556 --> 00:41:03,627
Here.

650
00:41:04,966 --> 00:41:05,997
Eat up.

651
00:41:07,727 --> 00:41:08,937
Eat this?

652
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:12,567
How could you tell me to eat this?

653
00:41:13,207 --> 00:41:16,176
Right? It's not that appetizing.

654
00:41:22,846 --> 00:41:24,317
He must be starving right now.

655
00:41:25,946 --> 00:41:28,786
If he still won't eat it after 30 minutes, it means he remembers.

656
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:33,326
Then I'll admit that it was most likely him.

657
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:58,547
Eat up. You must be hungry.

658
00:42:54,707 --> 00:42:57,736
Joon Young, why did you do that?

659
00:43:19,326 --> 00:43:22,136
What's wrong? You don't have much of an appetite?

660
00:43:24,966 --> 00:43:26,006
No.

661
00:43:27,306 --> 00:43:29,977
See that? He remembers.

662
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,055
I'm sure he remembers what he saw.

663
00:43:49,056 --> 00:43:50,256
That's why he didn't eat the soup.

664
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:53,297
It's possible that he instinctively sensed danger.

665
00:43:53,527 --> 00:43:55,236
Did you not see the look on Detective Geum's face?

666
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:57,365
He was all nervous that Joon Young would actually eat it.

667
00:43:57,366 --> 00:43:59,437
He kept flaring his nostrils.

668
00:43:59,966 --> 00:44:02,536
He was practically telling him not to eat it.

669
00:44:03,036 --> 00:44:04,107
Dr. Shin.

670
00:44:04,777 --> 00:44:07,006
This is unlike you. Why are you forcing your opinion on me?

671
00:44:08,107 --> 00:44:11,715
What I mean is that we need evidence. Something more concrete.

672
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:13,416
The murder weapon, for example.

673
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,386
He doesn't remember what he did with it.

674
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,017
Then how about a witness?

675
00:44:18,457 --> 00:44:21,897
Okay, I brought someone important so that you two can stop fighting.

676
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:24,426
We found the witness in the security footage.

677
00:44:24,826 --> 00:44:25,866
Come on in.

678
00:44:28,937 --> 00:44:31,497
My gosh. Dr. Shin?

679
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:36,336
Oh, my. Dr. Shin, I'm a huge fan!

680
00:44:36,337 --> 00:44:37,437
Nice to meet you.

681
00:44:38,647 --> 00:44:40,707
Nice to meet you too, Ms. Witness.

682
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:42,846
He called me "Ms. Witness."

683
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,277
So cool. I feel like I'm in a movie.

684
00:44:46,786 --> 00:44:48,457
- Are you sure she's that witness? - Yes.

685
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:51,756
Can I take a picture with him later?

686
00:44:53,756 --> 00:44:56,457
Of course. Before that, there's something we have to do.

687
00:44:56,997 --> 00:44:58,096
Oh, sure.

688
00:45:06,366 --> 00:45:09,337
Yes, that's right. I remember him walking past me.

689
00:45:10,636 --> 00:45:12,676
Do you remember his face?

690
00:45:13,107 --> 00:45:14,805
I didn't get a good look at it.

691
00:45:14,806 --> 00:45:16,647
He had on a mask, and his cap was pulled low.

692
00:45:18,017 --> 00:45:20,116
Please tell us everything that you remember.

693
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:22,386
Well...

694
00:45:22,857 --> 00:45:23,986
He was wearing a grey hoodie...

695
00:45:24,486 --> 00:45:25,486
and was tall.

696
00:45:25,587 --> 00:45:27,087
Right. What else?

697
00:45:28,627 --> 00:45:29,627
Also...

698
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:33,667
That's it.

699
00:45:38,267 --> 00:45:40,167
All right, Ms. Big Fan of Mine.

700
00:45:42,377 --> 00:45:44,036
The footage shows...

701
00:45:44,777 --> 00:45:46,607
that you turned around as he passed you.

702
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:48,277
Why was that?

703
00:45:49,676 --> 00:45:50,676
I'm not sure.

704
00:45:51,377 --> 00:45:54,247
Something must've caught your eye. Maybe he was handsome.

705
00:45:54,846 --> 00:45:56,056
Couldn't that be the reason?

706
00:45:56,156 --> 00:45:58,826
No way. Never.

707
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:02,357
You're the only one I deem handsome.

708
00:46:05,366 --> 00:46:07,365
You know what is of high quality,

709
00:46:07,366 --> 00:46:08,837
so you must have good observation skills.

710
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:14,767
Here. Let's try that again.

711
00:46:15,877 --> 00:46:17,806
It could've been an odd behavior...

712
00:46:18,747 --> 00:46:20,547
or something you smelled.

713
00:46:23,946 --> 00:46:26,786
I did turn around for some reason.

714
00:46:29,256 --> 00:46:31,417
I'm sorry. I just can't remember why.

715
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:41,966
Could I perhaps try that thing?

716
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,517
You will now close your eyes.

717
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,056
Take a deep breath.

718
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,727
You will feel your body relaxing.

719
00:47:09,857 --> 00:47:11,156
Focus on your breathing.

720
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:19,306
Unbelievable.

721
00:47:19,906 --> 00:47:21,135
Never have I come across a witness...

722
00:47:21,136 --> 00:47:23,437
who suggested a hypnotic interview before.

723
00:47:24,636 --> 00:47:27,276
A rapport was built because she actively volunteered,

724
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:28,716
which led to successful hypnosis.

725
00:47:29,977 --> 00:47:31,576
The theta waves are already present.

726
00:47:38,357 --> 00:47:42,027
It's last Saturday, 5:55am.

727
00:47:43,357 --> 00:47:45,497
You were on your way to the bus stop...

728
00:47:46,067 --> 00:47:47,566
when you noticed you forgot your wallet,

729
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:49,465
which is why you were heading home.

730
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:51,036
Picture that moment.

731
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:05,277
From a distance, you see the suspect walking toward you.

732
00:48:08,047 --> 00:48:10,716
The suspect is now approaching you.

733
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:15,087
The suspect is now walking past you.

734
00:48:16,797 --> 00:48:20,127
When you have the clearest view of the suspect,

735
00:48:21,096 --> 00:48:23,297
freeze the scene.

736
00:48:23,636 --> 00:48:25,566
Take photos with your mind...

737
00:48:25,567 --> 00:48:27,966
and look at them closely.

738
00:48:30,076 --> 00:48:32,107
Please tell me in detail...

739
00:48:32,547 --> 00:48:33,877
what you see and feel.

740
00:48:36,616 --> 00:48:38,576
When I glanced at him,

741
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:41,747
he became conscious of that fact.

742
00:48:44,986 --> 00:48:48,556
He used his hand to adjust his mask.

743
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:55,636
I think it was to cover his face.

744
00:48:58,067 --> 00:49:02,306
Right. Keep telling me what you see.

745
00:49:04,377 --> 00:49:06,176
I see a stain.

746
00:49:08,306 --> 00:49:09,716
A colored stain.

747
00:49:12,446 --> 00:49:13,446
Blood.

748
00:49:15,556 --> 00:49:16,656
I think it's blood.

749
00:49:20,087 --> 00:49:22,056
I see blood everywhere.

750
00:49:32,366 --> 00:49:33,366
Also,

751
00:49:34,306 --> 00:49:35,306
the smell.

752
00:49:36,576 --> 00:49:38,777
I've always been sensitive to smell...

753
00:49:39,707 --> 00:49:42,076
and can't even walk past a fish stand.

754
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:46,846
I turned around to look at him because I smelled something.

755
00:49:48,957 --> 00:49:52,687
All right. Try to identify the smell.

756
00:49:54,926 --> 00:49:55,957
The smell of blood.

757
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:58,627
And...

758
00:50:01,366 --> 00:50:02,966
maybe a restroom?

759
00:50:04,897 --> 00:50:06,067
Alcohol?

760
00:50:08,777 --> 00:50:10,337
I can't say for sure.

761
00:50:12,247 --> 00:50:14,406
I don't know what it is, but it's not pleasant.

762
00:50:15,877 --> 00:50:17,676
It's not what I'd categorize as nice.

763
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:23,556
I can't breathe.

764
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:26,857
I'm scared.

765
00:50:28,687 --> 00:50:29,997
Something about him scares me.

766
00:50:30,297 --> 00:50:33,027
Calm your breathing. You're perfectly fine.

767
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:34,596
You are safe.

768
00:50:53,187 --> 00:50:54,886
An unpleasant smell?

769
00:50:55,446 --> 00:50:56,486
Something that scares her.

770
00:50:58,357 --> 00:51:00,087
It must be the smell of blood.

771
00:51:01,386 --> 00:51:03,227
It must've been Kim Joon Young.

772
00:51:10,797 --> 00:51:12,267
All right. One more.

773
00:51:13,466 --> 00:51:15,906
You both look great.

774
00:51:16,277 --> 00:51:18,377
No way. Thank you so much.

775
00:51:18,846 --> 00:51:19,946
I'd like to ask for a favor.

776
00:51:20,446 --> 00:51:21,805
If you remember...

777
00:51:21,806 --> 00:51:24,277
anything about the suspect, please call us.

778
00:51:24,547 --> 00:51:25,547
Sure.

779
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,547
- Have a good day. - Bye.

780
00:51:30,886 --> 00:51:31,886
Gosh.

781
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:33,986
Hey, Chief.

782
00:51:34,786 --> 00:51:36,055
Captain Seul said...

783
00:51:36,056 --> 00:51:38,326
that the witness didn't remember anything significant.

784
00:51:38,656 --> 00:51:39,727
Not really.

785
00:51:40,527 --> 00:51:43,837
Forget it, then. Nothing beats a confession anyway.

786
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,566
Don't drag this out...

787
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:47,006
and hand him over to the prosecution tomorrow.

788
00:51:53,647 --> 00:51:56,175
(Approachable and Friendly Police, Seobu Police Station)

789
00:51:56,176 --> 00:51:57,446
Do you feel remorse?

790
00:51:57,517 --> 00:51:58,646
What was your motive?

791
00:51:58,647 --> 00:52:00,086
Was she abusive?

792
00:52:00,087 --> 00:52:01,186
How do you feel right now?

793
00:52:01,187 --> 00:52:02,655
Why did you kill your mother?

794
00:52:02,656 --> 00:52:03,715
Please say a few words.

795
00:52:03,716 --> 00:52:05,485
- What was your motive? - Please say a few words.

796
00:52:05,486 --> 00:52:07,555
- How do you feel right now? - Move aside.

797
00:52:07,556 --> 00:52:08,956
- Please say a few words. - Look over here!

798
00:52:08,957 --> 00:52:11,027
- Over here! - Please answer the question.

799
00:52:11,297 --> 00:52:12,726
What was your motive?

800
00:52:12,727 --> 00:52:14,095
Please say a few words.

801
00:52:14,096 --> 00:52:15,326
Do you feel remorse?

802
00:52:15,837 --> 00:52:16,997
Please answer the question.

803
00:52:27,607 --> 00:52:29,977
Dr. Brain, why is this bothering you?

804
00:52:31,116 --> 00:52:32,215
A patient with a memory disorder...

805
00:52:32,216 --> 00:52:34,646
who hasn't been out of the house for five years...

806
00:52:34,647 --> 00:52:36,516
swiftly murdered his target,

807
00:52:36,517 --> 00:52:38,357
disposed of the evidence, and confessed.

808
00:52:39,486 --> 00:52:40,857
Do you believe it's possible?

809
00:52:41,286 --> 00:52:42,326
I'm not sure.

810
00:52:42,527 --> 00:52:45,727
But there isn't any evidence that proves otherwise.

811
00:52:47,426 --> 00:52:49,936
A drink is what you need at a time like this.

812
00:52:49,937 --> 00:52:51,366
Hey, it's a Saturday.

813
00:52:51,567 --> 00:52:54,006
How about we both grab a shot of malt whiskey?

814
00:52:54,736 --> 00:52:56,877
Grab the drink with Captain Seul instead.

815
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,207
That reminds me.

816
00:52:58,477 --> 00:53:00,905
That preposterous love confession tactic of yours...

817
00:53:00,906 --> 00:53:02,445
almost got me killed.

818
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:04,646
She told me how she felt at the peak of a mountain,

819
00:53:04,647 --> 00:53:06,216
and I fell backward.

820
00:53:06,386 --> 00:53:08,385
I almost fell off a cliff and died.

821
00:53:08,386 --> 00:53:09,386
A cliff?

822
00:53:10,216 --> 00:53:11,417
Why are you in one piece, then?

823
00:53:11,687 --> 00:53:13,985
Thankfully, there was a rock underneath.

824
00:53:13,986 --> 00:53:15,386
I was scared out of my wits.

825
00:53:15,756 --> 00:53:18,696
What a bummer. I could've gotten rid of you.

826
00:53:21,227 --> 00:53:22,566
Look here, Dr. Brain.

827
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:25,067
I bet you gave her that advice just to get rid of me.

828
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:29,436
Taking one's good intentions and interpreting them as bad.

829
00:53:29,437 --> 00:53:32,846
You just proved you have a brain that is packed with low self-esteem.

830
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:35,846
(Neuroscientific Investigation Team)

831
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:38,377
You gave her the advice for my sake?

832
00:53:40,286 --> 00:53:41,286
Of course not.

833
00:53:41,517 --> 00:53:44,216
It was for Captain Seul's sake.

834
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:48,857
Captain Seul came to you for advice?

835
00:53:49,056 --> 00:53:51,296
I'm quick to notice things,

836
00:53:51,297 --> 00:53:52,366
so I figured it out.

837
00:53:52,727 --> 00:53:54,666
Although, why she likes you...

838
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:55,897
is worth being studied.

839
00:53:58,236 --> 00:53:59,866
She says it's the smell.

840
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:01,837
The smell?

841
00:54:02,636 --> 00:54:04,707
The smell of warmth or something.

842
00:54:05,176 --> 00:54:07,776
When she was at the hospital,

843
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:09,517
I took care of her a bit.

844
00:54:20,926 --> 00:54:23,457
She remembers the smell from back then.

845
00:54:23,756 --> 00:54:25,595
Is she the girl who sees scents?

846
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,366
I don't know if I should believe it.

847
00:54:27,826 --> 00:54:30,536
It's possible. Our brains...

848
00:54:30,866 --> 00:54:32,336
process the sense of smell...

849
00:54:32,337 --> 00:54:34,607
somewhat differently compared to other senses.

850
00:54:34,837 --> 00:54:37,135
Vision, the sense of hearing, touch, and other senses...

851
00:54:37,136 --> 00:54:40,206
pass through the thalamus first before being transmitted...

852
00:54:40,207 --> 00:54:42,176
to the cerebrum.

853
00:54:49,357 --> 00:54:51,485
Let's say that your hand comes into contact with hot water.

854
00:54:51,486 --> 00:54:53,726
The information is given to the thalamus,

855
00:54:53,727 --> 00:54:55,555
which then tells your brain...

856
00:54:55,556 --> 00:54:58,596
that it's hot, that it hurts, and that you should take your hand out.

857
00:54:59,027 --> 00:55:00,027
Gosh, it's hot!

858
00:55:03,536 --> 00:55:05,836
But smells go straight...

859
00:55:05,837 --> 00:55:08,806
to the part of the brain that handles emotions and memories.

860
00:55:09,207 --> 00:55:11,276
That's why a certain smell...

861
00:55:11,277 --> 00:55:14,305
elicits related emotions or memories...

862
00:55:14,306 --> 00:55:16,346
and makes people do certain things.

863
00:55:16,917 --> 00:55:20,445
For example, in "Parasite," whenever Lee Sun Kyun...

864
00:55:20,446 --> 00:55:22,755
smells poverty on Song Kang Ho,

865
00:55:22,756 --> 00:55:24,817
he grimaces subconsciously.

866
00:55:24,986 --> 00:55:27,527
That action causes the mad killing spree...

867
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,437
I thought of a way to identify...

868
00:55:40,506 --> 00:55:41,667
the real killer.

869
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:55,857
Do your best, then.

870
00:55:56,116 --> 00:55:57,156
Okay.

871
00:56:12,397 --> 00:56:13,437
Okay, then.

872
00:56:16,977 --> 00:56:20,607
The culprit is walking past you.

873
00:56:22,477 --> 00:56:24,876
You smell something,

874
00:56:24,877 --> 00:56:27,047
and it makes you turn to look.

875
00:56:36,497 --> 00:56:39,227
That's right. A smell.

876
00:56:41,426 --> 00:56:42,997
That man...

877
00:56:44,036 --> 00:56:45,596
smelled of something.

878
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:48,107
What smell was it?

879
00:56:51,076 --> 00:56:52,207
I'm not sure.

880
00:56:55,576 --> 00:56:57,176
What smell is this?

881
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:01,446
What's this smell?

882
00:57:04,386 --> 00:57:05,926
I don't know.

883
00:57:11,527 --> 00:57:14,267
Is this the smell?

884
00:57:15,897 --> 00:57:18,236
Yes. It's this smell.

885
00:57:42,527 --> 00:57:43,756
The smell of water.

886
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,096
The smell of bleach.

887
00:57:48,727 --> 00:57:50,067
A swimming pool.

888
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:54,036
I smelled a swimming pool. That's it.

889
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:01,877
Okay, then.

890
00:58:02,977 --> 00:58:06,316
Think of the appearance of the culprit who walked past...

891
00:58:06,317 --> 00:58:08,647
smelling of a swimming pool.

892
00:58:19,027 --> 00:58:20,997
On the back of his hand.

893
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:24,997
There's blood.

894
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,366
And...

895
00:58:39,817 --> 00:58:41,317
There's a scar.

896
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:58,397
The smell of a pool.

897
00:58:59,366 --> 00:59:00,636
The scar on the back of the hand.

898
00:59:02,136 --> 00:59:03,576
The killer's the younger brother...
