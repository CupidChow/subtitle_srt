11
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,189
No, I'm not at Gimpo. I'm at El Dorado.

00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,235
Yeah, this place is really far.

Look over there.
They're beating people up.

19

No!

20
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,108
It looks like there's been an accident.

21

- You should ask first!

35
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,719
- You'll scratch it!
- Eat shit and die, asshole!

36
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:40,887

- Yeah.

183
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,942

184
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,235

185
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,278
Hit me.

After the military,
I took every penny I saved in Vietnam,

00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,920
went to Pyeonghwa Market
to buy all the lingerie,

201

and brought them all to Colombia.

- My friend!

Yes, the lingerie.

215
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,838
At first, I was selling it
on the streets around Medellín.

216
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,049
But the local bastards
would follow me around,

217
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,595
grinning and singing whenever I walked by
with my bundle on my back.

358
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,616
<i>Little Park. He bought a club in the city.</i>

359
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:57,913
You need to get on his good side.
Little Park owns three shops.

360
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:02,209
He's got three shops and three lovers.
And they're all local girls.

361
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,586
I heard your club in the city
is doing well.

362
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,130
If it's Korean-style,
I'd be curious to see it.

363
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,799
You're so curious
about everything at your age.

364
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,093
- Jae-ung, bring a chair.
- A chair?

365
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,179
Hey, have a seat.

366
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,306
Let me pour you one.

367
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,810
- Just drop by sometime.
- Okay.

368
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,647
These are my fellow
Korea University alums.

369
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,023
Hello.

370
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:28,652
They've got it good,
living it up here as exchange students.

371
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,070
Hey, that's right!

372
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,364
As of today,
you're a Korea University alum.

373
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,449
All right!

374
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,661
- What are you doing?
- Korea University!

375
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,996
<i>Soo-young, a Korea University grad,</i>

376
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,791
<i>said he came to Bogotá</i>
<i>as an expat for Daewoo Motors.</i>

377
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,293
<i>When Korea's IMF crisis</i>
<i>shut down the expat branch,</i>

378
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,505
<i>he started helping Sergeant Park</i>
<i>with customs and settled here.</i>

379
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,006
Call me bro from now on.

380
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:54,261
Are you fucking kidding me?
"Bro"? The kid barely knows you.

381
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,930
What is this, a reunion?

382
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,266
Why did you bring all your lackeys?

383
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,393
By the way, listen up, all of you.

384
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,604
Cause a scene in my club again,
and you're dead.

385
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,941
These poor students left home
to study so far away.

386
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:11,069
They can come to Korean gatherings, right?
They don't even eat much.

387
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,070
Go back and dig in.

388
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,699
All right, fine.
You take care of your fellow countrymen.

389
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,243
Keep them in line when they're drinking.

390
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,120
"Keep them in line"?

391
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,831
Right, keep them in line.

392
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,836
Little Park, you sent this kid
to keep me in line, didn't you?

393
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,214
If you don't fucking trust me,
come do it yourself, Lil' Peck.

394
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,508
You're always up my fucking ass.

395
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,302
What the fuck? "Lil' Peck"?

396
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,846
- Sorry about that.
- How dare you talk to me like that!

397
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,180
- How old are you?
- Sorry.

398
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,390
- Come on.
- Why push him?

399
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,766
- Sit down.
- Come here!

400
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,810
- What?
- Hey! Seriously, sit down.

401
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,271
You fuckers are pissing me off,
for fuck's sake!

402
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,320
Why not flip the table?

403
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,447
That bastard Soo-young started it!

404
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,115
Go home, all of you.

405
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:58,950
Let's wrap it up.

406
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,205
Well?

407
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,291
Turn the music off!

408
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,418
For fuck's sake.

409
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,049
Call me Uncle from now on.

410
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,592
Pardon?

411
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:16,926
It's okay.

412
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,597
Your father and I were once comrades
who shed blood together.

413
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,433
I will later, boss.

414
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,145
Sure.

415
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,398
No rush.

416
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:37,322
In Buddhism,
there's a concept called the "Six Paths."

417
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,950
It means all beings cycle
through the six worlds,

418
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,204
from the lowest on the ground
to the highest in the sky,

419
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,373
based on their karma.

420
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,377
And this country
is the embodiment of that.

421
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,090
From Zone 1, where you live,
to Zones 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

422
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,843
Right now, we're in Zone 6.

423
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,347
Only the rich live here.

424
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,768
Do you drink?

425
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:08,728
Yes.

426
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,945
But to climb all the way up here,

427
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,822
you need more.

428
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,491
Just blindly working hard isn't enough.

429
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,243
You know that, right?

430
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,091
Very well.

431
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:43,096
Dear nephew, I want you to survive
and make it all the way

432
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,889
here to Zone 6.

433
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:56,443
<i>That day, for the first time,</i>
<i>I didn't want to go back to Korea.</i>

434
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,626
Let's get moving!

435
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,545
What the fuck? Hurry up!

436
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,885
See you, JP.

437
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,642
- Evening!
- Hey, wow.

438
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,398
- I missed you, my friend.
- Yeah.

439
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:40,820
<i>As the scale of the smuggling grew</i>
<i>and the number of trucks increased,</i>

440
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,323
<i>our wallets got fatter too.</i>

441
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,017
- Pass.
- Come on, count it as a goal.

442
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,519
There, you got it.

443
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,562
Yeah!

444
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:21,569
Ahn Jung-hwan!

445
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,779
What are you doing?

446
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,030
Ahn Jung-hwan!

447
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,616
SOUTH KOREA ADVANCES TO THE SEMIFINALS

448
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,117
They'll have it next month.

449
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,619
Thank you.

450
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,831
Okay, let's go get a drink.

451
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,332
Sounds good.

452
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,626
- Hey, good work.
- Stop! Don't touch my hair.

453
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,752
- Good work.
- Don't!

454
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:41,005
Why not?
I'm saying you did a good job. Hey!

455
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,466
Don't spray that at me, you little shit!

456
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,018
What's your name?

457
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,103
Carla.

458
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,438
- Kook-hee.
- Cookie?

459
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,357
- Jump!
- Jump!

460
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,659
Look at that! Isn't it nice?

461
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,537
Right? It's heaven!

462
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,672
Hey, isn't that Kook-hee?

463
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,801
Why's he with that group?

464
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:32,348
Why else? That fucker Soo-young
is keeping him close.

465
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,770
As for Soo-young,
he handles the customs work for Mr. Park.

466
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,900
There are many eyes on him,
so it's awkward for him to get involved.

467
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,069
- Right? Kook-hee.
- Yeah?

468
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,238
This is my first business,

469
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,782
so please help me out.

470
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:50,950
You get me, right?

471
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,827
Get what, Jae-ung?

472
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,496
See if you can do it
without Sergeant Park's help.

473
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,335
Come on, that's just not true.

474
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,088
We can manage
without Sergeant Park's help.

475
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,549
Besides, this is…

476
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,428
Hey.

477
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,972
This is Soo-young's plan.

478
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,349
Don't you know him?

479
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,232
You'll need to get your own shop too.

480
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,943
How long are you going to carry on

481
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,528
being someone else's errand boy?

482
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,163
Jae-ung.

483
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,458
How long do you think
I'll be an errand boy?

484
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,794
Huh? How long?

485
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:45,880
Errand boy, my ass.

486
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,478
Okay.

487
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,532
Fuck you.

488
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,576
- Piss off.
- Who do you think you are?

489
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,620
- What, fucker? Son of a bitch!
- What?

490
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,039
You motherfucker.

491
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,754
Don't worry about me.
Worry about yourself.

492
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,381
Well, I'm just trying to…

493
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,009
What's going on?

494
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,680
Sang-mook!

495
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,391
Stop, you dog!

496
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,559
You son of a bitch!

497
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,519
- What's going on?
- Stop.

498
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,687
Out of my way, damn it.

499
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,313
Come here, you bastard.

500
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,567
Come at me!
I'll kill you all, you sons of bitches!

501
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,986
Let go!

502
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,655
You motherfucker!

503
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,168
Jae-ung! Hey, you son of a bitch!

504
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,670
Fuck.

505
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,600
Shut up, everybody. Damn it.

506
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,518
Shut up, everybody.

507
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,105
I said shut up, everybody!

508
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,908
Hey, what's going on?
What's with this fucked-up situation?

509
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,459
It's an unloaded gun?

510
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,544
Jesus Christ.

511
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,720
Why don't you ask the bastard
who started this fucked-up situation?

512
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,229
Llama .38.

513
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,690
This should be
in a police officer's holster.

514
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:13,111
Why was he waving it around?

515
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,449
You're here.

516
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,577
Man, you fucking morons.

517
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,996
Seriously, you guys
have really embarrassed me.

518
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,457
Also, you get into a fight

519
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,043
only to get beaten up?

520
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,838
Here, this will help you shit better.

521
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,257
It's good for the kidneys
and stops gray hair too.

522
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,341
Wow!

523
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,343
It isn't booze, then. It's medicine.

524
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,762
Are you really going to sell these?

525
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:43,349
This country has spring weather
365 days a year.

526
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,892
How can you sell down parkas?

527
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,895
Exactly, it's like selling heaters
in the Tatacoa Desert

528
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,814
and refrigerators in the South Pole.

529
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,983
Have you ever been to a desert?

530
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,485
- Have you been to Tatacoa?
- Not yet.

531
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,571
The desert becomes freezing at night.

532
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,488
I see.

533
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,531
And the South Pole?

534
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,576
Do people only eat frozen food there,
not refrigerated food?

535
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,911
A refrigerator's key part
is its cooling section.

536
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,496
Cold feels way colder in spring.

537
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,165
It's like reverse thinking, right?

538
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,374
Oh! That's right!

539
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,918
Sergeant Park just sells stuff.

540
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,004
What I'm selling is a new concept.

541
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,672
A new fucking concept.

542
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,258
Look at this.
It's light, and it looks cool, right?

543
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,593
These will sell for sure.

544
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,886
Hey, you bastard!

545
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,763
Don't touch that. It's valuable.

546
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,186
You don't get to sit either!

547
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,148
Sit.

548
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,654
You can easily hire a <i>sicario</i>
for 100,000 won in this country.

549
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,072
Why'd you pull a gun?

550
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,700
Because we're in Colombia.

551
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,873
I wish you guys were even
half as good as Kook-hee.

552
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,668
You're always saying
Kook-hee this, Kook-hee that.

553
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,046
But honestly,
I'm two years older than him,

554
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,423
and when you keep comparing me to him,

555
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,176
it really hurts my feelings, you know.

556
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,845
Soo-young, Kook-hee's younger than me,

557
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,055
but he speaks unclearly,

558
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,224
sometimes using honorifics
and sometimes not,

559
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,850
which really annoys me.

560
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,229
But he's not a bad person or anything.

561
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:24,116
I was told to return this to you.
He said you'd understand.

562
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,338
Hey, have a drink too.

563
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,967
Helps you shit better,
boosts stamina, and stops graying.

564
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,557
Kid, do you trust Park Jang-su?

565
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,688
Cuca!

566
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,733
<i>La cucaracha, la cucaracha</i>

567
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,611
<i>Di-ri-ri-ri</i>

568
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,655
That's what everybody calls him.

569
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:11,289
Hey, did he also tell you that story
about how he smuggled panties in blankets?

570
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,626
Fuck, man. It's all lies.

571
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,046
<i>He went to Peru as a chicken sexer,</i>

572
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,133
<i>landed himself in trouble,</i>
<i>and ended up in Colombia.</i>

573
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,677
Have you ever heard of anyone

574
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,680
who started out working
under Park Jang-su and succeeded?

575
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:28,597
No one.

576
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,018
First, he gives you his trust,
then he uses you.

577
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,396
Once you're no longer useful,
you're nothing to him.

578
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:39,900
Hey, Kook-hee.

579
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,404
Why do you care so much about him, Uncle?

580
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:44,989
Let's be real.

581
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,742
He wants to sell parkas here.
You think that'll work?

582
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,826
In South America?

583
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,830
This is why you're so thick.

584
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,708
- What do you mean?
- Why wouldn't they sell?

585
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,127
They're light, warm, stylish, and new.

586
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,545
Aren't they?

587
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,715
Look at the way you're dressed.

588
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,802
What would you know about fashion?
All you know is women's panties.

589
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,804
Anyway,

590
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:13,142
if we seize
that bastard Soo-young's first shipment,

591
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,811
he won't be able to react immediately.

592
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,146
Is that it?

593
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,441
Meanwhile,
we target Soo-young's factory in China,

594
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,568
outbid him, and take over.

595
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:23,611
Okay.

596
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,240
<i>You think you can make it out of Zone 1?</i>

597
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,619
No, you never will.

598
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,288
By the way,

599
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,291
why did you send Kook-hee to Soo-young?

600
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,338
We gotta test him.

601
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,673
Test Soo-young?

602
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,634
No, Kook-hee.

603
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:52,890
Kook-hee? Why?

604
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,854
Soo-young will have to get his goods
to Bogotá somehow.

605
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,233
So who do you think
he'll try to lure to his side?

606
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,698
You don't trust Kook-hee, do you?

607
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,285
You actually trust people?

608
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:14,787
Me?

609
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,747
I trust you, Uncle.

610
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,000
- You trust me?
- Shit yeah. Amen.

611
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,794
Oh my, I'm so grateful.

612
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,713
Fucking bullshit.
You're better off fooling a corpse, punk.

613
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,716
Hey, yeah.

614
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,053
So did you return the package?

615
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:31,971
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

616
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,099
And Soo-young didn't say much?

617
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,810
<i>He asked me if I trust you, boss.</i>

618
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,646
Come on, I told you to call me Uncle.

619
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,107
So?

620
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,775
Do you trust me?

621
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,571
I said I can put food on the table,
thanks to you.

622
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,239
<i>Anything else?</i>

623
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,075
<i>No, nothing else.</i>

624
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:54,785
Nothing else?

625
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:58,747
<i>You hold on to this.</i>

626
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,712
It'll come in handy someday.

627
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,883
<i>This is Colombia, after all.</i>

628
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,938
That bastard Soo-young will mix his goods
with ours at customs this time.

629
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,900
They'll be the boxes
with the orange stickers.

630
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,279
<i>Kook-hee, your job is to bring them to me.</i>

631
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,450
Can I make you a proposition?

632
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,249
<i>Remember. The orange stickers.</i>

633
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:49,798
Here.

634
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,366
<i>Oh, Miguel.</i>

635
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,495
<i>If Kook-hee takes off</i>
<i>with one of the trucks, turn a blind eye.</i>

636
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,707
Because Soo-young's goods
have blue stickers.

637
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,045
<i>The orange stickers aren't important.</i>

638
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,180
He'll test you.

639
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:40,349
You don't trust Kook-hee, do you?

640
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,810
You actually trust people?

641
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,689
Fuck that. Who can be trusted?

642
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,315
Have I ever told you to trust me?

643
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,734
Just trust yourself.

644
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,831
You fucking bastard!

645
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:04,832
Son of bitches.

646
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,625
What the hell are you doing?

647
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,299
Soo-young.

648
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,510
Kook-hee!

649
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,515
Shit, man.

650
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,183
Good work.

651
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:24,810
Okay? Good work.

652
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,230
- It's hot, isn't it?
- Hey, good job.

653
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:32,234
Damn it. There's more left.

654
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,365
<i>Soo-young was right.</i>

655
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,993
<i>The business was a hit,</i>

656
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,370
<i>and the locals were excited</i>
<i>by its novelty.</i>

657
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,373
Thank you.

658
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:51,211
<i>Colombians started selling</i>
<i>duck down parkas too.</i>

659
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,256
<i>But their quality was no match.</i>

660
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:56,925
Well, it's nothing special.

661
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,344
<i>Soo-young was smart.</i>

662
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:02,014
<i>For reliable smuggling,</i>
<i>he needed connections in customs,</i>

663
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,266
<i>so he gave Sergeant Park a large cut.</i>

664
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,684
SIX PATHS CEO PARK JANG-SU

665
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,771
<i>Sergeant Park had no reason</i>
<i>to decline the offer.</i>

666
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,274
Mr. Park is here.

667
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,277
<i>Awkward situations were unavoidable…</i>

668
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,195
Hey, Kook-hee.

669
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,741
<i>…but money made people forget.</i>

670
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,537
<i>Just as they smuggled in goods,</i>

671
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,373
<i>Koreans smuggled out money.</i>

672
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:33,212
<i>Unreported money was continuously sent</i>
<i>to their homeland.</i>

673
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,300
<i>The money was laundered through Hong Kong,</i>

674
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,636
<i>then China,</i>

675
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,138
<i>and finally Korea.</i>

676
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,520
<i>Money equaled peace.</i>

677
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,531
<i>I bought a new house in Zone 3…</i>

678
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,034
<i>but this is just the beginning.</i>

679
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,953
It's okay, Mom. This is our house.

680
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:07,705
<i>Soo-young said</i>

681
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,749
<i>we should go see the ocean.</i>

CARTAGENA

683
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,428
Let's go!

684
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,016
Three, two, one!

685
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,320
Hey, are you jealous?

686
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:41,905
What?

687
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,242
During the IMF crisis,
many kids went home broke,

688
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:48,537
but these bastards are lucky
to have rich parents and are living it up.

689
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,956
They say rich kids have a glow about them,

690
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,000
but why do they look so dull?

691
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,296
Give me your hand.

692
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,798
- Huh?
- Your hand.

693
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,053
- Did you see the first <i>James Bond </i>movie?
- No.

694
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,432
This is the watch
Sean Connery has worn since then.

695
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,726
A Rolex Submariner.

696
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:12,561
Dope, right?

697
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,188
What is this?

698
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,815
Is it for me? It looks expensive.

699
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,735
That's why I'm giving it to you.
Would I give you cheap crap?

700
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,905
This is nice!

701
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,785
Hey, Soo-young.

702
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,870
I've been wondering for a while.

703
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,414
Why didn't you go back to Korea?

704
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,292
Why would I go back?

705
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,795
If I did, I'd obviously end up a nobody.

706
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,589
But man, look at this place.

707
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,548
This place

708
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,511
is fucking overflowing with life, yeah?

709
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,846
This is the land of opportunity.

710
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,515
What's your dream?

711
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,392
Why would I have one?

712
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,602
Well, my dream

713
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,898
is to build a fucking amazing
shopping mall here in Colombia.

714
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,359
One that South Americans go crazy for.

715
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,613
What? You don't believe I can do it?

716
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:09,284
Did you think I'd smuggle
duck down parkas forever, huh?

717
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,078
No, I believe in you.

718
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:12,871
Really, I do.

719
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:17,543
Could you let me be
a part of that dream of yours?

720
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,336
- Boss?
- You punk, get off me.

721
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,422
- Of course. Sounds great.
- Great.

722
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,968
A shopping mall sounds great.

723
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,637
Hey, years ago, our chairman said this,

724
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,808
"It's a big world,
and there's lots of shit to be done."

725
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:37,604
A long time ago, someone told me
that's why Daewoo went under.

726
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,148
And I'm so thankful they did.
Fucking Daewoo.

727
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,113
Thanks for that!

728
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,783
This isn't right.
They crossed the line this time!

729
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,287
If we don't get our shit together,

730
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,790
these rats will completely
take over the market!

731
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:01,670
But they're kind and work hard,
and I don't think this is my problem.

732
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,630
They're not like that at all.

733
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,923
They're full of tricks,

734
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,342
always ready to stab you
in the back at any moment.

735
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:12,055
I think you're slandering
perfectly fine folks.

736
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,516
Don't forget that you're a smuggler too.

737
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,769
No, you're wrong, Carlos.

738
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,772
We spend what we earn in this country.

739
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,859
But they're sending their money
back to Korea.

740
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,695
Let's think about it.

741
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,115
Expect a bigger cut this Christmas.

742
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,413
All right.

743
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,415
You can afford to laugh.

744
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,016
Perez! How have you been?
Working hard, my man.

745
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:57,559
Drink these.

746
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,311
Don't come any closer.

747
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:02,522
What's going on?

748
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:07,903
What's up with him?

749
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:08,820
Perez!

750
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:10,989
What's happening?

751
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:13,951
Perez.

752
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,410
Hey!

753
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:16,828
Calm down. Take it easy!

754
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,414
Lower your guns, and let's talk.

755
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,707
- Arrest them.
- Aim.

756
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,042
What's with you guys?

757
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,271
Get inside! Hurry!

758
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,578
Control stand 6-0-7.

759
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,247
I repeat, control stand 6-0-7.

760
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:15,512
What do you mean it was seized?

761
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,222
Hey, please calm down.

762
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,932
- Calm down?
- Those sons of bitches.

763
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,643
Christmas is in less than ten days!

764
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,395
- What do we sell?
- It's peak season.

765
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:24,521
- Move!
- Please stop.

766
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:27,149
If we miss the holidays, we're done!
You know that!

767
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,070
- What are we gonna do?
- Come on.

768
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,406
- Contact him now!
- Take responsibility!

769
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,995
Why would Carlos suddenly do this?

770
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,540
When we played poker last week,

771
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,917
we let him win,
and everything seemed great.

772
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:49,755
Hey, Jeon Soo-young.

773
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,382
Do you know anything?

774
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,802
What would I know?

775
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,679
Are you suspicious of me?

776
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,557
They seized two full containers
of my goods!

777
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,017
That's worth 400 million won!

778
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,603
All right.
I'm just frustrated. That's all.

779
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,688
Isn't dealing with the higher-ups
your job?

780
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:07,981
Why blame me? Damn it!

781
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,192
I've had enough of you, punk.

782
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,070
You think you're a big shot now, huh?

783
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,030
You expanded too aggressively!

784
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:18,450
My life's on the line every time!
What do you do in the back room?

785
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,120
What the hell are you doing?

786
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,915
Shut your traps.

787
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,376
From now on,
only speak if you have a plan.

788
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,807
Any ideas?

789
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:44,810
Cúcuta.

790
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:49,898
What about Cúcuta?

791
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:54,861
Since Venezuela is overflowing
with smuggled goods,

792
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,573
if we could just get to Cúcuta…

793
00:51:58,657 --> 00:51:59,741
Hey, you're right.

794
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,994
If we reach Cúcuta,
we can get goods from Venezuela, right?

795
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,455
They won't be Korean goods,

796
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,916
but it should tide us over
until we fix this, right?

797
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,292
Who's gonna go there?

798
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,795
Who's gonna go into rebel territory?

799
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:15,549
I heard the place is full of armed rebels.

800
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,102
I don't know if this is the right call.

801
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,728
You got another plan?

802
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,525
Jesus.

803
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,236
What a fucked-up situation.

804
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,532
I put in 200 million won, bro.

805
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,535
That's everything I've got.

806
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:46,955
Without it, I'm dead.

807
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:50,417
Yeah.

808
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,085
It's all there.

809
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:57,883
All right.

810
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,719
Rebels aren't what they used to be.

811
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,889
Then why don't you go with him, Mr. Park?

812
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:04,806
Yeah.

813
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:09,311
It is dangerous for him to go
on his own with all that cash.

814
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,634
Mom! What's--

815
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:58,151
For fuck's sake.
This is what you're resorting to now?

816
00:53:58,735 --> 00:53:59,736
Give me that.

817
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,867
You can… always start over.

818
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,160
So that thing…

819
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,496
- Give it to me.
- Give you what?

820
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,331
Just give it to me, Kook-hee!

821
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,084
I know about it, too, so…

822
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,128
Where is it?

823
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,260
- Kook-hee.
- Put it down.

824
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,136
Put it down. For fuck's sake!

825
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,847
Let go! Put it down!

826
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,015
- Kook-hee.
- Let go!

827
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,102
- What are you doing?
- Kook-hee, give it to me, please!

828
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:34,062
- Just give it to me!
- Put it down!

829
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,964
Shit, why did you shoot?

830
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:03,466
If we get caught, it's your fault!

831
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:09,639
Out of my way!

832
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,065
Damn it!

833
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,403
Kook-hee.

834
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,377
Father.

835
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,170
My money.

836
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,801
- My money.
- Father, you're bleeding.

837
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:30,595
Fucking Colombia.

838
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,517
- Colombia.
- Don't talk.

839
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,185
I said don't talk! Fuck!

840
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:45,902
Father.

841
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,529
I'm tired.

842
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,239
Kook-hee.

843
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:51,783
Father.

844
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:07,966
For fuck's sake.

845
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,014
Father!

846
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:18,852
<i>Father!</i>

847
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,243
Hey, you…

848
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:36,911
Come on, don't.

849
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:38,955
Kook-hee.

850
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,212
I know this isn't

851
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,591
the best time to bring this up…

852
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,179
but what about the money?

853
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,725
I'll pay you back, sir.

854
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,777
What are you going to do about this?

855
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:14,949
We can't even open for business,
and now you've lost our remaining money.

856
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,951
What are you going to do?

857
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,080
I'll pay you back.

858
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,960
How the fuck are you going to pay us back?

859
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:30,215
What? Let go, damn it!
I just said what we're all thinking!

860
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,925
I'll pay you back.

861
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,969
I said I'd fucking pay you back!

862
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,429
Let go!

863
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,431
My money!

864
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:41,267
Let go.

865
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,980
It's everything we had!

866
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,359
I'm sorry. I'll pay you back.

867
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,946
I'll pay you back.

868
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,548
Take this and go.

869
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,383
Somewhere. Anywhere.

870
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:15,426
Where would I go?

871
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,846
My shop's here. I'm staying.

872
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,390
You stupid idiot.

873
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,642
Someone could shoot you at any moment.

874
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,143
What are you gonna do about it?

875
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,439
Those fucking customs bastards.

876
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,317
Handing all our goods over to Alejandro…

877
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:33,903
What did you say?

878
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:41,619
Customs did what?

879
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,665
What did customs do?

880
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,628
Damn it.

881
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,381
They handed over all our goods.

882
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:57,594
<i>They seized our goods</i>
<i>and sent them to Alejandro's warehouse.</i>

883
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,179
<i>Colombian merchants will get them</i>
<i>before Christmas.</i>

884
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,140
To shut down Korean businesses.

885
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,683
Get out of here.

886
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,394
It's how you'll survive.

887
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,399
Damn it.

888
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,411
- No!
- This shit!

889
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:25,038
No.

890
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,206
No, son of a bitch! Fuck!

891
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,125
Don't forget my 50,000 pesos!

892
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:32,045
Calm down, you fat fuck.
It's just getting interesting.

893
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:52,774
Who are you?

894
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:54,192
What's up?

895
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:57,612
Are you deaf?

896
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,531
I asked you a question!

897
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,577
I came to get the goods.

898
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:08,289
"The goods"?

899
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,959
Isn't it tomorrow?

900
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:16,297
You know…

901
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:21,469
You know how impatient the boss is.

902
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:23,388
Then you should've called first.

903
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:26,015
You take us for fools?

904
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,602
- Look, buddy.
- Forget it.

905
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:33,564
Alejandro is being a bitch.

906
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:40,738
Alejandro really is a fucking prick.

907
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,242
- Thanks for the smokes.
- Yeah.

908
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,369
But I still need to check.

909
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,427
He's so damn loud.

910
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:05,513
No answer.

911
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:08,015
I'm busy. Let's make it quick.

912
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,977
You're the first one here?

913
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,896
What about the other trucks?

914
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,984
Fucker, you wouldn't come alone.

915
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,366
Don't run!

916
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,752
No!

917
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,337
Please, no!

918
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:40,965
Stop!

919
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:43,593
No!

920
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,595
No!

921
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:49,932
Please, stop. Don't kill him!

922
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,858
Let go! You son of a bitch!

923
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,861
Let go!

924
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:37,230
<i>Miguel came on Sergeant Park's orders.</i>

925
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,942
<i>We managed to get through</i>
<i>the holiday rush,</i>

926
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,902
<i>but this isn't over.</i>

927
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:45,029
<i>People here</i>

928
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:49,116
<i>don't pick up guns on Christmas.</i>

929
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:58,876
Isn't it a bit too quiet, Soo-young?

930
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:02,713
If we just read the room and stay back,
we'll be fine.

931
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,217
By the way,

932
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,719
how about Kook-hee?

933
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:11,681
Kook-hee?

934
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,059
Are you feeling guilty now?

935
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,895
You're the one who told him.

936
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:21,566
You said to wait for the right time
and tell him when--

937
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:22,483
What the fuck?

938
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,360
Did I tell you to do that?

939
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,488
You're making it sound like
I paid him to do it!

940
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:28,823
Did I do that?

941
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:31,409
Well. No, you didn't, but…

942
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:35,997
Is he a Korea University alum?

943
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,999
Why do you even care about him?

944
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:46,382
Close up early.

945
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:53,306
Alejandro.

946
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:56,309
What the fuck? You fucking bastard!

947
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,227
What the fuck is wrong with you?

948
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:03,441
It wasn't me. It's a misunderstanding!

949
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:05,318
No? It wasn't you?

950
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:09,405
Your boy robbed my warehouse,
but you didn't order him to?

951
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:11,324
If I were gonna rob your warehouse,

952
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,200
I wouldn't do it that way!

953
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,038
Don't you know who I am?

954
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:21,876
I'm Park Jang-su, you motherfucker!

955
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:24,545
- Hey, Jae-ung.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

956
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:26,255
I'm on the way.

957
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,551
What is it this time?

958
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:32,053
Are you worried?

959
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:33,679
Will you be okay?

960
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:35,890
You should be, right?

961
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:39,268
<i>With customs involved,</i>
<i>Alejandro can't do anything either.</i>

962
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,563
<i>Mr. Park said he'd handle it,</i>
<i>so don't worry.</i>

963
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:46,150
Damn, Kook-hee. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said all that.

964
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:47,068
Jae-ung.

965
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:51,781
You and Soo-young are the only ones
who came to my father's funeral.

966
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,951
You know I like you, right?

967
01:05:58,496 --> 01:05:59,330
Yeah.

968
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,641
It's been a long day.

969
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:32,905
Very well.

970
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:37,994
Let's clear up… this misunderstanding.

971
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:38,429
Don't think too hard.
Just hand the boy over.

972
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:41,891
That'd reaffirm our friendship.

973
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:46,353
We can bury the hatchet.

974
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:47,897
My friend.

975
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:54,111
Colombians forget the past quickly.

976
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:58,991
Living day to day is hard enough here.

977
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,243
Very hard.

978
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:04,747
Cheers.

979
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:17,760
You're here.

980
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:26,477
Don Alejandro chose not to cause
any trouble over this incident.

981
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,980
It's all okay now.

982
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:37,279
But man, this ugly bastard
is asking us for half our profit.

983
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:46,539
Did you know?

984
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:49,291
What?

985
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:52,545
- What do you mean?
- Wait a minute.

986
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:56,674
Kiddo, have you forgotten where you are?

987
01:08:57,591 --> 01:08:59,009
This is Colombia.

988
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:03,180
We speak Spanish here.

989
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:10,771
Listen carefully.

990
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,570
I've got no money or goods
for thieves like you.

991
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:20,030
That <i>sicario </i>you hired,

992
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:21,866
I paid him double.

993
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:24,660
You fucking bastard!

994
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:34,753
What did you just do?

995
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:45,973
No.

996
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,728
I don't know what you're thinking,

997
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:53,480
but it's utter nonsense.

998
01:09:58,485 --> 01:09:59,486
Kook-hee.

999
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:05,993
What is it?

1000
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:08,204
Tell me.

1001
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:17,504
I need to survive and reach Zone 6.

1002
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:20,549
Uncle.

1003
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:50,412
The path to enlightenment
is through compassion.

1004
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:55,084
The path to enlightenment
is through compassion.

1005
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:58,671
<i>The path to enlightenment</i>
<i>is through compassion!</i>

1006
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:20,067
Carlos, congratulations on your promotion.

1007
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:23,195
And please accept our condolences.

1008
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:26,240
Alejandro was an old friend of yours.

1009
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:30,661
When the killer is caught,
we'll know who was behind it.

1010
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:33,330
What do you mean?

1011
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:36,750
Many people are curious
about where Alejandro got

1012
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:39,461
all those Korean products
in his warehouse.

1013
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:50,180
Please allow Koreans
to contribute to revitalizing

1014
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:53,058
the Colombian economy.

1015
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:55,644
Listen, I have one thing to tell you.

1016
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:58,230
I do not like cakes.

1017
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,982
You'll learn to like them.

1018
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:02,901
This is how Koreans show appreciation.

1019
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,495
Is this Kook-hee's message?

1020
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,415
<i>It's the wish of all the merchants.</i>

1021
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:43,525
<i>We found her, Kook-hee.</i>

1022
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:45,736
<i>The bitch who killed your father.</i>

1023
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,081
See you again, my friend.

1024
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:04,338
<i>Sergeant Park kept his mouth shut,</i>

1025
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:07,091
<i>and people</i>

1026
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:09,551
<i>now fear me.</i>

1027
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:37,037
3 YEARS LATER

1028
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:40,332
<i>In exchange</i>
<i>for exempting customs duties in Bogotá,</i>

1029
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:45,629
<i>there has been an endless stream</i>
<i>of corruption involving bribes.</i>

1030
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:49,425
<i>Countless smuggled goods</i>
<i>are taking over the San Andresito Market,</i>

1031
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:54,346
<i>and despite opposition from the smugglers,</i>

1032
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:58,350
<i>raids will never stop.</i>

1033
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:02,563
<i>Congress has introduced</i>
<i>the Anti-Smuggling Act,</i>

1034
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:06,066
<i>and we'll properly root out</i>
<i>the illegal activities happening</i>

1035
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:08,318
<i>in the San Andresito Market.</i>

1036
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,293
<i>Anti-Smuggling Act?</i>

1037
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:26,545
Tell them to fuck off with that shit!

1038
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:29,631
Does this country even have any goods
that haven't been smuggled in?

1039
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:31,508
Don't get worked up.

1040
01:14:32,926 --> 01:14:34,011
What about customs?

1041
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:37,806
There are rumors running rampant
that they're gonna raid the market.

1042
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:41,351
Kook-hee!

1043
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,231
Did you have a good trip?

1044
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:49,234
Wow, you went to Seoul
and brought back good vibes!

1045
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,069
It's just a phase!

1046
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:52,946
Reform, my ass.

1047
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,781
It's not that simple a problem.

1048
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:59,453
Chinese goods are cheaper now,
and our costs have increased.

1049
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:01,914
We need to change too.

1050
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:03,874
Hey, wait.

1051
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,753
Are you saying we need to accept
the Anti-Smuggling Act?

1052
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,421
Is that it?

1053
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,964
This is Bogotá.

1054
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:13,425
It's Colombia.

1055
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:18,013
How long do you think this will go on?

1056
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:21,058
We just need to lay low for a while,
like we always do.

1057
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:24,144
Is the Anti-Smuggling Act about smuggling?

1058
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:25,145
Those guys?

1059
01:15:26,813 --> 01:15:29,816
This is them trying to push Koreans
out of San Andresito.

1060
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,401
Why act like you don't know?

1061
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:32,819
Hey, Jae-ung.

1062
01:15:33,737 --> 01:15:35,739
I saw Carlos the other day
with a new woman.

1063
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:38,867
Lots of expenses this time.
You know what I mean?

1064
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:40,410
Be prepared.

1065
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:44,957
Bro, that's enough.

1066
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,293
I'm the one making the decision.

1067
01:16:02,015 --> 01:16:03,308
That fucking bastard!

1068
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:13,068
HONORARY DIPLOMA

1069
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:17,906
PRESIDENTIAL COMMENDATION
SONG KOOK-HEE

1070
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:31,628
Hey!

1071
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:32,754
Don't touch them!

1072
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:36,550
Get out of my way!
Out of my way, you bastards.

1073
01:16:36,633 --> 01:16:37,759
Let go of that!

1074
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,554
- No.
- Don't touch!

1075
01:16:40,637 --> 01:16:41,722
Leave those alone!

1076
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:44,349
- I said out of my way!
- Wait a minute!

1077
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:45,434
Don't touch them!

1078
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,314
Let's just talk about it.

1079
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:51,982
Hold on!

1080
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:10,959
<i>The protest, which openly opposes</i>
<i>the Anti-Smuggling Act,</i>

1081
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:13,253
<i>is becoming increasingly violent.</i>

1082
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:17,466
<i>The Santa Fe shopping district,</i>
<i>which is resisting the most fiercely,</i>

1083
01:17:17,549 --> 01:17:22,012
<i>is led by Korean migrants</i>
<i>and is now in a standoff with the police.</i>

1084
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:43,867
Why the fuck are you doing this?

1085
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:46,078
You said you'd wait.

1086
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:49,539
Help me!

1087
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:51,833
Look at them!

1088
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:55,128
Can't you see they're out of control?

1089
01:17:56,129 --> 01:17:58,090
What the fuck do you expect me to do?

1090
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:59,132
Sir.

1091
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:00,050
Oh, come on.

1092
01:18:00,133 --> 01:18:02,803
Please trust me! I'll take care of it!

1093
01:18:06,264 --> 01:18:07,099
Sanches.

1094
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:10,560
Let the guy heading your way in.

1095
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:13,438
<i>He said he'll take care of this.</i>

1096
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:15,232
<i>We have nothing to lose.</i>

1097
01:18:19,152 --> 01:18:19,986
WE WANT TO SURVIVE

1098
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,780
Guarantee our survival!

1099
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:23,990
Police and customs, get out!

1100
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:26,284
We're all going to die. Fuck!

1101
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:28,662
I'll persuade them, okay?

1102
01:18:28,745 --> 01:18:31,039
Persuade who? Whose side are you on?

1103
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:32,541
This isn't the time to pick sides!

1104
01:18:32,624 --> 01:18:35,794
Mr. Song, I heard you support the Act!

1105
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:37,587
Did anyone here say we support it?

1106
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:39,339
None of us fucking did!

1107
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:40,966
Guarantee our survival!

1108
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:42,467
Guarantee our survival!

1109
01:18:43,343 --> 01:18:45,971
Move faster. Put it down.

1110
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:54,271
Stay away!

1111
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:56,273
Let go of me!

1112
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:15,542
Shit, my eyes are burning!
You motherfuckers!

1113
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:18,086
Hey, you sons of bitches!

1114
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,506
- What the hell?
- Fuck you!

1115
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:24,092
Leave it!

1116
01:19:49,075 --> 01:19:50,410
Get everyone out!

1117
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:52,245
Do whatever it takes!

1118
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:53,663
Look.

1119
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:56,166
Give them what they want.

1120
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:57,751
Whatever it is!

1121
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:00,253
Fucking useless piece of shit.

1122
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:09,221
Damn it. Seriously.

1123
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,143
I've already got one foot in the grave.

1124
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:20,524
But a cake box won't be
anywhere near enough for this incident.

1125
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:24,152
I guess we need to give him
an apple crate, at least.

1126
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:26,321
What do you think?

1127
01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:35,372
A diabetic shouldn't smoke.
I just do it out of habit.

1128
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:45,549
So?

1129
01:20:47,133 --> 01:20:48,510
What did you tell them, Uncle?

1130
01:20:49,135 --> 01:20:50,595
Goodness, what would I say?

1131
01:20:51,596 --> 01:20:54,724
I'm president of the Korean Association,
but I'm powerless.

1132
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,061
People from my hometown, you know,

1133
01:20:58,979 --> 01:20:59,938
are always neutral.

1134
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:08,113
But speaking of which…

1135
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:15,161
monks don't leave a temple
because they dislike the temple itself.

1136
01:21:17,163 --> 01:21:18,665
It's the head monk they dislike.

1137
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:23,211
Don't cross the line, too, Uncle.

1138
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:27,090
And set up a meeting.

1139
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:29,634
All right.

1140
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:50,822
A shopping mall sounds great.

1141
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:54,993
Terranova.

1142
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:58,079
What a damn grandiose name.

1143
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:01,666
How long has it been?

1144
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:05,337
Not long.

1145
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:08,173
The market's going to change anyway.

1146
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,844
Meaning only the legal shops will survive.

1147
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:16,890
So you're the legal merchant,
and I'm just the dirty, illegal smuggler?

1148
01:22:19,392 --> 01:22:20,852
I didn't say that, bro.

1149
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:26,191
All right.

1150
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:30,737
Sergeant Park's out anyway.

1151
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:32,447
Now you're the top dog.

1152
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:36,117
Any losses or damages incurred
will hit you the hardest.

1153
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:37,243
I get it.

1154
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:40,205
Then you should leave too.

1155
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:42,082
Walk away from the market.

1156
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:45,752
Stop calling me "dog."

1157
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:48,797
Hey, dog.

1158
01:22:51,007 --> 01:22:53,426
If the monk dislikes the temple,
he should leave.

1159
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,845
Why try to renovate the whole damn temple?

1160
01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:57,305
For fuck's sake!

1161
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:00,850
You wanted a mall
South Americans would go crazy for.

1162
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,185
Don't you remember?

1163
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:09,734
Bro, I'm sorry.

1164
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:12,696
Let's not do this.

1165
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:14,656
That was our dream.

1166
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:16,408
"Our" dream?

1167
01:23:20,286 --> 01:23:21,413
So you should try--

1168
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:23,248
"Our" dream?

1169
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:27,627
Is it ours?

1170
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:29,295
Huh? Ours?

1171
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:36,177
Don't do this.

1172
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:39,639
It was my fucking dream.
How did it become ours?

1173
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,032
<i>What are you trying to say?</i>

1174
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,410
We'll shut down the smuggling routes.

1175
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:02,829
And the new shopping mall

1176
01:24:02,912 --> 01:24:05,081
will only carry legal products.

1177
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:07,584
Legal? Bullshit.

1178
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:10,128
I was a fool for coming here.

1179
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:11,629
Get up, everyone! Let's go!

1180
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:14,549
Either way, we're foreigners
in this country, right?

1181
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:16,634
We're the ones to suffer, not them.

1182
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:19,220
Hey, you think
we've had an easy life here?

1183
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:22,223
The way I fucking see it,

1184
01:24:22,974 --> 01:24:25,852
you have no idea
how we do things around here.

1185
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:28,855
How you do things here?

1186
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:31,608
If you do things my way,

1187
01:24:32,692 --> 01:24:36,196
I'll take full responsibility
for any losses from seized goods.

1188
01:24:36,279 --> 01:24:37,405
I'll cover them in full.

1189
01:24:41,951 --> 01:24:43,703
Seized goods aren't the only problem!

1190
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:46,164
Things will stay like this
from now on, won't they?

1191
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:48,166
If we incur more losses,

1192
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:51,544
will you cover those too?

1193
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:53,338
Will you?

1194
01:24:54,672 --> 01:24:56,633
Why can't you fucking answer the question?

1195
01:24:57,967 --> 01:24:58,802
We're forming…

1196
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,140
a new Korean Businessman Association.

1197
01:25:04,974 --> 01:25:06,351
Will that be enough?

1198
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:07,977
The new shopping mall.

1199
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:10,063
Someone has to manage it.

1200
01:25:10,146 --> 01:25:12,398
Give us management rights,

1201
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:14,901
and we'll reconsider it.

1202
01:25:14,984 --> 01:25:16,069
Mr. Park.

1203
01:26:02,365 --> 01:26:03,741
Tell him to quit the bullshit.

1204
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:06,452
We've been through it all here
in the past 20 years.

1205
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:07,954
Haven't we?

1206
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,623
We can't go down like this,

1207
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:12,417
can we?

1208
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:34,939
<i>It'll come in handy someday.</i>

1209
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,359
<i>This is Colombia, after all.</i>

1210
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:40,945
SON OF A BITCH

1211
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:26,950
Put it on that rack.

1212
01:27:28,117 --> 01:27:29,160
This needs to go.

1213
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,788
Hello? I'll be right there.

1214
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:33,915
I'm coming.

1215
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:36,000
Kook-hee!

1216
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:37,252
Let's go.

1217
01:28:11,869 --> 01:28:13,621
Fucking Colombia.

1218
01:29:02,378 --> 01:29:03,504
It was you, wasn't it?

1219
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:05,757
Yes, it fucking was. Happy now?

1220
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,301
Hurry and tell Kook-hee it wasn't me.

1221
01:29:08,384 --> 01:29:09,886
You think you'll be safe?

1222
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:12,263
Tell him it was you, for fuck's sake!

1223
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,307
Tell him yourself, asshole!

1224
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:16,017
You and Kook-hee are tight.

1225
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:18,519
You've been kissing his ass
for so long, dipshit.

1226
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,147
Why? Are you worried he won't believe you?

1227
01:29:21,647 --> 01:29:23,066
You fucking coward.

1228
01:29:23,149 --> 01:29:24,984
Eat shit and die, motherfucker!

1229
01:29:25,068 --> 01:29:26,402
Fucking dumbass!

1230
01:29:57,767 --> 01:29:59,769
Have your injuries healed now?

1231
01:30:00,603 --> 01:30:02,814
This is a security level two vehicle.

1232
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:04,649
It has 22 armor plates

1233
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:07,568
and windows made of polycarbonate,
not glass.

1234
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:11,906
Yes, it's nice.

1235
01:30:12,448 --> 01:30:14,117
Yeah, it's nice and sturdy.

1236
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:16,661
I have to say…

1237
01:30:19,038 --> 01:30:20,623
I'm very grateful to you.

1238
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:25,586
Well, yeah.

1239
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:28,798
I'll help you as much as I can.

1240
01:30:39,642 --> 01:30:40,643
I won't be long.

1241
01:30:40,726 --> 01:30:42,520
No, it's fine. Take your time.

1242
01:30:49,318 --> 01:30:51,737
ACUPUNCTURE CLINIC

1243
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:05,710
Hey.

1244
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:07,795
It's me.

1245
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:09,672
Yes!

1246
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:11,549
Don't you understand?

1247
01:31:12,675 --> 01:31:15,011
Cancel my flight in two days!

1248
01:31:15,094 --> 01:31:17,472
And get me on the next flight!

1249
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:20,224
Yes, anywhere!

1250
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:21,392
Fastest one!

1251
01:31:23,936 --> 01:31:25,146
Yes, that's good.

1252
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:27,857
Here you go.

1253
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,651
If you're traveling a long way,

1254
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:32,695
emeralds transport better.

1255
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:35,865
By the way,

1256
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:37,783
where are you going?

1257
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:40,203
I don't fucking know. What does it matter?

1258
01:31:41,412 --> 01:31:44,415
Just a place to lay low
until things die down a little.

1259
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:47,210
I don't think
things will die down that easily.

1260
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:50,796
Hold on. Let me get you a few more.

1261
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:30,461
It wasn't me.

1262
01:32:31,462 --> 01:32:32,964
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

1263
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:35,841
I know.

1264
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:37,718
What?

1265
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:40,221
<i>I know you didn't do it, bro.</i>

1266
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:48,646
I did it.

1267
01:32:53,317 --> 01:32:54,443
What are you saying?

1268
01:32:54,944 --> 01:32:58,281
<i>If something's infected and full of pus,</i>
<i>it needs to be popped.</i>

1269
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,325
Everyone thinks someone tried to kill me,

1270
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:04,203
but they failed.

1271
01:33:05,204 --> 01:33:06,038
So…

1272
01:33:10,209 --> 01:33:12,003
no one else will dare try.

1273
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:15,214
Cut the bullshit, asshole.

1274
01:33:15,298 --> 01:33:16,424
<i>Let's drop this, bro.</i>

1275
01:33:17,174 --> 01:33:18,676
No one got hurt.

1276
01:33:21,137 --> 01:33:23,097
Now you just need to return to your place.

1277
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:29,562
You son of a bitch,
acting high and mighty to the end, huh?

1278
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:31,856
I won't repeat myself.

1279
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,275
They failed, so no one else will try?

1280
01:33:34,358 --> 01:33:36,986
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

1281
01:33:37,069 --> 01:33:38,404
<i>You think I'll stop there?</i>

1282
01:33:38,487 --> 01:33:39,614
<i>I'm also going to kill</i>

1283
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:41,365
your mother and--

1284
01:33:43,993 --> 01:33:47,163
Don't move.
I'm inserting an acupuncture needle.

1285
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:17,485
I hope something like this
never happens between us again.

1286
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:21,197
Why come all the way
to the other side of the world

1287
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:23,699
just to act like this
with our fellow countrymen?

1288
01:34:58,109 --> 01:34:59,068
Do you remember?

1289
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:04,115
You told me to survive and reach Zone 6.

1290
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:06,534
I do remember.

1291
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:11,080
But honestly,

1292
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:13,791
I never expected you to actually make it.

1293
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:18,713
Impressive.

1294
01:35:47,908 --> 01:35:49,910
God. Okay. That's enough.

1295
01:35:52,788 --> 01:35:53,914
That's it for me.

1296
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,834
Oh my.

1297
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:05,653
<i>La cucaracha, la cucaracha</i>

1298
01:37:10,449 --> 01:37:15,329
<i>La cucaracha, la cucaracha</i>

1299
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:18,791
<i>It can no longer walk</i>

1300
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:22,169
<i>Because it doesn't have</i>

1301
01:37:23,587 --> 01:37:25,548
<i>Because it's lacking</i>

1302
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:29,260
<i>Marijuana to smoke</i>

1303
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:32,054
<i>La cucaracha</i>

1304
01:37:32,721 --> 01:37:34,473
<i>La cucaracha</i>

1305
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:36,475
<i>It can no longer…</i>

1306
01:37:41,188 --> 01:37:42,022
Uncle.

1307
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:48,320
Why did the locals here
call you a cockroach?

1308
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:55,411
Those bastards hadn't seen many Asians.

1309
01:37:56,328 --> 01:37:57,788
Plus, I'm kind of small.

1310
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:00,416
I guess they took me for a chump.

1311
01:38:00,499 --> 01:38:02,251
Those bastards, they don't have shit.

1312
01:38:02,334 --> 01:38:04,295
Do you know which creature on Earth

1313
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:07,339
will survive until the end?

1314
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:09,174
Which one?

1315
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:12,219
The cockroach.

1316
01:38:14,471 --> 01:38:15,890
La cucaracha.

1317
01:38:15,973 --> 01:38:16,932
Wow.

1318
01:38:18,058 --> 01:38:19,476
That's quite meaningful.

1319
01:38:22,062 --> 01:38:23,022
Life…

1320
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:26,817
is so overwhelming.

1321
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,992
Mr. Song, let's pull over.
I need to take a leak.

1322
01:39:16,408 --> 01:39:17,576
That's bulletproof!

1323
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:20,537
Bulletproof!

1324
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:22,373
It won't break!

1325
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:23,999
You dumbass!

1326
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,460
Why won't you understand, you little shit?

1327
01:39:26,543 --> 01:39:27,711
It won't shatter!

1328
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:28,921
Do you understand?

1329
01:39:37,054 --> 01:39:38,639
Hello?

1330
01:39:39,223 --> 01:39:40,432
Can you hear me?

1331
01:39:41,558 --> 01:39:43,602
This car has great soundproofing too.

1332
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:44,687
Dear me.

1333
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:47,564
It's strange, isn't it?

1334
01:39:49,108 --> 01:39:52,319
I sent my wife and daughter to Seoul,
even though they wanted to stay.

1335
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:56,198
It's been over three years
since I said I'd wrap up and join them.

1336
01:39:57,449 --> 01:40:00,911
I really don't know
what's keeping me here.

1337
01:40:02,204 --> 01:40:04,748
Anyway, my dear nephew sure is different.

1338
01:40:05,749 --> 01:40:06,583
Right?

1339
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:12,631
Different from your father
and different from the other Koreans here.

1340
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:16,719
But you know…

1341
01:40:18,721 --> 01:40:20,431
you're just too different.

1342
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:23,434
Being different brings trouble.

1343
01:40:32,901 --> 01:40:35,571
Say hello. This is Alejandro's eldest son.

1344
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:12,566
Impressive.

1345
01:42:29,518 --> 01:42:35,607
BOGOTÁ

1346
01:42:35,691 --> 01:42:40,362
CITY OF THE LOST

1347
