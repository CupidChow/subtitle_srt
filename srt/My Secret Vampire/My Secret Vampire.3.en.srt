00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,280
The perfect combination of high fat
and high carbohydrates.

2
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,630
Add a spoonful of sweet honey
on top of vitamin-filled fruits.

3
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,140
Not too much, nor too little.
Just 5 kg, Han Dongha.

4
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,539
What's going on?

5
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,970
A war broke out?

6
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,300
-Yes, Chef!
-Yes, Chef!

7
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,450
You guys...

8
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,940
What's all this?

9
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,750
You must be tired
having to start work early in the morning.

10
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,980
Wait!

12
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:29,500
Dongha,

13
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,430
you keep going to work
without eating breakfast every day.

14
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,360
Eat this and work hard.

15
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,979
Don't feel too burdened.

16
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,970
Thank you.

17
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,000
Take care!

18
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,259
People would think you gave birth to him.

19
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,729
We didn't give birth to him,
but we are raising him.

20
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:50,680
With a loving heart.

21
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,600
What kind of creepy stuff
are you saying early in the morning?

22
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,250
Dongha! Give me your bag.

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,550
It'll be a waste if you lose fat.

24
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,130
Let's go.

25
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,530
Be careful. Very good.

26
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,260
Be careful.

27
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,470
Don't open your eyes.

28
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,740
All right.

29
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,460
Don't open your eyes.

30
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,860
Is today a special day?

31
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,590
It's a special day.

32
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,150
It's the Han Dongha Welcome Ceremony!

33
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,900
Applause!

34
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,280
Blow out the candles.

35
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,200
These are all yours.

36
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,980
We feel full just by looking at you eat.
Eat up.

37
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,320
Thank you.

39
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,150
It's good.

40
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,340
Do you want to have this too?

41
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,420
Shall I?

[-220 kcal]

43
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,900
Why aren't you eating?

44
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,960
It's good. Eat up.

45
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,830
Hyung, you eat things like that too?

46
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,880
Of course. This is delicious.

47
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,980
Why? Aren't you eating?

48
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,240
I don't feel like it...

49
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,770
Look at how skinny you are, Gyumin.

50
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,900
You could faint anytime.

51
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,320
No, I'm fine.

52
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,500
You'll faint.

53
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,630
Ah...

54
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,490
Chew slowly.

55
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,480
Wait, wait.

56
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,750
My phone...

57
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,740
Where are you going?

58
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,660
Hello?

59
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,950
It's good.

60
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,470
Come here.

61
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,180
Gyumin! Are you okay?

62
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,320
Gyumin!

63
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,730
Traitor!

64
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,070
He ran away alone.

65
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,780
You can leave too.

66
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,060
I'm scared of Joowon.

67
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,990
I had to lay for a week when he beat me up
for being rude.

68
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,159
Come on. You're so tall for nothing.

69
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,170
Are you okay?

70
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,150
Yes.

71
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,090
I'm scared of Joowon too now.

72
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,080
Did you see that?

73
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,320
How he doesn't even vomit
when he eats human food?

74
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,510
Does he dislike the fact that

75
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,770
we want some of Dongha's blood that much?

76
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,920
I wonder if Joowon is better now.

77
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,850
Of course not.

78
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,350
A dessert?

79
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,380
Forget it.

80
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,870
That's right.

81
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,130
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

82
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,080
What?

83
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,190
You don't eat what I gave you.

84
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,750
But you eat what everyone else gives you.

85
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,480
Think whatever you want.

86
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,430
Hey. You don't look well.

87
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,420
Just give me a second.

88
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,350
It's fine.

89
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,320
What a huge reaction.

90
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,780
How's that a huge reaction?
You were the one who pricked me suddenly.

91
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,110
Who would make such a fuss
over something like this?

92
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,250
Not like you're a kid.

93
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,070
What? A kid?

94
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,950
Give me your hand.
I'll prick it too.

95
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,000
Why? I'm not sick.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,810
Gosh, look at you stepping back.

97
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,740
That's not stepping back,
just pulling back my hand.

98
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,910
I'm better now.

99
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,490
Thank you.

100
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,110
Why are you always defending Dongha?

101
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,590
I'm defending him?

102
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,900
That's what it seems like to me.

103
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,570
What are you talking about?

104
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,850
I just don't want any trouble.

105
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,000
Is that so?

106
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,060
Yes.

107
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,110
Actually,
I want him to move out right away.

108
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,500
But I can't do that.

109
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,180
So my goal is to have him leave quietly
without causing any trouble.

110
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,870
So help me out.

111
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,040
Why are you looking at me like that?

112
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,920
Well.

113
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,730
Also, don't worry.

114
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,870
I told you. I like Han Dongha.

115
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,650
What do you like about him?

116
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,030
He's kind and cute.

117
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,210
Also...

118
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,620
Aren't you curious how good
his blood will taste?

119
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,190
Not at all!

120
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,430
Don't... do anything stupid.

121
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,150
I can't guarantee that.

122
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,320
I told you. I like Han Dongha.

123
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,750
He's kind

124
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,880
and cute.

125
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,350
How could he have gained
not even 100 grams?

126
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,610
Is this for real?

127
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,810
Is the weighing scale broken?

128
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,010
Dongha.

129
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,770
Are you preparing to debut as an idol?

130
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,330
It's not to that extent.

131
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,180
Why are you asking me to weigh myself?

132
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,020
Well...

133
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,520
Look at the slope.

134
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,520
We're worried that you'd be tired.

135
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,240
I may not look like it,
but I'm in good health.

136
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,700
I'm going to work.

137
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,790
What kind of job does he do
that he doesn't gain weight?

138
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,710
Should we follow him?

139
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,800
I'll go take a look.

140
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,730
Huh?

141
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,390
Where's the car key?

142
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,810
Also...

143
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,540
Aren't you curious how good
his blood will taste?

144
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,130
Absolutely not.

145
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,190
Why should I trust Kang Seonjae?

146
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,330
Anyway, what am I even doing?

147
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,740
Let's just get some sleep.

148
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,340
Can you do it by yourself?

149
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,710
Of course.

150
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,730
I can take out the trash too.

151
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,880
Go back in.

152
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,720
Thank you. See you.

153
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,460
We're vampires.

154
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,880
But is it right for us to learn
by watching a vampire movie?

155
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,040
Hey.

156
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,050
Of all the famous directors,
there has to be one who's a vampire.

157
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,250
This is a classic. Study it.

158
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,610
He's here.

159
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,940
What now?

160
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:03,970
What are you doing?

161
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,750
Don't you know simulation?

162
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,470
We have to succeed in it in one go.

163
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,340
Screw that, let's just watch the movie.

164
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,800
But...

165
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,590
Why is that vampire
only after human blood?

166
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,600
Maybe he's addicted to blood.

167
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,740
Will I... become like this too?

168
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,810
No way.

169
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,050
Will I get addicted to Dongha's blood

170
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,080
and keep chasing after him
for my whole life?

171
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,230
What?

172
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,900
Let's just watch the movie.

173
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,920
Is there anything I can help you with?

174
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,790
Thank you.

175
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,670
What am I doing here?

176
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,130
Would you like to order?

177
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,180
No, I'll come again next time.

178
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,040
Okay.

179
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,580
Hey! Don't you know how to pour water?

180
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,860
I'm sorry.

181
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,120
Darn it!

182
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:37,610
Hey! I'm in a bad mood because of you.

183
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,970
You have to take responsibility.

184
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,730
Sir,
you're making things difficult for me.

185
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,980
Hey!

186
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,670
You have to take responsibility!

187
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,240
Hyung...

188
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,340
Let's go.

189
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,040
I'm working though.

190
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,560
But still, how could you do that?

191
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,370
It was so frustrating. Why?

192
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,200
I just started this job not long ago,
and now I'm going to get fired.

193
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,500
I'll take responsibility, so stop nagging.

194
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,160
Take responsibility of what?

195
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,930
How are you going to do that?
