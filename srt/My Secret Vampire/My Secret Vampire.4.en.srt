1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,780
But still, how could you do that?

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,980
It was frustrating.
Why?

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,410
It hasn't been that many days since
I joined, and I'm going to get fired now.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,700
I'll take responsibility, so stop nagging.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,300
Take responsibility for me?

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,110
How?

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,630
Hyung, what's wrong?

8
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,540
Are you okay?

9
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,830
Seonjae...

10
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,510
What?

11
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,980
Call Seonjae.

12
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,079
Lee Joowon.

13
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,930
Seonjae, well...

14
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,390
Are you okay?

15
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,060
Where have you been?

16
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,280
Let's go out.

17
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,640
I'm in the middle of my work.

18
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,350
I'll take responsibility, so stop nagging.

19
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,950
Take responsibility for me?

20
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,700
How?

21
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,660
Hyung, what's wrong?

22
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,150
Are you okay?

23
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,940
What are you making?

24
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,260
Ginger tea.

25
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,920
My parents always
make this for me when I'm sick.

26
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,910
Joowon can't eat ginger or garlic.

27
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,360
But I found
his body temperature very low just now.

28
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,579
Doesn't he need to go to the hospital?

29
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:54,910
He's always like that. There's no need.

30
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,350
But his temperature is low.

31
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,160
Are you so worried about him?

32
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,180
Don't worry.
He's just bad at handling stress.

33
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,360
You must be tired. Get some rest.

34
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,220
I'll bring it to him.

35
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,670
Hey, Lee Joowon.

36
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,370
He can't drink it
'cause he's a half-blood.

37
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,110
That's not true.

38
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,440
Why don't you take a sip and show us?

39
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,820
-Drink.
-Drink.

40
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,430
-Drink.
-Drink!

41
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,290
You said you can drink it. Drink it!

42
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,130
You're pretty good
at pretending to be asleep.

43
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,390
I'm really going to sleep.

44
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,580
You really are a vampire.

45
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,390
You can't drink blood plasma

46
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,250
but had a reaction like that
seeing Dongha's blood.

47
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,630
But he's pretty kind,
still being worried about you.

48
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:31,040
Speaking of, were you following
Dongha around the whole day today?

49
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,500
You who wouldn't even leave the house
for more than 100 meters?

50
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,930
I want to find dirt on him
and chase him out as soon as possible.

51
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,010
Makes sense?

52
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,070
You said your goal
was to force him to leave quietly, no?

53
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,159
My head hurts. You can leave.

54
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,610
You know we can't be together
with humans, right?

55
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,840
What do you mean?

56
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,600
Well... Just in case.

57
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,730
You're the one being weird here, you know?

58
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,650
You don't usually stay home.

59
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,800
I kept seeing you at home these days.

60
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,820
Were you serious
when you said you liked Dongha?

61
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,260
You should get some rest.

62
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,210
What is this?

63
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,490
Dongha said
he drinks this when he is sick.

64
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,350
Leave it if you don't want it.

65
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,940
I have some leftover medication.
Do you want it?

66
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,320
Hey, get treated.

67
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,620
You almost killed me.

68
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,020
I don't care if you take it or not.

69
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,460
What are you doing?

70
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,870
I don't care if you die or not.

71
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,970
What?

72
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,460
Is this for me?

73
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,450
Thankfully, my injury
isn't life-threatening.

74
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,980
I'll use it well.

75
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,660
Hyung.

76
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,240
But... How do I apply this?

77
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,860
It hurts.

78
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,850
You're exaggerating.

79
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,130
You're the one who's exaggerating.

80
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,380
What is this antique?

81
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,990
Can it be used?

82
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,630
My parents bought this for me.

83
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,320
No wonder it's so vintage.

84
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,350
By the way, can I ask you something?

85
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,170
Forget it. I guess that's your privacy.

86
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,660
I won't ask.

87
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,720
Hey. I hate it
when people don't finish their sentences.

88
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,450
What is it?

89
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,010
When did you start living here?

90
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,700
When I was little.

91
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,680
With your family?

92
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,820
Yes. With my sister and godfather.

93
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,360
What about your parents?

94
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,430
I don't know.

95
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,700
Some people just don't know.

96
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,380
My parents passed away too.

97
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,250
When I was young, they told me

98
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,860
to go to a university in a big city.

99
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,270
I kept saying no stubbornly.

100
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,260
Yet in the end, here I am.

101
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,720
Why didn't you want to come?

102
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,400
Well...

103
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,750
I thought I'd feel lonely.

104
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,640
Because I'm different
from the city people.

105
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,960
It'd feel like I'm standing alone
among other races.

106
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,600
You probably
don't understand that feeling.

107
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,490
But you don't have to do all this for me.

108
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,080
If you wash it by yourself, the wound
can get inflamed after touching water.

109
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,530
I won't let you pay for the treatment.

110
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,870
Oh right.

111
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,340
Why did you go to that bar?

112
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,280
Done.

113
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,900
-Dongha, are you back?
-I'm here–

114
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,430
Is he not back yet?
He should be back.

115
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,080
It'll be weird if we go out together.

116
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,780
Sorry.

117
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,950
Dongha, do you want supper?

118
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,910
Spicy rice cakes?

119
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,980
Fried chicken?
Or all of the above?

120
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,000
Next time maybe.

121
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,310
Thanks to you, I've gained weight.

122
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,190
-Hey, he finally gained weight.
-Wow.

123
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,270
We heard it right, right?

124
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,150
Gosh. I'm not feeling well.

125
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,040
Is it going to rain?

126
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,140
Well... I thought I'd feel lonely.

127
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,440
It'd feel like I'm standing alone
among other races.

128
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,690
You know we can't be together
with humans, right?

129
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,050
What do you mean?

130
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,480
Well... Just in case.

131
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,890
Are you... avoiding me?

132
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,130
No.

133
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,380
I'm sorry about what happened earlier,
for suddenly–

134
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,990
It's nothing! It's okay.

135
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,130
Really.

136
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,140
I have to get up early tomorrow.

137
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,250
I have a favor to ask.

138
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,280
Tonight...

139
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,800
sleep with me.
