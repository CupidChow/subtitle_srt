1
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,550
Hyung, are you asleep?

2
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,140
You said you had insomnia...

3
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,740
[Lee Okhee]

4
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,530
Hello? Lee Joowon.

5
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,979
Gosh.

6
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,020
Why are you so hard to contact?

7
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,450
H-Hello?

8
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,860
Have you been taking your pills on time?

9
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,990
Don't forget to take that blood plasma.

10
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,700
What are you doing?

11
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,640
Your phone kept ringing loudly.

12
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,610
I thought you were asleep,
so I was going to turn it off.

13
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,070
I told you not to touch my stuff.

14
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,570
Do you always do whatever you want?

15
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,079
I...

16
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,120
Hey, Han Dongha.

17
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,920
Don't cross the line.

18
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,360
You were the one
who crossed the line first.

19
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,390
Why did you come look for me today?

20
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,660
I told you I couldn't sleep.

21
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,829
Is that all?

22
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:40,640
Is there no other reason?

23
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,870
You...

24
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,140
have way too many secrets.

25
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,660
Privacy?

26
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,500
Is your privacy that great?

27
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,150
Or do you just not trust me?

28
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,920
That's not what I meant.

29
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,470
I thought we'd gotten a lot closer.

30
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,370
But I don't know now.

31
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,650
Gosh, you startled me.

32
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,890
How did you know I was here?

33
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,160
Everyone knows your routine.

34
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,760
What happened this time?

35
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,730
Just say something.

36
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,399
It's weird that you're being so quiet.

37
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,950
Right?

38
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,740
That's how you are like now.

39
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,000
It's very strange.

40
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,140
I'm in a bad mood.

41
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,120
I tried staying up all night reading,

42
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,940
or working out until I'm exhausted,

43
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,710
but it hasn't gotten better.

44
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,720
Why are you in a bad mood?

45
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,740
I don't know.

46
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,230
If I knew, I wouldn't be so depressed.

47
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,140
Is it not because of Dongha?

48
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,409
I saw you two fighting yesterday.

49
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,450
We didn't fight.

50
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,990
Right.

51
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,240
You have to have feelings to fight.

52
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,920
You can't have feelings for humans, right?

53
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,160
Lee Joowon.

54
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,510
Let's go on a trip.

55
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,660
What?

56
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,970
You said you did everything you liked.

57
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,710
Then go on a trip, something you dislike.

58
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,110
No.

59
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,450
I'm in a bad mood too. Let's go.

60
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,090
So we could readjust ourselves.

61
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,800
I said no.

62
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,330
Are you not going
even if I beg you like this?

63
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,670
Gosh, what a terrible bro.

64
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,850
Instead...

65
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,800
Let's go see the sea.

66
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,760
You applied sunscreen, right?

67
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,130
A whole bottle.

68
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,350
Why are there five people suddenly?

69
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,570
What else? Just the two of us?

70
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,340
Why? What's wrong with that?

71
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,910
Give me your bag.

72
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,390
Thank you.

73
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,230
Why are we going to the sea
in winter?

74
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,060
It's a good thing.

75
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,310
I have to share a room
with Han Dongha today.

76
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,659
Did you book a room?

77
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,520
Of course.

78
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,050
Finally...

79
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,050
Finally, the day is here...

80
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,830
Gyumin.

81
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,280
I'm sorry about that day.

82
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,760
Hey, why are you suddenly apologizing?

83
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,500
Get in quickly.

84
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,920
What...

85
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,240
do you like to do?

86
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,990
Well.

87
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,530
I want to do
something you like together too.

88
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,840
Let's look for it together in the future.

89
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,240
Are you in a better mood?

90
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,280
Well, kind of.

91
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,600
I went too far yesterday.

92
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,810
I'm sorry.

93
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,030
This is the first time.

94
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,520
What?

95
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,750
I'm seeing the sea.

96
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,020
Isn't it funny?

97
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,520
It's my first time too.

98
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,340
Really? No way.

99
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,740
Why?

100
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,480
I feel like,

101
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,190
unlike me, you've done everything.

102
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,520
Let's do everything
one by one in the future.

103
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,080
What? There's only one room?

104
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,350
That's weird. I booked three rooms.

105
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,590
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

106
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,260
Why are you doing this? Huh?

107
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,840
No, that's not true.

108
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,170
It's the most fun when everyone
sleeps together on a trip.

109
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,050
Gosh.

110
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,160
I guess we won't
be able to eat barbecue today.

111
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,230
Why don't we skip dinner tonight?

112
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,270
We could clear our intestines too.

113
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,030
But I want to eat meat.

114
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,150
My suggestion is not great, yeah?

115
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,680
Why is it not working? Is it broken?

116
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,530
Dongha, that's amazing.

117
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,840
I'm fine.

118
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,260
Just keep it on.

119
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,800
It's already almost a month.

120
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,370
Right.

121
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,700
I didn't know
it would become like this when I moved in.

122
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,000
"Like this"?

123
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,560
It's nice to have met you guys.

124
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,800
I won't forget you guys.

125
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,680
Also...

126
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,750
I like Joowon.

127
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,750
I'm declaring war against you.

128
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,510
But you're so cool.

129
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,980
I don't know if I can be your opponent.

130
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,170
Why are you telling me this?

131
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,920
I just thought... I should tell you.

132
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,640
Where are you going?

133
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,450
I didn't see Han Dongha.

134
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,950
He'll be back soon.

135
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,450
He's not a kid.

136
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:17,830
It's dark. What if something happens?

137
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,390
Go to sleep.

138
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,710
Don't go.

139
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,960
What's wrong?

140
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,300
I told you.
We can't be together with humans.

141
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,900
Let me ask you one thing.

142
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,270
Are you worried as a friend or...

143
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,180
I like you too.

144
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,880
As a friend.

145
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,130
That's all.

146
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,400
You know that too.

147
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,790
I feel the wall
Joowon built up between us.

148
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,730
I want to know what's
on the other side of this wall.

149
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,830
You might not be able to take it.

150
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,450
Why are you out?

151
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,290
Do you want some sweet potatoes?

152
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,960
You can still eat?

153
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,890
There are marshmallows too.

154
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,560
Hyung.
There's something I'm curious about.

155
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,560
Please tell me honestly.

156
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
What?

157
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,520
Hyung...

158
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,920
You came to see the sea
because of me, right?

159
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,510
You're being too self-conscious.

160
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,470
I think you need to be honest.

161
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,580
I'm always honest.

162
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,330
Though I always feel like
I'm the one losing,

163
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,370
it's okay.

164
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,500
Because I'm bad at hiding my emotions.

165
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,830
Why are you smiling?

166
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,590
You told me to be honest.
