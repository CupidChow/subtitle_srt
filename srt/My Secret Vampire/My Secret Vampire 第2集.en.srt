1
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,400
What happened?

2
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,720
Was it a dream?

3
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,940
Hey, let go.

4
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,289
Hey, what were you doing just now?

5
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:12,870
I was just saying hi to someone
I've never seen before.

6
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,930
You misunderstood.

7
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,390
You say hi to people sleeping?

8
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,760
Sometimes.

9
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,860
What's going on?

10
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,590
You're still up. Were you waiting for me?

11
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,350
No way.

12
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,500
So sad.

13
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,360
Who is he? He's cute.

14
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,890
Cute, my foot.

15
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,250
What does going to university

16
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,280
have anything to do
with living with someone?

17
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,640
I guess it's like a practice?

18
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,110
I really don't understand
what Okhee is thinking.

19
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,400
But she cares about you the most.

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,720
Never mind,
I'll just hold out for a month.

21
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,840
So don't cause unnecessary trouble too.

22
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,100
Well, that depends on how you fair.

23
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,810
Drink this.

24
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,230
You always drink this when you're sick.

25
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,550
How did you know I was sick?

26
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,850
I heard it from Okhee.

27
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,970
Why does she keep contacting you?

28
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,710
Sorry for causing trouble.

29
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,560
I like it though.

30
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,210
I went out because it was cloudy outside,

31
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,940
but I couldn't even buy my book.

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,140
This?

33
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,579
You...

34
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,100
This is the first print version.
Where did you get it?

35
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,440
Give me a kiss.

36
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,300
Have you ever been slapped by a book?

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,030
He knows how to smile.

38
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,590
Hello.

39
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,110
My name is Han Dongha
who just moved in today.

40
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,950
My name is Kang Seonjae.

41
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,310
Seems like you were sleeping.

42
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,390
Just a little.

43
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,030
I was probably too tired
so I got sleep paralysis.

44
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,430
But Seonjae–I mean, Mr. Seonjae,

45
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,030
how should I address you?

46
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,260
Well... You can just call me hyung.

47
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,360
Okay, Seonjae hyung.

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,260
But...

49
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,840
Why?

50
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,750
You're really handsome.

51
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,120
You have good taste.

52
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,360
Stop talking nonsense. Go to sleep.

53
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,520
Why did you tell him that?

54
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,800
He's so cute.

55
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,050
Why? Are you jealous?

56
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,770
I heard human blood is delicious,

57
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,470
and we have one living with us now..

58
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,200
This is God's revelation.

59
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,390
Do you remember
the Romanian phrase we learned?

60
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,850
I almost forgot.

61
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,500
When you suck blood,
you can't cause harm to humans

62
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,740
or reveal your identity.

63
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,430
First, bite the vein.

64
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,159
You should suck
only an appropriate amount of blood.

65
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:37,550
If you suck too much,
you might lose control.

66
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,120
The conditions for whether a human is
suitable for bloodsucking are

67
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,850
height, weight, and pulse...

68
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,080
Why are there so many?

69
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,470
It's going to take forever to read this.

70
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,340
Shall we ask Seonjae when he comes?

71
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,310
Or we could just ask Joowon.

72
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,090
We can't ask Joowon that!

73
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,460
He...

74
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,500
[Resume: Han Dongha]

75
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,590
This is quite remarkable.

76
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,160
My home is in the countryside,
so I couldn't get it printed.

77
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,980
How much of a countryside is it?

78
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,910
The kind surrounded by mountains.

79
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,440
You came to Seoul alone for school?

80
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,170
Yes.

81
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,990
Where do you live now?

82
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,660
I'm living in a share house nearby.

83
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,790
I see.

84
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,850
But why did you decide
to apply here?

85
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,480
I liked sweets since I was a kid, so...

86
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,940
Okay.

87
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,100
Then, when can you go to work?

88
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,630
That's the most important.

89
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,900
Right now.

[Ice Cube, Lee Joowon]

91
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,960
This is for the umbrella.

92
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,580
No, that's not what I meant.

93
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,440
Let's keep a distance between us.

94

[Lee Joowon]

95
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,159
Why was Han Dongha's room
suddenly changed?

96
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,670
Is Joowon spying on us

97
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,080
just in case we bite him?

98
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,990
Is it because of me?

99
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,820
Did you bite him?

100
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,080
I didn't get to taste it though.

101
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,480
Brother, let us have him.

102
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,950
This is our first chance.

103
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,010
But do we have to change rooms?

104
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,320
Why can't he drink some blood
since living under the same roof?

105
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,890
He hates that.

106
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,450
What does human blood taste like?

107
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,680
Is it good?

108
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,440
Of course.

109
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,940
Is it different from blood plasma?

110
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,290
Hey. They can't be compared.

111
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,040
You're so daring.

112
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,360
What if you get caught?

113
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,530
The moment the teeth
bite through the flesh,

114
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,600
the sweetness of human blood
spread instantly.

115
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,650
The refreshing blood
will flow down through the esophagus–

116
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,700
What flows along the esophagus?

117
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,190
It's a gift to commemorate
your first day at work.

118
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,100
Go eat it with your housemates.

119
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,230
Okay.

120
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,450
Even if it's just for a month,
I should get along with them.

121
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,870
I'm home.

122
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,810
Huh? Why is my luggage outside?

123
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,950
What are you doing?

124
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,950
Can't you see? I'm moving your stuff.

125
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,580
Who allowed you to do that?

126
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,510
If you don't like me, just tell me.

127
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,039
Why do such a despicable thing?

128
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,970
Huh?

129
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,330
You told me not to interfere
with your private life,

130
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,930
but you're entering my room
on your own accord?

131

Are you the landlady?

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,560
You misunderstood.

135
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,200
I'll move out on my own in a month.

What's with the two of them?

138
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,470
It feels off.

139
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,970
You're right.

140
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,140
I shouldn't have done that.

Your room was moved to the first floor.

Didn't you see the text?

144
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,910
Text?

145
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,380
Yes.

146
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,980
The room on the first floor
is bigger and nicer.

147

I...

148

I'm sorry.

149
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,750
I thought you were ostracizing me,

150
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,760
so I misunderstood you.

151
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,610
I want to get along with you!

152
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,390
Though it's just a month,

153
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,320
we'd still be living
under the same roof after all...

154
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,610
This is not your home.

155
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,640
He's at it again.

156
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,410
He may sound cold,

157
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,930
but he changed your room for your sake.

158
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,640
So don't think of it too much.

159
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,040
For my sake?

160
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,160
Joowon feels that you shouldn't
stay by yourself on the second floor.

161
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,860
After you get to know us,

162
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,040
you'd know that Joowon's
the most humane among us.

163
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,990
Humane? Him?

164
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,450
Yes.

165
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,620
You're probably saying that
cause you're close to him.

166
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,820
Do we look close?

167
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes.

168
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,770
When I saw
the two of you together last time,

169
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,560
you seemed close.

170
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,760
Anyway, don't fight and get along.

171
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,930
Got it, hyung.

172
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,130
He's good at cutting tomatoes.

173
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,860
Did he learn it?

174
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,570
But... we can't eat this.

175
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,290
But this is his sincerity.

176
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,480
Did you put something in it?

177
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,360
What?

178
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,170
It's really delicious.

179
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,870
Really?

180
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,970
Well...

181
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,680
I made some toast.

182
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,710
I'm full.

183
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,110
Even his rejection's so casual.

184
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,690
Done cleaning the bathroom.

185
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,040
When can I finish cleaning this place?

186
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,280
You don't look like someone
who likes books.

187
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,610
Then what do I look like?

188
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,270
Are you done looking?

189
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,020
When did I look...

190
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,770
I'm talking about the book.

191
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,080
Ah...

192
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,780
Right.

193
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,810
Don't touch my stuff

194
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,970
in the future.

195
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,030
He's so annoying.

196
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,140
This is amazing.

197
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,690
I think my chronic rhinitis is healed.

198
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,560
Cold-blooded man.

199
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,450
No, he's not even human.

200
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,050
Are you okay?

201
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,410
Yes.

202
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,260
Thank you.

203
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,690
I don't know if I should say this now...

204
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,040
But what's your weight?

205
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,670
It's over for us, right?

206
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,330
According to the rules, his weight isn't
the standard for blood sucking.

207
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,860
That's what I think, at least.

208
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,100
Lee Okhee!

209
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,320
I knew this would happen.

210
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,110
Calm down.

211
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,180
That's what she meant by
he can't be eaten.

212
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,610
I was looking forward to it...

213
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,540
Even when
I was eating expired blood plasma,

214
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,320
I have been holding out with this thought.

215
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,830
He's a prey that can't be eaten.

216
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:50,760
Let's ask him to just move out, okay?

217
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,380
I think that's better.

218
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,900
Then let him gain weight.

219
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,770
I like Han Dongha.

220
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,880
So let him eat well and sleep well,

221
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,240
and gain weight.
