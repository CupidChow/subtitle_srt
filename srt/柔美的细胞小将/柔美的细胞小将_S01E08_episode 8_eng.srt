1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,640
 Yumi 

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:12,950


3
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,150
 Yumi's Cells 

4
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:51,890
 Episode 21 : The Great Encyclopedia of Yumi 

5
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,260
 40 years later 

6
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,350
Welcome everyone. This is the Yumi Great Library.

7
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,060
Here.

8
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,990
This is a historic place which contains all the information about Yumi.

9
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,260
All right, this way.

10
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,360
Yes, ma'am!

11
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,600
We keep photos of Yumi's important events like this.

12
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,330
Wow, there is a wedding picture here also!

13
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,750
Really?

14
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,060
Please come this way, everyone.

15
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,960
Yes, ma'am.

16
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,300
Now, these books are the great encyclopedias of Yumi.

17
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,640
One book is published each year and there are currently 72 volumes,

18
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,720
because our Yumi has turned seventy-two years old.

19
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,870
Everything about Yumi is recorded here.

20
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,920
Do you have any questions?

21
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,710
Me! I'd like to know what was the first award that Yumi got.

22
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,230
The first award?

23
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,270
That is probably...

24
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,420
in the seventh volume.

25
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,820
Here we go.

26
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,430
The first ever award that Yumi got was...

27
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,290
 This award is for participating in the children's art competition. 

28
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,310
 Good job, Yumi. 

29
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,720
 Thank you. 

30
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,730
 It was a participation award for an art competition. 

31
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,240
 Award 

32
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,650
For your information, Yumi never won another award at an art competition ever since.

33
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,360
Any other questions?

34
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,570
Ma'am, what was the most embarrassing moment in Yumi's life?

35
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:41,460
That's a good question. There were three most embarrassing incidents in Yumi's life.

36
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,680
The best out of them...

37
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,300
happened in the summer when she was 32 years old.

38
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:54,480
I'll take the picture now. Look at the camera. One, two, three.

39
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,510
 Incident name, Hong Na Ri Wedding Incident. 
    

40
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,100
- I'm getting married in the spring. March. 
 - With that woman?

41
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,200
Incident summary. When she heard that her ex-boyfriend Ji Wu Gi, whom she ran into at her friend Hong Na Ri's wedding,

42
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,880
was getting married,

43
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,710
What the hell is that crazy bastard saying?

44
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,520
 Sensitivity got shocked and went nuts. 

45
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,340
Actually, I'm getting married soon, too.

46
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,300
- Really? 
 - Yes. I think I'll do it next year as well.

47
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,700
But you'll probably be first. It hasn't been long since I was proposed to.

48
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,060
Oh, I forgot my ring. Actually, we're planning on going abroad to have a small wedding.

49
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,570
We're thinking about Hawaii for the location.

50
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,100
 After she lied like crazy, 

51
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,830
Congratulations.

52
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,420
 she got caught by Gu Wung, her boyfriend at that time. 

53
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,140
Wow, so embarrassing!

54
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,460
I never thought Yumi would have such a dark past.

55
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,250
Ma'am, so what happened?

56
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,980
And I'd like to congratulate you.

57
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,320
- For what? 
 - I heard you're getting married soon.

58
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,820
Oh.

59
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,930
I just heard that you're getting married next year.

60
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,140
Yes, that's right.

61
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,640
Yes, thank you.

62
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,480
Yumi, let's go in. I think the ceremony started.

63
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,620
Which island in Hawaii are you having it at?

64
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,390
I'm thinking about doing a small wedding abroad as well.

65
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,990
I envy you. Which island are you thinking about having it at?

66
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,490
- Sorry? 
 - It's the Hawaii island.

67
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,570
So which one in Hawaii?

68
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,150
There are four main islands in Hawaii.

69
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,520
You said you're having it in Hawaii.

70
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,080
Right...

71
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,930
Of course we want to have it in Hawaii.

72
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,750
That's why we're contemplating which one we should pick.

73
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,500
Which company did you contact? I'm thinking about it too, so can you share with me?

74
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,900
But we're running late, so we should head inside.

75
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,440
- Right. 
 - I'll let you know later at the reception. 
 - Sure.

76
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,830
Yumi, let's go.

77
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,810
You know... you were surprised, right?

78
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:36,250
So what happened was that he kept saying weird things. He's crazy.

79
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,720
He kept saying nonsense so I couldn't just not say anything. So Wung—

80
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,670
Was that him? The one you dated for seven years then broke up because he cheated on you.

81
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,250
It must be that jerk.

82
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,360
I thought so.

83
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:04,850
He said that he's getting married and that he hoped I won't be hurt.

84
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,700
He was saying that nonsense and I didn't realize...

85
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,160
Let's go in.

86
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,030
Dearest brothers and sisters,

87
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:32,590
to the servants of the Lord who married in the name of Christ...

88
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:37,080
Yumi, your boyfriend is so cool!

89
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,690
Hey, his style was nice.

90
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,900
He's so much better than Ji Wu Gi. You got a great one after the trash.

91
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,510
He's not that great.

92
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,420
He was nice. He's so much better than in the picture.

93
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,200
 He created everything with His omnipotent power... 

94
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,590
 I looked it up and there really are four main islands in Hawaii. Shocking. 

95
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,980
 Kaua'i, Maui, Oahu, and Big Island. 

96
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,030
 I'm furiously memorizing just in case that guy talks to me again. 

97
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,610
 Do you like Hawaii? 

98
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,570
 No, I've never been there. 

99
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,820
 So why Hawaii? 

100
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,740
 I don't know. It just came out. 

101
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,750
 I suddenly want to visit Hawaii. 

102
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,290
 Fortunately, the incident was wrapped up well, thanks to Wung being considerate. 

103
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,070
That's a relief.

104
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,950
But it wasn't wrapped up all the way.

105
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,600
Because there was an aftermath.

106
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,070
- An aftermath? 
 - Yes, an aftermath.

107
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:24,520
The Hong Na Ri Wedding Incident didn't just end as an embarrassing event.

108
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,040
Hyeong, are you marrying Seonbae Yumi?

109
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,560
- What? 
 - A friend of mine is Yumi's school hubae,

110
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,840
and he said that there's a rumor among the alumni that she's marrying you next year.

111
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:54,150
I heard everything's planned already, too. You're doing a small wedding abroad.

112
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,380
- Is that true? 
 - Uhhhhh...

113
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,790
What do you mean uhhh?

114
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,790
Is that true or not?

115
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,820
If it's true, I'm in favor of this marriage.

116
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,190
I won't comment.

117
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,100
What the heck? You're making me curious.

118
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,950
Ask Yumi, then.

119
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,970
Huh? So you're not denying it.

120
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,130
I said no comment.

121
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,810
Have you been to Hawaii? There are four main islands in Hawaii.

122
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,550
Wow, you're serious.

123
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,840
  Yumi, congratulations! I heard you were getting married? 

124
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,330
 Yumi! Congrats on your wedding. Rumor has it that your boyfriend is really handsome. 

125
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,500
 I heard you're having the wedding in Hawaii. I'm so envious. 

126
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,090
  But guys... I think you misunderstood the rumors.  

127
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,870
 I don't know when we will have it. 

128
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,210
 I heard it's going to be next spring. 

129
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,410
  No, I was saying that it might be the case  

130
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:02,960
but it is not confirmed at all.

131
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,290
 Yumi, are you getting married? Awesome! 

132
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,610
This is seriously killing me.

133
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,750
Seonbae!

134
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,250
Oh, Wu Gi!

135
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,370
Can I ask you just one thing?

136
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,840
I heard some rumors that you're getting marr—

137
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,190
I'm not getting married! I'm not. It's just a fake rumor.

138
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,340
What do you mean marriage? It hasn't been long since we've met.

139
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,790
Isn't the rumor itself laughable?

140
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,070
I really don't know who spread that rumor...

141
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,320
I know, right?

142
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,890
- Huh?

143
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,150
Really, fake news is going crazy.

144
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:55,070
It's a scary world, right?

145
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,790
  And this incident became a trauma to Yumi. 

146
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,930
It's Louis!

147
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,960
- Hello! 
 - Oh?

148
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,520
What's happening?

149
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,490
Hello...

150
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,680
Good thing, I was going to buy food for Louis too. Do you want some?

151
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,040
Yes ... No ... Are you two getting married?

152
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,830
You're one step behind.

153
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,380
I heard you were getting married next spring?

154
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,970
That was so long ago.

155
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:42,440
I just heard it. I heard it after pooping in the restroom.

156
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,570
You're a traitor.

157
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,650
I'm going to buy the sandwich.

158
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:51,020
I'm going to buy you the same thing as mine. This one is really good.

159
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,540
Who told you this?

160
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,320
May I take your order?

161
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,250
Yes...Uh...

162
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,570
 Marriage became a taboo word between the two of them. 

163
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,950
  The aftermath blew up into the cell village as well. 

164
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:14,210
I will now make a judgment regarding the Hong Na Ri wedding incident case.

165
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,010
Defendant, Sensitivity cell.

166
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:20,330
The Defendant used Reaction #1 without the consent of the cells.

167
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,340
She turned Yumi into a liar,

168
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,220
and made Yumi's credibility drop significantly.

169
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,150
Because she almost broke the relationship with Wung

170
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:32,880
and acted dangerously, she is found guilty.

171
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,340
  Reaction #1 was prohibited indefinitely from being used.  

172
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,390
  And Sensitivity was in solitary confinement for a month. 

173
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,320
- Sensitivity! 
 - Oh, Reason!

174
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,320
It's tough, right?

175
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,860
It's bearable.

176
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,390
Why did you do such a thing? I stopped you.

177
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,060
It's fine. I don't regret it.

178
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,970
- What? 
 - I'm sure about Wung this time.

179
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,050
Reason, could you deliver this for me?

180
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,240
I will put this on here.

181
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,610
Bulletin board! Please stick this on.

182
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,410
Keep up the good work.

183
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,600
What? Again?

184
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,140
  I want to get married with Wung. 

185
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,890
Why do so many stories like this keep coming in these days?

186
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,090
- What's that? 
 - I wonder too.

187
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,050
So, how did that work out?

188
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,420
What do you mean?

189
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,110
Did Yumi and Wung end up getting married in Hawaii the following year?

190
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:11,490
If you want to know that, you will need to read 33 books of the encyclopedia, right?

191
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,500
I saw a wedding picture earlier.

192
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,830
Really? Of whom?

193
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,250
Well it was—

194
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,760
Guys! This incident didn't stop there.

195
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,210
It brought about

196
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,500
two really important developments in Yumi's life.

197
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,280
Your order is here.

198
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,350
- Thank you! 
  - Enjoy the food. 

199
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,330
Wung, from tomorrow I'm starting to exercise.

200
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,140
- Exercise? 
 - I told you I was going to do a half-marathon.

201
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,580
I have to start training my body now.

202
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:59,990
This delicious overly sweet drink is my last dinner. I need to take care of myself starting from tomorrow.

203
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,400
We might not be able to see each other often because I have to run.

204
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,330
Don't be too sad and cry.

205
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,730
Aren't you overdoing it?

206
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,750
I'm not.

207
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:16,530
 One was that she wanted to give an impression of a cool girlfriend who is not focused on marriage, 

208
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,400
 so she started training for a marathon. 

209
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:32,110
  Si Yeon, are you looking at this? This is my boyfriend! 

210
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,020
  I got the bouquet!  

211
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,660
  Na Ri, congrats! Have a happy life! 

212
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,950
#I'lldryit #andgiveit #backtoyou.* 
  (Something Korean girls do when they get the bouquet; also means she will take good care of it) 

213
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,220
The other one,

214
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,960
was that it awakened Sae Yi's own heart.

215
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,110
  I'm never going to get married! 

216
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,450
  But if someday I do get married, 

217
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,700
 It will probably be to Gu Wung. 

218
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,020
  But if someday I do get married, it will probably be to Gu Wung. 

219
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,950
  Wung, I just arrived! 

220
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,540
Yumi, did you arrive already?

221
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,710
  The bus arrived quickly.  

222
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,490
I'm going out now. It will take me 15 minutes.

223
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,790
  Take your time coming! 

224
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,750
Okay. Just wait for a bit.

225
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,790
  Sae Yi 
 Wung, are you at home now? 

226
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,410
  Yes. 

227
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,280
 I have a favor to ask you. 

228
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,810
  What is it? 

229
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,520
  Could you lend me a hammer? 

230
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,140
  A hammer? 

231
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,620
 I have some nails to hammer,  but I don't have a hammer at home. 

232
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,850
  Just go to the supermarket and buy one.  

233
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,770
  I need it right now. Can I stop by your place? 

234
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,600
What is she saying?

235
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,510
  You're coming here? 

236
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,170
  Yes.  

237
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,590
 But I have to go out right now. 

238
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,450
  I'll come right away.  

239
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,600
What the heck? She's coming right away?

240
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,360
Her house is far from here. Anyway, that's up to her.

241
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,700
Who is it?

242
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,900
Wung, it's me!

243
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,530
Who...?

244
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,570
It's me, Sae Yi!

245
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,130
- Huh? 
- The hammer.

246
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,140
What the heck? You said you were home.

247
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,680
- How did you—
 - I moved in yesterday.

248
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,160
- What? 
 - You probably didn't hear about it because you were at your parents' house for several days.

249
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,970
Louis knows.

250
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,950
What did you just say?

251
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,440
I moved here to the 5th floor. Unit 503.

252
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,400
I thought you knew.

253
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,730
No wonder, I was sad that you didn't contact me when I moved in.

254
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,390
Let's get along well in the future, good neighbor!

255
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,520
The hammer, please.

256
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:19,330
It costs too much to take a taxi back and forth whenever I work overtime.

257
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,340
And it's tiring.

258
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,770
My mom told me to get my own place instead.

259
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,230
You told me how it was living in this officetel some months ago.

260
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,780
I don't think I have ever told you that living here is great.

261
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,570
There were no other places like here.

262
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,580
It's close to the company and it's clean since it's new.

263
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,110
Come eat for dinner now and then.

264
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,010
- Dinner? 
 - I always cook my own food.

265
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,800
Don't eat delivery food, if you're hungry come.

266
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,660
I  just have to put another pair of chopsticks on the table.

267
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,560
Here you are.

268
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,260
I can bring it back to you tomorrow, right? I have a lot of nails to hammer.

269
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,830
Do as you please.

270
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,950
Ah, that's right! Are you busy now?

271
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,520
I have plans right now.

272
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,970
Couldn't you just hammer one nail for me before you go?

273
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,580
I have to put a clock on the wall but it's too high.

274
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,990
You can't?

275
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,600
Please do it before you go. Uh?

276
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,550
Wung!

277
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,220
You waited a while, right? Sorry.

278
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,350
You said it would take you 15 minutes. Turns out it took you 30 minutes, Gu Wung.

279
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:46,640
- Ah... Well. That's because... 
 - Huh?

280
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,330
Yumi, you know...

281
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,710
What?

282
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,140
What?

283
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,280
It's nothing.

284
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,350
What do you mean "it's nothing?"

285
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,810
No, never mind. Let's go, we'll be late.

286
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,310
What do you mean never mind?

287
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,190
 That's how the Hong Na Ri incident 

288
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,720
led to other important events such as Sae Yi's heart was awakened

289
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,760
and Yumi started training for a marathon.

290
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,090
Wow.

291
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,780
Ma'am. So, Yumi started training for the marathon?

292
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,190
Why is this important?

293
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,160
Well, that's...

294
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:37,750
  Episode 22 
 Yumi's guards 

295
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,090
What the heck? It's getting cold already?

296
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,200
♫  I feel like I'm in Paris or anywhere.  ♫

297
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:58,260
♫  Having just woken up from a dream I  ♫

298
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,870
♫  Feel like I'm crazy or anyway  ♫

299
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,990
♫   I'm together with you holding hands  ♫

300
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:12,320
♫  like I'm in anywhere  ♫

301
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,260
Ah, I'm tired.

302
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,540
  Good morning! Are you up? 

303
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,380
  Of course, I'm currently at the park. 

304
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,120
The park?

305
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,260
  At such a time, why? 

306
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,360
  I told you that I would be training for the half-marathon starting from today. 

307
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,490
  Ah, that's right. You said so. 

308
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,110
  I see that you don't pay attention to your girlfriend haha  

309
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:12,140
 Don't pay attention? I found out what middle school you went to. 

310
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,200
  Where is it? 

311
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,140
Sport High school.* (T/N :  A pun mixing 'middle school' and 'sport' in Korean also means I'm doing exercise right now).

312
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,110
What the heck.

313
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,750
  I know what middle school you went to, too. 

314
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,080
  Where is it? 

315
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,500
  Love high school.* (T/N: Pun mixing 'middle school' and 'relationship' in Korean also means I'm in a relationship) 

316
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,970
  Correct! 

317
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,930
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

318
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,600
Pardon?

319
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,790
Do you know where the park exit is?

320
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,650
If you go that way, you'll find the exit.

321
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,480
Thank you.

322
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,170
  Sorry, someone just asked me for directions. 

323
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,760
  A man? 

324
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,620
  What a jealous guy. 

325
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,290
  A young man? 

326
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:22,520
  I don't know I don't remember  

327
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,130
  He's so handsome! 

328
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:29,920
  He looks good! 

329
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,530
  Today's lunch is a new curry restaurant. 

330
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:38,280
 #goodrestaurantatwork, #mytaste, #goodcurryrestaurant,  #curryrice 

331
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,060
Eonni, did you see it earlier?

332
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,000
I saw it! 
 - Saw what?

333
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,300
The guy who served us when we ate curry.

334
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,860
The cutie at the curry place, he was so handsome.

335
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,900
Right? We're going to have to go back tomorrow.

336
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,740
Yeah, he's totally super handsome.

337
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,130
What? Who are you talking about?

338
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,180
That part-timer at the curry place. Our server.

339
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,490
The part-timer at the curry place?

340
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,640
Who ordered shrimp fry curry?

341
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,040
Me, me.

342
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,940
I should take pics.

343
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,650
Me.

344
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,890
Do you need anything else?

345
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,070
- We're good. 
 - Enjoy your meal.

346
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:24,470
- Thank you. 
 - We'll enjoy it.

347
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,640
- We'll enjoy it.  
 - Let's dig in. It looks good.

348
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,070
Right. I guess it was a young guy.

349
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,410
What? You didn't see him?

350
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,400
I don't remember his face.

351
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,450
How can you not remember that face? It was legendary.

352
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,820
I was busy taking pics. You should have told me if he was that handsome.

353
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,440
He came over so many times. He brought water and banchan and stuff.

354
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,040
He did?

355
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,180
Why did I not know?

356
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,280
I must have been too busy eating.

357
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,380
I was starving since I trained for the marathon this morning.

358
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,730
 That's not it. It's not because she was too busy eating. 

359
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:08,100
 It's because Men Reconnaissance Team is not working these days. 

360
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,690
 They always observe everywhere and spy if there are any cute guys, 

361
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:16,890
Hmm? 5 o'clock. Spotted totally Yumi's style!

362
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,130
Hmm? Where? Where?

363
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,340
 Yumi, to your 5 o'clock. Turn your head. 

364
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,850
Sir, please go to Yeonnam-dong.

365
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:39,280
 Yumi, on your right! On the right side mirror! 

366
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:47,020
 Their main task is to find guys who are Yumi's style. 

367
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:53,920
Reason, since Yumi's got a boyfriend now, we'll take a short break.

368
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,970
You won't need us for a while, right?

369
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,840
Okay. Then when will you get back?

370
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,830
When Yumi gets lonely again.

371
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,120
- Have fun! 
 - Aloha!

372
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,160
Wung!

373
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,650
Yumi.

374
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,750
You're early.

375
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,210
Yumi!

376
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:34,570
- Are you okay? 
 - Ow, it hurts.

377
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:48,580
You tend to fall often. Please be more careful.

378
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,060
Why? Does it still hurt?

379
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,180
Wung, should we order fried chicken?

380
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,220
No, maybe pizza might be better.

381
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,750
No, let's eat chicken. There is a really good place nearby.

382
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,850
No, pizza...

383
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,350
We can order both chicken and pizza.

384
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,620
Wung.

385
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,530
What now?

386
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,570
My heart just fluttered.

387
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:24,780
Then let's eat chicken and pizza.

388
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,260
Did you order something already?

389
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,330
I must have a package.

390
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,810
A package?

391
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,780
Oh, it's matching shirts.

392
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:44,660
Yeah, I was looking for workout clothes, then bought them. Thought it'd be nice to wear it together and work out.

393
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,510
The yellow one is mine.

394
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,490
The blue one is yours.

395
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,060
Let's see.

396
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,810
- It's nice. 
 - Right?

397
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,240
- Try it on. 
 - Now?

398
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,690
Yes, so I could see if it fits. If it doesn't, I should return it.

399
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,210
Okay.

400
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:22,420
♫  t's not about something I can understand  ♫

401
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,730
♫  To me who spent a day I couldn't even imagine  ♫

402
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,950
Oh? You have a mole on your back.

403
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,460
On my back? I don't have a mole on my back.

404
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,060
You do. Right there.

405
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,650
Where?

406
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,120
Here.

407
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,610
Coming, who is it?

408
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,450
What? Who called me?

409
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,560
Here's the mole.

410
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,010
- The chicken... 
 - Hmm?

411
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,280
Can you order it later?

412
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,310
Should I just order the pizza first?

413
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,900
No.

414
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:15,770
♫  Sing me a song song song song song ♫

415

421

 Let's go! 

422
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,810
 With no sign of Men Reconnaissance Team's long-term vacation ending, 

423
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:09,320
 - Yumi's Guards returned to the village instead. 
   - Let's go   

424
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,440
Excuse me!

425
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,140
What was that? Who is that?

426
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,740
Who is it?

427
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,820
Me?

428
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,850
Yes. Well. I was just wondering.

429
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,540
Are you Kim Yumi?

430
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,430
Who is it? Do you know them?

431
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,850
- No. 
 - You don't know him either?

432
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,820
If an unknown man says "excuse me,"

433
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,040
it's my turn to step up.

434
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:58,360
This is an order. Lock the door of her heart immediately and put all cells on high alert.

435
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,660
Security alert!

436
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,200
- You never know. He might ask for her number– 
 - Guard!

437
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,000
- What? 
 - Wait! Wait!

438
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:17,330
Don't do that. Instead, let's see if he is on the list of men you know.

439
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:20,030
Isn't it rude not to recognize someone you already know?

440
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:23,240
That's true. That would be a problem.

441
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,650
But. Does Yumi really know that many men?

442
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,420
It's not this one.

443
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,290
It's this one. The number of men she knows.

444
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,770
 Who? 

445
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:43,920
 He's not there. He's a face that she doesn't recognize.  He's not on the list. 

446
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,920
How did you know my name?

447
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,260
You are Assistant Manager Kim Yumi, right?

448
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,480
Hello! I'm Assistant Manager Yu Ba Bi from the marketing department.

449
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,810
Ah! Yes.

450
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,350
Hello.

451
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:00,150
I saw you a few times and thought you looked familiar, I was right.

452
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:03,390
Last time, I even asked you for directions.

453
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,050
Did you?

454
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,040
Um. Yes.

455
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,290
Anyway, it's nice to meet a co-worker living in the same neighborhood.

456
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,490
Sure. Sure.

457
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,540
Well, I'll see you next time.

458
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,110
Sure! Goodbye.

459
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,550
Oh wait! By chance

460
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,400
Yes?

461
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:36,510
I knew it! You punk.  You're busted!

462
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,560
By chance.

463
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,100
By chance what? What?

464
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,770
Is it an attempt to get into Yumi's heart? No way! Not as long as I'm here!

465
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:53,610
Look here. I'm sorry but Yumi has a boyfriend!

466
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,720
Yes?

467
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,000
Did you lose an umbrella?

468
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,020
Excuse me?

469
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,880
It looks like a fried egg.

470
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,480
Oh my! That's mine. Fried egg!

471
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,810
Yes. It is mine!

472
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,620
We found the umbrella!

473
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,030
We found it! It was expensive!

474
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,740
That's great, Stingy.

475
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,360
Guard! I think you can lower your guns.

476
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,200
But I still can't let go of my guard!

477
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,030
He could say something like "I found your umbrella, so please buy me a cup of coffee."

478
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,870
You are busted.

479
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,870
What is he doing?

480
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,510
I thought it was gone so I had given up on it!

481
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,080
That's such a relief!

482
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,310
I found it in the company lobby, so it's at the office. I will bring it to the accounting team tomorrow.

483
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:45,350
No, you don't have to. I'll go to the marketing department.

484
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,000
Your name was written under the handle.

485
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,610
Yes! Yes! You're right.

486
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:53,700
I also didn't notice, but my girlfriend saw it and told me.

487
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,680
Ah!

488
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,460
He has a girlfriend.

489
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:04,680
Hey! Hey! He has a girlfriend. Are you going to continue doing that?

490
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,340
If that's the case then- Ow!

491
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,320
Security alert cancelled.

492
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,250
It was an umbrella I really loved.

493
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,920
- Thank you. 
 - Don't mention it.

494
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,690
Then, I'll leave it at the lobby information desk.

495
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,920
Hello. 
 Yes. Hello.

496
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,810
Assistant Manager Yu Babi from the marketing team left an umbrella for me?

497
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,220
Ahh. Yes.

498
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,830
- Are you Assistant Manager Kim Yumi? 
 - Yes, that's me.

499
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,000
Thank you!

500
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,320
It's really nice to see you.

501
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,490
Yumi!

502
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,500
Hi, Yi Da.

503
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,230
Oh? Your umbrella!

504
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,460
I found it! I thought I had lost it.

505
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:25,910
Where did you find it? I thought you couldn't find it anywhere?

506
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:30,670
Someone from marketing left it in the lobby for me.

507
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,210
Oh really?

508
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:34,900
That's great!

509
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:40,850
Do you know Assistant Manager Yu Ba Bi in the marketing department?

510
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,930
- Yu Ba Bi? 
 - Yes.

511
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:46,190
A man named Yu Ba Bi found it for me.

512
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:49,080
I may have seen him a few times here, but I've never seen him before.

513
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,750
The Assistant Manager Yu Ba Bi who transferred here from the Jeju branch last month?

514
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:57,600
He came from Jeju branch. No wonder he looked unfamiliar.

515
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:03,160
Assistant Manager Yu Ba Bi, who is the second most handsome man of Daehan Noodles, found your umbrella?

516
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,660
Handsome man? That guy?

517
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,510
Hey! He is good looking!

518
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:12,720
Is he? By the way, he lives in my neighborhood.

519
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,940
What?

520
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,600
The second most handsome man in the company found your umbrella

521
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,690
and he happens to live, of all places, in your neighborhood too?

522
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:25,290
Anyway, I'm really glad he found it. It's a good thing that I wrote my name on it.

523
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,260
Hey, can I touch it just once?

524
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,320
Good morning! Oh! You found your umbrella.

525
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,320
She found it.

526
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,490
 Hot chocolate 

527
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,390
Hello!

528
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,110
Hello!

529
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,860
Did you get your umbrella?

530
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,630
Yes.

531
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,510
Oh! It's the savior who found our prized umbrella!

532
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,690
Should we get the savior a cup of hot cocoa?

533
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,450
Yumi doesn't have any change, I'll have to break a thousand won bill.

534
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,650
You just called him a savior!

535
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:37,230
Would you like some? It's hot chocolate.

536
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,950
Ah. Thank you.

537
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,870
The weather is cold today.

538
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,800
It is.

539
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,950
You haven't worked out at night for a few days, right? I don't think I've seen you.

540
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,190
I only come out when my boyfriend is busy.

541
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:12,530
Me too. Because I don't have anything to do when I'm not meeting my girlfriend.

542
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,830
I see.

543
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,870
She's a reporter, but she must be very busy these days.

544
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,560
So these days, I work out on the weekend too.

545
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,240
I see.

546
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,110
It's good to come in the morning on the weekend. There are too many people in the afternoon.

547
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:33,050
I always come in the mornings on the weekends.

548
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,770
I see.

549
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,030
Are you done? Give it to me, I'll throw it away on my way.

550
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,280
It's okay.

551
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,340
Thank you.

552
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,850
I'll see you later. Thanks for the drink.

553
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,920
Sure. Enjoy your workout.

554
00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:00,250
 We met Yu Ba Bi at the park again today. 

555
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,670
The conversation was nothing special.

556
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:13,650
It was a conversation to not feel awkward while drinking hot chocolate.

557
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:17,410
But this part is bothering me a bit.

558
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,720
  It's good to come in the morning on the weekends. There are too many people in the afternoon. 

559
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,790
 I always come in the mornings on the weekends. 

560
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:30,880
Is there a good reason for sharing his schedule?

561
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,060
Is it just a friendly tip as a neighbor?

562
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,760
Or did he want to tell you about his weekend workout schedule?

563
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,070
Is this an ulterior motive or not?

564
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:48,130
I can't decide if I should defend or not.

565
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,900
Hello!

566
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,340
Hello.

567
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,610
Assistant Manager Yumi, you're working on the weekend too.

568
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:38,520
What are you doing?

569
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,330
The sky is so beautiful.

570
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,050
The sky is really clear today.

571
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:50,230
Yes, it's totally an autumn sky.

572
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,880
Your hairstyle has changed.

573
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,580
It's pretty.

574
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:22,050
 Episode 23 : Male Friend, Female Friend? 

575
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,750
About Yu Ba Bi.

576
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,390
I think...

577
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:31,140
No. I should wake Yumi Guards. I don't feel good about this.

578
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,620
Guard! Wake up!

579
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,610
We met Yu Ba Bi on our way to work.

580
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,790
What? That jerk again!

581
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,050
Your hairstyle changed.

582
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,820
It's pretty.

583
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,170
I knew this would happen, that jerk!

584
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:04,940
You're going to attack while I'm asleep? Not a chance.

585
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,380
Yumi Guards, this is an order!

586
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:10,280
Lock the door to heart and be alert!

587
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,870
Again?

588
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:23,760
Excuse me?

589
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,640
Sorry?

590
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,450
What did you just say?

591
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:34,250
How is my outfit today?

592
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,430
- Your outfit? 
 - Yes, it's new.

593
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:42,490
I think it looks good on you.

594
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:46,320
Thank you. Your hair is pretty today, too.

595
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,670
I'll get going first.

596
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:54,850
Wait, wait. What was that? He's leaving.

597
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,840
I guess it was just a compliment without any meaning.

598
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:02,080
Yu Ba Bi, that jerk, is making me uncomfortable.

599
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,930
It's so confusing! How can you tell if he has an ulterior motive or not?

600
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:13,770
Idiot. Should I tell you how?

601
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:15,720
Detective, can you tell the difference?

602
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,870
Of course!

603
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:21,840
It's simple. Think of Yu Ba Bi as a woman.

604
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:27,250
- A woman? 
 - Then won't we be able to see his actions more objectively?

605
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:32,830
By chance...

606
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:34,560
Yes?

607
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,890
Did you lose an umbrella?

608
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:40,050
- Excuse me? 
 - It looks like a fried egg. 
 - Oh, my!

609
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:43,230
That's mine. A fried egg. That is mine!

610
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,220
Right?

611
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:51,210
It's better to come in the mornings on weekends. There are a lot of people in the afternoon.

612
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,960
I always come in the mornings on weekends.

613
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,910
I see.

614
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:00,420
Yes, it's totally an autumn sky.

615
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,860
Your hairstyle changed.

616
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,030
It's so pretty.

617
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:12,160
 Thank you. 

618
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,300
Looks like he just wants to be close.

619
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,830
You're right. It doesn't seem weird when you look at it this way?

620
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:20,310
- Wait! 
 - Huh?

621
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:23,260
If you put it that way, Seo Sae Yi's actions aren't bad either.

622
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,930
That's not acceptable but this is?

623
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,010
Wung, a present.

624
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,870
It's yuja tea.

625
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:36,220
I made it myself. You said you got a cold.

626
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:40,460
 Drink it in the morning and evening. I'm sure you'll get much better. 

627
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:46,840
Wung, let's get this one for Yumi.

628
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,040
Don't you think it'll look good on her?

629
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,430
You think?

630
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:57,450
Oh my.

631
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,390
You have something on you.

632
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:08,670
- No! 
 - That's not right.

633
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:17,050
Wung, do you think my way of thinking is a bit old-fashioned?

634
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,500
Yeah.

635
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,130
Come on, answer me seriously.

636
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:23,560
Seriously?

637
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,790
Yes.

638
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:27,370
Gosh.

639
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,340
Why are you asking all of a sudden?

640
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:34,790
It's just I thought I was a bit conservative when it comes to relationships between women and men.

641
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:38,510
I'm talking about men and women being friends.

642
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:43,660
Not sure. I guess you are a little more cautious.

643
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:48,580
Really? Am I weird?

644
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,320
- Are you going to be done late again today? 
  - Yeah. 

645
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,700
 I think it'd be hard for me to get done early till the end of this month. 

646
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,500
I'll be alone this weekend again.

647
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,390
 Just like last weekend. 

648
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:08,760
Sorry. I'll make sure to finish by this month no matter what.

649
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,280
Okay. Don't work too hard.

650
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,040
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

651
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,100
What should I do today?

652
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,590
Cabbage.

653
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:40,280
Oh right, I'm out of sugar.

654
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:47,250
Aren't you working out today?

655
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,810
What are you doing here?

656
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:58,820
- What would I be doing? I came to the market to grocery shop. 
 - Right.

657
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,620
I guess you and I have similar paths, right?

658
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,040
Is that right?

659
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:11,410
You must be making fish cutlets.

660
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:14,590
Yes, my girlfriend is coming over later.

661
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:17,110
She likes fish cutlets.

662
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:18,470
I see.

663
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:21,000
Do you know where the tartar sauce is?

664
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,420
Tartar sauce...

665
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:29,700
Are you buying it? It's better homemade.

666
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,230
Isn't it hard to make?

667
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:34,450
Not at all. Do you have mayo at home?

668
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:35,770
Yes.

669
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:38,940
You add finely chopped onion and pickle to that.

670
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,840
Chop chop chop, very finely.

671
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,570
Finely chop onion and pickle?

672
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:46,970
Yes, then mix in a boiled egg.

673
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:48,470
Grind the yolk through a sieve.

674
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:51,180
Hold on. You're too fast.

675
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,740
Like this?

676
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:59,130
Yes, then mix in the boiled egg.

677
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:00,170
- Mix. 
 - Right.

678
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,910
Grind the yolk through a sieve.

679
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:05,280
Grind the yolk through a sieve.

680
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,930
Sensitivity, now that I think of it,

681
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:14,540
I think men and women can be friends if done correctly.

682
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:17,140
Then are you saying you accept Sae Yi?

683
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:21,080
If you accept male friends, then shouldn't you also accept female friends, too?

684
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,340
I cannot accept it.

685
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:26,010
I don't like stuff like male friends or female friends.

686
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:30,570
What did else you say to put in earlier? Lemon juice?

687
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:33,600
Yes, one tablespoon of lemon juice.

688
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,920
There she goes again.

689
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,840
- Excuse me for a sec. 
 - Sure.

690
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:47,600
Yeah, it's me.

691
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,420
Then you can't come over today?

692
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:56,660
Where else would I be? I'm grocery shopping.

693
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,400
Then why did you...

694
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,620
Never mind. We'll eat it next time.

695
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,740
It's fine. You must be busy. You should go back.

696
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:14,450
Okay.

697
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,560
She said she can't come all of a sudden.

698
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:23,080
Your girlfriend must be pretty busy.

699
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:28,410
I'm definitely in a relationship but strangely, it seems like I'm more bored now than when I wasn't in a relationship.

700
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,130
Then see you at work.

701
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:49,190
Enjoy your dinner.

702
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:51,660
Sure, good bye.

703
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,370
 I think I know how that feels. 

704
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:16,210
 That lonely feeling from time to time even though you're in a relationship. 

705
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,220
He must be really busy.

706
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:31,280
Thank you for the food.

707
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,540
It's yummy, yummy.

708
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,400
So yummy.

709
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,120
I miss Wung.

710
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:12,570
 Yumi, are you sleeping? 

711
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,300
 No, I'm not sleeping. 

712
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:21,090
 I'm on my way home. 

713
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:23,790
 You got done earlier than I thought. 

714
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,000
 Yeah. What did you do today? 

715
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:34,870
 I made tteokbokki at home, ate, then cleaned up... 

716
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:38,070
Guys.

717
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,740
Should we surprise Wung?

718
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,670
How?

719
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,290
 He wouldn't think that Yumi would come over at this hour. 

720
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:54,180
That's a good idea. Wow, I like things like this.

721
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:58,900
Let's go. Let's go and eat a late night snack together!

722
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:03,060
Let's text Wung that we're going to sleep now, so he'll be surprised.

723
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,410
 You must be tired. Go to bed. 

724
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:09,440
 I should go to bed, too. 

725
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,850
 Okay. Good night. 

726
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,500
 Dream about me. 

727
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:20,430
 Okay, I'll try haha. 

728
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,320
If we show up after this, he'll be surprised, right?

729
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,430
Let's go guys, to see Wung!

730
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:30,890
Let's go see Wung!

731
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:32,830
No!

732
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:35,320
She's already all washed up and you want to go out?

733
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,760
On top of that, I was just about to put a face mask on!

734
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,740
Don't worry. We can take two masks and do it together.

735
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:45,130
You're a genius!

736
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,290
♫  Are you paying attention to me?  ♫

737
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:52,920
We should do this together.

738
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,520
Wung's skin was pretty damaged lately.

739
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:00,420
Yay, head to Wung's place with face masks!

740
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,430
Hold on!

741
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:06,310
It's Monday tomorrow. What about work clothes?

742
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:09,350
Don't tell me you're thinking about going to work in what she's wearing now!

743
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:13,600
No worries. We can bring what she'll wear tomorrow.

744
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,380
- There you go. 
 - Aha!

745
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,050
I should pack clothes for tomorrow.

746
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:21,660
♫  I really want to know how you feel  ♫

747

♫  Close to you  ♫

760
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:56,230
 How should we tease him? Should we hide after we ring the bell? 

761
00:54:56,230 --> 00:55:00,150
♫  I really want to know how you feel ♫

764
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:09,170

♫  I have my hunch that  ♫

766

♫  I want to know how you feel  ♫

768
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,480
 It would be worth seeing his expression. 

769
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,400
 I can't wait to see Wung. 

770
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,420
 Fifth floor. 

771
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:40,750
It's Sae Yi!

772
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:47,360
Oh, Yumi. Hello.

773
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,830
Sae Yi...

774
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,880
Wait. What is this? Why is Sae Yi here?

775
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,400
She got on from the fifth floor. Why?

776
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:10,600
You must be going to Wung's place.

777
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:14,330
So why are you here?

778
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:16,940
I live here.

779
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,580
Didn't you know?

780
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:21,910
I moved here on the fifth floor last month.

781
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:23,660
- Sorry? 
 - Gosh.

782
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,480
Wung must've not told you.

783
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,220
Well, it's nothing he needs to bring up.

784
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,600
I'm going to Wung's, too. I need to borrow something.

785
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,000
What is this? What is going on now?

786
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,380
Sae Yi lives here?

787
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:42,680
Wung never told us.

788
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,940
I'll go find out.

789
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:48,040
What are you talking about?

790
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,550
Sensitivity, don't tell me ... did you escape from prison?

791
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:56,150
Why does Sae Yi live here? Since when? What is this?

792
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:59,840
What have you guys been doing while I was in jail?

793
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:06,610
 Tenth floor. 

794
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,660
Aren't you getting off?

795
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:24,960
What are you doing, Yumi? You've got to say something back!

796
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,200
Why are you mute?

797
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,540
Where is Reaction #1?

798
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:31,390
It's been prohibited because of you.

799
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:33,400
My goodness!

800
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,690
It's my first time living on my own, so there are many things I don't have.

801
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:47,450
I'm borrowing things from Wung.

802
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,890
It's so nice to have a friend as your neighbor, right?

803
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,820
Should I ring?

804
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:00,510
Sure.

805
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,140
You should at least buy your own wine glasses.

806
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,800
Yumi.

807
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,680
We met in the elevator.

808
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,880
She didn't know that I moved.

809
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,770
I used it well.

810
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,740
Thank you.

811
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:35,250
My friend called and said she's bringing wine.

812
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,670
I didn't have any glasses, so I asked for help since it was urgent.

813
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:40,930
- I'll make good use of them. 
 - Sure.

814
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:42,570
See you later, Yumi.

815
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:44,420
Good bye.

816
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:48,260
Oh right.

817
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:54,390
Yumi, I'm planning a house warming party. Please come.

818
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:58,170
Sure, invite me.

819
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,950
I'll come.

820
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:02,990
Then have a good time.

821
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:04,760
Good night.

822
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,480
Yumi.

823
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:15,820
How are you here all of a sudden? You said you were going to bed.

824
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,990
Come in.

825
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:26,140
Come in, Yumi.

826
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:35,070


827
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:45,000
Come in.

♫  I haven't changed  ♫

830
00:59:55,060 --> 01:00:00,110
What did I say? Male friend? Female friend? Yeah right!

831
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:04,380
There is no such a thing. I was right!

832
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,290
Sensitivity, please be quiet.

833
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:08,390
You're a fugitive. Why are you so loud?

834
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:14,790
I am just so mad! I trusted Wung.

835
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:17,710
I was certain!

♫  Oh love,  ♫

 Yumi's Cells Previe 

848
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:26,470
 She's acting like your girlfriend pretending to be your friend. 

849
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:27,440
 No! 

850
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,510
 I'm worried that you're not happy dating but only getting stressed out. 

851
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:33,880
 No, no. Pull yourself together, Wung! 

852
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:38,080
 We used to have a very special relationship. 

853
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,090
 I don't have any kind of ability to get rid Seo Sae Yi. 

854
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:44,700
 But it's my choice to not see him if I don't want to or to keep seeing him if I want to. 

855
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,060
 From now on, Yumi will carry breakup card. 

856
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:52,940
 Right, I had something to ask you. What are you doing on Christmas?
