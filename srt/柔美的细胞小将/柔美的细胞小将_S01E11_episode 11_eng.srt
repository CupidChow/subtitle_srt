 Yumi 
 A tvN original series 

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:13,940


3
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,380
 Yumi's Cells

00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:51,820
  Episode 30 
 What's wrong, Wung? 

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,000
What's wrong?

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,760
What's wrong?

7
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,880
What's wrong?

8
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,440
What's wrong?

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,990
What's wrong?

10
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,320
I am Wung's training cell.

11
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,380
I practice saying "What's wrong?" all day long.

12
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,260
What's wrong?

13
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,200
What's wrong? What's—

14
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,870
What's wrong?

15
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:18,100
But, I don't really know when to use these words.

16
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,720
What's wrong?

17
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,580
What's wrong?

18
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,700
It's my duty to learn the tradition that has been passed down and spread it to future generations.

19
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,530
What's wrong?

20
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,290
What's— Damn it!

21
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,030
Tradition or whatever. I'm sick of it!

22
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,270
What are you doing not practicing?

23
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,810
Master, I want to do something productive like other cells.

24
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,940
Not useless things like this.

25
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,840
You rascal!

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,940
It is also important to train to say "What's wrong".

27
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,660
Why aren't you immediately getting back up?

28
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,260
What on earth does "what's wrong" mean?

29
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,740
What's so important about it that I have to train like this?

30
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:08,120
"What's wrong" is something Wung's mom passed onto him.

31
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,500
His mom?

32
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,640
That's right. When Wung's mom said "what's wrong" softly,

33
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,400
Wung's sharp dad

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,780
used to melt like snow.

35
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,250
"What's wrong" isn't a useless technique.

36
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,840
It's the greatest one ever.

37
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,170
When someday Wung finds himself in a critical situation,

38
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,560
that would be the day

39
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,400
you can go down the mountain.

40
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,350
Please do it as quickly as possible.

41
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,180
Yes, don't worry.

42
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,020
- I'll contact you.
 - Thank you.

43
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,300
I put my apartment up for sale.

44
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,260
You're going to sell your place to get funds?

45
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,650
What are you going to do?

46
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,480
There's no other way.

47
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,840
I don't even have money to pay the monthly rent for the office starting from the new year.

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,200
Still, selling your house...

49
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,380
I was going to tell you to try to contact Sae Yi.

50
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,150
Why would I?

51
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,410
Sae Yi's company said they were interested in our game.

52
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,150
So if it doesn't work out, you should consider selling it to th—

53
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,280
According to whom? I'm never selling it.

54
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,210
Since you don't have money.

55
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,760
I told you I selling my house. You don't have to worry about it.

56
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,800
I didn't know this would be this hard.

57
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,200
It's really not easy to start up a company.

58
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,450
Why aren't things going the way we want?

59
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:58,990
Honestly, I don't have any money to contribute so I can't really say much,

60
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,330
but don't you miss those days

61
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,280
when we used to get paid monthly and ate warm meals?

62
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,560
This is the last box. Please check that there isn't anything left.

63
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,670
All right, thank you.

64
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,170
♫  I looked forward to your heart  ♫

65
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,590
 That's fabric softener! 

66
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,020
♫  It finally returned.  ♫

67
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:20,820
♫  I want to be comforted  ♫

68
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,740
 SLW Studio 

69
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:51,770
♫  I was looking forward to your heart  ♫

70
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,200
♫  It finally returned.  ♫

71

72

♫  Before we get farther apart  ♫

73
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,730
 Did you make it home safely? 

74
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,150
  Yes, where are you?  

75
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,690
 I'm at home. 

76
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,990
 Did you eat? 

77
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,920
 Yes, a little. 

78
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,690
Hey, Yumi.

79
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,000
Were you sleeping?

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,390
No, I'm not sleeping yet.

81
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,050
Where are you right now?

82
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,730
I'm home.

83
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:20,000
Wung, I'm in front of your house right now.

84
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,110
What?

85
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,070
You're not home, are you?

86
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,510
 Where are you? 

87
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,770
Wung, what's going on?

88
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,640
Yumi.

89
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,770
You sold your apartment?

90
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,890
Yes.

91
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,780
When?

92
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,680
About a month ago.

93
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,050
Did you sell your house to develop your company?

94
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,530
I ran out of funds.

95
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,960
I had no other choice.

96
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,170
And you didn't tell me that something this big was going on?

97
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,420
It's not a big deal. It's something everybody encounters when starting up a company.

98
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,370
How can this be not a big deal,

99
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,020
when you're living without a home like this?

100
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,710
Look at yourself. With your beard and your sleeping bag.

101
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,800
What the hell is this...

102
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,020
I'm growing my beard longer on purpose, so it doesn't count.

103
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,190
You're joking at a time like this?

104
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,220
I'm asking if you are joking at a time like this?

105
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,790
Am I really your girlfriend?

106
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,810
Why do you always keep secrets from me whenever something important happens?

107
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,760
Master!

108
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,260
Master, something serious is going on in the village right now.

109
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,770
Something big must have happened.

110
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,710
The time has come for you to go down the mountain.

111
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,150
Go stop what is about to happen to Wung and come back.

112
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,280
Pardon? Are you talking about me?

113
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,930
How?

114
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,960
It's cold.

115
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,370
Use "what's wrong?".

116
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,180
What?!

117
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,450
 'What's wrong?' isn't a technique to calm or appease people. 

118
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:48,130
 It's a technique telling that our relationship is very precious. 

119
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,680
 So the true 'what's wrong' technique, 

120
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,000
 should contain fear. 

121
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,520
 The fear that she could leave him. 

122
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,260
 Send that feeling to her. 

123
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,320
 Seriously but not bluntly. 

124
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,410
 Softly but not lightly. 

125
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,230
 With the fear that 

126
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,710
 this precious relationship might break. 

127
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,030
What's wrong?

128
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,750
Yumi, what's wrong?

129
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,370
What's wrong?

130
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,400
Seriously...

131
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,390
What's wrong? Huh?

132
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,810
I stopped it. I stopped it!

133
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,430
Master! "What's wrong?" worked!

134
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,780
I stopped it!

135
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,000
Gu Wung, seriously you...

136
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,800
What should I do with you?

137
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,750
What the hell is all this?

138
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,540
This place isn't too bad. I can save commuting time.

139
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,380
So this is why you told me that

140
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,120
I shouldn't jump into new things so carelessly.

141
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,460
 Starting new work is good, but it's something you've never done before. 

142
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,360
 I think it's better to keep improving on what you're good at now. 

143
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,240
 Life doesn't go the way you want. 

144
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,900
 I think we should always prepare for the worst. 

145
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,570
It's not easy.

146
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,180
I'm telling you from experience.

147
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,790
I left a stable, well-paying company.

148
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:32,770
But a lot of things happened, that I hadn't foreseen when I left .

149
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:41,090
So, since you regret doing it, you think I'll regret transferring, too?

150
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,740
I don't regret it because I will succeed in the end.

151
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:52,380
But there are too many obstacles.

152
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:57,320
So I meant that it'd be hard to endure unless you are really determined.

153
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,310
I like what I do, so I can endure it, but you're not sure

154
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,540
if you really like marketing.

155
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,780
That's what I meant.

156
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,300
Think about if it's something that you like so much that you won't regret it

157
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,440
even if something were to happen.

158
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,520
Okay.

159
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,030
I got it, so let's go to my place for now.

160
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,020
You can't live here like this.

161
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,870
I don't want to.

162
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,190
Why not?

163
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:42,830
I don't like the idea of moving in with my girlfriend because I have nowhere to go.

164
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,890
It's a fact that you have nowhere to go.

165
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:53,560
I didn't go broke or fail, I just chose to be uncomfortable for a little bit for the sake of my dream.

166
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,140
It's a choice I made.

167
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,060
Please understand.

168
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,130
 Gu Wung, you seriously ... 

169
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,480
- He's proud, even though he has no other plan. 
 - Still, he has a sense of responsibility.

170
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,130
Let's just go. We have to think about his pride too.

171
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,340
Does pride feed you? Provide shelter?

172
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,200
How can we just leave after seeing this?

173
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,380
Wung is right. We can't just move in together without thinking about it.

174
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,290
We don't know what obstacles we'll face when we live together.

175
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,580
And we might regret it later. But at that point we won't be able to tell him to leave.

176
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,730
He said you won't regret it if it's something that you like.

177
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,640
Don't we like Wung?

178
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,630
Then why are you worrying in advance that we might regret it?

179
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,180
You're good with your words.

180
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,080
Let's go.

181
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,400
I'm not going, Yumi.

182
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,160
You're really not coming?

183
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,600
I'll just stay here until I find a place. It's really comfortable here.

184
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,910
- Yeah? 
 - Yeah.

185
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,320
Even if you won't see me again?

186
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,430
- What? 
 - Even if this moment is our last moment together?

187
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,040
What the heck? Are you threatening me?

188
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,810
Even if it's not a threat and I really mean it?

189
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:28,140
- Yumi, what's wrong? 
 - Stop that now.

190
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,910
 "What's wrong" isn't working anymore. 

191
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:34,350
Maybe it doesn't work twice in a row? What should I do?

192
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,020
I will be back, Master.

193
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,090
- Hold on. Let me teach you another killer move. 
 - What?

194
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,520
Wung's mom's killer move is 'what's wrong'.

195
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:58,510
And this is Wung's dad's killer move.

196
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,990
 If there is a crisis where 'what's wrong' doesn't work, 

197
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:14,240
 then say your name at the last moment. 

198
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,340
I'm not just saying this.

199
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,320
Pack up now.

200
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,500
Wung (Okay).

201
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,730
You're coming with me?

202
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,760
Wung (Yes).

203
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,300
 Obedience is the only way to survive. 

204
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,440
Let's shave your beard first thing when we get home.

205
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,070
Wung (Okay).

206
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,750
Let's go.

207
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,270
But I'm really growing my beard—

208
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,850
Wung (Okay).

209
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:20,560
 With the superior genes of the Gu family, Wung safely averted the crisis. 

210
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,390
 But there is still a long way to go. 

211
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,720
 Wung's hardships will continue on in the future, 

212
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,210
 and my training won't stop either. 

213
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,610
 Wake up! 

214
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,760
 Wake up! 

215
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,240
 Wake up! 

216
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,470
 Wake up! 

217
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,090
Shoot! I'm late!

218
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,260
You should've woken me if you were up already.

219
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,550
I did wake you but you said you can sleep more.

220
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,720
That was sleep talking!

221
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,500
What do you want for breakfast?

222
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,310
I don't know! I'm not eating.

223
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,090
Yumi, eat this before you go.

224
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,300
No, I'm late.

225
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,840
You're not late yet. I'll get a cab and drop you off on my way. It'll only take 20 minutes.

226
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,810
You're broke. What cab?

227
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,570
What do you mean? I'm rich in cash because I sold my place.

228
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,000
- I can ride the cab hundreds of times. 
 - Aigoo.

229
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,720
Sit.

230
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,770
But Wung, I'm going to transfer to the marketing department.

231
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,310
I made up my mind.

232
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,700
Did you give it a lot of thought?

233
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,460
Not a lot but I want to try it.

234
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,070
I'm not responsible if you regret it.

235
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,600
Well, just because you have a clear goal, it doesn't mean you will be successful.

236
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,890
I don't know, but after trying it, I might like it,

237
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,920
and I might have a new goal while trying it.

238
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,570
Don't you think?

239
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,290
You're right. Eat.

240
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:13,750
 Actually, many important things in life often start unexpectedly. 

241

245
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,090
They won't kick me out.

246

You never know. You might be the first one to make the record of being kicked out.

247
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,440
Watch it.

248

I'll go to the marketing department.

Although I'm a little scared.

270

You made a good decision.

It is, right?

Of course. I'm really glad.

Sorry?

322
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,120
Is that all right? They weren't really used anyway.

323
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,980
I like it. I bought some churros, let's eat.

324
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,560
Okay.

325
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,960
What are you doing? Are you looking for a certain book?

326
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,400
No, its not that.

327
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,300
How are you categorizing these books?

328
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,940
Categorize? I just put them in.

329
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,970
You don't have a system?

330
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,480
It looks like all of the books here are romance novels.

331
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,420
Yes. I really love romance novels.

332
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,350
You have romance and not romance.

333
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:46,250
I think it will be much better to separate romance by author and then organize it alphabetically.

334
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,130
- Huh? 
 - Then it'll be much easier to find books.

335
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:54,740
It would be easier. But when would I have time to do that?

336
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,940
Or do you want to do it for me?

337
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,650
- Really? Can I? 
 - What?

338
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,610
Should I organize them? I'm really good at things like this.

339
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:08,480
Sure, you can do it.  That'd be good for me.

340
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,040
Thank you! I'll organize really well!

341
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,340
You don't really need to thank me..

342
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,140
Since there are six shelves,

343
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,770
if we distribute three consonants for each shelf, then it'll be just right.

344
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:24,340
ABC, DEF, GHI, JKL... YZ! 
(The Korean alphabet has 14 consonants and no name begins with a vowel)

345
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,080
And then the rest...

346
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,400
What's with him? Why does he like it so much?

347
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,770
What's with him? Why does he like it so much?

348
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,490
Does Wung like house chores?

349
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,500
Oh, so that's why his house was always so clean.

350
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,100
No wonder.

351
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,430
What are Wung's cells like? I bet its so different from our Housework cell.

352
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,940
Are you guys talking about me?

353
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,740
Yes, you! I want to see how different his cell is compared to you!

354
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,790
All right!

355
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:05,030
Even when Wung came over the first day,

356
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,570
Thank you.

357
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,270
Let's go.

358
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,810
I turned off the heater before leaving, so it'll be cold.

359
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:33,190
- Wait Reason ... did we clean? 
 - Clean?

360
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:37,500
This is the first time bringing Wung in without us preparing.

361
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,880
We probably cleaned, right? Because I'm worried.

362
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,080
When we left in the morning I think everything was–

363
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,720
That! The laundry on the drying rack!

364
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,120
You didn't take in the laundry? What were you even doing on your day off?

365
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,040
Sit, sit.

366
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,150
Reason, we're in trouble. That is not all!

367
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,800
Is there something else?

368
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:18,640
 Oh no! Where did Housecleaner go?! 

369
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,370
Agh! What were you doing not folding the laundry?

370
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,950
I was going to do it tomorrow. I guess I'll do it now!

371
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:29,730
You're going to fold the laundry while Wung is here?!

372
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,540
Then I guess I'll do it tomorrow!

373
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,730
You need to hurry and figure it out, Wung is already here!

374
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,810
Really? Then I guess I just need to do a little laundry kick!

375
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:47,440
Let's go ... laundry kick!

376
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,390
Finishing it off well! 
 Laundry kick: Technology to send laundry to the 4th dimension 

377
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,550
Are you satisfied?

378
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,500
That's...still not everything.

379
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,450
Look at the pillows ... the drool marks.

380
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,580
What are we going to do about the hair?!

381
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,800
I told you to wash the pillowcases more often!

382
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,970
You did, you did. I was going to do it next week.

383
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,170
- Why I ought to...! 
 - It's all right!

384
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,410
I know a method that makes them look good as new.

385
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:25,670
You just got to turn the pillows 180 degrees.

386
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,990
Now they look clean, right?

387
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,820
It's not something to be proud of.

388
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,510
And, that!

389
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:38,140
The snack you were munching on yesterday. Why didn't you clean it?

390
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,070
♫  Even if I walk carefully  ♫

391
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,780
♫  My heart is far away there  ♫

392
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,110
♫  Even at night when everyone else is asleep  ♫

393
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,980
♫  It's racing wide awake  ♫

394
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,580
That's not a problem. The answer is there!

395
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,210
You just got to hide it as one of the books.

396
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:59,570
Doesn't that look natural?

397
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,960
Oh my goodness.

398
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,070
Now it's time for me to sleep! Goodnight!

399
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,610
♫  Even if I spend a day when nothing happens  ♫

400
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:14,350
 We've always lived like this. 

401
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:19,020
 But.. look at Wung. Look how different he is. 

402
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,150
Wung, coffee.

403
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:27,780
♫  Even if I knew I can't do anything with my heart  ♫

404
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,950
Wung, should I help you?

405
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,620
There are too many Lees. There are too many Lees.

406
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,520
- Huh? 
 -You have a lot of books by the author Lee Dong Gun.

407
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,650
Yes, I like the author Lee Dong Gun.

408
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,610
And that is why there isn't enough space for the third consonant. There are too many Lee's.

409
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:49,210
Ah ... what should I do?

410
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:54,880
Wung, it doesn't matter to me if the books are in alphabetical order.

411
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,680
Oh?

412
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,320
Oh?

413
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,450
This isn't a book.

414
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,660
These are crackers! Why is this here?

415
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,820
Oh wow. You're right. How did this ... get there?

416
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,780
That's it! Now if I put these last books in there ...

417
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:22,740
It's done! Book shelf, success! Success!

418
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,740
- Are you finished? 
 - Yes.

419
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,910
Good job. Now come and eat this! It's all cooled now, so it won't be as good.

420
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,910
There's a lot of dust on the floor, so I think I'll clean it first.

421
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,510
I'll clean it. You come eat.

422
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,010
No, no. Where is the mop?

423
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:49,140
The length of this ... 40 cm.

424
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,460
And the floor is...

425
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:56,240
from the bookshelf to the bed, 160 cm.

426
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,770
Can I wipe it all perfectly, in just 4 sweeps?

427
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,290
Let's do it.

428
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,800
Look at this! It fits perfectly.

429
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,920
Look at it. This is it!

430
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,590
It's so thrilling.

431
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,410
Thrilled ... while cleaning?

432
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,850
It's my first time seeing someone get so excited by cleaning.

433
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:46,390
On top of that, that person being my boyfriend,

434
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:49,040
is even more surprising.

435
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:53,020
Before we lived together, I didn't know...

436
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,540
What?

437
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,310
What is it? What are you looking at?

438
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,510
Yumi.

439
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:20,300
- Yes? 
 - Can you get up for a sec?

440
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:34,510
The poster is too far to the left in relation to the bed.

441
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:39,300
- What? 
 - It's too late to put in a new nail.

442
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,620
I have to push the bed.

443
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:48,790
So as to line up the poster with the middle of the bed. Okay.

444
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,720
Is this good? Yumi, take a look.

445
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,200
- Is this good? 
 - Hmm? Yes ...

446
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,290
I think it's good.

447
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,320
Is it?

448
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,760
Okay, it's good.

449
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,930
Now I feel better.

450
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:22,680
- Yumi, what do you think? 
 - Huh? I like it.

451
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,140
 Wung loves to keep things organized. 

452
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,040
Perfect.

453
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,700
This is impressive.

454
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,220
You hung the pots by their size.

455
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,650
I couldn't just let it go.

456
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:07,940
Your nickname from now on is neat freak. It's confirmed.

457
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,450
At this rate, you're going to organize my underwear drawer.

458
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,260
Why aren't you answering? Did you already do it?

459
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:32,110
- I didn't yet. 
 - Not "yet". Don't do it!

460
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,640
But I can do it really well.

461
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,320
- No. Don't do it. No way. 
 - I got it.

462
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,800
I won't do it. Okay. Sit.

463
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,060
- You won't do it, right? 
 - Right.

464
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,680
Enjoy your food.

465
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,360
Gosh.

466
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,960
You're a lot cleaner than I thought.

467
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,140
I didn't know you like organizing this much.

468
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,130
It's not that I like organizing.

469
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,510
I like finding the continuous regularity of an arrangement.

470
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,770
Cleaning is a kind of a mathematical process.

471
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:05,530
If you make a clear algorithm for cleaning, you can apply it anywhere.

472
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:08,990
And I'm neat because of that.

473
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,430
That's so impressive. He's diligent and efficient.

474
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:22,220
He even has scientific reasoning. He's at a master's level.

475
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,630
Hey, don't you feel anything?

476
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,910
I do. Wung's great!

477
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,070
Not that. Don't you think you should learn from him?

478
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,230
What do I need to learn?

479
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:41,020
The person who loves doing it should just do it. I'm off to get some rest.

480
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,080
Should I kill her?

481
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,520
Wung's housework cell?

482
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,440
Yes. Since you've been to Wung's village, you've probably seen him.

483
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,210
I want to learn their technique and pass it down to our housework cell.

484
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:01,820
Well... from what I can remember, Wung didn't have a housework cell.

485
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:06,970
What? How can he be so good at housework when he doesn't have a housework cell?

486
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,050
Instead, he has a huge artificial intelligence cell.

487
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,300
 An articial intelligence cell? 

488
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,690
Run the algorithm now.

489
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,370
 Running the algorithm. 

490
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,640
- There is such a thing? 
 - Yes.

491
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,590
When there was a problem, that was what solved everything.

492
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,030
Housework is probably determined there, too.

493
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,810
I'm jealous. I'm really jealous.

494
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,200
How efficient and scientific!

495
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,210
You don't even have to nag at the lazy housework cell.

496
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,130
And my work would be reduced so much!

497
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,080
That's the very world I've been dreaming of.

498
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,110
- Love, I have a favor to ask you. 
 - A favor?

499
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:50,090
Love wormhole opens pretty often these days.

500
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,630
Yeah, I guess.

501
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,510
When the wormhole opens today...

502
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,160
Yumi, coffee.

503
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,010
It's hot.

504
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:15,880
Wung, look over there. Isn't the moon exceptionally yellow today?

505
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,360
- Is it? 
 - Yeah, look over there.

506
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,370
- No, look at me. 
 - Hmm?

507
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:33,510
 Send me to Wung's village. 

508
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,640
Now!

509
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,450
Reason, be careful.

510
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:46,640
I'm not scared, Love. I'm so excited.

511
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:52,320
I'll learn a lot!

512
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:13,640
Wow, I'm finally here. So this is Wung's world.

513
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:18,980
A world ruled by science and logic. A world where reason is the most valuable.

514
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:26,220
What is that?

515
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,230
No!

516
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,250
No! Don't come to me!

517
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:45,820
Right, Naughtysaurus is probably on the loose right now.

518
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,980
Would Reason be all right?

519
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,550
No, let me down!

520
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:56,280
Yumi is so sexy!

521
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,670
I can't hold it in anymore!

522
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:05,840
I want to go home!

523
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:10,570
 Wung's world was a world of chaos, where scientific logic and the madness of a beast coexist. 

524
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:16,870
Let me down! 
  After that, I never dreamed of that place again. 

525
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:23,760
 Episode 32: Cake and Keyboard 

526
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,140
 Daehan Noodles 

527
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,270
Assistant Manager Yumi.

528
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,490
Oh, Assistant Manager Yu.

529
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:38,890
Are you on your way home? I'm jealous.

530
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:42,780
- Are you not going home? 
 - I'm working overtime today.

531
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,790
- You know you're starting at marketing department starting next week, right? 
 - Yes.

532
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:50,850
If you have any questions regarding the transfer, let me know.

533
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:55,470
- Questions? 
 - Yes, don't you have any?

534
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:58,460
I do have a question.

535
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,680
The marketing department has a higher salary compared to other departments.

536
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,140
So is Yumi getting that much as well?

537
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,690
- Ask this, Yumi. 
 - What if she isn't?

538
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,760
It not, she shouldn't go. Why bother to transfer?

539
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,530
Stingy, you said you'll be my best supporter—

540
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:19,080
Go ahead and ask Yumi. Tell him no if they aren't.

541
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,780
Umm, I do have a question.

542
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:26,270
- What is it? 
 - By chance, my sal—

543
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,910
Sal?

544
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:35,640
Never mind. It's nothing. It's nothing.

545
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,940
I'll ask you when I think of something.

546
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,780
Sure. Have a great weekend.

547
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,240
You, too, Assistant Manager Yu.

548
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,980
Why is it so hard to talk about money?

549
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:55,450
- Oh, right! Assistant Manager Yumi. 
 - Yes?

550
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:59,380
Did you hear about your salary?

551
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,780
What? No.

552
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:07,210
You'll get a raise, too. I'll let you know the exact amount some other time.

553
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,330
Oh, sure.

554
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,950
Goodbye.

555
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,180
 Stingy 

556
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:31,050
Let's work hard, Writer.

557
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,910
 Daehan Noodles 

558
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,470
Hello? Wung, where are you?

559
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,810
 I just left the office. 

560
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:46,560
I just left, too. Wung, let's stop by the grocery store first.

561
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,490
We don't have any food at home. Let's make something yummy.

562
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,900
Yumi.

563
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,040
Yumi!

564
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,370
Wung.

565
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:12,340
I got here really fast, so I started shopping.

566
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,120
Why did you get so much stuff?

567
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,140
Wung, they said I'm getting a raise.

568
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,820
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

569
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,020
Marketing department always has the highest salary at my company.

570
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,340
And I guess they'll match that. I think I'll get a big raise.

571
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,490
That's good.

572
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:27,910
It is good.

573
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:31,480
So we can splurge today.

574
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,920
Hey, mandu are 'one plus one.' 
 (mandu: dumplings | 1+1= buy one, get one free) 

575
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:40,210
Wait! That's a little...

576
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,820
It's not a lot. We can freeze it.

577
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:46,700
That's not what I meant.

578
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,040
This is tastier than that.

579
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,950
Yeah? But that's not one plus one.

580
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:57,940
That's two 400 grams, two of them 800 grams for 8,000 won  (≈$7) .

581
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,280
And this is 5,500 won  (≈$5)  for 500 grams.

582
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,590
That's 1,000 won per 100 grams but this is 1,100 won per 100 grams.

583
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:08,800
It's only a 100 won  (less than 1 cent)  difference. Shouldn't we go with the taste?

584
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,620
You're fast with calculation, Gu Wung.

585
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,660
I am pretty fast.

586
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,490
Then, pan-fried mandus for dinner tonight?

587
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:19,070
How about pairing them with bibim-ramyeon? 
 (Spicy instant noodle without broth) 

588
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:22,000
Your culinary sense is no joke either, Gu Wung.

589
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,640
Let's go.

590
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,200
Did we get too much?

591
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,170
No, this won't even last one week.

592
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:35,170
Wung, I have to go to the bathroom.

593
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:38,010
All right. We don't need anything else, right?

594
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,240
No, there isn't.

595
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,110
Okay. Hurry and go.

596
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,000
- Wung, my credit card. 
 - It's fine.

597
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,390
No, I was going to buy today...

598
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:45,920
to celebrate my raise.

599
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,210
It's fine. Hurry and go. I'll wait outside.

600
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,030
Go ahead.

601
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:53,910
I was going to pay.

602
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:01,110
It's 182,840 won  (≈$155) .

603
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:03,350
Here you go.

604
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:08,050
Sir, I'm sorry. Do you have another card?

605
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:11,010
- Sorry? 
 - It says it's over the limit.

606
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,540
Hold on.

607
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,630
Try this one, please.

608
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:22,240
- One payment? 
 - Yes. Actually...

609
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,150
Three-month plan, please.

610
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,030
Three months...

611
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,390
Thank you.

612
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,970
Have a good day.

613
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,310
I suddenly had a tummy ache.

614
00:46:58,310 --> 00:46:59,240
Are you all right?

615
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,580
Yes, I'm fine.

616
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,060
Wung, it was a lot, right?

617
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,060
No, it wasn't.

618
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:08,140
How much was it? Let me pay for some. I got a lot of stuff.

619
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:13,240
Yumi, do you know what money they use in Australia?

620
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,910
Huh?

621
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,770
Australian money. 
  (Pocket and Australia are homonyms) 

622
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:23,570
Yes! One joke per day has succeeded. Let's go.

623
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,530
- Give me a bag. 
 - No.

624
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:29,380
- Give me one. 
 - No way!

625
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,680
Let's hurry. Hurry!

626
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,160
Okay, there won't be any spots left later.

627
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,810
What's going on?

628
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:42,170
There are so many.

629
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:45,210
Let's stick it here so we can see better.

630
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:49,420
Everybody feels the same. I really hope it works out.

631
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:52,180
I'm so excited.

632
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:01,350
Let's get married and eat all three meals together.

633
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:06,310
Let's please put on a wedding dress.

634
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:08,910
Gosh, these guys!

635
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,810
- Yumi. 
 - Yeah?

636
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:24,720
Should we... do it?

637
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,820
It?

638
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:33,000
You know it...

639
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:40,960
We're in the middle of washing dishes. What are you saying?

640
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:45,450
You said masks are best to do at night.

641
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,920
Mask?

642
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,040
- Are you talking about facial masks? 
 - Yes.

643
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,370
That really makes a difference.

644
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:59,830
You should've said that from the first place.

645
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:04,980
What the heck? Kim Yumi, what were you thinking?

646
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,400
- So naughty. 
 - I'm not.

647
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:12,130
What do you mean?

648
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,890
Come here.

649
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:18,420
♫  There's nowhere to go in this room  ♫

650
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:23,200
 If I marry Wung, I want to cook a lot of delicious things for him.  
    

651
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,350
 It would be so great if we lived together forever. 
    

652
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:30,390
♫  I'm in suspense. While I'm on my way to collect the heart I left behind  ♫

653
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:33,910
♫  It's getting soaked. It's slowly closing.  ♫

654
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,390
I knew you'd look good in this.

655
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:40,570
That's too tight. I don't think my blood is flowing.

656
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:42,350
Just hold on for a bit.

657
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:45,240
I think my face turned purple.

658
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,090
♫  When the tireless rain pours again  ♫

659
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:50,340
Don't make me laugh when I have a facial mask on.

660
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,750
Hey, Tinky Winky, let's take a picture.

661
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:53,940
I don't want to.

662
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,360
Here we go.

663
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:01,490
One, two, three.

664
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:05,630
♫  Soak up fall slowly  ♫

665
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,690
 Can we marry Wung? 
    

666
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:12,500
 Let's get married and do facial masks together every day.  
    

667
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,690
 Let's get married to Wung! 

668
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:20,590
 I agree! 

669
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:23,130
 A small wedding. 

670
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,340
 Let's ask Wung if he thinks about getting married. 

671
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,550
Sensitivity, what are you doing?

672
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:36,110
Let's ask what Wung thinks about marriage.

673
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,360
Why?

674
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,230
Why?  Should we not ask?

675
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:42,130
I think Wung would want to get married, too.

676
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,210
- Wung. 
 - Yeah?

677
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:05,340
Can I ask you something?

678
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,020
What is it?

679
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:17,350
You know...

680
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,160
That is...

681
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:27,470
You know... ma...

682
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:29,130
What?

683
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,610
 Let's ask Wung if he wants to get married. - Sensitivity Cell 

684
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:33,250
No! Don't ask him.

685
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,900
What's wrong with you?

686
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,940
Ma what?

687
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:44,710
Maha! Tari!

688
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:52,680
What are you doing?

689
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,640
What do you think I was going to ask you?

690
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,970
I have no idea.

691
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:00,030
Oh well, then.

692
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:04,570
What the heck? Was that a new joke?

693
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:13,030
A new joke?

694
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:22,090
Reason, what are you doing?

695
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:26,150
Bulletin, let's clean this up while everyone's sleeping.

696
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:29,130
Take off all the notes about marriage.

697
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:33,070
Then there won't be anything left. Marriage is what everyone's talking about these days.

698
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,970
That's why they need to be cleaned up.

699
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:39,400
If we keep posting about marriage here, Yumi might make a mistake without thinking.

700
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,340
Hurry. Hurry!

701
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,190
I got it.

702
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:49,610
All done.

703
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:53,950
Please take off notes about marriage from now on. Got it?

704
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:57,510
But why? Don't you want to marry Wung?

705
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:01,130
It's not that I don't like it. It's not something you can do alone.

706
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:04,830
Why? Wung doesn't want to get married?

707
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,790
That's how it was.

708
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:10,360
- Is that true? 
 - Yes.

709
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:14,510
I saw it when I went to Wung's village.

710
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:34,000
Wung's desire to marry.

711
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,490
I couldn't say anything because I didn't want everyone to get discouraged.

712
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:41,870
But I think you should know. Notes about marriage keep on showing up nowadays.

713
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:46,130
I got it. But why was it submerged in the sea?

714
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:48,700
Then Wung doesn't want to get married?

715
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,640
I don't know why either.

716
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:56,530
That is...

717
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:59,310
Just take care of the bulletin board, please.

718
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,800
It must be so nice.

719
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,310
Then how much of a raise are you getting?

720
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:17,470
I'm not sure yet. I'll look into it when I get to work tomorrow.

721
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:20,750
I want to move to marketing department, too.

722
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:24,990
Hey, now what fun would I have at work without you?

723
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:27,230
You got Ruby.

724
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:29,230
Are you kidding me?

725
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:32,690
I'll stop by everyday. Our offices are right beside each other.

726
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,740
Are you buying some clothes for Wung?

727
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,710
Yes. It's his birthday today.

728
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,930
Really?

729
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:48,800
How is it?

730
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,870
This one? I don't think it's his color.

731
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:58,150
Not that. How is it living together?

732
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,710
That is...

733
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:07,370
It's a lot more...

734
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,570
Horrible?

735
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:11,560
No, I like it.

736
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,310
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

737
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,740
I love it.

738
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:21,540
What? Really?

739
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:26,890
Now that we live together, I think he's a better person than I thought.

740
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,950
Hey, then that should do it.

741
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:31,590
Marry him.

742
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:33,020
No. That's a no.

743
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:35,640
What's there to wait? It's not like we're still in our twenties.

744
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,540
I'm plenty happy now.

745
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:41,700
And his situation isn't great.

746
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,040
It's Wung.

747
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,150
Yes, Wung.

748
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:57,650
I'm shopping with Yi Da.

749
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:59,910
Then when are you going home?

750
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:02,990
Yeah.

751
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:08,970
But I might eat dinner with Yi Da.

752
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:12,090
Yes. All right.

753
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:14,870
What was that? I thought you're going before dinner.

754
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:17,300
- I lied. 
 - What?

755
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,880
To surprise him, even this morning I pretended to not know.

756
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,570
I pretended I forgot it's his birthday.

757
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:25,940
He's probably really mad.

758
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,650
Really?

759
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,190
Poor Wung.

760
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:32,130
He must be so sad.

761
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:34,510
I'll make it up at night.

762
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,380
Gosh, you. That's really cute.

763
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,460
- Right? 
 - Yes.

764
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,490
You're so deliberate.

765
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:41,780
- That's cute. 
 - Right?

766

 Yes, on my way home now.

Gu Wung, I guess he'll be salty when he gets my text.

779
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:58,620
I just need to bring out rice and soup.

You're going to be so surprised.

797
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:22,340
   

798
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,570
Is the setup going well?

799
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:27,810
Of course, Endorphin can't miss the surprise party.

800
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:32,480
When Yumi comes out of the closet, we'll all shout together.

801
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,630
Surprise!

802
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:37,060
That's too loud.

803
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:42,390
Happy, happy birthday!

804
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:51,300
I'm nervous. Why am I nervous?

805
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,730
He's here.

806
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:17,160
He's coming. He's coming.

807
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:27,000
Guys, when Yumi walks out of the closet, what do we say?

808
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,480
Surprise!

809
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,510
Here we go!

810
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:36,290
Ten! Nine! Eight!

811
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:39,420
Seven! Six!

812
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:43,130
 Five! Four! 

813
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:46,370
 Three! Two! 

814
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:48,320
 One! 

815
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,650
Go!

816
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:57,820
Surprise!

817
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,030
Hold on! Hold on!

818
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:03,070
Guys, hold on! We have an unexpected situation.

819
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:05,520
What's going on?

820
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,110
What the?

821
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:45,670
Did he leave? Why?

822
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:50,550
Is he really salty?

823
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,970
What is that?

824
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:25,490
 Bluetooth mechanical keyboard 

825
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:27,820
It's a keyboard.

826
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:39,440
Hello?

827
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,560
Wung, where are you going?

828
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,260
 Huh? 

829
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,870
Why did you come home then leave right away?

830
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:50,430
I'm going back to the office because I have things left to do.

831
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:54,570
But how did you know that?

832
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:01,190
Are you home? I just left.

833
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:03,620
 What is this keyboard? 

834
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,970
You saw? It's a present.

835
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:09,690
- A present? 
 - It's your first day at the marketing department tomorrow.

836
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:13,540
That's the best mechanical keyboard there is.

837
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,190
Famous writers all use that.

838
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,900
My first day of work present?

839
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,080
I want you to write good things.

840
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:25,830
What's going on?

841
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:27,200
Why are they like that?

842
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,780
- What's going on? 
 - Do you know? 
 - I have no clue.

843
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:35,530
I think I'll have to work all night so I just stopped by to drop that off.

844
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:39,970
I should be the one giving you a present.

845
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:43,100
Give me a present? Why?

846
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,790
It's your birthday.

847
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:47,530
Today?

848
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:52,200
- Is it? 
 - Didn't you know?

849
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:56,420
I didn't know. I totally forgot.

850
01:03:57,430 --> 01:04:01,870
You remembered my first day of work and yet you forgot your birthday?

851
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:04,690
I'm kind of off these days.

852
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:11,110
When did you get home? I just left.

853
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:14,330
Hello?

854
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:19,770
Wung!

855
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:24,600
Come back.

856
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:32,000
Come home and eat. I made you a birthday dinner.

857
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:38,380
Happy birthday.

858
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:53,760


859
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:59,140
You made all this?

860
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:04,200
I'm so happy.

861
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,010
Let's cut the cake later.

862
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:09,890
Did you make this, too?

863
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:13,010
This is so touching, Kim Yumi.

864
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,690
Thanks for the food.

865
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,170
This is good. You made the seaweed soup so well.

866
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:30,200
- Wung. 
 - Yes?

867
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:34,000
Should we ... get married?

868
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,480
♫  Like the star  ♫

869
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:41,740
♫  Always be at my side  ♫

870
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:46,310
♫  Like a star shining in the dark night  ♫

871
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:52,980
♫  always shine brightly by my side  ♫

872
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:55,190
♫  Like a Star  ♫

873
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:59,610
♫  while looking at me smile brightly  ♫

874
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:05,920
♫  You who are so precious to me  ♫

875
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:12,700
♫  Always by my side, remain at my side  ♫

876
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:19,210
♫  Sometimes I sleep tightly curled  ♫

877
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:23,830
♫  Hiding a lot of pain  ♫

878
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:27,840
 Yumi's Cells  
♫  inside a lonely room  ♫

879
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:31,090
 - You two look so close. 
 - We just ran into each other a few times. 

880
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:33,220
 Of course I know. It's well-known. 

881
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:35,650
 While you are working out, you catch someone's eye. 

882
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:38,680
 Have you eaten dinner? Should I buy you a consolation dinner? 

883
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:44,070
 I think there is something between Ba Bi and Yumi. 

884
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:45,310
 What is with this combination? 

885
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:46,840
 Excuse me. 

886
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,960
 Hello. I'm Yu Ba Bi. 

887
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,950
 That action is a little weird! 

888
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:57,400
 No! There is a jerk giving his jacket right in front of the boyfriend! 

889
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,800
♫  while looking at me smile brightly  ♫
