 Yumi 
 A tvN original series

 Going on a trip 
 Episode 15 
 At Yumi's home 

5
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,980
  Hello everyone in Wung's village. Did everybody sleep well? 

6
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,720
It's a morning that reminds me of this kind of phrase.

7
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,580
Happiness always comes with trials.

8
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,390
It was like that yesterday.

9
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,030
But did you have to pick out the necklace with Sae Yi?

10
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,950
Why couldn't you tell me that Sae Yi was the one who gave you the yuja syrup?

11
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,710
I'm hanging up. Enjoy the dongdongju. Goodnight.

12
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,560
Wait... Hello? Hello?

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,980
♫  Except for my being vigilant in my heart there is no suspicious intent  ♫

14
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,400
 It was our first time seeing Yumi angry. 

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,600
♫  Ling Ling Don't try to be understanding  ♫

16
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,570
♫  Aside from minor quirks I am usually such a person  ♫

17
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,600
Please give me that one.

18
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,730
 We were afraid that Yumi's birthday would be the last day we saw her. 

19
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:56,790
 It also took courage to go find her at her place. But... 

20
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,550
♫  Even if you are looking for something new,  ♫

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,530
♫  I'll keep remembering the past,  ♫

22
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,200
♫  We're going to fall.  ♫

23
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,840
- It's Yumi. 
 - What do we do? What if she wants to break up?

24
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,720
♫  Even so it's better than being dizzy.  ♫

25
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,130
- Is that all? 
 - Yes.

26
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,250
Is that what you call an explanation?

27
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,740
Since that's all there is to it.

28
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,900
♫  There isn't anyone who loves you as much as  I do.  ♫

29
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,360
She laughed. Yumi laughed!

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,440
What's going on? Is it not over?

31
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:39,100
♫  Ordinary things don't suit you at all.  ♫

32
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,250
Come up. Let's eat it together.

33
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,110
♫  My crush.  ♫

34
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,700
♫  You will always be my crush.  ♫

35
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,860
We did it! She told us to come up.

36
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,190
We're going inside Yumi's place!

37
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,890
That's right. Happiness isn't just something that comes to you.

38
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,620
Happiness comes with trials.

39
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,510
Hit the drums! Hit the drums!

40
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,720
It's the beginning of love.

41
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,480
  Error!  Error!  Error! 

42
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,280
- It's here. 
 - Oh.

43
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:56,020
Guys, let's calm down! What should we start with once we're inside?

44
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,100
- What about a back hug now? 
 - A back hug?

45
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,850
Oh, back hug! It's good timing for that. Do you like it too?

46
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,830
- Wung, come in. 
 - Okay.

47
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,660
What's that? Heart, stop.

48
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,110
 Mic test. Mic test. Can you hear me? 

49
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,090
Isn't that the colon cell's voice?

50
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,400
This is Colon speaking. To all the village cells,

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,660
due to a stomachache, I'm going to release that 'thing' soon.

52
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,290
Can you hear me well?

53
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,340
I need to go poop.

54
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,630
What are you talking about? Are you saying you're going to poop at a time like this?

55
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,750
Colon, are you crazy?

56
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:01,690
 Yes, that's right. Happiness always comes with trials. 

57
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,190
 I guess there's no way for there to just be happiness. 

58
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,320
I cleaned up everything and aerated the room.

59
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,360
Wung!

60
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,190
What are you doing, Wung?

61
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,690
Why isn't he coming in?

62
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,030
- What were you doing? 
 - Huh?

63
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,060
Come in.

64
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,400
 We decided to face the ordeal confidently. 

65
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,910
 Who knows if there will be another chance to come to Yumi's house. 

66
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,460
 However ... 

67
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,600
My house is a bit small, right?

68
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,460
No, it's cozy and nice.

69
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,250
Let's eat the cake.

70
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,170
Yes, let's.

71
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:14,330
Wow, it's pretty. I really like strawberry cheesecake.

72
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,330
- Wung, what are you doing? 
 - Huh?

73
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,900
Come here, let's light the candles.

74
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,560
Yes.

75
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,150
Should we turn the lights off and sing?

76
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,100
All right.

77
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,650
The button is over there.

78
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,490
 Emergency! Emergency! 

79
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,360
 'That' is being released from the colon now. 

80
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,900
No!

81
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:29,120
It's the first time coming to your girlfriend's house. Try to hold it in at any cost!

82
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,860
 Can you hold it in? 
 No. 

83
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,790
 Is it too difficult, even for one minute? 
 Yes. 

84
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,790
 You need to run to the restroom right now. 

85
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,460
Damn it! Is there no other way?

86
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,630
 - There is one.  
 - What is it? 

87
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,720
 Searching 

88
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,070
 - You can do it in your pants. 
 - What? 

89
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,870
You have to sing for me, Wung.

90
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,560
Wung, sing!

91
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,360
- Huh? 
 -Aren't you going to sing "Happy birthday" for me?

92
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,420
Ah... That's right. The song...

93
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:33,620
♪  Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you,  ♪

94
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,790
♪  Happy birthday dear Yu—  ♪

95
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,660
- The restroom... 
 - Huh?

96
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,790
Where is the restroom?

97
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,020
- Huh? 
 Where is the restroom?!

98
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,460
It's over there.

99
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,500
- The door isn't opening, Yumi. 
 - You have to push it! Push it!

100
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,400
Push it?

101
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,800
Oh no.

102
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,530
 Splash 

103
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:10,430
 Mission clear. 'That' has been released. 

104
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,690
We're doomed. We're doomed.

105
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,990
I can't believe he pooped

106
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,800
right after coming to his girlfriend's house for the first time.

107
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,500
This is embarrassing.

108
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,220
Was there something wrong with the pasta I ate earlier?

109
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,810
Why all of a sudden...

110
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,170
- Wung. 
 - Yes?

111
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,830
Are you sick? Do you have a stomachache?

112
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,140
No, no!

113
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,930
Should I blow the candles? They're all melting.

114
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,070
No, don't! Just wait a minute. I'll be right out.

115
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,960
All right.

116
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,060
Love, let's forget what's already happened.

117
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,630
Our cute Yumi will understand that much.

118
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,030
That's right. We can start over now, right?

119
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,960
What should we do now?

120
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,970
Let's set the mood by giving Yumi a congratulatory kiss when she blows the candles! What do you think?

121
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,430
- Right? 
 - A congratulatory kiss sounds good.

122
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,130
What's the problem now?

123
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,460
 We shouldn't have faced this trial, 

124
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,540
 instead we should have gone home earlier. 

125
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,630
No. Please don't do this.

126
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,630
 Is the toilet clogged? 
 Yes 

127
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,560
 Do you need tools? 
 Yes 

128
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,900
 Unsuitable 

129
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,350
 Ask Yumi for help. 

130
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,330
I can't.

131
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,160
I can't do that.

132
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,280
I can't wait any longer.

133
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,290
Why isn't he coming out?

134
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,510
Is he showering?

135
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,150
Shower?

136
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,690
Why is he showering?

137
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,350
Wung, I was wondering why you weren't coming out.

138
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,430
Yumi.

139
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,110
Yes. What's wrong?

140
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,790
- Do you have ... 
 - Yeah?

141
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,250
that thing at home?

142
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,120
That thing?

143
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,550
Yes, I need that thing.

144
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,430
What thing is that thing?

145
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,960
You know. There's that thing.

146
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,660
If you don't have it, I'm going to go buy it right now.

147
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,660
Oh.

148
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,630
That thing.

149
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,210
Do you have it?

150
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,410
I don't.

151
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,990
You don't?

152
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,220
- You don't have the thing to unclog toilets? 
 - What?

153
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,490
The toilet is a bit clogged, so I need it.

154
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,130
- The toilet. The toilet is clogged! 
 - A little bit.

155
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,220
- I have that. 
 - You do?

156
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,880
And here I was, thinking he meant something else.

157
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,960
Wung.

158
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,530
- Here.
 - Thank you.

159
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:41,450
But isn't it better if I do it though? I've done it many times.

160
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:45,010
No. Thanks, but no thanks.

161
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,470
I'll take care of my business myself.

162
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,420
This is so embarrassing.

163
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,870
Did it work?

164
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,360
This is bad!

165
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,920
- Wung. 
 - Yes.

166
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,120
Why? Isn't it going well?

167
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,130
No, it's fine. I'll be right out, just wait.

168
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,810
I'll do it. Open the door.

169
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,230
It's all done.

170
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,680
You can start eating the cake.

171
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,290
We should have gone home.

172
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,820
We should have gone home as soon as

173
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,160
we got the signal.

174
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,700
- Hello? 
 - Yes, hello?

175
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,190
- Colon!
 - Reason, I'm sorry,

176
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,650
but I'm calling since I need to send that out again.

177
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,930
What did you say? Are you crazy? You're out of your mind!

178
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,990
Do you know where we are? We're not at home, we're at Yumi's place!

179
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,490
There's nothing I can do, though.

180
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,860
It's an automatic discharge system, as you know.

181
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,360
The problem must have been the cream pasta we ate earlier.

182
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,030
You punk! The toilet is clogged! The toilet! And you're going to poop more? More?

183
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:31,260
Why are you angry?

184
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,320
Seriously.

185
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,960
My stomach.

186
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,570
Does this make sense? At my girlfriend's place?

187
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:47,750
I'm so embarrassed I could die. Why isn't this unclogging?!

188
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,860
Wung. Are you all right?

189
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,270
I unclogged it

190
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,100
and I cleaned it up neatly.

191
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,860
You didn't have to clean up.

192
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:37,020
I'm sorry this happened as soon as I got here.

193
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,160
- What about the cake? 
 - I put it in the fridge, since you were taking so long.

194
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,970
- Do you want to eat it? 
 - No, never mind.

195
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,860
I think the cream upset my stomach.

196
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,090
Yumi, I'll just go.

197
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,730
Don't you need to go to the hospital?

198
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,760
No. I think I just need to go home and rest.

199
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,700
Drink this. It's plum tea. It's good for upset stomachs.

200
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,370
It's all right. I think it's better if I go home as soon as possible.

201
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:14,530
Go after you feel better. What if you get a bellyache on your way home?

202
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:24,690
What else can he do? He'll just poop in his pants. Why does it matter?

203
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,260
He's ruined anyway.

204
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,620
No. I'll be fine.

205
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,060
Yumi, hurry up and go to bed. I'll just go home—

206
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,560
Come here.

207
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,760
Lie here. I turned on the heating mat.

208
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,490
Isn't this your bed? No, I'll just go home–

209
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,230
You have to warm up your body. Just lie down.

210
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,390
Lie down comfortably.

211
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,190
Drink this and stay a little longer. It's going to calm your insides.

212
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,840
  ♫ I had an unexpected day ♫ 

213
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,800
  ♫ You sang to me ♫ 

214
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,900
  ♫ Song song song ♫ 

215
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,230
- Do you want me to give you medicinal hand therapy? 
 - Medicinal hand therapy?

216
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,230
  ♫ Can't think a word that ♫ 

217
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,830
This is very effective. You'll probably feel better.

218
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,160
  ♫ You sang to me ♫ 

219
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,760
 Yes. It's true that happiness comes with trials. 

220
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:50,960
Wow. You have a lot of books. Have you read all of them?

221
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,500
- Of course, I have. 
 - That's an unexpected hobby.

222
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,000
Why? Didn't I tell you?

223
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,810
I once wanted to be a writer.

224
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,150
- Really? 
 - Yes.

225
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,390
A romance novelist.

226
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,320
I gave it up early, though.

227
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,000
Why did you give up?

228
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,380
I didn't think I was that talented.

229
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,330
Why? It suits you.

230
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,520
Writer Kim Yumi.

231
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,620
What about you? Was it your dream to become a game developer?

232
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,760
No. My dream was to play games for the rest of my life,

233
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,670
but it turns out you can't live on just playing games.

234
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,950
It sounds like something you would say.

235
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,630
Is that your mother?

236
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:47,520
Yes. My mom. And that's my dad.

237
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,580
And that's my maternal grandmother.

238
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,420
I lived with my grandmother until high school.

239
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,310
Although she passed away,

240
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:04,330
whenever I got a bellyache, my grandmother would do this for me.

241
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:12,120
♫ Baby has a potbelly, Grandmother has a healing hand.

242
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,960
This isn't a potbelly.

243
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,830
Babies have potbellies. Cute potbellies.

244
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,500
Wung!

245
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,780
- Aren't you late? 
 - I still have time.

246
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,080
Then, should we eat something before we go?

247
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,430
Sure. But is your stomach feeling better?

248
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:56,210
Absolutely fine. Now that it's all out, I'm starving.

249
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,980
Let's go.

250
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,690
- It's really good! 
 - It is.

251
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,420
It's even better because we're eating together.

252
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,680
Should we go on a trip?

253
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,470
- A trip? 
 - Over the weekend, for three days and two nights. What do you think?

254
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,730
Sounds good.

255
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,560
Where should we go? The mountains?

256
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,390
- The sea? 
 - The sea? Yes.

257
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,610
The sea.

258
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:36,520
 I think we'll remember this morning for a long time. 

259
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,200
 - This means that Colon did a great job.  
 - Busan?

260
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,160
 Thank you, Colon cell. 

261
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,040
Then Sokcho.

262
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,890
 Episode 16 
 Ocean-View Double Bedroom 

263
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,320
 I think this itinerary is good. Take a look. 
   

264
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,080
Wow, it is nice.

265
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,650
It is. What's with the beach first thing in the morning?

266
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,890
- Just because. 
 - Are you planning on going with Wung?

267
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,370
Wow, how did you know?

268
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,780
I saw you used your vacation right after the weekend.

269
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,570
- You saw that? 
 - Yes I did.

270
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,990
Where are you going?

271
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,430
He wants to go to Sokcho and Yangyang.

272
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,550
Looks like you're going to visit the sea.

273
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:59,270
Must be nice, Kim Yumi. You're going on a trip with your boyfriend.

274
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,690
Yes, it's so nice. If you're so jealous, you should go too.

275
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,950
How can you say that to your lonely friend?

276
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,500
I hope it pours.

277
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,400
I'll still be happy.

278
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,190
So, what are you going to do in Sokcho?

279
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,640
I don't know. Wung said he would make the plans.

280
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,260
You should plan your trip together. Why are you leaving it all to him?

281
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,840
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

282
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,950
But it's been so long since I went on a trip, so I have no idea where to start.

283
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,560
Did you know? It's my first trip since that time.

284
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,220
When?

285
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,670
That trip to Phuket we went to, two years ago.

286
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,330
Seriously?

287
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,150
- You haven't gone on a trip since then? 
 - No.

288
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,530
Well, I didn't have a boyfriend to go with.

289
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:54,390
And weirdly, I didn't want to travel much after that.

290
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,190
Maybe it's because I'm getting old.

291
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,570
 It was not because she was getting old. 

292
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,100
 It was because the travel cell was no longer with us. 

293
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,650
 Travel cell 

294
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:14,050
You didn't even get to show your amazing abilities. You left us too early.

295
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:19,170
 There is a graveyard in the village for the cells that have died because they have not been active for too long. 
   

296
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,960
 Two years ago 

297
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,940
 After the Phuket trip that cost three months of her salary two years ago, 

298
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:32,360
 Yumi never went on a trip again, so Travel was buried here. 

299
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,670
It was a shame you had to go like that.

300
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:44,360
 You know, when Yumi gets an awesome boyfriend someday, 

301
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,500
 I'm going to send her on the most spectacular trip. You'll help me when that happens, right? 

302
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,880
 Of course! 

303
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,410
This is the moment you've always dreamed of.

304
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:59,280
It would've been so nice if you were here.

305
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,680
Although I lack experience, I'll do my absolute best for you!

306
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,020
I'll try my best to make Yumi have an amazing trip. I promise!

307
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,990
 Travel cell 

308
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,420
I want to drink wine while looking at the stars in the night sky.

309
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,360
All right, I'll write that down for now. Thanks!

310
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,200
Good luck!

311
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,470
Face Wash Up!

312
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:26,700
Was there anything you wanted to do if she went on a trip with her boyfriend?

313
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,640
Yes! There was something I wanted to do when I went on a trip.

314
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:38,320
 Lying together and putting on face masks! 

315
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:42,550
Just thinking about it makes my skin feel alive!

316
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,650
Okay, I'll try to put that in the schedule.

317
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:49,500
I have this kind of romantic fantasy.

318
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:00,660
 At dawn, I want to run and play with him on the white sand that nobody has stepped on yet. 

319
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,740
No, stop!

320
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,000
You can do that in the day too, right?

321
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,330
No! It has to be white sand at dawn which nobody has stepped on!

322
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,510
It won't be easy, but I'll try to fit that on the schedule.

323
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,820
Reason!

324
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,420
I want to go on a makguksu* tour. 
  (buckwheat noodles in a chilled broth 

325
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,970
Makguksu?

326
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,490
 If you pour 

327
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,820
the cold dongchimi* broth directly over the buckwheat noodles, 
  (water kimchi made with Korean radish) 

328
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:39,500
 then put a piece of boiled pork on it, and take a bite, 

329
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,080
It's rather good. What's your rating?

330
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:56,710
I like everything ... But the sourness of the dongchimi is a little too intense.

331
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,650
So I'm giving it a 4.5.

332
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:03,330
You have a sharp palate, Kim Yumi. Let's eat.

333
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:08,830
It's my dream to meet the seventh master of makguksu in Gangwondo.

334
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,890
I don't think we'll have enough time.

335
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,250
I'll write it down for now.

336
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,870
What? A makguksu tour?

337
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,290
Face masks? Beach? Makguksu?

338
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,690
Are you guys joking right now?

339
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,290
Then what about you, Naughty?

340
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:28,740
Forget all that. The essence of a couple's trip is

341
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,830
a hot, passionate night!

342
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,910
♫ I need to get hit

343
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:41,450
♫ with the club of love

344
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,480
 Yumi, what kind of accommodation would you like? 

345
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,740
 Accommodation? 

346
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,620
 Hotel, pension,  condominium, shared house, etc. Do you have a preference? 

347
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,980
 My preference? 

348
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,520
 I'm not sure. I'm fine with anything. 

349
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,570
 Then what do you think of this place? 

350
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,630
 Julie Hotel is considered one of the most beautiful hotels in Gangwon-do. Enjoy the refreshing breeze blowing from Mt. Seorak to the East Sea. 

351
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,320
Wow.

352
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,520
 It's right by the beach. What do you think? 

353
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,850
 I like it. I like it a lot but it looks expensive. 

354
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,870
 If you like it, then I'm making a reservation. 

355
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,410
 All right. 

356
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,860
It's nice.

357
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,730
I think I'd be so happy if we laid there and did a face mask together.

358
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,580
There is a white sand beach right in front. We can take a walk early in the morning.

359
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,320
On top of that, that place is only five minutes away

360
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,990
from the best makguksu place in Sokcho. Awesome!

361
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,740
I got it. I got it. Then we'll do this on the first day.

362
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:06,050
They'll check in, have makguksu for dinner, put on face masks to relax—

363
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:09,580
Forget it. Don't bother making a schedule.

364
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:13,800
There's no need for one. Because Yumi...

365
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,190
has no reason to leave their bedroom.

366
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:25,660
They'll just be stuck to the bed saying, "Oh that's too much."

367
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:30,290
Yumi will be satisfied with just one bed.

368
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,360
 Gu Wung 

369
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,150
Hello? Hey, Wung. Did you make the reservation?

370
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,450
 - No, not yet.  
 - Why not?

371
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:04,010
The hotel server went down so we can't make reservations online. They said we can only make reservations by phone at 12 o'clock.

372
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,970
 Really? 

373
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,160
But I have an investor meeting to go to.

374
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,270
- An investor meeting? Isn't that important? 
 - Yes.

375
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,250
So I was wondering if you could make the reservation for me.

376
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,550
 All right, I'll do it. 

377
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,360
- Wung, let's go. 
 - Yes.

378
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,780
It's Julie Hotel. I'll send you my credit card number and their phone number.

379
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:26,820
You'll probably have to call them right at 12. It's pretty popular so we won't get it if we're late.

380
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,090
All right, I'll make sure to do it.

381
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:32,020
Don't worry, just trust me.

382
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,170
Bye.

383
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,370
What time is it?

384
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,800
 11:00 

385
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:48,040
All right, let's go eat.

386
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,050
If we don't go now, we'll have to stand in line again.

387
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,590
Somewhere in my office?

388
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:56,560
Section Chief. Can we eat out today rather than at the cafeteria?

389
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,110
I'm sick of the cafeteria food.

390
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,570
Let's do that then. Let's eat out.

391
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,030
You're the best.

392
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,570
Assistant Manager Kim, what are you doing?

393
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,600
I don't feel like eating, so please go ahead without me.

394
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,290
- Aren't you going to eat? 
 - No.

395
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:17,520
I have some things to do.

396
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,430
Oh, all right.

397
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,950
What was that?

398
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:25,420
You exchanged some looks just now. What is it?

399
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,440
We didn't. Let's go.

400
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,100
What is it that she has to do? Ruby is curious.

401
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,550
- It's nothing. 
 - Is it a secret from me? 
 - There are no secrets.

402
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,950
Enjoy your lunch.

403
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,100
Eleven thirty.

404
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,780
Assistant Manager Kim, aren't you going to eat?

405
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,430
No, I'm all right.

406
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,420
Enjoy your lunch.

407
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,490
I'm nervous. Why am I so nervous?

408
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,670
Five. 
  

409
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,320
Four, three,

410
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,380
two, one!

411
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:23,780
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

412
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:28,120
 - Hello. This is Julie Hotel with the best views in Sokcho.  
 - They answered.

413
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,990
 Please press the number after the beep. 

414
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,720
 One for reservations. 

415
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,070
 This is Julie Hotel, always trying our best, what can I help you with? 

416
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:43,600
Hello? I'd like to reserve a room for August 1st and 2nd.

417
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,500
Yes, ma'am, what kind of room would you like?

418
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,470
An ocean-view, double-bed room, please.

419
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:54,020
Ma'am, I can't really hear you very well. Can you speak up a little bit, please?

420
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:58,110
Which room are you talking about with an ocean view?

421
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,600
A double-bed room.

422
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,000
Excuse me?

423
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,290
A double... double

424
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,600
One big bed.

425
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,870
Oh, you mean a double-bed room, right?

426
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:20,800
But currently for the ocean-view...

427
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,720
we only have twin-bed rooms left for August 1st and 2nd.

428
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,890
Sorry?

429
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,780
Well, that can't be helped. Then it'll be an ocean-view, twin-bed room—

430
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,530
No! Are you joking?

431
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,940
 How can there be two beds? 

432
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,120
 That can't happen on a couple's trip. It has to be a double-bed, no matter what! 

433
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,710
 It's cold. So cold. 

434
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:55,300
It doesn't have to be an ocean-view room.

435
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,760
Do you have any other rooms with a double bed?

436
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,940
A double bed room that's available for reservation currently is...

437
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,970
one with a parking lot view. Would that be all right?

438
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,300
A view of the parking lot?

439
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,070
It's unfortunate but we'll just take the double-bed room with a parking lot view—

440
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:16,260
No! No way! Why would you go all the way to the beach and look at the parking lot?!

441
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,850
 You're up? 

442
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,780
 Good morning. 

443
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,750
 Good morning. 

444
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,980
 But Wung, the view is so... 

445
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,160
 shitty, right? 

446
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,250
It really is shitty. I cannot give up the ocean view.

447
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,760
I don't really like the parking lot view.

448
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,730
Are those two my only options?

449
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:56,600
We do have one ocean-view double bed room but customers usually don't take it.

450
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,230
Which one is that? I'll take that one.

451
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,660
It's a full-glass bathroom. Would that be all right?

452
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,150
You can make a reservation for that room.

453
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,330
A full-glass?

454
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,230
 Should I wash up first? 

455
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,020
 All right. 

456
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,670
 Okay, then. 

457
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,480
 It can't be helped. 

458
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,950
That's it. Let's take that.

459
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,920
Do you really want to do this one?

460
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,930
It has the view that Sensitivity likes and it has a double bed. What's the problem?

461
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:01,310
I think the view would be nice in many directions.

462
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:06,200
Let's take it. Let's take it. It's a chance given by the heavens.

463
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,470
Then we'll reserve this one—

464
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,760
No way! No!

465
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,910
Etiquette.

466
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:18,160
Are you in your right mind?

467
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,130
There are rules and there's etiquette in this world. How can you take

468
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,930
that outrageous full-glass bathroom for the first trip with a man?

469
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:28,810
So indecent!

470
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,960
Etiquette, there are no other rooms—

471
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,150
No way. Never! Then just go on a day trip.

472
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,800
What? You wench!

473
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,920
The full-glass bathroom is a little

474
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,720
overwhelming.

475
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,240
I will think about it a little more and get back to you.

476
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,500
Thank you.

477
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,310
What should I do?

478
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,550
Should I ask Wung?

479
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:10,600
I should. I'll tell him to make the decision.

480
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,370
That'll make it simple.

481
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:19,120
The puppy character can be customized by the player

482
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,800
to make their own unique character.

483
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,360
As you can see, you can even choose hair types.

484
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,170
There are thirty different hair colors regardless of long hair or short hair.

485
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:34,250
And their patterns can also be customized. Spots...

486
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,440
What should I do?

487
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,640
 - A double bed! 
 - Let's just take the parking-lot-view with a double bed. 

488
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,710
 Do you want to die? Then we can't see the ocean! 

489
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,960
 I said it's better to do a day trip. 

490
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,020
All right. I've made up my mind.

491
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,360
Whether it's big or small, we can just use one bed.

492
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:07,890
 This is Julie Hotel with the best service always. What can I help you with?  

493
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,880
This is Kim Yumi, I just called.

494
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,230
I'll just take the ocean-view, twin bed room.

495
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,600
I'm sorry, but that room's been taken.

496
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,940
Sorry? Already?

497
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:26,470
It hasn't even been five minutes yet. Then what about other rooms? Are they all booked?

498
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:29,880
The double-bed room I mentioned earlier is the only one left.

499
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,430
You said you didn't want the full-glass bathroom–

500
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:37,900
It doesn't matter! I like full-glass bathrooms! Please give me the full-glass bathroom!

501
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,000
 All right, ma'am. 

502
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:54,470
What did she just say that she likes? What kind of bathroom?

503
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:58,830
A full-glass bathroom. I heard it.

504
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,610
That's not what I said.

505
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:10,930
I'm having my shower booth redone at home.

506
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,530
I'm on a call. Did you enjoy your lunch?

507
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,600
Yes.

508
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:22,450
She did say she's remodeling.

509
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,900
It's fine. I'll just take the room with the full-glass...

510
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:34,430
I mean, I'll go with the double room.

511
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:38,280
Yes. Yes. I'll pay with a credit card.

512
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,620
I can't believe it, this is indecent.

513
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,350
Since we won, you should get lost, please.

514
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:51,430
We're going to see the full-glass bathroom.

515
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,540
It's the end of the world.

516
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,630
I don't know what Wung is going to say.

517
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,300
Wung wanted to choose an ocean-view double bed room from the start.

518
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:03,020
We just did what Wung asked us to. What's the problem?

519
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:09,180
That's right. We've booked lodging. Let's plan the trip itinerary.

520
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,170
That's right. We need to prepare for the next step.

521
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,420
Is it finally my turn? I need to start preparing lingerie.

522
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,280
I think it's going to be a really romantic night.

523
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,830
Where are you all going? What about the other travel plans?

524
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:27,120
Guys, this is a trip. We're not just going to sleep!

525
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,840
  ♫ Are you paying attention to me?  Or  is it meaningless? ♫ 

526
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:37,900
  ♫ Do our eyes keep meeting. Or were you just looking at something behind me? ♫ 

527
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:42,360
  ♫ It's busy inside my head all day long ♫ 

528
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:48,350
  ♫ I'm going to continue to hide it so you won't know how I feel. ♫ 

529
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,630
Yumi.

530
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,530
- What's up with the car? 
 - I borrowed it from my friend.

531
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:02,150
We're going to have fun, so we should at least set the mood.

532
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,170
  ♫ You are smiling ♫ 

533
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:09,460
- This looks cool.
 - I'll take this.

534
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:14,140
  ♫ I have my hunch that ♫ 

535
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:18,290
  ♫ I care about you. ♫ 

536
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:22,100
I'll take you there safely and carefully.

537
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,690
Thank you, Driver Gu.

538
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,720
Put on your seat belt.

539
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:36,950
  ♫ I want to hear your heart ♫ 

540
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,970
Here. Morning coffee.

541
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,730
Thank you.

542
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,960
- It's refreshing.
 - Today's weather is great too. I think we picked a great day to go on a trip.

543
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,800
You're right.

544
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,390
- Let's go to the hotel first. We can go out after we've put away our luggage. 
 - Sounds good.

545
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:58,190
I heard it's really hard to book Julie Hotel's ocean-view rooms. Good thing we were able to book one.

546
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,150
Thanks for your hard work, Kim Yumi.

547
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,450
Don't mention it.

548
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,030
There's something I haven't told you yet.

549
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:13,860
Oh right! I heard Julie Hotel has some bizarre rooms.

550
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:18,240
Do you know they have rooms where the bathroom walls are all glass?

551
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,920
- What? 
 - You can see people taking care of their business and showering. Isn't that totally bizarre?

552
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,270
Why would they design such a room in a high-end hotel?

553
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:30,880
Who would reserve that except for perverts?

554
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,560
Perverts would probably like it.

555
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,960
If you reserve one, it's like proving you're a pervert. Who would reserve those rooms?

556
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,190
We're departing. Go go.

557
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,570
Go.

558
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:52,960
 Error 

559
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,300
 Episode 17 
 Here comes the Great Majesty 

560
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,070
The weather is so nice.

561
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,110
It is.

562
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:10,470
Yumi. Aren't you hungry?

563
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,890
I'm fine for now.

564
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,640
Then let's go a little further and stop by a rest area. I heard the view is really nice there.

565
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,570
Sounds good.

566
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,560
  ♫ Leave our tired hearts behind ♫ 

567
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,490
  ♫ And think of someone ♫ 

568
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:31,710
  ♫ I've been wasting my thoughts ♫ 

569
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,190
  ♫ On these things that have nothing to do with me ♫ 

570
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:39,040
 Gyoyang Rest Stop 
   ♫ In these times ♫ 

571
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,420
  ♫ That I always spend the same way ♫ 

572
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,880
Are you not getting out?

573
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,730
I'm just going to stay here and listen to music. Is that okay?

574
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,860
- Don't you need to go to the restroom? 
 - I'm fine.

575
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:54,510
Then should I buy mini potatoes and sotteok-sotteok*? You like those. 
  (sausage and rice cake skewer) 

576
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:57,170
- Yes. Sounds good. 
 - Okay.

577
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,410
Answer, answer. Hurry up and answer.

578
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,240
 Hello. This is Julie Hotel with the best views in Sokcho. 

579
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,510
 Please press the number for the service you need. 

580
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:24,070
 This is Julie Hotel, always trying our best– 

581
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:29,440
Hello? I need to modify my reservation. It's under Kim Yumi.

582
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,190
I made a reservation for two nights starting today, but I want to cancel it.

583
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:37,620
It's not possible to get a refund if you cancel on the day of your arrival. Would you still like to cancel?

584
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:42,560
- You won't refund anything? 
  - That's right. We can't refund if you cancel on the day of the reservation. 

585
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:49,040
Then can I switch to a different room? The view doesn't matter.

586
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,140
Parking lot views or twin beds are good too.

587
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,010
 Julie Hotel. 
 Sokcho 

588
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:57,370
All the rooms are booked for today.

589
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:02,040
I really need to change the room. Any room is fine. Please.

590
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:07,180
It's not possible for now, but I'll contact you if any bookings get canceled.

591
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:11,020
Just in case there isn't any, I have a situation,

592
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:18,850
so I'll just cancel the reservation.

593
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:22,100
 We can't refund you. Is that all right with you? 

594
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,170
- Yes, there's no other— 
 - It's non-refundable! 
 - No!

595
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:30,500
Do you know how much that room costs? If you're going to cancel, then kill me first. 
  Non-refundable 

596
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,810
 Would you like me to cancel your reservation? 

597
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,780
No. Never mind. I understand.

598
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,940
 Thank you. 

599
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,110
 Non-refundable 

600
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,240
What should I do?

601
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,550
There's no other way. Given the situation,

602
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,870
- We have no choice but to deny it. 
 - Deny it?

603
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:06,070
We have to deny it. Say we didn't know about the full-glass bathrooms.

604
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,770
We can't become a pervert.

605
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,380
We've arrived. Julie Hotel. Can you see it?

606
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:22,810
Yes. It looks nice.

607
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,210
- What's the name the reservation is under? 
 - Kim Yumi.

608
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,080
You've reserved an ocean-view double room for two nights.

609
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,970
Yes, that's right.

610
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:46,740
Here you are. Enjoy your stay.

611
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,820
- Let's go. 
 - Yes.

612
00:47:55,090 --> 00:48:00,060
If it's on the 19th floor, the view must be really nice. Good choice, Kim Yumi.

613
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,510
 Julie Hotel 

614
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,970
Let's go in.

615
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:21,310
Look at that view. That's a real ocean view.

616
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:23,140
Wow.

617
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,910
What is that?

618
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:29,970
What is this?

619
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,440
What's wrong?

620
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,480
Yumi, look at this. The bathroom.

621
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:45,780
Oh my goodness. Is this the bizarre room you mentioned earlier?

622
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,700
What's going on?

623
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:55,280
There are probably blinds or something. There's nothing.

624
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,680
- There's really nothing? 
 - There's really nothing.

625
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,040
What is this? Is there no other bathroom?

626
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,980
Wait a moment.

627
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:19,910
I wonder what happened? I just booked a double-bed room with an ocean view as you told me to.

628
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:23,950
It's an ocean-view double room all right.

629
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:27,740
- Did they tell you the bathroom is like this? 
 - No.

630
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:34,120
That's ridiculous. They should've told us in advance. How can we shower here?

631
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,110
You're right.

632
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:38,050
This is absurd.

633
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:47,070
But the view is so nice. Let's just forgive them because the view is nice.

634
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,740
Are you really fine with this?

635
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:56,580
I'm not fine, but what can we do? It's happened already.

636
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:01,550
Can't we just take turns leaving the room when the other person is showering?

637
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:04,150
Still. How can we—

638
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:06,840
I'm fine with it, Wung.

639
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:11,980
I'm really fine with it.

640
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,620
Well, if you're fine with it then...

641
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:18,220
I'm happy just to be able to stay at Julie Hotel.

642
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,350
Thank you, Wung.

643
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,510
It worked. It worked. He believes us.

644
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:29,680
Our acting was so great. Now we can have a great time!

645
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,110
Look at that. It's the ocean.

646
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,850
It's so nice. Wung, this view is really amazing.

647
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:44,070
I really like this place.

648
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,690
Wung, come out and take a look.

649
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:58,630
Wung!

650
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:02,130
Where did he go?

651
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,210
Wung!

652
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,700
 Yes, Yumi! 

653
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,350
Wung, where are you?

654
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:27,040
- I'm going to the lobby. 
 - Why?

655
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,100
I'm going to make a complaint. I can't just let this pass.

656
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:33,080
Why? The room is nice. I told you I'm fine with it.

657
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,650
No, I have to say what I have to say. Just relax.

658
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:39,280
Wung! Wung?

659
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:45,660
All right. Yes, understood.

660
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,210
How can I help you?

661
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,500
We just checked in a little while ago.

662
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,760
I see. Is there a problem with your room?

663
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,880
- There is. 
 - What's the problem?

664
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,840
The bathroom is full-glass.

665
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:05,570
Pardon? Oh, that room has a special full-glass bathroom.

666
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:11,360
That's the problem right now. We made a reservation for a standard ocean-view double bed room.

667
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,790
Excuse me, but how can we use the bathroom if we're embarrassed?

668
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:18,020
Don't you need to notify us in advance when we make the reservation?

669
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:22,390
I'm pretty sure we did inform you. There are exactly three such rooms in our hotel.

670
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:26,490
If the customer doesn't ask for that sort of room first, we have a rule of not giving it.

671
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:31,070
I'm complaining because I got that room when I didn't want it.

672
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:33,710
That's not possible.

673
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,230
Where did he go?!

674
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,750
 Hello? 

675
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,780
Wung, where are you? I don't see you in the lobby.

676
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,730
I'm in the hotel's office.

677
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,280
The hotel's office?!

678
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,800
They keep saying they informed us in advance and are blaming you for it.

679
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,190
So I got upset and came to meet the reservation manager.

680
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:04,470
 They could have just apologized, but they kept saying that it isn't their fault. 

681
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:10,110
I said let's hear the recording then and they said let's hear it.

682
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:13,150
What did you say? No, Wung. Stop.

683
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:16,690
We came here to have a good time, what are you doing? What's the point of listening to the recording?

684
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:19,420
I'm just asking for my consumer's rights.

685
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:22,630
When I'm mad, I see things to the end.

686
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:26,990
Sir! You said you made the reservation on the 27th at 12 o'clock, right?

687
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:28,850
Yes.

688
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:31,330
Yumi, hold on.

689
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:33,320
Wung, no!

690
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,400
He—Hello?

691
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,710
What is this? You said it would be fine if we just denied it.

692
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:45,100
What? Who knew Wung was such a persistent guy?

693
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,760
Why in the world is this happening?

694
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,330
Excuse me.

695
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,080
- Where is the reservation office? 
 - Excuse me?

696
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,350
The reservation office.

697
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:59,380
Oh, you have to go that way.

698
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,630
Thank you.

699
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:07,320
Listen to this. This employee talked to Kim Yumi on the phone twice.

700
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:13,570
 This is Julie Hotel with the best service always. What can I help you with?  

701
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:17,230
 I'd like to reserve a room for August 1st and 2nd. 

702
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:20,650
 Yes, ma'am, what kind of room would you like? 

703
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:23,200
 An ocean-view, double-bed room, please. 

704
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,700
See? An ocean-view with double-bed room! Right?

705
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,530
When is she asking for a full-glass bathroom?

706
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:39,150
 Then what about other rooms? Are they all booked? 

707
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:42,480
 The double-bed room I mentioned earlier is the only one left. 

708
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,790
 You said you didn't want the full-glass bathroom– 

709
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,400
- Yumi, when did you— 
 - Let's go.

710
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,340
Wait. Wait a moment. I haven't heard it all yet.

711
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:56,520
I- I asked them to give me that room. I was the one who asked them to give me that room.

712
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,370
What?

713
00:54:57,370 --> 00:55:00,180
I asked them to give me that room. Let's go now.

714
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,510
Wait—

715
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:06,590
 It doesn't matter! I like full-glass bathrooms! Please give me the full-glass bathroom! 

716
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,190
 All right, ma'am. 

717
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:21,990
We're screwed.

718
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:24,100
What do we do?

719
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:28,220
We're screwed. We're screwed.

720
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:31,590
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

721
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:33,590
We're screwed.

722
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,890
What's wrong with him?

723
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:43,480
I told you I was the one who asked for that room.

724
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,580
I told you, right?

725
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:49,060
Have a nice day!

726
00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:01,360
There were no other rooms left.

727
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:05,320
I see.

728
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,890
Then, shall we go?

729
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,730
Yes.

730
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:19,220
♫   What is obvious while looking at me today   ♫

731
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:22,180
Have a nice time in our hotel.

732
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:26,790
♫  Although there aren't enough clues, I have my hunch  that  ♫

733
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:30,130
♫  I care about you  ♫

734
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:33,360
♫  I want to hear your heart  ♫

735
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:40,510
♫  Are you paying attention to me? Or is it meaningless?  ♫

736
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:43,880
♫  Will I continue to be conscious of the smallest hint?  ♫

737
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,580
Where should we go?

738
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,000
♫  I'm so curious it's driving me crazy  ♫

739
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,720
Are we going to our room?

740
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,250
Huh?

741
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:56,500
Or...

742
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,450
Shall we go out?

743
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,810
Huh?

744
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,970
You're hungry, right?

745
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:04,800
Let's eat first.

746
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:07,670
All right.

747
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:10,660
Yes. All right.

748
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,170
Let's go.

749
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:25,290
What did I say? What did I say?

750
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,780
We're screwed.

751
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:31,960
Didn't I say that we shouldn't get the full-glass bathroom room?

752
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,660
You went too far after listening to Naughty, that lewd devil.

753
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,110
Now we are so humiliated.

754
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:39,660
Etiquette, would you mind being quiet?

755
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:42,160
Reason has lost his mind right now.

756
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,140
Whatever will be, will be.

757
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:55,340
Try the suyuk* too. 
  (boiled pork) 

758
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:02,040
It's good, right?

759
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,480
Yes.

760
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:08,020
Where should we go after we're done eating?

761
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,930
Anywhere.

762
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,340
What should we do about the room?

763
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:22,260
It's a little uncomfortable, but the view is nice. Should we just use it?

764
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,190
It's the weekend, so it'll be hard to reserve anywhere else.

765
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:33,290
You told me to reserve an ocean-view, double-bed room.

766
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:35,410
That's why I did it.

767
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:40,210
- I know. 
 - That was really the only room left.

768
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:44,110
- All right. 
 - It wasn't because I like the full-glass bathroom.

769
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:47,560
I got it.

770
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:54,120
Why are you laughing? Are you laughing at me right now?

771
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,710
Do you think I'm a pervert?

772
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:59,140
No, it's not that, it's because you're cute.

773
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:03,340
Cute? You always say cute when you don't know what to say.

774
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:06,000
- I thought it was funny so I just– 
 - What's so funny?

775
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,990
I'm serious right now.

776
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:10,670
The situation is kind of funny.

777
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:14,760
I never laughed when you came over to my place and had diarrhea all night.

778
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:18,900
Compared to that, this situation isn't even funny, don't you think?

779
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:25,130
Just a sec! That was a little harsh. How can she bring up diarrhea?

780
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:30,180
Woah. She's just saying that because she's so embarrassed by this situation.

781
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,850
We need to be understanding right now.

782
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:34,670
Hey!

783
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:37,910
Out of the way!

784
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:40,030
The great king is coming!

785
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:42,230
Who is that?

786
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:44,790
He is... it can't be!

787
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:51,490
- He's the second son of Prince Angry. They say when he comes, he stays for three years. He's ... 
 - He's...

788
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:53,930
He's King Salty!

789
00:59:55,430 --> 01:00:01,240
The king's feeling uncomfortable. Everybody out of the way!

790
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,770
No!

791
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:04,770
Your Majesty!

792
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:07,770
I apologize for saying this but you can't be salty right now.

793
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,470
Yumi is very embarrassed and ashamed by the situation.

794
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:15,370
We need to be understanding. Please be sympathetic.

795
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,880
What? Don't tell me he's already salty?

796
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,820
His personality is horrible.

797
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,540
Ppoong!

798
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:39,630
Is that so?

799
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:42,890
Yes, well...

800
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,440
I guess you're right.

801
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:04,580
Put yourself in my place, how you would feel?

802
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,820
I don't think I'd feel good.

803
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:14,750
Then what should we do? Should we just go back home?

804
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:18,860
We can just cancel the hotel and go home. Do as you wish.

805
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:23,000
- Now? 
 - If you want to go, we have to go now.

806
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,820
Even if we leave now, we'll get home at night.

807
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:29,270
How can we go back home? We don't have to go this far.

808
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:33,600
Please stop being salty, your Majesty.

809
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,330
Ppoong!

810
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:42,970
I don't really care.

811
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:44,560
I'm just worried it might be too hard for you to drive.

812
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,790
I'm fine.

813
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,130
- Yeah? 
 - Yes.

814
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:53,540
Then well... whatever. It doesn't matter to me.

815
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,320
Then let's go.

816
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:00,000
- I'd like to pay. 
 - All right.

817
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:06,300
We're going back home?

818
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,730
Good thinking.

819
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:11,710
Let's go home rather than be treated as a pervert.

820
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:16,440
No! We came all the way here. What are you saying?

821
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:20,530
 Eonni Makguksu 

822
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:24,020
Let's go.

823
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:49,420
Can I turn on some music?

824
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:52,790
   

825
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,590
I thought you were canceling the hotel.

826
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,520
I should.

827
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:06,150
Shouldn't you do it now?

828
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:10,250
It's non-refundable anyway. I can do it at a rest stop.

829
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:21,140
Oh, the bags! We left the bags in the room. What do we do?

830
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:33,550
We can just go get them.

831
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,720
Look at the ocean.

832
01:03:53,510 --> 01:04:00,570
♫  Holiday where through the leaves there is a small boat.  ♫

833
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:10,200
♫  Spread your arms and follow the wind's path.  ♫

834
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:17,300
♫  A holiday where through the leaves there was a small boat and me.  ♫

835
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:24,580
♫  Spread your arms and follow the wind's path.  ♫

836
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,810
Can you go up and grab the bags?

837
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:38,730
I'll cancel the room since I'm here.

838
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:50,090
What can I help you with?

839
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:55,150
I'd like to cancel my room. Room 1920.

840
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:59,050
I will check and help you with that. Just a moment.

841
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:04,430
♫  Always in the evening when I can't fall asleep  ♫

842
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:08,600
♫  the phone and a glass of wine  ♫

843
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:16,940
♫  Number and tango, secret, chasing the light  ♫

844
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:27,430
♫  The more the problem can't be resolved, the more the night slips away  ♫

845
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:34,220
♫  Holiday where I wore out my soles from being on a stomping path  ♫

846
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:40,970
 Why do we have to go home when it's this romantic? 

847
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:47,200
I don't want to go home. You said we'd take a walk on the beach early in the morning.

848
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,970
I wanted to do a face mask together on that bed.

849
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:55,270
We still have six more makguksu restaurants left.

850
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:58,780
You know how much that room cost? Although I wasn't the one to pay for it,

851
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:01,920
still this is crazy!

852
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,470
Be quiet! Everybody stop crying.

853
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:08,760
We need to stand firm if we want to rebuild our broken dignity.

854
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,670
What is she saying?

855
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:15,180
♫  I still remember you. It's 24th summer night  ♫

856
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:24,770
♫  I also unconsciously pretend to forget even my old face  ♫

857
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:31,610
♫  Holiday where I spread my two arms and let my body go on the wind's path  ♫

858
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:33,680
Why did you come up?

859
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,850
To help you with the bags.

860
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:38,540
- Are you going up? 
 - Yes, I'm going up.

861
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:40,550
Excuse me.

862
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:48,660
Did you cancel?

863
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:53,090
Are they really not refunding even a little bit?

864
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:00,210
That's so mean. I'm never coming back here.

865
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:03,980
I didn't cancel.

866
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:08,940
- You didn't? 
 - I didn't yet.

867
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:11,080
I wanted to ask you first.

868
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:14,650
Why? You said you were canceling.

869
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:16,640
- It felt like a waste. 
 - You said it was fine.

870
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,420
Not the money.

871
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,360
I don't want to waste this moment.

872
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,890
Should I cancel?

873
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:34,710
Do as you wish. It's your credit card.

874
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:48,260
Yumi.

875
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,670
Let's not cancel.

876
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:55,240
I like that full-glass bathroom.

877
01:07:55,240 --> 01:08:00,650
- What? 
 - I actually like full-glass bathrooms.

878
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:08,050
There you go again! No! You have to maintain your dignity—

879
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:11,310
Dignity or whatever, get lost!

880
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:15,310
How insolent! Let me go right this moment!

881
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:17,610
How long are you going to be salty like that during this important moment?

882
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:19,650
We caught King Salty!

883
01:08:19,650 --> 01:08:23,610
Let me go! I'm salty!

884
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:42,640
♫  Like a star    ♫

885
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:47,240
♫  Always stay by my side   ♫

886
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:51,720
♫  Like a star shining in the dark night  ♫

887
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:58,320
♫  Always shine brightly by my side  ♫

888
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,440
♫  Like a star while looking at me smile brightly  ♫

889
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:05,010
♫  While looking at me smile brightly  ♫

890
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:11,310
♫  You who are so precious to me  ♫

891
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:18,730
♫  Always by my side, remain at my side  ♫

892
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:26,790


893
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:41,000
♫  Sometimes I sleep tightly curled  ♫

894
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:46,810
♫  Hiding a lot of pain  ♫

895
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:51,650
♫  And comfort me  ♫

 Yumi's Cells 
 ~ Preview ~ 

897
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:00,250
 Wung is falling in love with Yumi right now. 

898
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:03,630
 I'm sure there's no way but why don't we still check? 

899
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:07,910
 Yumi, you have a boyfriend? She claims that she has one, but there's no proof. 

900
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:09,780
 Wung, you're my boyfriend. 

901
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:12,570
 You need to come to my friend's wedding as my boyfriend. 

902
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:16,550
 You need to come and defeat all those terrible incarnations of jealousy. Got it, Wung? 

903
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:17,810
 Let's hurry. 

904
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:21,220
 But when is your boyfriend coming? Yumi, your boyfriend. 

905
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:23,900
 Let things be. 

906
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:30,270
♫  Always by my side, remain at my side  ♫
