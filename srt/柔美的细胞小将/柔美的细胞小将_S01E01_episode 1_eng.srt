 Episode 1 
 Assistant Manager Kim Yumi 
 Daehan Noodles 
 Accounting Department 

4
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,980
Wake up.

5
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,610
Seonbae*, wake up. We will be late. 
 (senior at work) 

6
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,510
What time is it?

7
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,350
7:30 am.

8
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,390
It's okay. Let's sleep for ten more minutes.

9
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,620
Did you sleep well?

10
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,000
Did you sleep well, Seonbae?

11
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,980
What was that?

12
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,540
What was that?

13
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,560
What was that?

14
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,620
 This is our Yumi. 

15
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,250
 Kim Yumi. 32 years old. 

16
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,480
She's been living alone for the past four years.

17
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,980
She isn't married and also does not have a boyfriend.

18
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,250
Her last date was three years ago.

19
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,180
 Sorry. I think this is it for us. 

20
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,200
 What  did you say? 

21
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,830
 This hurts but I will let you go for the sake of your happiness. 

22
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,610
 I am happy right now too. 

23
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,350
 Who says I'm unhappy? 

24
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,610
Yumi ... take care.

25
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,940
♫  Where are you going?  ♫

26
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,470
 Is it over when only you say it is? 

27
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,980
How can it be one-sided like this?

28
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,260
Wait!

29
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,620
 Wait right there for a second! 

30
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,890
Let's talk some more!

31
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,900
Are you all right?

32
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,130
Wait for me!

33
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,970
 There are some good things about Yumi not dating. 

34
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,740
 First, you spend less money on buying clothes. 

35
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,510
 Second, 

36
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,980
 you don't have to clean the house every day wondering if that guy is going to come over. 

37
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,140
 Third, 

38
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,700
 you don't have too much on your mind, so you can focus on work. 

39
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,570
 Accounting Team 
 Kim Yumi 

40
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,620
 She worked so hard that she got promoted last month. 

41
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,040
Assistant Manager Kim.

42
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,990
- Yes. 
 - When will you be finished with the sales report for the Geumgang Mill?

43
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,140
I think it will be done in 30 minutes.

44
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,430
I am checking it right now.

45
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,750
- Please hurry. 
 - All right.

46
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,540
- Oh, that's right. Assistant Manager Kim. 
 - Yes?

47
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,950
We need to send the changed inventory to Mr. Chae Wu Gi in the Sales department.

48
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,580
All right.

49
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,530
- Oh, Assistant Manager Kim! 
 -Yes?

50
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,940
You can just send them the digital file. Are you going to deliver it yourself?

51
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,860
The Sales department will have to print it out anyway, so why bother?

52
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,390
I can just go and drop it off.

53
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,270
- All right then. 
 - All right.

54
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,420
Eonni, give it to me.

55
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,970
- I'm going to a meeting with the Sales department. I'll give it to them. 
 - What?

56
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,400
You are busy.

57
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,200
Thank you!

58
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,300
 Since she doesn't need to spend money, she's been saving a lot, and she's been doing well at work.  

59
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,170
 We have adapted to Yumi's life without a boyfriend. 

60
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,940
But...

61
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,860
Seonbae.

62
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,120
 This guy is the problem. 

63
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,160
 Wu Gi, a hubae* in the Sales department who even appeared in her dream.
 (junior) 

64
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,690
Good morning.

65
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,650
- Good morning. 
 - Are you busy?

66
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,160
Yes, because today is the deadline.

67
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,440
That's right, today is the deadline for the Accounting team.

68
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,700
Oh, right. Ruby took the changed inventory and said she would take it to you.

69
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,520
All right, I will take a look.

70
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,020
- All right. 
 - Have a good day.

71
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,620
Oh, right, Seonbae.

72
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,680
You live in Ilsan, right?

73
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,060
What? Yes.

74
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,990
- Where in Ilsan? 
 -Baekseok-dong. But why do you ask?

75
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,800
It's nothing. Then work hard. Seonbae, fighting.

76
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,490
All right, you have a good day too.

77
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,350
- Hello, Section Chief. 
 - Oh, Wu Gi. Hello.

78
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,740
Why would he ask where I live in Ilsan?

79
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,070
It was out of the blue. Makes me wonder.

80
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,470
 Yumi! You need to work. You are busy right now. 

81
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,580
 Concentrate! Concentrate! 

82
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,080
- Should I ask? 
  Why should you ask! Aren't you going to work? 

83
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,500
 Why not? Let's ask. 

84
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,200
Assistant Manager Kim, your coffee is here.

85
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,520
Hey Yumi, the coffee shop worker is really good-looking.

86
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,870
Is it all done?

87
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,100
Excuse me?

88
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,000
- The sales deadline. 
 - No, not yet.

89
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,400
I have a meeting at 11 and was hoping to see it before then.

90
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,200
Yes.

91
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,580
What's the big deal?

92
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,710
Just to ask that right now...

93
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,300
 That's right, it's not a big deal. Work is important right now. 

94
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,500
 What do you mean? Maybe Wu Gi was sending a signal! 

95
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,900
 Who asks about where someone lives first thing in the morning? 

96
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,900
 - This is definitely some (flirting). 
 - Some? 

97
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,090
 Yes, some! 

98
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,720
- Reason.
 - Yes?

99
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,900
This is flirting.

100
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,470
If this is not flirting, then what is?

101
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,890
Sensitivity, then are you saying that Wu Gi is interested in Yumi too?

102
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,220
I think so! I have a feeling!

103
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,400
- Flirting? 
 - Really?!

104
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,100
- Wu Gi likes Yumi? 
 - Really? Wow!

105
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Reason, let's confirm it.   "Some" is occurring.

106
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,840
Some is happening.

107
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,570
Yes.

108
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,660
- I'll find that out next time. 
 - Oh, okay.

109
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,810
Hello.

110
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,890
Excuse me for a moment.

111
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,450
But isn't this a bit too much? Calling him out while he is in a meeting.

112
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,340
The meeting didn't start yet. She can ask him as if she thought of it while passing by.

113
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,700
Hey guys ... I am nervous, though.

114
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,400
Anxiety, about what?

115
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,590
I think those co-workers will think it's weird.

116
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,870
Look at their expressions, especially Ruby!

117
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,330
What if Ruby spreads rumors?

118
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,340
That's what I'm saying. What's so special about asking where you live in Ilsan?

119
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:00,510
It will be obvious that she is hitting on someone five years younger!

120
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,320
Did you call me? Why?

121
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,350
Seonbae?

122
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,100
Oh... that's ,..

123
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,800
 - Yumi, you can't! 
 - Yumi, you can't! 

124
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,850
Why do you think I called you out?

125
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,520
Excuse me?

126
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,930
Take a guess.

127
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,740
What?

128
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,050
Section Chief Oh is coming. You should hurry on in.

129
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,780
Seonbae!

130
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,810
Yumi. Where have you been? I bought you coffee.

131
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,260
Hey, the ice is melting. Here, drink it.

132
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,740

Exactly! What did you just do?

138
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,310
Still ... I think it is a good thing that she didn't ask! She was about to look like a loser.

139
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:18,060
What do you mean it is a good thing?! So frustrating. Fine, let's just die alone like this, then.

140
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:23,900
Sensitivity, wouldn't it be better to remain an elegant seonbae than a loser seonbae?

Section Chief Nam. Assistant Manager Kim. I'm heading home. Goodbye.

- Goodbye. 
 - Have a good night.

If you multiple this by 0.033,

It's not right again.

How come it doesn't match up?

It's been a while since we've moved it, so it's hard to turn.

Sensitivity, help us! Today is the deadline!

158
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:03,800
Using her brain is your job. I am in charge of her emotions. Why are you asking me?

159
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,490
We need to finish it quickly so that we can go home quickly.

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,940
Sunset?!

162
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,130
Okay, come on guys. What are you all doing? Aren't we going home?

163
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,020
Of course, we have to.

164
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:36,410
Okay, it's turning! Stay strong!

165
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,160
Heave ho! Heave ho!

166
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,920
Oh, it's right! It's right.

167
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,580
That's it! That was it!

168
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,870
Heave ho! Heave ho!

169
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,730
What? What is that?!

170
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,510
No!

171
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,060
Why are you appearing right now? Not right now, Hunger!

172
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,610
I am hungry. I want to eat something.

173
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,590
I'm hungry.

174
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,570
I'm hungry.

175
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,130
I can't...

176
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,270
If I leave right now, it'll take 30 minutes.

177
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,210
I can't. I have to wait.

178
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,510
Hunger, stop it!

179
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,800
I am hungry! Give me something to eat!

180
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,040
Look at him! He keeps getting bigger!

181
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,180
- Stop right now, please! 
 - Give me cell snacks!

182
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,300
Yumi, where are you going again?

183
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,300
- I am going to buy some kimbap. 
 - Hey!  We can eat together once this is done.

184
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,160
I can't wait any more. My hands are shaking.

185
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,020
She must be very hungry...

186
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,740
Here you go.

187
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,390
- Thank you! Hope you sell a lot. 
 - Take care.

188
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,730
Seonbae Yumi!

189
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,650
Oh, Wu Gi.

190
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,540
You didn't leave work yet. Did you not meet the deadline?

191
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,480
Not yet. I am doing it right now.

192
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,340
What about your dinner?

193
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,860
- I bought gimbap. - Would that be enough?

194
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,770
It is enough.

195
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,290
Choose one of these.

196
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:11,310
There is iced coffee, latte, iced tea, and peppermint. I have everything.

197
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,480
- I'm all right. 
 - I think there will be one left over anyway.

198
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,250
Which one do you like?

199
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,810
- Hm ...  then, iced coffee?

200
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,290
This is iced coffee.

201
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,980
Hold on.

202
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,970
Oh, be careful!

203
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,030
 Daehan Noodles 

204
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,610
They held hands!

205
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,860
It almost dropped.

206
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,000
- You are going in, right? 
 - Yes. Shall we?

207
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,110
I will open it for you.

208
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,670
They held hands! They held hands twice!

209
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:35,230
They held hands! They held hands twice!

210
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,920
Come in.

211
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,640
Oh... thank you.

212
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,130
- Do you still have a lot to do? 
 - Excuse me?

213
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,270
I asked if you still have a lot to do.

214
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,860
Well, I'm almost...

215
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,370
You are almost done! You just need to wrap it up, so maybe 30 minutes ...

216
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,560
- wait.
 - Huh?

217
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,790
- Detective! 
 - This fool.

218
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,980
When she will finish is not what is important!

219
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,650
Wu Gi wants to know if he can work overtime with Yumi.

220
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,330
- Based on what? 
 - Do you want me to tell you?

221
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,690
See those drinks that Wu Gi is holding?

222
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:41,510
Why do you think he bought so many drinks? It means the sales department will be working overtime for a long time.

223
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,000
And another important clue from this morning.

224
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,860
- What? 
 - Clue? 
 - What is it?

225
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,200
A clue from this morning?

226
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,390
You fool. You don't know?

227
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,060
Why Wu Gi asked that in the morning?

228
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,520
 You live in Ilsan right? Where in Ilsan? 

229
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,810
Wu Gi already had everything thought out.

230
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:02,750
Today is finally the day of taking the chance!

231
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,940
Perhaps today they will work overtime together,

232
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,120
and they can leave work together in Wu Gi's car,

233
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,880
and Wu Gi will take her home,

234
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,250
- and then... 
- And then what?

235
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:15,820
And perhaps, it will be a night they won't forget for the rest of their lives.

236
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:22,510
All right.  So Yumi needs to stay late at work today!

237
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,550
You asked if I had a lot to do?

238
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,270
There's a lot to do. I have a lot left to do.

239
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,400
Oh, is that so?

240
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,220
I think I'll finish late.

241
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,200
I see.

242
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,650
I guess you're working overtime too today?

243
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,530
- Me? 
 - Yes.

244
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,510
No.

245
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,100
- Huh? 
 - Ah ...

246
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,690
I feel sorry since the youngest members are working overtime so I'm bringing this to them before leaving.

247
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,100
But that's a shame. Seonbae, you said you live in Ilsan.

248
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,530
I'm also going to Ilsan today because I have plans there.

249
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,310
I was going to give you a ride if you finished early.

250
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,980
It was a chance to do something for you today. That's a shame.

251
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,390
- Aren't you getting in? 
 - Huh?

252
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:28,490
 It makes Korea healthy. 

253
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,800
Detective? As if.

254
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,780
Do you call that a deduction?

255
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,090
You idiot!

256
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,120
You're always out of your mind!

257
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,850
I'll get going first.

258
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,430
- All right. 
 - Bye.

259
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,210
See you tomorrow.

260
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,110
Yumi, this is really good.

261
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,400
Aren't you going to eat?

262
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,990
- You lost your touch, Kim Yumi. 
 - Touch?

263
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:17,160
I lost my touch and my hunches.

264
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,790
I'm lonely.

265
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,560
 Did I take a break from dating for too long? 

266
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,020
 No, it's because there isn't a love cell. 

267
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,870
♫  I'm right here  ♫

 On the day that Yumi's tears flooded the village. 

284
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,580
Love!

285
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,960
Love!

286
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,800
Love!

287
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,200
 Although rumor has it that the love cell was swept away by tears and died,

00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:40,190
You have to do something. Can't you wake her up?

291
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,880
I can't do anything either.

292
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,370
 She didn't die, 

293
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:47,600
 but she has been in a coma for three years. 

294
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,250
I'm going home now, Section Chief.

295
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,450
Assistant Manager Kim, please organize this income statement.

296
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,590
- All right. 
 - Thank you.

297
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,080
 Yumi lost her touch and hunches. 

298
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,220
 Her passion and desire for dating have disappeared too. 

299
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,190
 Maybe Yumi will really grow old by herself. 

300
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:26,760
 Chae Wu Gi. 

301
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,650
Hello?

302
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,140
 It's me, Seonbae. 

303
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,820
Yes, Wu Gi. What's going on?

304
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,170
 You're still at the office, right? 

305
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:44,180
-Yes, why? 
  - Ah... 

306
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,760
 The hyeong I was planning to meet said he was going to be late, so I went and came back. 

307
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,950
  If you're done, let's go together. I'll take you home. 

308
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,120
You'll take me ... home?

309
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,020
Yes.

310
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:13,350
Let's go together. I'll take you home.

311
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,830
I...

312
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:23,760
But I don't know how much time this will take.

313
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,030
It's all right. I will wait.

314
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,290
 It was at that moment 

315
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,310
 that Love opened her eyes, after three years.

 Yumi VS Ruby

Reason, I think you're going too fast!

318
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,740
I can't control myself.

319
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,860
Be careful!

320
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:55,230
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

321
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,110
 It's all right, I'll wait. 

322
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:07,590
Sensitivity. I've never seen Yumi's head turn that fast.

323
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,650
Yumi, fighting!

324
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,590
Yumi, fighting!

325
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,410
 Financial Report 

326
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,960
 Financial Report 

327
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,070
Section Chief, here you are.

328
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,710
- I checked three times, there's no error. 
 - Oh...

329
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,580
Good work. Then you can—

330
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,670
Can I go home?

331
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,860
What?

332
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,380
You said 'leave work' just now.

333
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,060
That's right. You can go.

334
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,600
Yes, Section Chief. See you tomorrow.

335
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,550
I was going to tell you to wait

336
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,650
and ask to leave together ...

337
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:06,320
It's scary, being alone.

338
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,370
I ... I heard a noise.

339
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,340
Is there still someone here?

340
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,180
Hello?

341
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,680
Oh, Wu Gi. I just finished now.

342
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,160
You waited for a long time, right?

343
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,530
No. Come out to the first floor.

344
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,230
- I took out the car. 
 - Okay.

345
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,970
- I'll come right away. 
  - All right. 

346
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,360
Seonbae!

347
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:08,050
Sit in the front.

348
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,750
Yes.

349
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:35,060
Date! Date! First date in three years!

350
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,020
Sorry. I'm so late, right?

351
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,100
- It's all right. 
 - Section Chief Nam is such a stickler.

352
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,450
 Good work today, Eonni! 

353
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,240
Ruby?

354
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,640
Eonni?

355
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,920
Eonni, Ruby wants to come too.

356
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,260
Ruby also has plans at Ilsan.

357
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,530
I totally hit the lottery. I had plans to meet with my friend in Ilsan.

358
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,650
I was wondering how I would get there when I ran right into Oppa* Wu Gi. 
 (affectionate address for an older brother or a romantic interest) 

359
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:22,730
Coincidentally, he said he was also going to Ilsan because he had plans there, too.

360
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,600
Oops, I called you Oppa Wu Gi so naturally.

361
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,090
Is that all right with you?

362
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,790
Well ...

363
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,010
Why not? I'm going to call you "oppa".

364
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,860
All right, let's get going.

365
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,820
Yes, let's go!

366
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:51,470
My best friend has been living in Ilsan since she got married, and her birthday is tomorrow.

367
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,270
But she's in her third trimester,

368
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:57,420
so I decided to go to Ilsan. In consideration of her pregnancy.

369
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,190
Your friend got married early.

370
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,410
Ruby, aren't you in the class of 2014?

371
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:05,790
That's right. You're in the class of 2013, right?

372
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,530
That's right.

373
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:10,200
And Eonni you're in the class of 2009, right?

374
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,340
- Huh? 
 - You're five years older than me, so...

375
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,510
You are class of 2009, right?

376
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,730
No, I'm in the class of 2008.

377
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,480
2008? Really?

378
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,020
- Yes. 
 - Seonbae, we're five years apart?

379
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,000
I thought it was four.

380
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,260
Still, you look really young for your age.

381
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,750
That's fortunate.

382
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,110
Let's drop you off first.

383
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,580
I'm fine, you go first.

384
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,530
No, you can go first.

385
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:59,350
No. You have plans, but I'm just going home so I'm not in a rush.

386
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,230
Wu Gi, let's drop off Ruby first—

387
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,980
I'm going to the same place as Wu Gi.

388
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,320
- What? 
 - The restaurant she's going to is in the same shopping mall I'm going to.

389
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,890
- I see. 
 - We'll go to your place first.

390
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:17,780
All right. Then I'd be really grateful.

391
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,690
Thank you for taking me home.

392
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,860
See you tomorrow.

393
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,410
Get lots of rest, Eonni.

394
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,180
Bye.

395
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,380
Bye-bye Eonni!

396
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,460
That was a fail. Date, my foot.

397
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,480
What kind of date was that?

398
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,260
I'm just going to sleep. Bye.

399
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,120
I thought it was for real this time.

400
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,220
I really thought it was a date.

401
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,820
It's because of Ruby. If she wasn't there—

402
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:20,740
No. It's not Ruby, it's because Love isn't here.

403
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,140
I miss Love.

404
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,860
Sensitivity ...

405
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,230
Where are you going?

406
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,620

 Who am I? 

422
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:26,860
 Kim Yumi, who are you?
   

423
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,630
 I'm not ambitious. 

424
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:36,080
 I'm not enjoying life, nor having a good time. 

425
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,950
I thought I would be a cooler adult than I actually am now.

426
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:52,350
There she goes again. Sensitivity explodes from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m.

427
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:58,260
We should've put her to sleep before that. What do we do, Reason? She has work tomorrow.

428
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,000
Wait here.

429
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,900
What on earth is life?

430
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,620
What on earth is love?

431
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,580
Sensitivity? It's time to sleep now.

432
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:11,250
Where do we come from, and where do we go?

433
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,050
- Sensitivity, can you look at me for a second? 
 - What?

434
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,100
Lullaby, now's our chance! Hurry up and put Yumi to sleep!

435
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:35,540
♫ Rockabye Yumi, on the tree-top. ♫

436
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:41,750
 That's right. 
 ♫ Rockabye Yumi, on the tree-top. ♫ 

437
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,000
 Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep. 

438
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:02,720
The more I thing about it, the more it pisses me off. Why would she suddenly ask about my school year?

439
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:07,030
Ruby, that brat.

440
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,890
What's going on? There's a cell that still isn't sleeping?

441
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,900
Revenge?

442
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,220
That stupid mouth of hers.

443
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,900
Let's see what happens, Ruby.

444
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,630
Go to sleep!

445
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,500
Forget it, whatever!

446
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,860
Oh, right.

447
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,900
Did I turn the gas off?

448
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,960
I'm feeling nervous.

449
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,800
What do I do? What if the gas valve explodes?

450
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,330
Please go to sleep!

451
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,100
I turned it off.

452
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,460
I  saw it earlier.

453
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,600
I saw everything.

454
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,020
What on earth did you see?

455
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:11,060
The leftover dumplings in the freezer.

456
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:15,900
 Dumplings 

457
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,530
What are you doing?

458
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:33,850
What are you making at 2 a.m.?

459
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,890
What is this?

460
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,860
 My friend went to the hospital due to labor pains. 

461
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,110
 Wu Gi's plans also fell through. 

462
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:15,130
 We who got rejected are comforting each other in Ilsan. 

463
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:18,590
 We're at Chicken Box. Drinking and eating chicken. 

464
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,660
 Who knows when we're leaving. 

465
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,640
It's just the two of them right now?.

466
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,450
Should I tell you what's going on right now?

467
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,520
Location: Chicken Box

468
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,400
It's a fried chicken restaurant at the Ilsan shopping mall where those two had plans.

469
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,660
They left at 9 p.m. but it's currently 2 a.m.

470
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,570
That means it is not the first round, but the second or even the third round.

471
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,990
Based on the number of fried chicken pieces left,

472
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,300
I'd say there is a 90% chance of this being their third round.

473
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,820
- If they went for a third round, it means their next stop is— 
 - That's enough!

474
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,670
What time is it?

475
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,390
You can sleep more.

476
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,250
Did you sleep well?

477
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:26,090
We're not late, are we?

478
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,200
We're still okay.

479
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:13,950
 Episode 3 
 Prime Cell 

480
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,700
The new guy I told you about, he's weird.

481
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,200
Everyone has their own prime cell.

482
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,960
 They fell asleep, 
   

483
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,610
and let out a really loud fart.

484
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:26,020
 But his own fart woke him up. 
   

485
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,630
I was at a loss for words.

486
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,670
I think he's a weirdo who loves to fart. I have to go.

487
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,970
 A cell with superior ability among all other cells. 
   

488
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:36,590
 The cell that represents that person. 

489
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:40,950
Good morning. 
  Shopping Spree 

490
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:47,170
 Ambition 

491
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,740
 Yes. 

492
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,720
Good morning, Yumi.

493
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,210
Good morning.

494
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,420
Hey, what's wrong with your face?

495
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,770
Why?

496
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,750
It looks like you aged ten years. 
 Nosiness 

497
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,850
Did you get any sleep?

498
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,850
Do you want some coffee?

499
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,650
No.

500
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,020
- Eonni Yi Da, good morning. 
 - Hi.

501
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:49,510
Did you also not get any sleep? You look really tired.

502
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:53,150
How did you know? I didn't get any sleep last night.

503
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,770
I'm right, aren't I? Why, why, why?

504
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:58,070
That's

505
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,470
a secret!

506
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:05,810
What's making you excited?

507
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,480
 Yumi's prime cell was 

508
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:15,910
 Love. 

509
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:20,490
 Love was really amazing. 

510
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:22,810
♫  I didn't hear anything  ♫

511
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:26,570
♫  The small light went out  ♫

512
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,580
♫  Now I can't see anything  either  ♫

513
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,780
Cell snacks are the best.

514
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,390
Stop eating already!

515
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:34,670
Do you want to go on dates with your stomach out?

516
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,850
♫  Even though it was excitement,   ♫

517
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:39,940
It was the only cell that was able to control Hunger.

518
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:43,480
♫  Ling Ling don't make a sad face  ♫

519
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,680
It's warm.

520
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,610
It's minus 10 degrees today.

521
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,760
But it isn't cold at all. It's really warm.

522
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,860
It spreads magic that can make the coldest winds warm.

523
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:58,040
I left my wallet again.

524
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,850
I can pay.

525
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:03,130
♫  I am usually such a person  ♫

526
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:06,780
I want to drink coffee too but I don't have my wallet.

527
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,020
I have a coupon.

528
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:13,610
Yumi.

529
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,160
To be honest, I also don't have cab fare—

530
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,780
I do.

531
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,390
♫  Will you tell me again?  ♫

532
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,340
Yumi, 10,000 won  (≈ 8,5$)  is a bit tight, I think I need at least fifteen thousand.

533
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,700
All right, here.

534
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,480
Let's go. 
 - ♫  Even if you are looking for something new  ♫

535
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,160
♫  I keep remembering the past  ♫

536
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,120
♫  We're going to fall  ♫

537
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,910
 Whatever crappy situation Yumi was in, 

538
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:35,070
Bye!

539
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:38,590
 it was able to make happy memories,   

540
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,190
 The cell of all cells, 

541
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:43,490
 our star. 

542
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,280
Love, this is too hard.

543
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,270
How do you start a relationship?

544
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,790
Eonni, good morning.

545
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:09,520
Did you get some sleep last night?

546
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,290
You got home okay, right?

547
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:16,500
No, I went home at four in the morning.

548
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,370
Why? What were you doing?

549
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:23,210
My plans fell through and the person Wu Gi was supposed to meet was going to be late.

550
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:26,250
We were hungry, so we decided to grab some food while we waited,

551
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:29,790
but his friend didn't come, so we kept drinking while waiting for him.

552
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:32,500
But his friend showed up at three in the morning.

553
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,430
In the end, that guy took me home.

554
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:37,110
Isn't that so funny?

555
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,190
Really?

556
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:40,430
But still, it was pretty fun.

557
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:43,360
Oppa Wu Gi is actually really funny.

558
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,510
You both have such great stamina.

559
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:49,720
It would've been nice if you were there yesterday too.

560
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,400
You should've called. I live nearby too.

561
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,210
I thought you might be tired.

562
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,200
I see, you did that because you were looking out for me?

563
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,760
Yes.

564
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:04,120
Thanks for thinking about me, Ruby.

565
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,460
Of course.

566
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:20,150
Put more strength! We need to smile now!

567
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,990
Eonni, do you know what Oppa Wu Gi does over the weekend?

568
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:32,800
He just stays home. He doesn't seem like the type, right?

569
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,090
It may be because he's a Gemini.

570
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:39,200
And do you know what Oppa Wu Gi's mother does for a living?

571
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,590
It's really surprising.

572
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:44,290
There's this old magazine, right? Just a moment.

573
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,650
Her expression is about to change!

574
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:49,790
No, you have to hold on!

575
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:52,590
If you don't smile here, you'll look weird!

576
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:55,410
I can't!

577
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:03,650
That's why we agreed to go together.

578
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:05,510
- What? 
 - To the flower festival.

579
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:07,050
You two are going to the flower festival?

580
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:10,110
Yes, they say Ilsan is famous for its flower festivals.

581
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:12,860
Yesterday, I saw banners hanging on the wall.

582
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,680
It starts tomorrow.

583
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,160
We talked about it over drinks, but we're actually going.

584
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,200
So I can't back out of it now.

585
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,150
Eonni, what's wrong with your expression?

586
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:30,250
What about it?

587
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,890
Your expression is very mean...

588
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:36,170
Mean? What?

589
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:40,830
Oppa Wu Gi!

590
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:42,760
Good morning.

591
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,860
Seonbae, good morning.

592
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,840
If you show Wu Gi, it's over!

593
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,520
Smile, please!

594
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,510
I heard you had fun yesterday.

595
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:03,970
I'm sorry?

596
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:08,110
Somehow it ended up that way.

597
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:11,090
It's because my friend came at three in the morning.

598
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,190
But it was still a lot of fun.

599
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,800
Oh right. Can we go to the flower festival on Sunday instead?

600
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,810
I forgot I have to go to Busan tomorrow.

601
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:21,410
Fine, let's go on Sunday.

602
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:24,160
Yes! Great!

603
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:31,870
Oppa, since we're going, can we go in the evening?

604
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:35,290
- I heard at night they do fireworks and it looks more spectacular. 
 - Sure.

605
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,880
I'm excited.

606
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,220
Seonbae, you should come too.

607
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:41,580
What?

608
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:45,170
You live in that neighborhood. Come with us.

609
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:50,290
No, it's all right. Why would I?

610
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,550
Do you have plans on Sunday?

611
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:54,370
No, I don't.

612
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:56,390
Then come with us.

613
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,490
I don't know.

614
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:00,700
Come with us, Seonbae.

615
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:04,320
Yes, it'd be great if you came with us.

616
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,330
Come with us, Eonni.

617
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:10,220
It would be great if a bunch of us went. Come with us, Eonni.

618
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,990
Why is she being like that?

619
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,830
Wasn't she interested in Wu Gi?

620
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:16,250
Maybe she's just cheerful and tactless.

621
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,370
We misunderstood Ruby.

622
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:20,470
We misunderstood her.

623
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:22,440
Really?

624
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:27,330
Come with us, Eonni. Will you come with us?

625
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:33,590
All right, I'll go.

626
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:36,960
I'm so happy that you're coming with us.

627
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,850
That's great.

628
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,840
Congrats!

629
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,150
I'm jealous.

630
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:50,300
You even became director,

631
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,350
Section Chief.

632
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:53,930
I have to go.

633
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,750
You should also go to the flower festival with us!

634
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:58,730
Let's all go together. Come over here.

635
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,110
Why? What is it?

636
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,730
The festival?

637
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,300
- Is Section Chief Nam going, too? 
 - Isn't that a good thing?

638
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:15,200
Okay. Everybody concentrate. This is more serious than I thought.

639
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,620
Look closely.

640
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,870
There are four people going to the flower festival.

641
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:21,410
Two men and two women.

642
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:26,550
This is what we want to see, ...

643
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,290
 It's been a long time since I laughed. 

644
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:32,770
- But this is what Ruby wants to see.

645
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:36,090
  What are you looking at? Seriously. 

646
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,460
 This is so fun! 

647
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:43,170
- The reason Ruby suddenly included Section Chief Nam is to set him up with Yumi. 
 - Boo!

648
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,220
Why would she do that?

649
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,870
It doesn't matter if Ruby and Wu Gi end up together.

650
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,300
Of course it matters! Why?

651
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,630
- The section chief is totally wasted. 
 - Our Wu Gi!

652
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:55,700
- Oh my, Section Chief. 
 - Let's hurry up and get away.

653
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,190
Thank you so much!

654
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:00,230
- This is from my heart. 
 - Whoa!

655
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:02,800
I think you are drunk.

656
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,280
Drunk. Definitely drunk.

657
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:10,540
Section Chief Nam is like an older brother to Wu Gi. They are best friends.

658
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:12,790
Assistant Manager Kim!

659
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:14,770
I mean, Miss Yumi.

660
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:17,770
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

661
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:22,140
 The  moment Section Chief Nam gives Yumi a subtle signal ... 

662
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,830
Oppa!

663
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,910
Let's go!

664
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:32,200
 It's highly likely that Wu Gi will give up his interest in Yumi for good. 

665
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,600
Why?  It is because Wu Gi is loyal!

666
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:41,610
Then ... we got affected by Ruby again.

667
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:44,580
That wench is like a fox!

668
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,960
Then, I don't want to go. I would rather not go to the flower festival.

669
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,420
Tell the three of them to go!

670
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,830
- We can't let that happen.
 - Why?

671
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:55,350
If Yumi does not go, then it looks like Section Chief Nam is interfering with the young couple,

672
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:58,400
so the chances of Section Chief Nam not going are high.

673
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,370
Then the two of them will be on a date just as Ruby planned.

674
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:11,850
We got caught in Ruby's trap.

675
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:14,620
I have always hated Ruby!

676
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,520
What do we do?!

677
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,180
Then what do we do now?

678
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:25,120
I don' know either.  I'm really not an expert at this.

679
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:28,070
But we still have to do something!

680
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:32,500
Do you guys like it when the person you like gets along with someone else?

681
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:38,100
How long is she going to live this lonely and miserable life, lying around every weekend with nothing to do?!

682
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:42,780
Doing the same thing every weekend for the last three years. Complaining about being lonely every night.

683
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:46,130
I am sick and tired of this now!

684
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,120
That's right! I'm also fed up with it!

685
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,040
Sensitivity is right.

686
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,060
We can't live like this forever!

687
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,360
- That's right! 
 - We can't live like this!

688
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,840
- Let's change. 
 - Guys, let's fight!

689
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,800
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!

690
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,700
Going for love means playing to win! Let's beat Ruby.

691
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:05,260
Let's beat her!

692
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:08,970
Oppa, let's go here for the second round.

693
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:12,110
They also have a lot of reviews and the star rating is high.

694
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:14,150
- Should we? 
 - Yes.

695
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,770
Or what about this place?

696
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:19,780
This place is good too, but we have to make a reservation by today.

697
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:25,250
- By the way, Assistant Manager Yumi. 
 - Yes.

698
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,370
I forgot,

699
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:32,420
but we're going to get contacted on Sunday about the contract that we need to send to Germany, right?

700
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:35,060
I think we will need to come to work on that day.

701
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:38,480
Oh yes, you're right.

702
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,860
I cannot believe I forgot. Would it be possible to go to the flower festival tomorrow?

703
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:45,980
I guess we should.

704
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,200
I'm fine that, but Ruby might...

705
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:52,390
Tomorrow doesn't work for me. I'm going to Busan.

706
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:54,030
Is that so?

707
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,320
Can you just take care of it sooner?

708
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,870
Or can you do it after the flower festival?

709
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:03,990
I don't think that will work, because Germany also has specific business hours.

710
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,750
Then, why don't we go next week?

711
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,770
- The festival is over next week. 
 - I see...

712
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,170
What should we do...?

713
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:13,740
Now is the time!

714
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:17,820
Here.  In the mixture of jokes,

715
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:23,020
we will add some sincerity, 
    

716
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,620
and just like this... we've created a bait.

717
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:30,520
Fishing, will that bait be okay? Isn't it too obvious?

718
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,090
Sensitivity, don't worry!

719
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:35,260
We mixed it with a lot of jokes, so there are many ways to escape.

720
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,140
Go bait!

721
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,220
Catch a big one!

722
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:46,500
Then, I guess the three of us should go without Ruby tomorrow.

723
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:50,050
But this was my idea to go in the first place.

724
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:52,950
I was just joking, Ruby. How can we leave the youngest behind?

725
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:55,470
We can't go without you two either.

726
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:01,030
No, I'm all right with your original plan.

727
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:03,930
That would be better then.

728
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:07,540
Just the three of you should go and have a good time.

729
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:14,360
That's it. We caught it!

730
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,950
It is coming up!  It is coming up!

731
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,780
Are you really okay with that?

732
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,320
Yes, Ruby is okay!

733
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,440
I can just go with my friends next time.

734
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:32,800
Then...tomorrow the three of us should...

735
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,840
- I am okay. 
 - What?

736
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:40,310
I am okay, so Wu Gi and Assistant Manager Yumi should go.

737
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,920
- Why? 
 - Why?

738
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,190
Come to think of it, I don't have much time tomorrow either.

739
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:46,980
I have a lot to do.

740
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,580
Next time, please include me.

741
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,500
- Section Chief! 
 - Have fun!

742
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,630
What was that? After asking me to go with them.

743
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,420
Then ... is it just us two going?

744
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,080
- Wow, it's a big one! 
 -    

745
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,340
- It's a date! 
 - It's a date!

746
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:27,140
It's a big one!

747
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:32,900
You're right.

748
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:37,890
Somehow it turned out that way. Should we then?

749
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:39,800
Then the two of us will go tomorrow.

750
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:44,260
I didn't even think about going in the first place, but I got roped in.

751
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,700
- Are you going to be okay?

752
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:51,100
- You'll be uncomfortable with just the two of you going. 
 - Huh?

753
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:55,700
Is it uncomfortable for you?

754
00:56:55,700 --> 00:57:00,160
- No– 
 - Of course she's uncomfortable with just the two of you going. Can't you tell?

755
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,180
Eonni did not even want to go but I forced her.

756
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:09,360
 Ruby is interfering again! 

757
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:15,000
The date I finally caught is dying.

758
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,290
Ruby, I am not letting this go! That fox!

759
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:24,350
So frustrating! Go to that damn flower festival, please!!

760
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:28,420
Hurry up and say that you don't mind and that the two of you should go!

761
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,230
She can't!

762
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:34,720
What if Ruby decides to spread some kind of rumor?

763
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,500
The rumor that she is hitting on a guy five years younger than her will spread through the company.

764
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,930
Stop saying that he is five years younger!  We already know that!

765
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:46,510
I'm saying that she can be seen as a fool!

766
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:48,640
From the moment you threw the bait,

767
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,240
she intervened with the younger people and tried taking the guy for herself.

768
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,500
That's being foolish.

769
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,250
Are they going to go or not? I am about to explode.

770
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:00,700
Be quiet!

771
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,140
Guys, please quiet down!

772
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,090
I said be quiet!

773
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:07,260
Move aside.

774
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,500
What is it?

775
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,100
It's Love.

776
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,700
- Is it Love? 
 - It is Love.

777
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,290
Love is here!

778
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:17,870
Hey, Love!

779
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,400
Love, are you okay?

780
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,400
- Love! 
 - Love! When did you wake up?

781
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,830
We waited for you for a long time!

782
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:30,220
Violence, go let your true feelings out.

783
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,590
- Wait a minute! 
 - You can't show your true feelings!

784
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,290
We cannot show her true feelings here! This is her workplace.

785
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:41,280
Guys. There's no better time for her sincerity than now.

786
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,770
How can you love without showing your sincerity?

787
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,040
Let's get upset! I'm going.

788
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:08,530
'Deep within my heart'

789
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:10,620
Did you call me?

790
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:14,490
Oppa Wu Gi, let's not make Eonni uncomfortable and next time let's all...

791
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:17,240
Why would I be uncomfortable?

792
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,700
- Excuse me? 
 - What's wrong with just the two of us going?

793
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,390
I don't mind.

794
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:26,880
I like it this way even more.

795
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,960
Let's go together, Wu Gi.

796
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:39,850
  ♫ Are you paying attention to me? Or is it meaninglfess? ♫ 

797
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:42,240
  ♫ Do our eyes keep meeting? ♫ 

798
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,890
  ♫ Or were you just looking at something behind me? ♫  .

799
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:50,500
  ♫ It's busy inside my head all day long ♫ 

800
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:56,700
  ♫ I'm going to continue to keep it hidden so you won't know how I feel.♫ 

801
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:03,790


802
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:06,220
  ♫ Are you only being nice to me? ♫ 

803
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:09,020
  ♫ Am I the only one who thinks so? ♫ 

804
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:13,720
  ♫ Whether you know it or not, you make my heart flutter ♫ 

805
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:17,320
  ♫ I really want to know how you feel. ♫ 

806
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:21,290
  ♫ What is obvious is that while looking at me today ♫ 

807
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:23,550
  ♫ you're smiling ♫ 

808
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:28,080
  ♫ Although there aren't enough clues, I have my hunch that ♫ 

809
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,470
 I am in front of the fountain right now. 

810
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:31,720
 Do you know where the garden fountain is? 

811
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,990
 I'll be right there. Please wait a little bit. 

812
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:36,270
Today's weather is so nice.

813
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:37,650
This is crazy! This is crazy!

814
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:39,540
This is definitely a green light, right?

815
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,960
Let's even get a kiss today!

816
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,790
 Ms. Kim Yumi! 

817
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:45,520
Wait ... you are going like this?

818
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,180
Why? I put an effort into my appearance.

819
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:50,110
 What? I am saying this because I am worried about you. 

820
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:51,980
  ♫ I'm so curious I'm going crazy ♫ 

821
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:55,490
 Hey guys! Wung became a total idiot! 

822
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:59,360
♫  so that you won't know how I feel ♫
