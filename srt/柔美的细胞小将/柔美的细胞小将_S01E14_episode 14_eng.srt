1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
 Yumi 

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:13,090


3
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,080
 Yumi's Cells 

4
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,120
 Episode 39: Time Machine 

5
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,010
 Yumi has a cell that ignores principles. 

6
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,290
Hey! Why are you only replying now? Did you break your fingers?

7
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,350
Do you want to get in trouble, Gu Wung?

8
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,590
Goodness! Are you all lright?

9
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,780
Guys, you have to throw harder!

10
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,350
- Throw it! 
 - So annoying!

11
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,490
 Even though she threw the most bean bags to the gourd, 

12
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,620
Wung.

13
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,170
Yes?

14
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,660
I have to tell you something.

15
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,620
I think we...

16
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,260
need to take some time from each other.

17
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,570
Oh no. Look at his face.

18
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,730
Seeing his face like that hurts my heart.

19
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,510
But it can't be reversed.

20
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:13,550
He would be so sad to get dumped on a beautiful day like this.

21
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,820
That's why he should've been good to her. You deserve this, Gu Wung.

22
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,210
You're so mean!

23
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,160
How can you be so cruel?

24
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,590
R-Rampage! Rampage, are you all right?

25
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,350
Is he dead?

26
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,270
I've made up my mind.

27
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,120
If he says he'll be good from now on,

28
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,490
no, if he does something even close to it,

29
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,000
I will make all this invalid.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,450
CPR, I need CPR.

31
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,460
Sensitivity, you're the one who always threw the bags at the gourd to make it burst.

32
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,940
I didn't.

33
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,200
I saw it a million times.

34
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,610
I'm sure you saw wrong.

35
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,110
Seriously! You were the one who had the most complaints about Wung!

36
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,610
 Sensitivity is always like that. 

37
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,800
 She changes her decision depending on her mood all the time. 

38
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,590
I won't die, right?

39
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,260
All right.

40
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,130
All right, I got it.

41
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,000
 But whether it's unfortunate or fortunate,  

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,740
 Wung calmly just said "I got it". 

43
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,830
 Let me tell you how out of control Sensitivity is. 

44
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,820
It was so exciting then.

45
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,110
Sensitivity, I know how you feel but this is not okay.

46
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,570
What's not okay?

47
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,800
Don't you think you should be more careful on a day like today?

48
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,700
No one can sleep because the screen is too bright.

49
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,990
Let us sleep.

50
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,480
Aren't you being too much?

51
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,230
It's too bright.

52
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,660
Whatever. I can't sleep.

53
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,850
I'm going to sleep after watching this.

54
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,680
Seriously!

55
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,610
You should think of Yumi, too.

56
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,200
How upset would she be when you play a trick like this today?

57
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,920
Please, let's go to bed early today.

58
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,030
- Sensitivity. 
 - What!

59
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,290
- Are you really going to keep being like this? 
 - Can't I even sing?

60
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,420
Of course not. Do you know what time it is?

61
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:11,350
Don't I have the freedom to express myself? I want to express my feelings right now!

62
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,530
Give me the microphone!

63
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,150
Stop it already! I don't want to hear it! You're a horrible singer! Seriously!

64
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,890
I didn't get to sleep at all.

65
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:38,400
 One good thing is that Sensitivity is nocturnal so she doesn't work in the morning. 

66
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,390
I did the right thing

67
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,760
yesterday, right?

68
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,660
Of course. Yumi, let's get ready to go to work now.

69
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,430
It's nice out today, so it'll be good to wear blue and white.

70
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,230
You should lather up, start from the cheeks, rub on the T-zone and wash off completely. 
    

71
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,730
I got it.

72
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,670
Should we eat cereal or toast for breakfast?

73
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:05,010
Should we just eat both?

74
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,510
I didn't do laundry yesterday and there's no clean underwear.

75
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,710
What? Seriously, that little...

76
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,010
Come on, we have things to do.

77
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,570
- Good morning. 
 - Oh, you're early today.

78
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,460
Yes. Did you have a good weekend?

79
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,670
Yes. I went to Gyeongju over the weekend.

80
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,520
Really? That must've been nice.

81
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,140
It was so nice.

82
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,430
Do you want to see some pictures?

83
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,650
- Sure. 
 - Hold on.

84
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,430
♫  To me who am spending an unexpected day  ♫

85
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,230
 Since Sensitivity might flip out later when she sees this. 

86
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,800
♫  So I can feel your love love love love  ♫

87
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,850
I think it'd be good to get rid of it before Sensitivity wakes up.

88
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:11,400
♫  So I can feel your love love love love  ♫

89
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,130
♫  In a corner of my heart  ♫

90
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,510
♫  I wish someone lives there  ♫

91
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,830
Assistant Manager Yumi, please check this.

92
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,470
Sure. When do you need it by?

93
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,130
Uhh... Probably by 2 o' clock.

94
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,660
All right.

95
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,280
 It's nice that there's no time to think about other things when she's focusing on work. 

96
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,230
Guys, don't think about chatting, just push the millstone.

97
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,520
That's the way for Yumi.

98
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,540
But what if Wung comes by when she's off work?

99
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,900
Wait! Anxiety, you just said that word!

100
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,360
- Oh no! 
 - Oh no! 
    

101
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,710
 For the time being, if you say the word "Wung," you'll go to jail. 

102
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,340
Guys, I heard it!

103
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,270
She definitely said "Wung".

104
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,990
 Arrested 

105
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,990
Look at those guys.

106
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,340
They said "Wung" so recklessly.

107
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,350
 Arrested 

108
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,890
I hope there are no other cells going to jail like me.

109
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,290
- We'll get going then. 
 - See you tomorrow.

110
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,820
- Goodbye. 
 - See you tomorrow.

111
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,130
 After work is the problem. 

112
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,090
What should I do from now on after work?

113
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,900
It's Monday so it's a little weird to call someone to hang out. 
    

114
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:03,120
Let's see... People she can call to hang out even on weekday evenings...

115
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,800
Here is one.

116
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,910
 Go Si Hyeon 

117
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:13,520
 Go Si Hyeon. She lives nearby and she's free, so there's no burden. 

118
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,640
 Why did you call me? Did you miss me? 

119
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,200
 You must have broken up with your boyfriend! 

120
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,020
Forget it.

121
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,710
She'll just make me upset.

122
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,190
It's been a while, should I go for a run in the park?

123
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,760
 Yes, let's do that! If she runs, she'll get tired and will be able to sleep. 

124
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,050
 Then Sensitivity won't have time to whine. 

125
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,170
It's probably still too chilly at night to run.

126
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,940
 Hey, I can feel someone staring at us from the side. 

127
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,760
 - Who? 
 - It's Wung! 

128
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,070
Awesome! If it's really Wung, then I approve!

129
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,520
 Arrested 

130
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,270
Let's see. Hurry and look over!

131
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,090
It's not chilly at night these days.

132
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,620
It's perfect for exercise.

133
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,160
I'm off, too.

134
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,510
Assistant Manager Yu.

135
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,780
It's not easy for someone who was always with a lover

136
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,140
to suddenly hang out by themselves.

137
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,590
You need a lot of research to hang out by yourself.

138
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,470
How do you know?

139
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,730
There is something like that. An empty space...

140
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,080
shows soon enough.

141
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,700
Isn't it fascinating?

142
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,810
The bus is here. Let's go.

143
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,640
What should I do now?

144
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,240
There is nothing to do.

145
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,500
 Yes, Wung. 

146
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,470
 You're home? 

147
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,790
 I either talked with Wung 

148
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:09,070
 or met with him at this time. It was one of the two. 

149
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,790
What did she do before she dated him? Why can't I remember?

150
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,680
Wouldn't it be better if we take the time machine and travel to before she met him?

151
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,220
That's a good idea.

152
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,310
Let's go back to when she wasn't dating and see what she did.

153
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,130
Come out, Time Machine!

154
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,320
 Diary 

155
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,420
The blind date with Wung was last June.

156
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,110
So let's go to May.

157
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,240
 Diary 

158
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,040
 Diary 

159
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,580
May...

160
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,360
Here it is. May 15th.

161
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,130
 I don't know what to do when I get home from work. 

162
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,760
 I'm so bored. 

163
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,720
What?

164
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,960

 ♫   and think about someone.  ♫

170

♫  Although my fading image may seem miserable  ♫

177
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:33,240
 I swear I'll never date anyone ever! I'm changing my last name if I ever date again. 

178
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,730
What?

179
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:41,000
 I don't care! I'll never date, ever. 

180
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,100
 I won't date again! 

181

♫  We can smile like this while looking at each other  ♫

182
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,020
Why is she in such a bad shape?

183
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,480
This is right after the breakup.

No, no. This isn't right.

193
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,210
Let's go to a later time after the breakup.

194
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:58,910
 After a quick run, I took a shower and finished the book I was reading on my way back. 

195
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,170
 This is after midnight and I'm so lonely right now. 

196
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:09,290
 When you're alone, whatever you do, you're all a-lone 

197
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,670
You were doing so well. What happened?

198
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,090
What do you mean, "lonely"?

199
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:24,100
♫  Which still remain and are in the distant memories  ♫

200
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,810
 When I read this diary in the future, I'm sure someone will be by my side, right? 

201
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,160
 Without a doubt. 

202
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,080
What? That stings.

203
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,760
 Imagining myself spending exciting days with someone I love 

204
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,840
 makes me feel better. 

205
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,080
I'm sorry I let you down.

206
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,850
 I guess I won't be going through my old diary 

207
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,760
 if I have someone by my side. 

208
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,510
Wow, that just hit the nail on the head.

209
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,330
This won't do. It's making me more depressed.

210
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,320
 This is all because of Love. 

211
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,090
Gosh, I'm out of breath.

212
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,370
You can't even run this far, Kim Yumi?

213
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,240
 She should have maintained her life even while dating,  
[Yumi Everyday life 00% Romance 00%

214
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,410
 but she put too much emphasis on romance 

215
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,380
 that it's hard for her to go back to her everyday life.
   

216
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,490
So why did you do it again

217
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,690
when you always regret it every time?

218
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,000
You ended up coming out.

219
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,390
Oh, yes.

220
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:16,240
Isn't the night air nice? It's perfect for exercise.

221
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,130
You're right.

222
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:27,260
You can't get back to your original pace in one shot.

223
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,970
I once took a long break before starting to run again.

224
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:41,100
I gradually increased my pace as if starting all over, and it eventually worked.

225
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:47,680
I'm sure you'd be able to get to your original pace if you bring it up little by little.

226
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,830
Sure.

227
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,730
Take your time.

228
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,780
How did you resist the urge to call?

229
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,730
I ran.

230
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,370
If you still wanted to call?

231
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,750
I ran all night.

232
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,120
You're tough.

233
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,290
Not really.

234
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,530
Didn't I tell you?

235
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,950
About the ring that I threw away.

236
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,400
Sorry?

 Daehan Noodles 

238
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,710
I was leaving, then suddenly I regretted it.

239
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,250
So I went back to look for it.

240
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,060
But the trashcan was empty.

241
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,310
I couldn't do it all at once.

242
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,680
You get better slowly, little by little.

243
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:10,570
If it's hard for you to hang out by yourself, should I join you?

244
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,210
- Sorry? 
 - Do you want to run together?

 Episode 40: Male Lead 

247
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:57,410
 We were tired from the long journey. 

248
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:02,150
 The fuel ran out, and we were exhausted trying to sort out all kinds of incidents. 

249
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,960
I told you to give up that fashion. It's all your fault.

250
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,460
Speak for yourself, Moody.

251
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,120
What?

252
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,010
- I won't let that go! 
  - We couldn't ignore the internal conflict. 

253
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,100
- What did you say? 
 - Let go!

254
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,470
Hey, if you're going to fight, do it somewhere else.

255
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,370
Let go!

256
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,350
I'm so sick of them fighting.

257
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,450
I said let go!

258
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,290
 In the end, we were exhausted and decided to turn back to the headquarters. 

259
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,490
We are returning so suddenly. Would it be all right?

260
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,910
Let's contact the headquarters.

261

This is Yumi. This is Yumi.

262
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,650
Reply,  Headquarters.

263
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,270
We'd like to return.

264
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,440
Is it not working?

265
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,230
 This is headquarters. Can you hear me? 

266
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,890
We hear you. This is Yumi.

No, no. Let's hurry.

Why?

276
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,920
Mom's waiting.

Hurry and eat. It'll only be good now.

How do I eat all this? It's too much.

Eat it and eat some more.

00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,060
Your food is the best.

323
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,810
Come more often.

324
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,740
Is it good?

325
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,040
Try the ribs, Yumi. The ribs.

326
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,370
I'm full.

327
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,070
I'm stuffed.

328
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,140
Let's eat some watermelon, Yumi.

329
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,890
Watermelon.

330
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,910
Mom, I'm really full.

331
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,860
This is so sweet. Eat.

332
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,690
I have no room for this.

333
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:05,490
Hey, no! Her stomach is totally full. We can't take anymore!

334
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,170
What? I want to eat more.

335
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:11,080
The stomach will explode!

336
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,110
Yumi, don't worry and eat.

337
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,950
The stomach will explode.

338
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,640
I already talked with the stomach cell.

339
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,350
What?

340
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,350
This is so sweet!

341
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:37,300
Hey, Reason. I knew this would happen, so I made partitions in the stomach already.

342
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,410
Meal and dessert.

343
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:43,290
There's a separate space for the dessert, so don't worry, man.

344
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,810
 Meal (C:) - Out of 50yb, 2yb available. Dessert (D:) - Out of 50 yb, 48yb available. 

345
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:53,390
Last course, vitamins.

346
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,020
It's gummy.

347
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,150
You have a hard time swallowing pills, so I got these.

348
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,300
I'm the best, right?

349
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,570
I knew you're the best.

350
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:11,700
♫  Holiday where I wore out my soles from being on a stomping path  ♫

351
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,080
My Yumi's favorite.

352
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,570
Dad, I'm full. I really can't eat anymore.

353
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,950
It's the twisted doughnut that you like.

354
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,830
Twisted doughnut?

355
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,450
Twisted doughnut from the market in town.

356
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,370
She ate it so much when she was little.

357
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,600
Wow, it's twisted doughnut!

358
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,160
Can you work something out for Dad's sake?

359
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,730
The stomach might really burst.

360
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,740
Oh, Reason, don't worry. Don't worry, man.

361
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,430
I divided the dessert part in two just in case, too.

362
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,660
Fruit and bread, baby.

363
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,330
You're really thorough.

364
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:01,580
Honey, she just got finished eating. For whom ... Oh, my.

365
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,960
There is a separate stomach for bread, Honey.

366
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:11,350
There you go. A separate stomach for the meal and bread.

367
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,240
She's my daughter.

368
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,860
Dad, I have another stomach.

369
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,420
I know. I have one, too.

370
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,550
Alcohol stomach.

371
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,410
You all understand, right? You know?

372
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:29,530
When you go home, dividing the stomach into partitions

373
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,600
is the basic of the basic.

374
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Eat, eat. Eat a lot. Gobble gobble, okay?

375
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,180
- Is it good? 
 - Yes.

376
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,280
You eat so well.

377
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,940
It's yummy, right?

378
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,590
It's so, so good!

379
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,490
It's really good 'cause it's warm.

380
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,550
Try it.

381
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,320
Will she be okay?

382
00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:01,230
Don't worry too much, Reason. We can overdo it here.

383
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,930
We got into a fight while playing word chain.

384
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,380
 This is Yumi's starting point, 

385
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:15,730
 Yumi's real home that resets her tired heart. 

386
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,270
It's done.

387
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,370
Fail.

388
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,280
Just as expected.

389
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,030
 On vacation 

390
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:33,510
 Ansan Station 

391
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,450
Can you carry it all?

392
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,710
I'll be fine. I'll get going.

393
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,190
Wait.

394
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,370
Hold on.

395
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,030
You almost forgot this.

396
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,310
Right, my twisted doughnut.

397
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,410
Eat it on the way. It won't be good cold.

398
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,790
All right.

399
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,000
- Call when you get home. 
 - Yes, Dad.

400
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,830
Yumi, next time, come with him.

401
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,470
- Him? 
 - Wung or Gung, you said you had someone.

402
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:19,000
Bring him. Mom's curious.

403
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,570
I'll get going.

404
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,180
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

405
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,670
I'll come back.

406
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,550
Bye.

407
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,070
 Being alone after having so much fun 

408
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,960
makes you feel even more lonely.

409
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,310
I'm so lonely.

410
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,070
Maybe we should've stayed at home longer.

411
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,840
Can you bring me the microphone?

412
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,530
No.

413
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,760
I wonder what Wung's doing now.

414
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,360
Do you want to get arrested again?

415
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,270
Let them arrest me.

416
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,860
I wonder what Wung's doing.

417
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,140
 Can we call Wung? 

418
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,100
 Stop it. 

419
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,800
 Can't we call Wung? 

420
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,640
 Why? What's the point of calling? 

421
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,970
 Because I miss him. 

422
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,230
I miss him.

423
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,220
 Yumi 

424
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:48,090
 Wung 

425
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,290
Hello?

426
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,920
Yes, Louis. What's up?

427
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,690
So?

428
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,000
What did they say?

429
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,560
 Wung 

430
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,730
 I told him we should take some time to think 

431
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,410
 but I don't want to be alone again. 

432
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:08,620
 Am I afraid that Wung might leave me? 

433
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:13,520
 Or am I just afraid to be alone again? 

434
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,390
 That night, 

435
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,590
 I dreamed the weird dream 

436
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,620
 that I had a few years ago. 

437
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,100
Huh?

438
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:50,040
I've been here before.

439
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:12,240
Right, I was definitely here before.

440
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:25,750
 It was a dream of me wandering around 

441
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,470
 a village where dwarf fairies seemed to live. 

442
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,360
What is this?

443
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,400
Is it a millstone?

444
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,550
Oh, I remember this place, too.

445
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,890
There was a bulletin board around that corner.

446
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,310
There it is.

447
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,840
 I was definitely here a few years ago. 

448
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,270
 On the day I felt the breakup with my ex, 

449
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:11,280
 I remember coming here and putting up a note with my wish. 

450
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,340
 With Wung 

451
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,840
Are you going to stick that note?

452
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,690
Are you sticking that?

453
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,620
Who are you?

454
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,040
I'm the manager of that bulletin board.

455
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,790
If you put up a weird memo, I have to clean it up.

456
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,820
A weird one?

457
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:56,320
It's not weird. I just wrote my wish.

458
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,270
You want it to be a happy ending with Wung?

459
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,190
Yes. I still do.

460
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,610
 I hope it's a happy ending with Wung. 

461
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,170
I thought...

462
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,720
Wung was the male lead of my life.

463
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,320
I'm sorry but Wung isn't the male lead.

464
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,770
What?

465
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,760
Then who's the male lead?

466
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,460
There is no separate male lead.

467
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,350
There is only one lead here.

468
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:46,920
 Episode 41: Wung's Card 

469
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,510
Hey.

470
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,850
Hey, tell me in detail.

471
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:15,230
What did they say exactly?

472
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,650
 Everybody has their own cards. 

473
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,400
♫  We know the hidden things inside  ♫

474
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,700
 I want to be alone. 

475
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,020
 Set me up on a blind date. 

476
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,520
How about this one?

477
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,440
 Leave me alone. 

478
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,660
 I'm so sick of this. 

479
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,780
Ba Bi. 
  Burning Friday. 

480
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,540
I'm sorry. 
  Hardship 

481
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,060
I'll modify it then send it right to you.

482
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,300
 You can't really see it since it's the card in your mind. 

483
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,820
♫  I feel I am changing for us  ♫

484
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:24,600
♫  Now even the small things are all significant  ♫

485
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,270
 Yumi, are you doing well? 

486
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:40,940
 Yes, I'm doing well. How about you? 

487
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,120
 I'm doing well. 

488
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,180
 Are you free tomorrow? 

489
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,720
 I'll go near your house. 

490
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,300
 Sure. What time? 

491
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,050
 How about 2? 

492
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,700
 Sounds good. 

493
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,460
 I'll meet you in front of Bonjour Fountain. 

494
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,940
 Fine. 

495
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,060
 See you tomorrow. 

496
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,940
 Yes, see you tomorrow. 

497
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:40,820
 This is the card I'll use tomorrow when I meet Wung.  
    

498
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,410
Assistant Manager Kim, please look over this revised version.

499
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,500
Sure.

500
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,140
What is that?

501
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,480
It's nothing.

502
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:58,050
 I don't show people at work the cards related to my personal life. 

503
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,750
Huh?

504
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,280
Your boyfriend's picture isn't there. Did you take it off?

505
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,580
What? Did you break up?

506
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,500
No.

507
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,060
 There are people like Han Byeol who are nosey. 

508
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,160
♫  Will we be somewhere in that scene?  ♫

509
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,850
♫  You and I.  ♫

510
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,700
♫  Nightfallin'  ♫

511
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,340
♫  At the end of the sun setting  ♫

512
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,350
Oppa Wu Gi!

513
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:28,680
 There are people who show their card like Ruby. 

514
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,240
Oppa, Oppa!

515
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,540
 Sending signals that I like you. 

516
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,970
 And there are people like Wu Gi who never show their card. 

517
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,340
♫  We are walking to the same beat  ♫

518
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,750
Oppa.

519
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:48,900
I got some tickets to a concert. Come with me.

520
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,380
Why would I?

521
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,040
Come with me.

522
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,380
Ruby wants to go with you.

523
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,880
Assistant Manager Choi, I'll be in the office.

524
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,820
- I'll come with— 
 - No.

525
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,760
♫  You and I  ♫

526
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,780
♫  are headed toward the same place  ♫

527
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,900
Please? Let's go.

528
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:11,120
It's Ruby's birthday next week. Consider it my birthday present and come with me.

529
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,130
I really really want to see it.

530
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,420
Hold on.

531
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,730
Will you come with me?

532
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,780
- Ruby. 
 - Yes?

533
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:27,580
If I'm being honest, what I think of you.

534
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,890
 Wu Gi shows his card sometimes.  
    

535
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:42,260
I'm sorry but this is how I feel.

536
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,550
 From the day Wu Gi took out his card, 

537
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:00,320
 Ruby exchanged the card she had on her forehead. 

538
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,580
 Tell others of the sadness that happened to Ruby. 

539
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,820
Two iced lattes and...

540
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,300
How about you, Ruby?

541
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,880
Ruby, what are you getting?

542
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,390
Whatever.

543
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,940
What's whatever? Then I'll get three iced lattes.

544
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,750
Whatever.

545
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,190
I'll take three iced lattes.

546
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,900
Sure.

547
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:25,350
Ruby, is there something wrong?

548
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,410
Does it show?

549
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,260
I was trying really hard to look normal.

550
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:38,140
Ruby, it really shows a lot.

551
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,180
That's interesting.

552
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,960
You're so quick, Eonni.

553
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:50,810
Eonni, where do you think my other half is?

554
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,160
What?

555
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,120
Will he even show up?

556
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,660
Just a second.

557
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,780
- Wu Gi. 
 - Seonbae.

558
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,180
- Did you eat lunch? 
 - Yes.

559
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:17,940
By the way, did you say something to Ruby?

560
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,140
I told her how I feel.

561
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:24,520
I thought it would be rude to keep ignoring it.

562
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,480
I see.

563
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,020
Yes.

564
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,460
I'm off.

565
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:48,290
Wait... Then...

566
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:51,080
 Ba Bi said he has someone that he's interested at work 

567
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,730
 and there is a letter U in her name. 

568
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,280
 Ruby 

569
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,830
- Assistant Manager Yu. 
 - Yes?

570
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:11,340
Is your research going well?

571
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,820
Research? What research?

572
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,340
- Research of hanging out by yourself. 
 - Oh.

573
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,080
Of course. It's going well.

574
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,140
Really?

575
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,450
Why do you seem to be disappointed?

576
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:29,060
If I'm good at hanging out by myself, shouldn't I get complimented?

577
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:34,150
Then you're not planning on seeing anyone for a while?

578
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:35,700
No.

579
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,850
If there is someone, I want to hang out together.

580
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:40,250
Oh, really?

581
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,810
Yes.

582
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:44,680
Then by chance...

583
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,140
 Do you want to go on a blind date? 

584
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,890
- Blin— 
 - Of course, I won't meet someone by a blind date.

585
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:57,480
I guess you don't really like blind dates.

586
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,450
No, I don't really like this sort of thing.

587
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,050
I see.

588
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,700
Should we start the meeting?

589
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,560
Yes.

590
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,780
 Assistant Manager Ba Bi isn't the type to show his cards either. 

591
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,260
This is today's agenda.

592
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:20,020
We will modify it a little more, but you can look at this for now.

593
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,290
 I wonder who that is on that card. 

594
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,580
 It's probably Ruby. 

595
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:48,560
 But guessing other people's cards doesn't mean much. 

596
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:53,240
 I have my breakup card out but 

597
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,260
 I'm hiding another one. 

598
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,700
 Breakup 

599
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,080
 A random card that I can change my decision depending on the situation.  
    

600
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:11,450
 I will bring this card along when I meet Wung tomorrow. 

601
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,510
 It's Wung! 

602
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:41,900
 It's Wung! 

603
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,070
 Wung! 

604
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,760
 Wow, Wung has a ponytail! 

605
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,400
 Did he not wash his hair? 

606
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,870
Wung.

607
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,480
You're here.

608
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:10,850
You tied your hair up.

609
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,290
It's too hot.

610
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:17,110
It suddenly got so hot.

611
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:20,920
You're right. It looks cool.

612
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,230
Really?

613
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:29,160
Should we get coffee from there?

614
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,810
Sure.

615
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,690
Let's go.

616
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:40,720
 He kind of looks down. 

617
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,630
Would you like some cake too?

618
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:57,120
No, I'm fine.

619
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,840
It's really hot, isn't it?

620
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,380
Right, it is.

621
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:26,760
How have you been?

622
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,330
Me?

623
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:34,880
I recently signed a huge outsourcing contract.

624
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,130
Really?

625
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:40,860
Congrats! Congrats!

626
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,590
An unexpected opportunity suddenly came.

627
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:46,500
I was surprised too.

628
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,470
I didn't even expect it.

629
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:52,820
That's great. Seriously, congratulations.

630
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,490
Thanks.

631
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:57,590
Aside from the money, I think it's a good opportunity.

632
00:49:57,590 --> 00:50:01,050
I'm glad things worked out well.

633
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:03,970
You might become big.

634
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:07,120
I've just been revived.

635
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,140
I'm sure you'll get big.

636
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,270
I hope so.

637
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:15,430
What about you?

638
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:19,100
- Me? 
 - Have you adjusted in the marketing department?

639
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:23,740
Well...

640
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:27,240
 Assistant Manager Han Byeol is so annoying 

641
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,120
 Wung, I'm annoyed by Assistant Manager Han Byeol.  

642
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,950
I'm managing.

643
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:37,080
Seeing you say that, I guess you're doing pretty well.

644
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,400
Not well.

645
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:46,400
I get compliments from the manager from time to time.

646
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,440
Quite often lately.

647
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,480
That's a relief.

648
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,510
I was worried.

649
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:57,260
I'm still at the beginning of work.

650
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:01,270
At any rate, writing is fun.

651
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:03,420
You'll do great.

652
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:07,170
I hope so.

653
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,870
Yumi.

654
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:29,300
  Oh my gosh! He called out  her name!  

655
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,350
  Is he finally getting to the point?  

656
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:34,290
  Someone go get Love cell!.  

657
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:40,660
Remember what we talked about last time?

658
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,280
Yes.

659
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,300
Wung took out his card.

660
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,110
Oh goodness. What card is it?

661
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:59,590
- I'm nervous. I'm so nervous. 
 - What do we do?

662
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,540
Hey, take out our card too!

663
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,060
You have the breakup card!

664
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:06,820
Yumi is innocent! Yumi, you can do it!

665
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:18,060
Love, did you bring the breakup card?

666
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,650
I did. It's right here.

667
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:23,640
  Breakup    

668
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,570
I don't think you should postpone it again this time.

669
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:30,430
- This time, we have to decide on a conclusion, Love 
 - Right.

670
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,890
 Breakup 

671
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,450
Don't worry.

672
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:38,810
To be honest, I brought along another card with me.

673
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:43,190
 Breakup 
 Random 

674
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:46,110
If Wung's card is to be friends, we will.

675
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:50,630
And if he doesn't want to break up, we won't.

676
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:53,530
That's my decision.

677
00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:01,090
Back when ... we used to live together,

678
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:05,790
I remember it being my birthday.

679
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,750
You brought up marriage.

680
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,370
I did.

681
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:15,250
Back then...

682
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,910
For the first time back then

683
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:26,470
I thought that you and I might be different.

684
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,150
Even though that was obvious.

685
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,730
Yumi.

686
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:50,050
I thought about it a lot

687
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:57,620
and I think we should end it here.

688
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,260
 Breakup - end the relationship 

689
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:15,560
 Breakup - break up 
 Random - leave the decision to the moment 

690
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,210
This isn't it. This is not it.

691
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:19,990
Love, what are you doing?

692
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,930
- You have the breakup card. 
 - What?

693
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,640
Hurry up and throw the breakup card!

694
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,550
Hurry up! Throw the breakup card! 
 Throw it.

695
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:34,950
Why are you hesitating? You have to throw it.

696
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:37,820
That's right! Pathetic! 
 What!

697
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,510
Me?

698
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:45,400
Yes, Pathetic! Come help me quick!

699
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,070
Don't tell me you want to use the clinging card?

700
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:51,100
I do. Let's try clinging onto him.

701
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:54,010
Please, Pathetic! Just this once!

702
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,640
Wung.

703
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,740
What?

704
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,310
I...

705
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:18,140
Wung, I don't want to break up. Do we have to break up?

706
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,800
I said that because I was so angry then.

707
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,850
Let's think about it one more time.

708
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:28,780
You can't!

709
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:31,990
Who said you can cling on to him? Stop being pathetic!

710
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:33,880
Stop saying nonsense!

711
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,680
I, Pride cell, am still alive! What do you think you're doing?

712
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:42,860
What's with you, Love? Are you feeling weak again?

713
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:46,700
Do you not care what happens to Yumi's pride?

714
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,350
Pride, I...

715
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:52,930
You traitor! You don't deserve to be the prime cell!

716
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:57,280
Hand over the cards to me!

717
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,180
Didn't you hear me? Hand over the cards!

718
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:05,650
 Breakup - break up 
 Random - leave the decision to the moment 

719
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:25,040

I feel the same.
