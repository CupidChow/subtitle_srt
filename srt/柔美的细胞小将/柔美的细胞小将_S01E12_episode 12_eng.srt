1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,710
 Yumi, a TVING Original Series 

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,980


3
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,090
 Yumi's Cells 

4
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,120
 Episode 33 : Excuse 

5
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,890
It's yummy. You really made the seaweed soup well.

6
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,910
- Wung. 
 - Yes?

7
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,720
Should we ... get married?

8
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,270
Do you want to marry me?

9
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,930
 What are you doing? She's asking if you want to get married. 

10
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,100
 Are you listening to me? 

11
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,250
Love, wake up!

12
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,820
- What is it? 
 - Yumi is asking right now if he has the desire to get married.

13
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,720
Desire to get married?

14
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,500
Yes, desire to get married.

15
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,510
He was eating. In the middle of eating?

16
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,180
Whatever he was doing, she's asking now. Does he have the desire to get married?

17
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,250
That's in the ocean.

18
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,420
So he doesn't have it right now?

19
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,910
Huh?

20
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,360
Then he should tell her he doesn't have the desire to get married.

21
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,110
Wait! Wait up, Reason!

22
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,520
Huh?

23
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,830
Hold on for a sec. Why are you talking like it's about some stranger?

24
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,660
What? You said he doesn't have the desire to get married.

25
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,260
Right, he didn't really have it originally. But...

26
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,480
Tada!

27
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,250
Wung, here.

28
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,060
It's hot. Slow down.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,960
It's so good!

30
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,010
What?

31
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,330
It's sooo good! It's a marvelous combination, a perfect choice.

32
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,410
- Wung, do you want more? 
 - No, you go ahead.

33
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,610
I don't need it.

34
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,020
Why not? Your razor is broken.

35
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,210
I won't shave, then.

36
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,420
You're growing your beard again?

37
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,290
I can shave you.

38
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,300
With some shaving cream.

39
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,220
Like this. What if I do it for you?

40
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,680
Handsome Guy.

41
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,370
Let's hurry home.

42
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,170
-  Living with Yumi...  
 - A little more that way.

43
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,790
 is nothing special 

44
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,000
 but when he does something with Yumi 

45
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,250
 it just makes him so happy. 

46
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,470
 So when I saw it the last time, it was stuck in the ocean, 

47
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,170
 but maybe now... 

48
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,860
 Reason. Reason, can you hear me? 

49
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,150
What? Yes, I hear you. Did you find the desire to get married?

50
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,920
 Yes, the box came up. 

51
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,170
- That's a relief. 
 - That's good.

52
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,760
Really? Wow. Then can we answer her now? 
  

53
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,140
Yes, I think he can say 'of course' to Yumi's question.

54
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,070
Okay! Then let's answer her quickly.

55
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,970
What do you think?

56
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,160
- Of— 
 -  Hold on! 

57
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,970
Hey.

58
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,690
Where are you going with that?

59
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,700
What? He's going to get married to Yumi... Sir...

60
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,810
With whose permission?

61
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,320
Can't he marry Yumi... sir?

62
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,510
Did you ever think of the worst-case scenario?

63
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,100
The worst-case scenario after getting married?

64
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,130
Fights, divorce, and things like that?

65
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,800
 Not those, punk. 

66
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,230
Wung, I'm so cold.

67
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,200
You're cold?

68
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,380
Then turn up the heater.

69
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,210
Heater?

70
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,300
Yumi!

71
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,050
Yumi!

72
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,790
Are you all right?

73
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,530
Wung...

74
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,880
I'm so cold.

75
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,700
I want to sleep on a bed.

76
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:20,360
 If something goes wrong, he might have to be with Yumi during the worst-case scenario of his life. 

77
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,320
Don't you know that if something goes wrong he could be on the verge of losing his office?

78
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,970
Well... that is ...

79
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,120
And he's still going to get married?

80
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,700
 Love, what should we say? 

81
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,560
Love? Huh? Love!

82
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,100
Oh well.

83
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,660
Wung likes living with Yumi.

84
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,170
But

85
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,020
 he's financially unstable right now,  

86
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,840
 so it'd be nice to think about it when he's more stable. 

87
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,660
We should summarize it like this and answer her, right?

88
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,470
 He has to answer her within five seconds. 

89
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,430
 Yumi's facial expression is changing. 

90
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,080
What?

91
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,700
 Her expression is getting really bad now. 

92
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,870
No, no!

93
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,240
He's already answering late,

94
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,340
and if the answer is long, it'd be more awkward.

95
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,790
Let's get rid of all the unnecessary things.

96
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,940
 When I get more stable. 

97
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,970
 Done! Wung, answer ' When I get more stable'. 

98
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,800
I get it.

99
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,220
Huh?

100
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,410
I didn't say anything yet.

101
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,630
I just wondered what your thoughts were about it.

102
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,200
You don't really have to think that hard.

103
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,390
- I mean— 
 - Just a sec.

104
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,480
Yes, Mom.

105
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,650
Yes, I'm home.

106
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,290
Oh, the package didn't arrive?

107
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,960
I got a text saying it arrived.

108
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,540
 Situation over. Wung rejected Yumi's proposal. 

109
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,310
What? He was going to answer.

110
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,270
 It's too late. 

111
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,750
Why? He can't answer anymore?

112
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,550
 It's too late. From now, anything he says will be an excuse. 

113
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,530
- It was my mom. She didn't get the package I sent her. 
 - I see...

114
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,040
You weren't eating? You should.

115
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,770
- But Yumi— 
 - Wait.

116
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,940
Let's stop talking about it. Forget it.

117
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,800
- I mean— 
 - I mean it.

118
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,210
You don't have to answer me, Wung. I don't want you to be burdened. Really.

119
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,990
Right, let's blow the candles.

120
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,560
Gosh.

121
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,780
 Happy birthday, Wung. 

122
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,340
Then you'll work all night then come back in the morning?

123
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,930
Yes, there is a test early in the morning, so I don't think I can come back tonight.

124
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,660
I'll be back tomorrow night.

125
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,200
I see.

126
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,960
Oh, there comes the bus.

127
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,660
Seaweed soup was really good. So was the cake.

128
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,880
The sweater looks good on you.

129
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,950
I like this, too.

130
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,920
Hurry and get on.

131
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,870
Good luck on your first day.

132
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:33,320
 Yumi doesn't look too happy. Can't he get off and answer her now? 

133
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,300
 It's too late. 

134
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,890
How about texting her the answer?

135
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,490
 It's too late. 

136
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:42,470
How is it like that? Then when can he answer her so it won't be an excuse?

137
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,810
 The bus has gone. 

138
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,630
 The next chance will be when Wung is really financially stable. 

139
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:08,310
♫  takes me back to the time  ♫

140
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,990
Goodnight.

141
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,980
I thought it was going to be a good one.

142
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,250
♫  which shined most beautifully  ♫

143
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,800
Sensitivity, what are you doing?

144
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,220
I feel weird, Reason.

145
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,650
How are you feeling?

146
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,370
I feel...

147
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,970
I'm so thankful to Wung, but I'm really upset.

148
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,780
I like Wung, but I hate him.

149
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,800
That's why I told you not to ask about marriage.

150
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,010
Then should she just keep waiting? Indefinitely?

151
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,070
Until she is 35 or 40?

152
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,290
You're exaggerating.

153
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,120
It won't take that much time.

154
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,210
I want to get married during spring, the 33rd one.

155
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,210
I'm not asking for a lot.

156
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,390
I'm not asking him to buy me a house.

157
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,790
I don't care if he doesn't have money.

158
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,430
I simply want to live with him forever.

159
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,520
But he rejected me!

160
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,350
He didn't reject us. We just didn't hear his answer.

161
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,690
Him not answering is rejecting, idiot!

162
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,480
He was going to answer but we stopped him!

163
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,230
If it takes five minutes to answer, it means you're rejected!

164
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,240
That's being rejected!

165
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,740
Welcome.

166
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,270
Hello.

167
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,030
I'd like a cup of cappuccino please.

168
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,340
You're alone today.

169
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,490
My boyfriend is working late today.

170
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,050
I see.

171
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:27,030
Ba Bi, I just got here.

172
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,910
Ah, is that so?

173
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,060
I got it.

174
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,890
I'll wait. Take your time.

175
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,470
Yes.

176
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,670
She just said Ba Bi, right? Could it be that Yu Ba Bi?

177
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,550
I'm sure it's someone different.

178
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,730
Ba Bi isn't a common name.

179
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,130
And in this neighborhood. Could that be his girlfriend?

180
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,030
Maybe she is.

181
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,790
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

182
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,490
Yes, Su Jin.

183
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,970
No, I'm in Ilsan, near Ba Bi's place.

184
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,470
No, I'm still seeing Ba Bi.

185
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,890
I didn't have time.

186
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:28,560
I'm so busy it's not easy to break up.

187
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,460
No, I'm going to tell him today. Yes.

188
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,700
What is she saying?

189
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,270
Breaking up? Here? Now?

190
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,410
Sensitivity, Yu Ba Bi must be getting dumped today.

191
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,820
How do you know if it's Yu Ba Bi or Kim Ba Bi or Park Ba Bi?

192
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,860
It is Yu Ba Bi!

193
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,570
Wow, she really was Yu Ba Bi's girlfriend.

194
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,440
Is he coming to get dumped right now?

195
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,670
Look at him with his big smile not knowing he's getting dumped in five minutes!

196
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,570
He's like Yumi an hour ago.

197
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,210
- Ja Yeong, you're early. 
 - Yes.

198
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,960
Traffic wasn't bad.

199
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,360
Did you order something?

200
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,350
No, not yet.

201
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,400
- What do you want? 
 - Umm, Ba Bi.

202
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,690
- Yes? 
 - Sit for a sec.

203
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,060
I have something to say.

204
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,710
What is it?

205
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,080
Don't sit, stupid!

206
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,360
Don't ask!

207
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,180
Can't you tell by your girlfriend's expression?

208
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,740
Do you want to be like Yumi? Why are you so dense?

209
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,290
Sensitivity, calm down. It's none of our business—

210
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,070
Yu Ba Bi! If you don't want to get rejected, get up.

211
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,140
If you avoid this moment, she might change her mind!

212
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:27,300
I was going to take my time telling you, but I don't think it's right.

213
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,290
Is it something bad?

214
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,810
Yes.

215
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,000
What is it?

216
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,950
I think...

217
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,340
we should stop seeing each other.

218
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,430
Let's break up.

219
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,790
Ba Bi, you also know we were already over.

220
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,890
Wow, so bluntly. She's tough.

221
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,890
Look at that. Yu Ba Bi, what did I tell you? My gosh!

222
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,730
There is a male Yumi.

223
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,550
Clueless Yumi Season 2.

224
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,570
Today must be the day.

225
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:27,240
You get rejected, I get rejected. How great.

226
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,030
Have you gone mad?

227
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,290
You're scaring me.

228
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,610
Sorry. I'll get going.

229
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,570
I'm really going.

230
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,350
Eonni, Ruby is so sad!

231
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,700
I'm going to stop by every day.

232
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,110
Let's get lunch together later.

233
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,990
All right, I'll come later.

234
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,730
Kim Yumi, you can do it. Hold your head up.

235
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,790
Eonni, fighting!

236
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,440
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

237
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,340
Fighting!

238
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,090
Fighting!

239
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,280
Bye, Eonni.

240
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,280
Go ahead.

241
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,410
 Marketing Department 

242
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,850
 Kim Yumi - Marketing Department 

243
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,550
 Daehan Noodles
 Kim Yumi 
 Marketing Department 

244
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,330
That's a cool keyboard.

245
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,200
That's not an ordinary keyboard.

246
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,670
It's a gift from my boyfriend.

247
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,530
To celebrate the first day at marketing department.

248
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,390
Really? No wonder.

249
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,360
When the manager comes, he'll probably introduce you to everyone.

250
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,350
Yes, right.

251
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,430
And...

252
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,140
You have the ring, right?

253
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,090
Pardon?

254
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,730
I left my ring at the cafe yesterday so I went back.

255
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:06,610
And they told me that their regular who works with me took it to give it to me.

256
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,080
The only regular who works with me

257
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,390
is you.

258
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,880
Yes...

259
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,750
I happened to see it somehow when I stopped by.

260
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,660
It was really a coincidence.

261
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,450
And it looked so expensive.

262
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:35,550
So I was contemplating how to give this back to you.

263
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,800
Here you go.

264
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,170
Thank you.

265
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:51,200
She said she was so busy that it'd be good for me if we break up.

266
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,590
Breaking up for my sake. It's a strange excuse.

267
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,540
What should I do with this?

268
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,650
Pardon?

269
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:09,270
What would you do with this?

270
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,310
I'm not sure...

271
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,980
Good morning.

272
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,880
  Episode 34 
 An awkward drinking gathering 

273
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,680
Day one from today.

274
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,490
Right?

275
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,340
- Sorry? 
 - This is your first day at the marketing department.

276
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,040
Yes, that's right.

277
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,990
You know I've been looking forward to having you here?

278
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,480
Me?

279
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,960
Assistant Manager Ba Bi's been complimenting you so much that I was very curious.

280
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,920
Nice to meet you. I'm Assistant Manager Kang Han Byeol of the marketing department.

281
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,440
Let's get along well.

282
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,510
Sure.

283
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,910
Nice to meet you.

284
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,890
And my seat is way diagonally over there.

285
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:46,170
If you have a question, ask me anything, any time.

286
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,300
I'll do that, thank you.

287
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,040
But...

288
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,790
I don't have any questions right now.

289
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,290
Oh.

290
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,810
Well...

291
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,920
Were you always close with Ba Bi?

292
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:23,270
We're not close. We just live in the same neighborhood.

293
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:27,550
Oh, so you're commuting from Ilsan, too?

294
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,810
Hmm? It's still hard to get close even if you live in the same neighborhood.

295
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:35,270
I guess you've known each other from before then.

296
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,290
Why is he asking in such detail?

297
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,840
I don't like him from the start. Should I say something?

298
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,510
Woah, woah. It's the first day. Let's not ruin our first impression.

299
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,850
We just ran into each other a few times while working out.

300
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,510
There is a big park in the neighborhood.

301
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,760
Oh, I know! That place is famous.

302
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:06,130
I heard a lot that while you are working out, you can catch someone's eye.

303
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,190
- Sorry? 
 - Oh, Miss Bon Hui!

304
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:12,430
Miss Bon Hui, say hello to Assistant Manager Yumi.

305
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,140
This is Lee Bon Hui.

306
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,480
And this is Kim Yumi who's been strongly recommended by Ba Bi.

307
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,160
Oh, hello.

308
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,950
She lives in the same neighborhood as Ba Bi.

309
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,050
Oh, really?

310
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,840
They work out together at the park.

311
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,050
- Oh! 
 - Uh, Assistant Manager Han Byeol.

312
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:32,660
Everyone come say hello to our new addition, Assistant Manager Yumi.

313
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,360
Come over here.

314
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,220
She is here with a strong recommendation from Ba Bi—

315
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,000
- Assistant Manager Han Byeol. 
 - Yes.

316
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,680
I will introduce myself.

317
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,540
Hello, I'm Assistant Manager Kim Yumi. I transferred from the accounting department.

318
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,050
Nice to meet you.

319
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,340
Nice to meet you.

320
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:03,560
In addition, she came here with a strong recommendation from Ba Bi.

321
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,490
Welcome.

322
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:12,950
Seriously, what's wrong with him? Is he determined to make some rumors or what?

323
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,120
To be honest,

324
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,650
I think there's something going on between Ba Bi and Yumi.

325
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,850
It's a perfect situation to misunderstand that.

326
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,770
You guys, have to clarify it.

327
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,520
Why clarify?

328
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,990
The amulet will solve it.

329
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,640
The amulet?

330
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,900
Yumi, coffee.

331
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,680
Thank you.

332
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,170
Oh? Is that your boyfriend?

333
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,780
Yes.

334
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,060
He must've taken it without you knowing.

335
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,610
Yes, he took it to tease me.

336
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,960
You must be really close.

337
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,080
Yes, we are.

338
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,490
- See you later. 
 - Yes.

339
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:10,830
Let's not worry about other things. I just have to do a good job. I can do it.

340
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,550
 Daehan Noodles 

341
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,050
Seonbae Yumi.

342
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,160
Oh! Wu Gi.

343
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,650
- Are you getting off now? 
 - Yes.

344
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:49,250
How is the marketing department?

345
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,060
I don't know yet.

346
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:56,570
It's just crazy. Work and people.

347
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:00,110
It's the first day. I'm sure you'll adapt soon.

348
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,170
I hope so.

349
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,160
By the way, I'm on my way to meet Wung.

350
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,150
Really? He said he had plans.

351
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,000
Those plans are with me.

352
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,110
We're getting a drink.

353
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,640
Do you want to come with us?

354
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,190
Can I join?

355
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,630
I'm sure he'll love it. Would he want to drink with just me?

356
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,970
Then I should surprise him.

357
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,140
- I'll get the car. 
 - All right.

358
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,690
- I'll wait in the front. 
 - Fine.

359
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,450
Assistant Manager Yumi.

360
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,450
Oh, Assistant Manager Yu.

361
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,280
It was tough today, right? You're not familiar with the work, yet they gave you so much to do.

362
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,440
No, it was all right.

363
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,440
Actually, I'm not sure. It's not easy.

364
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,920
You'll just have to get used to it slowly. Don't stress out.

365
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,210
You're right.

366
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,700
And don't care too much about Han Byeol.

367
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,570
He was born nosy.

368
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,020
We can't stop him.

369
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,740
Oh, I see.

370
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,230
Have you eaten? Should I buy you a consolation dinner?

371
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:16,640
No, I'm all right. I have a previous engagement.

372
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,240
Oh, is that your boyfriend?

373
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,010
No, it's Assistant Manager Choi Wu Gi of the sales department.

374
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,150
My boyfriend and him are close.

375
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,580
Oh, really?

376
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,250
Eonni!

377
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,530
Eonni, Ruby's coming, too.

378
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,860
Why?

379
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:37,570
I wanted a farewell party with just the two of us, but I couldn't have it.

380
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,990
Then I ran into Oppa Wu Gi on the elevator.

381
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,840
He said he's going for a drink with you. So Ruby is tagging along.

382
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,290
To catch up with you.

383
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,980
You're coming to catch up with me? No way.

384
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,060
Hurry and get in.

385
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,520
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

386
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,030
But doesn't Assistant Manager Ba Bi live in Ilsan as well?

387
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,730
That's right. He lives in the same neighborhood as me.

388
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,600
Then come with us. We're going to Ilsan.

389
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,760
Oh... me?

390
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,080
Do you want to? We'll drop you off on the way.

391
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,120
What's taking him so long?

392
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,190
- Why are you so late— 
 - Oppa Wung, hello.

393
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,050
Oh?

394
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,680
- Wung! 
 - Oh?

395
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,460
Hello.

396
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,080
Uhh...

397
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,750
What's this combination?

398
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,900
Wung, just get in for now.

399
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,360
- Can you fit well in the back? 
 - I think so.

400
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,240
Excuse me. Ouch!

401
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,840
- Aigoo... 
 - Ow...

402
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,120
Are you all right?

403
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,760
- And you, are you all right? 
 - Yes.

404
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,040
I'm sorry this happened when I just met you.

405
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,400
No problem.

406
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,050
It must hurt.

407
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,770
Where should we go?

408
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,510
Oppa, let's go here.

409
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:14,810
This place is dope. Unlimited free wine.

410
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,020
There is no such place.

411
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,240
It's a place my cousin owns.

412
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,820
Let's go. Straight forward.

413
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,850
Just go straight.

414
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,040
I'll take off for now.

415
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,890
Yes!

416
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,860
Yumi.

417
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,330
How was it?

418
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:45,020
- Huh? 
 - First day.

419
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:53,330
Oh Wung, say hello. This is Assistant Manager Yu Ba Bi.

420
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:57,610
I told you, right? He recommended me to marketing department.

421
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,660
Oh, you're him.

422
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,590
Hello.

423
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,850
That's my boyfriend, Gu Wung.

424
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,390
Hello, I'm Yu Ba Bi.

425
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,380
He lives in my neighborhood. I told you, right?

426
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,480
He found my umbrella.

427
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,550
I think I remember.

428
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,510
Excuse me.

429
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,580
Here.

430
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,700
Your business card. You could have given it to me later.

431
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,830
I'm getting off soon.

432
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,810
Mr. Wu Gi, I'll get off at the next intersection.

433
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,400
- Why? 
 - It's a quick walk from there.

434
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,440
Why? Come with us.

435
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,830
- Me? 
 - Yes.

436
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,670
You can come with us.

437
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,250
You're all friends.

438
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,450
I'm definitely not close with this person.

439
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,630
You're so funny.

440
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:06,780
Come with us. Ruby always welcomes handsome men.

441
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,040
I think he might be uncomfortable.

442
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,420
Then could I join you?

443
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:17,250
I really don't want to go home alone today.

444
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,310
Great! Ruby loves things like this.

445
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,410
These awkward gatherings.

446
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,200
Go go!

447
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,570
Without you, Eonni, it feels so empty.

448
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:33,490
I didn't know not having you would feel so empty.

449
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,730
I was seriously so sad.

450
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,750
- Really? 
 - Yes.

451
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,720
You were sad?

452
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,320
You were so happy in the hallway earlier.

453
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,200
You're so funny! You're driving me crazy.

454
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,950
It's cheating if you're handsome plus funny.

455
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,000
Cheers.

456
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,330
You're funny.

457
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,280
Right? Oppa Wu Gi is super funny.

458
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,780
- No, I mean you, Miss Ruby. 
 - Me?

459
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,200
Thank you.

460
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,920
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

461
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,990
Cheers.

462
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,260
Oppa, too.

463
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,460
Oppa, he says I'm funny.

464
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,620
By the way, you're a good judge of character.

465
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,300
- I hear that often. 
 - I like you a lot.

466
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,050
Ba Bi, Ruby.

467
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,430
- Bibi! 
 - Bibi.

468
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,480
This is okay, right?

469
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,860
The vibes at work must be nice.

470
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,470
Is it fun?

471
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,500
It's more fun when I was with you.

472
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,640
Then come back.

473
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,020
Just kidding.

474
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:51,190
 My original plan was to leave around 10, go home 

475
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,730
 and make up with Yumi, who was hurt yesterday. 

476
00:34:54,730 --> 00:35:00,180
 I had a feeling that today would be an important day for our future. 

477
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,250
- But, Assistant Manager Ba Bi ... 
 - Yes.

478
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,640
Am I really funny?

479
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,980
You must not know your charm well.

480
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,920
 So first, I used the carp lip technique. 

481
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,500
Carp lip. A technique to communicate

482
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,800
by just the lip shape without making sounds.

483
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,920
It's mostly used when couples need to get away from drinking situations.

484
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,620
Yumi.

485
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,190
Yumi

486
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,790
Yumi.

487
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:30,020
Come on. That was a compliment, right?

488
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,990
Yumi.

489
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,370
But...

490
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,690
We should get going now.

491
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,540
Huh?

492
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,730
I said we should get going now.

493
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,710
 I'm type b. 

494
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,600
What, Wung? I can't hear you.

495
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,050
What?

496
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,730
Ch-cheers.

497
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,510
You should've said that louder.

498
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,010
Cheers!

499
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,390
Okay!

500
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,050
Cheers!

501
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,350
 Then I sent her the eye message. 

502
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:10,820
Eye message. A technique to communicate with eyes.

503
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,390
Usually used by couples to get away from company dinners.

504
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:23,260
Yumi.

505
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,080
 Yumi. 

506
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,500
 What? 

507
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,570
 We should get going now. 

508
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,280
 Let's just finish this then leave. 

509
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:42,690
 But eye message has a weak security. 

510
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,400
What? So you two will ditch us?

511
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,860
Says who? If you two leave, Oppa Wu Gi will leave, too.

512
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,960
That can't happen.

513
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:18,500
Strangely, we seem to drink wine really well today.

514
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,030
Let's open another bottle.

515
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,420
 One bottle of wine is approximately five glasses. 

516
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,840
 There are five people currently. 

517
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,920
 One bottle will only be one glass per person. 

518
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,840
First, Oppa Wung.

519
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,460
Oppa Wu Gi.

520
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,840
 I'll modify the plan by finishing this glass in one shot then escape this place. 

521
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,600
 - But the opponent is Ruby.  
 - Eonni's turn.

522
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,230
 Ruby quietly filled the glasses.  

523
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:55,740
 But without having anyone notice, 

524
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,580
 - She's pouring more wine than before.   
 - Thank you.

525
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,870
 If she pours a little more in four glasses, 

526
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:07,930
 naturally, the last glass cannot be filled. 

527
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:11,530
Oh? It's empty.

528
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:14,480
Ruby's glass isn't full yet.

529
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,480
I guess I'll need to get another bottle.

530
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,440
Oppa!

531
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,660
 Is this... 

532
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,930
 an endless circle of alcohol? 

533
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,320
Endless circle of alcohol.

534
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,000
When pouring alcohol, purposely making the last glass not full

535
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,580
thus opening a new bottle.

536
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,890
But is it all right to drink this much wine—

537
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,490
Of course it's all right.

538
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,030
Ruby's buying today.

539
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:44,140
This is Ruby's cousin's bar.

540
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:48,110
Everyone, lift your glasses.

541
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,340
Cheers!

542
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,440
Cheers.

543
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,460
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

544
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,440
Should I drink for you?

545
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:01,670
Oppa, I'm drunk. Can you drink for me?

546
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:05,910
Assistant Manager Yumi, you didn't even major in Korean literature, yet you're such a good writer.

547
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,770
Stop flattering me like that.

548
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:10,520
You're right.

549
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,710
I'm sure my Yumi will write good things.

550
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:17,790
She has so many books at home. A whole wall is filled with books, right?

551
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:18,840
Really?

552
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:25,530
Of course. She likes the author Lee Dong Gun.

553
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,670
Wung, are you all right?

554
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:30,200
 All right? All right? 

555
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,270
- What's going on? 
 - What is this?

556
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,280
The power went off.

557
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,330
Oppa, I'll read your palm.

558
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,240
I don't offer it to just anyone.

559
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,560
 He still has some energy left. 

560
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,060
 He must've drank too much wine, which caused this error. 

561
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:53,250
Then we should reboot.

562
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,060
There we go.

563
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,640
He's coming back!

564
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,960
 There you go. Get up, Gu Wung! 

565
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,240
 We need to have a serious conversation with Yumi today. 

566
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,630
Actually I was sitting behind you yesterday.

567
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,960
Really?

568
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,330
I didn't see you at all.

569
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,540
I really didn't purposely listen.

570
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:28,050
You'll forget, right? I wish you'd forget.

571
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,300
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

572
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,080
 What are they talking about? 

573
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,260
 Seems like a secret. 

574
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,220
Thank you.

575
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,520
 Gu Wung, let's get up. 

576
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,090
 Come on now. You can do it! 

577
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:58,150
Oh no, he's must have used up all his energy.

578
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,980
I'm so curious what they're talking about.

579
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,130
- Let's connect emergency external battery. 
 - Right!

580
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,390
It'll hold up for a little bit.

581
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:26,930
Get up, Gu Wung. This is not the time to be sleeping!

582
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,940
 Where is this? 

583
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,030
 Seems as if it's been a while. 

584
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,830
 What about Yumi? Where is she? 

585
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:54,000
It keeps getting canceled.

586
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,670
Are you cold?

587
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:03,550
No, I'm fine.

588
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,170
Put this on.

589
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,270
I'm fine.

590
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,450
Put it on. It's still chilly at night.

591
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,050
 What the? Why is he giving his clothes? 

592
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,820
 No, wake up, Gu Wung! 

593
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,240
 That action is a little weird. 

594
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,640
No, he's used up all his energy.

595
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,210
We have to wait until he recharges.

596
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,450
We don't have time for that.

597
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:50,300
That jerk Yu Ba Bi looks dangerous somehow.

598
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,630
- You think? Then we should use the last resort. 
 - Yes.

599
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,210
 Last Resort 

600
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,450
The last resort.

601
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:13,270
Let's reboot Wung with self-propelled willpower!

602
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:23,420
Open your eyes, Gu Wung! This is not the time to be sleeping!

603
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:32,470
There is a jerk offering his clothes right in front of the boyfriend!

604
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,250
 When I woke up, I was at Yumi's place. 

605
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:48,100
 It must've been late. It was quiet. 

606
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,800
 And Yumi was by my side. 

607
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:03,120
 I never imagined breaking up with Yumi until now. 

608
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:28,700
 But that night, for some reason 

609
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,140
 I imagined ominous things I couldn't help. 

610
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,310
 Put it on. It's still chilly at night. 

611
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,590
 No, I'm really fine. 

612
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:47,660
Mr. Kim Ba Bi.

613
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:54,840
- Me? 
 - Yes, Kim Ba Bi.

614
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,590
I'm not Kim Ba Bi but Yu Ba Bi.

615
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,870
What the heck are you doing right now?

616
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,060
Wung.

617
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,810
What the heck are you?

618
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:09,030
I thought Assistant Manager Yumi might be cold.

619
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:11,250
Look at this jerk.

620
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:14,150
Wung, what's wrong?

621
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:16,400
Yumi, just stay still.

622
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,260
Hey, lets see here, this...

623
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,390
Mr. Wung, calm down. Mr. Wung, calm...

624
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,170
down...

625
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,690
Why are you taking your clothes off?

626
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,370
You'll catch a cold.

627
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:39,650
You need to dress warmly.

628
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:41,690
- I'm fine. 
 - Noooo.

629
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:47,050
You've got to dress well, Mr. Kim Ba Bi.

630
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,510
Listen to me while I'm being nice to you.

631
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,530
I'll be upset.

632
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,270
I'll be upset if you catch a cold.

633
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:57,770
Sure, I'm sure.

634
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,880
Thank you.

635
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,790
It's cold.

636
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:07,010
Wung, wear this.

637
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:11,750
Oh my tummy.

638
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,890
It's cold.

639
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:16,370
I'm still cold.

640
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:18,360
It's cold.

641
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,960
Get up. Let's go up.

642
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,590
Let's go.

643
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,860
- I'm cold, Yumi. 
 -  Gosh, you're heavy.

644
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,020
I have low alcohol tolerance.

645
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,990
It's cold. Let's go up.

646
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:30,990
Wung.

647
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,280
I did that?

648
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,150
Yes, you did that.

649
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:37,380
You took off your clothes like a knight then put it on him.

650
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,830
You were so kind.

651
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:43,430
So take it back to him, since it's yours.

652
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:44,680
- Me? 
 - Yes.

653
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,320
I have to go somewhere right now.

654
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,430
I should hurry.

655
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,410
Can't you come with me?

656
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,330
Hurry and finish.

657
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,940
Please come with me.

658
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,830
Wung, drink it. You said your stomach is upset.

659
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:13,680
- Hello. 
 - Oh, hello.

660
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,560
Are you feeling all right?

661
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,450
Yes, I'm sorry.

662
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:22,000
I was so drunk last night, I think I did something rude.

663
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,030
No, you were so caring I was really touched.

664
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:33,760
Then...

665
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,080
Oh, right.

666
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,150
Then...

667
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,060
I had a good time yesterday.

668
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,010
Yes, me too.

669
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,450
- Then I'll see you again. 
 - Sure.

670
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:10,050
- Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye.

671
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:22,900
 What ominous imagination? 

672
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,090
 It was a total misunderstanding. Wasn't it? 

673
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:29,270
 Why? Does it still bother you. 

674
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:32,380
 Yes, still something bothers me. 

675
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:39,540
 Actually, I feel the same. 

676
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:49,140
 Episode 35: Yumi and Wung's problem solving  

677
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,530
See you at home.

678
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:02,220
Bye.

679
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,960
It'll be summer soon.

680
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,140
Was that your boyfriend?

681
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,720
Assistant Manager Han Byeol.

682
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,140
Was that your boyfriend just now?

683
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,090
Yes. We live in the same neighborhood so he dropped me off on his way.

684
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:25,470
So you really do have a boyfriend.

685
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:28,540
What? Then you thought I put a fake picture?

686
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,290
I thought it was a smoke bomb.

687
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:33,910
Why would I throw a smoke bomb?

688
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,760
You might have been afraid of spreading rumors in the company. Is it really not Yu Ba Bi?

689
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,250
I keep telling you we're really not together and yet you still say that.

690
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:43,110
I'm really getting mad now.

691
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:48,410
I'm sorry. Sorry. I ... There were some hints  ...

692
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,300
So you tried to link Assistant Managers Yumi and Ba Bi this time?

693
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,030
It was a reasonable assumption.

694
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:58,640
He was quiet for a while then started back.

695
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,820
But he's like this because

696
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,770
we did a truth or dare at the team dinner last week—

697
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:05,220
- Truth or dare? 
 - Yes.

698
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,230
- But then— 
 - Ba Bi said that there's someone he's interested at work

699
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:12,480
and her name has the letter u in her name.

700
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,320
- U? 
 - Yes.

701
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,480
The letter U.

702
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,200
 U 

703
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:31,040
 Yumi 

704
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,180
I think I found something out again!

705
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,800
Everyone, Yumi's name has a 'U' in it. Extra!

706
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,900
- It hasn't been long since he's been released from prison! 
 - Extra! Extra!

707
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,680
Yu Ba Bi likes U!

708
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,120
It must be Yumi! Extra! Extra!

709
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,630
Are you nuts?

710
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,210
Shut your mouth this minute!

711
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:57,350
Ba Bi loves U! Ba Bi loves U!

712
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,750
Yumi Guards!

713
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,270
He likes a person with a 'U' in her name.

714
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:17,360
Am I wrong? Huh? Huh? What did I do wrong?

715
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,960
Stop with the nonsense!

716
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,540
Girls with the letter 'U' in their names are...

717
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,240
 Marketing Department - Ju Hee, Ji Young, Eun Ah, Yumi 

718
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,920
 There are four just in marketing department! 

719
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,590
Having a 'U' in the name is really common.

720
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,030
That's true.

721
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:36,730
I think Assistant Manager Ba Bi played it smart to get out of it.

722
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:40,020
But I don't have a 'U'.

723
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:43,460
Well, we can narrow it down to a few people. All right, listen up.

724
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:48,140
Yu Ba Bi broke up with his girlfriend approximately in early March, because...

725
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,800
 Ba Bi, there is a typo here. 

726
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,940
 Where is your ring? 

727
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:59,110
 The ring that was there! 

728
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,020
 The couple ring... 

729
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,910
 That's when his ring suddenly went missing. 

730
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:05,120
Then he said there was someone he's interested in last week.

731
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,180
There was a change of heart during that time.

732
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:11,900
In other words, after taking off his ring, he met someone with a 'U' in her name.

733
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,210
Do you have any guesses? You're close with Ba Bi.

734
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:25,750
Me? I'm not close—

735
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,920
 A colleague with a 'U' in her name 

736
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,370
 that he met after he threw away his ring? 

737
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,960
 YUMI 

738
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,590
 YUMI 

739
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:43,260
Wait! I think I know this.

740
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:47,700
The letter u he met after he threw away the ring.

741
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:53,580
R-U-B-Y.

742
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:56,820
 The answer is Ruby! 

743
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:02,670
- Why? Did you think of someone? 
 - No.

744
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:04,100
You did.

745
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,880
- I think you know who it is, right? 
 - Yes.

746
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,700
I'm not sure. I don't know.

747
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:16,600
But you are so interested in Assistant Yu's relationship.

748
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:20,030
I told you it's not good for your mental health to listen to Han Byeol too much.

749
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,850
According to him, I like all the female employees.

750
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:28,980
How can the main character of our tea just show up? That's rude.

751
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,960
You said so with your own mouth that she has the letter 'U' in her name.

752
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,760
- Let's start the meeting. 
 - Hey.

753
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,080
Assistant Manager Ba Bi!

754
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,080
Miss Ruby.

755
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,780
When are we going to gather again? The wine family needs to meet again.

756
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,760
I'm in whenever you call me.

757
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,630
Nice! Then I should call everyone again soon.

758
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:58,910
Let me know when you do.

759
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:00,920
You're going to treat us this time, right, Manager Ba Bi?

760
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,370
Just pick the date.

761
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:04,780
As expected, Bi bi.

762
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,730
They look good together.

763
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,450
They really look good together.

764
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:18,120
Alphabet B?

765
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,360
Yes, I think I know who it is.

766
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,300
The letter B is in there, right?

767
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,310
No.

768
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:29,970
No? Then give me another hint?

769
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:33,930
The letter B isn't in there for sure.

770
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:31,450
Oh, yeah!

771
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,170
There's no eggs.

772
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,770
Or green onions.

773
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:51,490
- Do you need a bag? 
- Yes.

774
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:53,450
50 cents.

775
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:57,730
Never mind, I'll just take it.

776
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,850
 Wung, I just left. 

777
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,430
 Here is today's question to pass the time. 

778
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:37,020
 Question 1. What is the probability that Yumi is on that bus? 

779
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,070
Let's see.

780
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:45,160
 Yumi got on the bus in front of her company around 11:28pm. 

781
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,140
 From here to her company it takes about 24 minutes, 

782
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:52,790
 and right now it's 11:53pm. 

783
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:56,570
 The probability of Yumi being on that bus is 100%. 

784
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:59,360
 Answer:  100% 

785
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:08,950
That's right.

786
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:12,030
 Correct. 100%. 

787
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:20,550
 Question 2. What's this situation right now? 

788
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:24,710
 My team has a work dinner so I'm going to be a little late. 

789
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,580
 Wung, eat dinner without me. 

790
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:30,380
 Today, Yumi had a work dinner. Yu Ba Bi lives... 

791
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:35,220
 Oh right. My house and your house are very close by. 

792
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,630
 Right. That's why I saw you a couple of times at the mart. 

793
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:42,650
 Answer. After the work dinner, they got on the bus together. 

794
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:51,280
Isn't that your boyfriend?

795
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,030
Wung!

796
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:01,110
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

797
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,020
It's been a while.

798
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,290
Yes. Have you been well?

799
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:06,740
Yes.

800
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:16,350
You must be visiting Manager Yumi's house.

801
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:22,410
 Question 3. Is Gu Wung visiting Yumi's house? 

802
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:24,340
 It's a multiple choice. 

803
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:27,630
 a. Yes, I'm just here to visit.  

804
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:31,420
 b. No, I just have nowhere to go. 

805
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,960
Well, A isn't the answer.

806
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,810
The answer is B but..

807
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:41,870
we can't say B, we have pride.

808
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:45,230
- Well— 
 - Yes, he's here to visit.

809
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:48,270
I see.

810
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:50,230
Then I'll see you again.

811
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:51,320
Yes.

812
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,420
Assistant Manager Yumi, I'll see you tomorrow.

813
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:54,590
Yes, goodbye.

814
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:05,360
Did you come out to meet me? Wow, Gu Wung. Gu gu gu gu...

815
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,090
Good job.

816
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:08,870
Let's go.

817
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:14,730
That's a relief. Yumi replied for us.

818
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:16,920
So embarassing.

819
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:19,360
What's wrong?

820
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,580
It's so embarrassing.

821
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:25,890
Right now Wung is overstaying...

822
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:31,660
 What is this, and in front of Yu Ba Bi ? 

823
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:35,190
 Who would believe that he's just visiting. 

824
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,860
Wung, what did you buy?

825
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:42,910
Eggs and scallion? Were you going to make ramen?

826
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:45,420
Right?

827
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,080
 Next question. 

828
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:51,990
 Number four. Which of the following is a way to be confident? 

829
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,500
 a. Straighten your shoulders.  

830
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,980
 b. Smile brightly. 

831
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,770
 c. Make a joke. 

832
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:06,200
Wung, I had a fun thought today.

833
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,500
Remember our wine gathering last time?

834
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:12,200
I think another couple will be born.

835
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,610
Yumi.

836
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,280
Yes?

837
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,040
I...

838
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:26,590
I'll leave this week.

839
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:30,020
 d. Leave Yumi's house. 

840
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,810
You're leaving?

841
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,950
Yes.

842
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:47,950
Why?

843
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,950
Why?

844
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,170
Is it because ...

845
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,810
I talked about getting married?

846
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,380
Is it really that?

847
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:17,700
 Question 5 is next. What is the right thing to tell Yumi? 

848
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:22,180
 a. It's embarrassing living at my girlfriend's house.  

849
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:25,290
 b. Talking about marriage is burdensome.  

850
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:29,550
 c. I got some money and can get a nice house. 

851
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,380
Answer me, Wung.

852
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:41,390
Why are you suddenly saying you want to leave?

853
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:45,380
Wung.

854
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:50,020
Let's talk about it later.

855
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:54,470
 d. Don't answer.  

856
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:58,360
♫  I won't change  ♫

857
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:01,140
Let's go. It's cold.

858
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:13,300
♫  I know what you want me to say ♫  

859
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:16,560
♫  I'll answer  ♫

860
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:23,160
♫  I like a quiet night  ♫

861
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:29,530
♫  As you always run away  ♫

862
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:38,000
♫  while walking at dawn stop  ♫

863
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,200
♫  wherever your toes touch  ♫

864
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,800
♫  With a dream, waves and the sand  ♫

865
01:02:51,800 --> 01:03:01,700
♫  I am breaking and scattering every day  ♫

866
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:09,210
♫   A minor romance, my own festival   ♫

867
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:15,180
♫  Oh love,  ♫

868
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:22,500
♫  will this love which fills a small fist   ♫

869
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:26,330
  Yumi's Cells 
 Preview 

870
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:29,040
 Yumi, I'm leaving now. 

871
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,010
 I'll leave the house key on the table. 

872
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:34,970
 By the way, your boyfriend isn't here today. 

873
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:39,100
 Louis, I'm sorry but do you have some money? 

874
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:40,990
 Don't send me money. Seriously.  

875
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:44,510
 I broke it. Of course I should. 

876
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:46,150
 It's nice to see you all of a sudden. 

877
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:49,690
 More than anyone isn't it your responsibility to fight for love until the end? 

878
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:51,010
 There's no need to drag it out. 

879
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:52,750
 - Love! 
 - I said it's all over! 

880
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:58,110
♫  Of all things when the song coming out of the radio  ♫
