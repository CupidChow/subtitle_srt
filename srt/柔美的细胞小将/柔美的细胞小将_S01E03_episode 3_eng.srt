00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,710
 Yumi 
 A tvN original series 

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,750


3
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,680
 Yumi's Cell 
 This program includes indirect and virtual advertisements.

00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,510
 Episode 6 
  Gu Wung 

5
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:57,080
Is the pharmacy open today? What time is it now?

6
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,160
Did you ask what time it is?

7
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,740
- Yes. 
 - It's Seoul*. 
  (*T/N: Seoul the city sounds the same as Seoul time.) 

8
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,120
Oh...

9
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,230
What time? It's Seoul.

10
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,270
That's funny.

11
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,740
Do you know this one?

12
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,150
- What? 
 - Do you know what a gentleman says when he introduces himself?

13
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,640
- I'm not sure. 
 - I'm a gentleman*.

14
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,320
 *(This sounds the same as "I am Sim Sa Im Dang," a Korean artist from the Joseon Dynasty. She is on Korea's 50,000 won banknote.) 

15
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,000
Ah, Sim Sa Im Dang.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,180
That's so funny!

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,790
That's a relief!

18
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,460
Wung is coming back to normal.

19
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,120
This is all thanks to whom? Thanks to me!

20
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,930
They're just laughing so much.

21
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,040
Now you just have to trust me.

22
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,100
You're going to do it again? I think you have already done enough.

23
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,850
What do you mean?

24
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,600
I still have a hundred left.

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,720
What shall I say next? What happens if an apple laughs?

26
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,180
Green apple*.
  ("Green" and "laugh" are homonyms)  

27
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,680
What happens when you surprise a hat?

28
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,770
Mosaic.

29
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,500
 (Combining moja (=hat) and K the Korean laugh icon) 

30
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,460
- That's funny. 
 - Then I have one more!

31
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,430
What?

32
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,340
He is going to do another one?

33
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,800
Stop while I'm saying it nicely.

34
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,880
Do you know what house slippers say when they introduce themselves?

35
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,580
- I don't know. 
 - Try to guess!

36
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,800
I told you to stop! Do you really have a death wish?

37
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,950
Sensitivity, whoa whoa!

38
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,820
House slippers are like this when they introduce themselves.

39
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,190
Excuse me*. 
   (*Sounds the same as "I am a house slipper".) 

40
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,590
The coffee you ordered is out!

41
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,160
- The coffee is– 
 - I will go get it.

42
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,620
He's really...

43
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,990
He's a bit clueless.

44
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,760
Sensitivity, let's be a little more patient. We just need to have coffee and then we can leave.

45
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,690
It is a game-making company but it's actually more of a team than a company.

46
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,020
We are all friends.

47
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,720
Oh really? That must be so nice.

48
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,880
What do you mean? We fight every day.

49
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,780
But it's still fun.

50
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,680
I would imagine that it would be. I'm envious.

51
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,120
It is good that there is no set time to come into work

52
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,260
but the problem is that there is no set time to leave either.

53
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:50,040
That's true. Then ... what kind of game are you making?

54
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,400
We are making this game right now, called 'Bow-Wow Time'.

55
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,020
- The dog is trying to find snacks hidden by its owner. 
 - Really?

56
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,300
I really like dogs.

57
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,820
Wow! That sounds fun.

58
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,000
The dog is searching around like this.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,050
It's cute.

60
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,200
I'm bored. How long do we have to do this?

61
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,330
It has been an hour or two so I think we can leave now.

62
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,690
What's that sound?

63
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,470
Isn't it Hunger?

64
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,290
I am hungry! I am hungry! I am hungry!

65
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,200
Guys, I am hungry! I am hungry!

66
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,890
- Why did he get so big? 
 - We skipped breakfast

67
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,420
and barely ate lunch. What should we do?

68
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,690
Let's hurry and leave. It isn't fun, so let's just go home and eat.

69
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,530
But we can't just suddenly end it and leave!

70
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,450
I can't take it anymore because I'm hungry!

71
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,020
T-That is... tummy flute*! 
 ("stomach playing the flute": Korean equivalent of "stomach rumbling")  

72
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,170
You can't play tummy flute! We're in the middle of a blind date!

73
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,430
Nooooo!!

74
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,670
Stop!

75
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,490
No-o-o-o!

76
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,120
I always stay up all night because of this, that's how it's been.

77
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,650
Then, when will it be released?

78
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,160
It will be released in July.

79
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,110
But I didn't realize it's already 6 p.m. because we were talking this whole time.

80
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,720
Should we go eat?

81
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,330
- Pardon? 
 - I know a great restaurant nearby.

82
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,250
Since you introduced me to a great coffee shop, I will introduce you to a great Korean restaurant.

83
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,340
But I am really fine...

84
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,950
Shall we?

85
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,530
- Let's go. 
 - All right.

86
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,920
This is my first time here.

87
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,320
Not many people know that this is Ilsan's best hidden restaurant.

88
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,920
Really? I have lived in Ilsan for a long time, so I know most good restaurants.

89
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,300
Your meal is here.

90
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,060
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

91
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,750
How is it?

92
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,430
It's good...

93
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,090
It's good! It's good!

94
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,030
Really?

95
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,620
It's good, right?

96
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,930
Yes, it's really good.

97
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,470
The side dishes are good too!

98
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,220
Wow, everything is good.

99
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,420
Everything is good.

100
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,300
The grilled mackerel is the best!

101
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,850
The rolled eggs are the best!

102
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,390
The lotus root, the best!

103
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:43,270
Wow! How can it be this good?

104
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,280
Calm down, Hunger!

105
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,300
You eat well!

106
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,260
Oh, I didn't have lunch.

107
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,040
It is nice to see! It's really great that you are enjoying it.

108
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,620
Should we also order kimchi jjigae*? 
  (*a kimchi stew) 

109
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:11,050
- Kimchi jjigae? 
 - The aged kimchi jjigae here goes really well with the grilled mackerel.

110
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,230
- Ma'am, we'd like to order kimchi jjigae please. 
 - Yes.

111
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:19,590
Kimchi jjigae! Kimchi jjigae!

112
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,390
If you eat grilled mackerel

113
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,890
and aged kimchi together,

114
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:29,930
♫  it tastes really amazing!

115
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,030
Oh yeah!

116
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,820
It's good! Oh yeah!

117
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,690
He's unbelievable.

118
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,070
- I like, I like, I like that person. 
 - What?

119
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,920
He is the expert on hidden delicious restaurants.

120
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,660
If I start dating him, I think I will be able to eat something delicious all the time!

121
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,230
You idiot! You are willing to sell your soul for something to eat?

122
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,900
But Reason, I am nervous.

123
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,440
About what?

124
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,520
I think that stew will splash on her.

125
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,390
Yumi's outfit is white. What should we do?

126
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,970
Here is an apron in case the stew splashes.

127
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,330
Ah ... Thank you.

128
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,500
Oh my, what's going on? That man is considerate.

129
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,480
So what? It isn't like he bought the apron. He just brought what was already there. What's so hard about that?

130
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,650
But still... who else would have done that?

131
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,690
I like that man.

132
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,830
- What! 
 - You saw what happened when her stomach was growling, right?

133
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,790
He pretended not to hear it.

134
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,430
He has manners.

135
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,730
How do you like the kimchi jjigae?

136
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,090
It's very good.

137
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,770
Eat a lot. You can get unlimited refills here.

138
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,270
Do you come here often?

139
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,090
Yes, when I'm craving a homemade meal, I come here.

140
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:19,660
Since I live by myself, I order delivery food often, so I miss a homemade meal.

141
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,180
I do too. Since I've been living alone for a long time,

142
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,200
I started to like restaurants like this one, that make homemade meals.

143
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,840
That's right.

144
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,440
I guess he's not the type to dress up or show off. I like that.

145
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,500
- What? 
 - I don't think he's the type that will waste money. I like him too.

146
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,940
Hey hey! How can you know that, when we've just met him?

147
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,740
Guys! After observing more closely,

148
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,200
I don't think he just threw on those clothes.

149
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:57,000
Moderately disheveled hair. Bohemian style beard.

150
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,180
Wrinkled shirt and flip-flops.

151
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,220
I almost missed it because it was thought out so well,

152
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,830
but you cannot fool me.

153
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,170
I'm talking about the perfect "effortlessly natural look"!

154
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,290
That man is quite fashionable.

155
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,430
Stop exaggerating. How can a bum be fashionable?

156
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,230
- I like that man. 
 - What?

157
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,970
I would have to know more about how he spends his money,

158
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,140
- but me too. 
 - I like him too.

159
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,440
I like him too.

160
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,000
What? What is wrong with you all?

161
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,650
- How much is it? 
 - It's 22,000 won  (≈$18,5) .

162
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,830
- What are you doing? 
 - Since you bought the coffee earlier, I'll pay for the meal.

163
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,140
What are you talking about? I just stepped away to go to the restroom.

164
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,380
- I'll pay for it. 
 - There's no way. I said I'm buying.

165
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,060
- I can't keep letting you pay. 
 - No.

166
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,440
- We're floating! 
 - We're floating!

167
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,870
What are you guys doing?

168
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,520
Why are you acting like this? We've just met him today!

169
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,900
I guess everyone was feeling really lonely. Sensitivity, come here.

170
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,640
Let's have fun for at least a day.

171
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,700
Yes, come on! Let's have fun!

172
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,300
Come back to your senses! Yumi isn't an easy woman!

173
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,620
This can't continue. Let's end this quickly and go our separate ways.

174
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,100
 Mom's Dining Table 

175
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,950
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

176
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,680
- I should have paid. 
 - That wasn't necessary.

177
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,030
I had a great time today thanks to you.

178
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,850
- What? 
 - What?

179
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,410
Are you leaving already?

180
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,850
I thought you would be busy.

181
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,740
I'm not busy.

182
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,770
- Then... 
 - Shall we have a quick beer...

183
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,590
But I can't drink a lot.

184
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,330
seems a bit too much.

185
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,020
- That place would be nice. 
 - Sorry?

186
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,950
That's right. There's no place better than there.

187
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,630
Where?

188
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,060
I suddenly can't remember the name, but that...

189
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,660
There's that place, you know, that place.

190
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,530
We need to remember where that place is!

191
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,410
You guys! Everyone come to the millstone!

192
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,160
We can't end at the second round*. We must come up with an idea for the third round. 
  (*sequence of events: coffee 1st round, dinner 2nd round, etc.)  

193
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,190
Third round! Third round!

194
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,020
Third round! Third round!

195
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,760
That place would be perfect for a third round.

196
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,650
Where are you talking about?

197
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,860
That place is...

198
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,260
 Dream Maru Frog Festival  
 Frogs.

199
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,480
- Frogs? 
 - You know Dream Maru Park, right? 
 - Yes.

200
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,240
They're having a Frog Festival there now.

201
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,200
They released a lot of frogs there. Anyway, I heard it's fun.

202
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,730
It's starting today. There are fun performances too. 
  Place: Ilsan Dream Maru Park, Date: June 7-21 
Hosted by: Goyang City 

203
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,390
Frogs?

204
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:29,950
Who cares about frogs? I want to go home and rest.

205
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,990
What should I do? I really want to go but I have to go home—

206
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,100
Why did you do that?

207
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,800
Let's just go. Everybody wants to go.

208
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,860
There's nothing to do at home anyway.

209
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,460
I want to eat popcorn and ice cream for dessert.

210
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,120
Since he has good manners, he'll probably take us home even if it gets late.

211
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,430
These guys...!

212
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,220
 Dream Maru Frog Festival 

213
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,710
Welcome! Ribbit. Ribbit.

214
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,230
The entrance fee for two adults is 30000 won.

215
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,490
You get a 50% discount if you're a couple.

216
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,420
We're not a couple.

217
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,180
I mean what's so hard about saying that you're a couple?

218
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,530
You can get a 50% discount if you say we're a couple.

219
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,570
We are a couple.

220
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,730
We're a couple. Please give us a discount.

221
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,020
You're sure you're are a couple, right?

222
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,660
Yes.

223
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,970
Yes.

224
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,330
Then,

225
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,810
if you take a couple photo wearing this,

226
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,100
and post it with our tag on social media, we will give you a prize depending on how many likes you get.

227
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,070
No thank you.

228
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,780
I'll give you an additional 3,000 won  (≈ $2,5)  discount.

229
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,770
Three thousand won discount per couple?

230
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,080
Three thousand won discount for each person.

231
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,480
It's a total discount of 6,000 won. 6,000 won isn't a trivial amount of money.

232
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,750
Shall we take the photo?

233
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,320
I'm going to take the photo.

234
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,150
But I don't use social media.

235
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,020
I'll post it to my account. It's a waste to not get the discount.

236
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,030
One, two, three, ribbit.

237
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,980
You look great! I'll take one more.

238
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,490
Please stand a little bit closer.

239
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,680
One, two, three, ribbit.

240
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,710
 Sorry for doing this the first time we meet. 

241
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,210
Oh my. Who is this?

242
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,990
Why are they together? Oh my goodness.

243
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,590
 Assistant Manager Kim Yumi 

244
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,860
No, I shouldn't. She'll probably ignore my calls again.

245
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,300
The frogs are really loud.

246
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,260
Are you okay with uploading the picture to your social media account?

247
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,100
It's fine. Nobody is going to look at it anyway.

248
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,750
Are you not going to pick up your phone?

249
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,260
It's an unknown number.

250
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,920
Please excuse me for a second.

251
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,520
Hello?

252
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,180
 Hello, Oppa Wung. 

253
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,160
Who are you?

254
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,620
 It's Ruby. 

255
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,550
- Ruby? 
 - Ruby?

256
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,110
Who are you...?

257
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,230
Oh, right. Hello miss Ruby.

258
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,270
- He just said Ruby, right? 
 - What's going on?

259
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,790
Don't tell me it's the Ruby we know?

260
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,330
How does Wung know Ruby?

261
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:08,180
What's happening? I'm already starting to get upset.

262
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,940
Yes. I didn't save your number so I didn't know it was you.

263
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,720
Oh, Ruby is so sad! Why didn't you save my number?

264
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,350
But ... why are you calling?

265
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,680
You're with Eonni Yumi right now, aren't you? Why?

266
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,980
How did you know that?

267
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,910
Eonni uploaded a picture to her social media account.

268
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,720
A blind date? Oh my! Really?

269
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,560
But how did you get introduced to each other?

270
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,890
Oppa Wu Gi did? Really?

271
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,650
 Oh my! 

272
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,720
Yes.

273
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,190
Why are you so excited that I'm going on a blind date with Yumi?

274
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,940
Oh, I see.

275
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,910
Then do your best. Yes. Yes.

276
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:57,360
Have a great time today and go home late.

277
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,960
Ruby is rooting for you!

278
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,640
What a surprise. Oppa Wu Gi introduced them?

279
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:14,230
Then Eonni Yumi is out of the game. Awesome!

280
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,290
What was that?

281
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,430
You know miss Ruby, right?

282
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,760
- Hubae Lee Ruby from my company? 
 - Yes.

283
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,870
She said she's rooting for us.

284
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,750
- For what? 
 - For us to be together.

285
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,780
What do you mean root—

286
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,670
Ruby said she will be rooting for us?

287
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,150
How do you know her?

288
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,810
I had plans with Wu Gi recently and she followed him.

289
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,920
 Actually, he lives in Ilsan. 

290
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:53,270
 So that's why when we both went to Ilsan that time, I was thinking of introducing him to you naturally. 

291
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,990
 - Eonni.
 - But because Ruby interrupted that day, 

292
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,280
 she met him instead. 

293
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,590
- You met her that day. 
 - Yes.

294
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:09,370
What should we do? Now that Ruby knows, how excited will she be tomorrow?

295
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:13,380
That's why I told you we should hurry up and go home!

296
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,050
But she's a bit weird though.

297
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,900
What do you mean?

298
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,000
She keeps calling herself by her name.

299
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,390
"Ruby is sad." "Ruby wants to do it." Things like that.

300
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,260
Why does she talk like that?

301
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,990
What's wrong with that? That's why she's cute.

302
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,170
Everybody says she's cute.

303
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:40,500
That's cute? I think it's weird.

304
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,120
Even my nephew stopped talking like that after he turned five.

305
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,760
Why are you laughing?

306
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,740
Is it okay for you to say that, though?

307
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,290
I could go and tell her what you said tomorrow.

308
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,960
I can't help it. Weird is weird.

309
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,820
I can't lie.

310
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:07,970
Also, the ones I find cute are people who look like you.

311
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,090
You're unexpectedly good at flattering people.

312
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,420
It's not flattery. I told you I can't lie.

313
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,250
He's different from Yumi. He doesn't care what other people think.

314
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,720
That's right. He's honest. That's a big plus.

315
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,030
Master. What type of reaction should I give now?

316
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,620
Never mind. It's fine.

317
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,480
From now on, I'll answer him myself.

318
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,340
Well, I'm happy even if it's just flattery.

319
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,870
It's been so long since anyone called me cute.

320
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,010
There's no way that's possible.

321
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:01,620
It's true. I'm buying some popcorn since I'm thankful.

322
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,780
It's over there.

323
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,230
There's no need to thank me. I was just telling the truth.

324
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,260
I'll buy you two servings of popcorn.

325
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,020
It's true, though.

326
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,750
He's easy to talk with and there's nothing wrong with him as long as he doesn't tell jokes.

327
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,900
I like his name too. Gu Wung.

328
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,320
Since our mood is better, shall we go have a beer?

329
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,020
Wung probably knows a lot of good craft beer places.

330
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,760
Let's do that. Let's do that.

331
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:43,440
You've got to be kidding me. Really!

332
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,570
Two.

333
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,400
- Please take this one first. 
 - All right.

334
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,880
 Yumi 

335
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,220
What's happening? Why is Yumi's mood suddenly changing?

336
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,760
I don't know. She's suddenly in a bad mood.

337
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,060
Did somebody lower the mood lever perhaps?

338
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,620
What?

339
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,350
Let's go check it out.

340
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,350
You guys, over there!

341
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,310
It's Hysterius!

342
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,780
Hysterius! Why did you show up?

343
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,060
Why did you mess with the mood lever? You can't mess with that!

344
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,540
You all have lost your mind because you got excited!

345
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,590
Why did you want to start dating Gu Wung?!

346
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,950
Why can't we?

347
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,750
Anyway, you guys are the problem. You're ruining Yumi.

348
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,350
What did we do?

349
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,200
It's obvious what he's planning by flattering us like that.

350
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,350
You want us to fall for that trick again?

351
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,630
Listen carefully!

352
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,840
The love cell that you trusted and followed is dead!

353
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,410
Her minion Inner Feeling has also died.

354
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,490
Therefore, starting today, I'm in charge of the village.

355
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:15,200
There's no dating in my village. Got it?

356
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,740
 What am I doing right now? 

357
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,000
- Thank you.
 - Please enjoy.

358
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,800
 Only yesterday I was turned down by the man I had a one-sided love for. 

359
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,890
 What's so great that it's making me laugh like this? 

360
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,220
 Am I really going to date that man? 

361
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,160
 The man whom Wu Gi introduced me to? 

362
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,980
You really have no heart.

363
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,590
I bought two, since you told me to buy two.

364
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,960
Shall we go over there?

365
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,860
I heard there's a photo zone where you can take pictures with frogs.

366
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,580
- No. 
 - Sorry?

367
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,280
I think I should get going because it's so late.

368
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,630
Let's head out now.

369
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,350
 Let's head out? 

370
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,810
 What does that mean? 

371
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,680
 Is she saying that we should go to another place? 

372
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,000
 I bought two popcorns though. 

373
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,880
 Or does she mean that she wants to walk while eating popcorn? 

374
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,400
 I mean ... we haven't even seen the frogs yet. 

375
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,400
 I don't want to go home yet. 

376
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:38,150

Sorry?

I don't know.

384

Canola oil*.

401
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,930
Why are our last words "canola oil"? How can it be "canola oil"? I'm so annoyed.

402
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,610
What's wrong with that?

403
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,650
We weren't able to say goodbye properly because of your stupid joke!

406
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,350
- Are you leaving now? 
 - Why are you so late? Louis is waiting for you.

407
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,170
I thought you two were going to wrap up stuff today.

408
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,100
Yes. We will.

409
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,890
- Why are you just coming in now? What were you doing? 
 - What else? The blind date.

410
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:34,670
- You've been together this whole time? 
 - Yes.

411
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,540
Gu Wung. Seeing you're back so late, you must like her.

412
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,290
Yes.

413
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,010
- You really liked her? 
 - Yes.

414
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:47,140
- I see. She must be pretty? 
 - Yes.

415
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,160
It's good enough as long as she's pretty? You dummy.

416
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,530
No. I like everything.

417
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,550
I like everything about her.

418
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,350
- Really? 
 - Yes.

419
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,400
We have so much in common.

420
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,280
We have similar interests and like similar foods. She even gets my jokes.

421
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,230
See you later.

422
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,330
Bye.

423
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,290
I'm back.

424
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,970
I said I'm back. Get up.

425
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:38,260
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

431
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,560
Who's she? Why is she disturbing the village?

432
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,040
Don't you recognize her? It's Yumi.

433
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,520
I'm going to take over Wung's village.

434
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,700
She must be home by now.

435
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,970
Thanks to you,

436
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,820
I had

437
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:25,820
 Did you get home safely? Thanks to you, I had a great time today. 

438
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,750
She read it.

439
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:44,660

447
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:29,550
There's no answer.  She didn't reply.

448
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:37,140
  ♫ keep falling ♫ 

449
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,290
What should we do? I think he found us.

450
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:03,100
Damn. I should have just stayed in prison.

451
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,590
Hey, guys.

452
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,570
Hey, guys, it's me. It's me.

453
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:15,070
Reason! I thought you were dead.

454
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,940
Where's everyone else?

455
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,580
I don't know. They're probably hiding somewhere.

456
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,170
That crazy Hysterius.

457
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,970
He was quiet for a while. Why is he throwing a fit again?

458
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,860
I think he is going crazy from worrying about Yumi dating again.

459
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,090
What's wrong with Yumi dating?

460
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,550
It's scary. I'm worried she might get hurt again.

461
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:36,900
Then does that crazy guy want Yumi to grow old and be alone forever to make him feel better?

462
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,190
We can't let that happen.

463
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,790
Guys, look at this. Wung sent us a message.

464
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:46,260
"Have you gotten home safely? Thanks to you, I had a great time today."

465
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,960
Don't we need to reply?

466
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,840
If we don't reply, Wung will think we're ignoring him and then this will end here.

467
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,490
- We need to reply! 
 - We need to reply!

468
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:57,060
But how? Hysterius is controlling the village right now.

469
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,970
Only Love can stop him.

470
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:03,020
Love died.

471
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:09,450
There's sugar. Hysterius has no power if Yumi eats sweet things.

472
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,690
That's right. There's Hunger.

473
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,850
We can only trust in Hunger now.

474
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:26,310
 I'm hungry, let's eat that. 

475
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,450
 I said I'm hungry! 

476
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,630
Let's eat, let's eat, let's eat! Let's eat chocolate!

477
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,350
Oh no! How could this happen?

478
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,800
My appetite!

479
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:11,920
♫  Requiem*  ♫ 
 (Eternal Rest) 

480
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,470
♫  Done Eis Requiem  ♫

481
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,820
- What's going on? 
 - What's happening?

482
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,270
Hunger must have lost his appetite!

483
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,660
We're done for...

484
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,040
There's no answer.

485
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,090
She didn't reply...

486
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,800
Why?

487
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,000
Is she sleeping?

488
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,830
But she read it.

489
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:54,560
Hey Louis, if I went on a blind date and she's not responding to my text, what does it...

490
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,160
Are you sleeping?

491
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,450
Wu Gi. That's right, Wu Gi.

492
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:11,000
 Wu Gi, it's me. Are you sleeping? 

493
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,980
 Have a good date. I'm boarding my flight now. 

494
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,720
 I'll be on a business trip to America for 3 weeks. Hope it goes well! 

495
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,410
That's right.

496
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:39,060
 I went on a blind date and messaged her afterwards, but she isn't responding. 

497
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,750
 Am I being rejected after a blind date if she isn't responding? 

498
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:47,330
  If I went on a blind date and didn't really like the person, I don't think I'd respond back at all. 

499
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:51,300
 Think about whether you made any mistakes while you were on the date. 

500
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,430
Mistakes?

501
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,460
 Did you ask what time it is? It's Seoul. 

502
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,050
 I'm a gentleman. Canola oil. 

503
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,560
Didn't I tell you to do it in moderation?

504
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,680
Hey! Why are you guys doing this to me?!

505
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,000
It's because of your bad jokes! If it weren't for that, it would have been perfect!

506
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,220
What do you mean? My jokes were hilarious!

507
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,230
No.. I don't think that's it.

508
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:19,090
Yumi laughed so much at that, right?

509
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,040
 Is it bad if I don't shave before going out on a blind date? 

510
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,660
 My friend who set up the date told me to make sure to shave before I go. 

511
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,810
 Are men with beards not that attractive? 

512
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,430
What?

513
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,900
 It's absolutely gross. They look as if they don't shower. 

514
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,300
  Honestly, most women don't really like beards because it looks messy.    

515
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,190
 It's more about the face than the beard. It doesn't matter if you have a good-looking beard or not. 

516
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,870
 You should shave no matter what. 

517
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,210
What are you saying?

518
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,090
What? What's wrong?

519
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,330
What?

520
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:54,330
Hey. I found out some shocking facts while doing some research.

521
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:57,360
What is it? Huh? What?

522
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,800
I'm a little taken aback because it's so surprising

523
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,800
but do women hate beards?

524
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,470
Ah, you're stressing me out!

525
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,250
The comments say that women don't like beards.

526
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:15,270
Did you think that they liked them?

527
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,850
Don't women think it looks cool?

528
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:20,490
They probably think it looks gross.

529
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,240
I'm cold.

530
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,460
Beards are gross?

531
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,570
Did you get rejected on your blind date?

532
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,240
Oh no, you were rejected.

533
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,860
- You got rejected, right? 
 - Not yet.

534
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,830
What do you mean not yet?

535
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,620
- I sent a message, 
 - And?

536
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,130
and she read it but didn't respond yet.

537
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,610
You got rejected. That's what they call rejection, CEO.

538
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:54,940
She could have fallen asleep.

539
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,890
You said she read it and ignored you. Do you think she fell asleep one second after she read it?

540
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:02,310
Didn't I tell you to shave before you left?

541
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:07,860
Didn't I tell you that a good thing would happen to you if you listened to me?

542
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,320
I should have gone out on that blind date.

543
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,670
I mean.. you're seriously an idiot.

544
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,480
This means that the jerk who is responsible for ruining this date is...

545
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,910
I told you I told you!

546
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,920
I told you it wasn't me.

547
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,310
Everyone! Bring out Hair.

548
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,310
Is it really because of this?

549
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:45,760
So you're saying, the reason why Yumi hasn't responded is because of me?

550
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,430
How ridiculous.

551
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,540
You are the only suspect!

552
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:53,290
Get ready. I'm going to shave off all that hair today.

553
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,290
Wait wait!! You can't!

554
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,740
Do you know how long it took me to grow this?

555
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,490
A beard is a man's pride!

556
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,870
A man is a beard, and a beard is a man in itself.

557
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,110
It's not that easy to grow this out.

558
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:13,570
If you don't take care of it, you get pimples. And you have to groom it every day.

559
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,610
Then what's the point, if women think it's gross?

560
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,180
She didn't say that she didn't like my beard.

561
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,120
Did she say that your beard looked good?

562
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,950
- No. 
 - That means she didn't like it, punk.

563
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:31,710
If women don't mention it, that means they don't like it.

564
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:35,610
What women would say this when meet you first meet them, "Hello!"

565
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:38,710
"Oh wow! You look a bit gross."

566
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:42,320
Do you think there are women like that? There aren't!

567
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,510
What! Did you get a message?

568
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:00,770
 Do you need urgent cash? Instant cash up to $50,000. 

569
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,930
Shave your beard.

570
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,210
Wait, wait, wait! Hey!

571
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:14,310
Give me until... Give me until tomorrow morning!

572
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:16,190
What difference does it make from now until the morning?

573
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:20,800
If Yumi doesn't reply by the morning, then...

574
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,370
then I will accept my fate.

575
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,890
What time in the morning?

576
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,250
8...wait no! 9 a.m.! 9 a.m.!

577
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,550
I'll give you until 8 a.m.

578
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:33,760
You! Seriously!

579
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,150
 Yumi will wake up 

580
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:41,630
 at least by 7 am to go to work. 

581
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,190
 If she doesn't respond right after she wakes up, 

582
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,620
 then you should accept that you were rejected.

00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,520
The lights are back on!

600
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,270
Sugar is coming in. Yumi ate something sweet!

601
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:46,210
We have to do it right now! Before her sugar level goes down, hurry!

602
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:49,260
Yumi, respond!

603
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:19,230
 I'm sorry my reply is so late, I fell asleep last night. 

604
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,440
You take care of the remaining half.

605
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,710
Wait!

606
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,400
We got a reply from Yumi!

607
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,050
What?

608
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:53,790
You're right. She really did reply.

609
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:56,610
See! I told you it wasn't because of me!

610
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:01,310
My hair.. my precious hair.

611
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:04,880
Put it back on right now!!!

612
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,040
It's impossible to put it back on.

613
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,780
It's unfortunate,

614
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,310
No, no, no don't do it!

615
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:12,560
but just get rid of the rest.

616
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,010
- Hey! Hey! 
 - Grab him.

617
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:16,500
- Let's get rid of all of it. 
 - Don't cut there!

618
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,580
 Episode 8 
 Umbrella 

619
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,460
- You're here? 
 - Good morning.

620
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:36,070
- Did you two sleep here last night? 
 - Yes.

621
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:38,330
I told you guys to go home and sleep.

622
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:41,760
I'm going to go home and change my clothes.

623
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,250
Wait.

624
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,230
Something's different about you.

625
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:49,820
What?

626
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:52,700
Your beard. Where's your beard?

627
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,370
- I shaved it. 
 - Why?

628
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:57,420
It was getting annoying. I feel refreshed now that it's gone. I like it.

629
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,230
Weren't you growing it for a while? Why did you suddenly shave it?

630
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,790
- Just because. 
 - Just because?

631
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:05,950
You said a man's beard is his pride.

632
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,010
Did I say that?

633
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,640
I'm leaving.

634
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,620
He shaved his beard because of Kim Yumi.

635
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:21,160
- What? 
 - She didn't reply to his text, so he was feeling upset,

636
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:24,360
so I told him it was because of his beard, and he actually shaved it.

637
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,410
Dummy. Did he get rejected?

638
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,280
It's not a big deal to get rejected. Why did he shave the beard he's so proud of?

639
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,430
But she replied now.

640
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,230
I guess he really liked her.

641
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,600
 I also had a great time thanks to you. 

642
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,810
 I hope you have a good day at work today. 

643
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:07,350
 Oh! Of course. I hope you have a good day at work today too. 

644
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,770
 Oh, also, I... 

645
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,820
 shaved my beard. 

646
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,490
   

647
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,080
His beard?

648
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:29,120
"I shaved my beard." What does this mean?

649
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,830
That's so out of the blue. Whether he shaved his beard or not, why would he tell her about it?

650
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:35,240
Why did he shave it? I liked his beard.

651
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,430
Guys, maybe beard is slang for something?

652
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:43,050
- Slang? 
 - Maybe it means something bad.

653
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,580
I feel nervous.

654
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:50,010
It looks like Yumi's blood sugar dropped again.

655
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,980
What do we do? She only sent him a message.

656
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,620
- I can't see anything. I'm scared. 
 - Ah come on.

657
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:59,260
This won't do. I'll go outside and see what's going on out there.

658
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,220
Reason, let's go together.

659
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:05,080
Eonni Yumi!

660
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,050
Eonni! How did the blind date go?

661
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:12,510
It's amazing. Even just by looking at your pictures, you guys look so good together.

662
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,240
How did Oppa Wu Gi think of doing that?

663
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:20,940
How did it go? Tell me, I'm so curious.

664
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:30,960
- Oh no! 
 - It's stress mines! If we step on them they'll explode!

665
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,420
You're going to see him again, right? Did he ask to see you again?

666
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,460
Why isn't it coming down?

667
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,290
Did he ask to see you again?

668
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,760
I don't know.

669
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,660
How can you not know? I'm so curious.

670
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:46,970
I'm going to take the stairs, so take your time.

671
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,620
You're going to walk all the way up to the 7th floor?

672
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,610
Please wait!

673
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:00,670
Hello.

674
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:31,730
Eonni, you just got here? The elevator came right after you left.

675
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:35,550
Kim Yumi! I heard your blind date went really well yesterday.

676
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:37,060
Who said that?

677
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,430
Ruby did. Ruby said it's someone she knows.

678
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:41,210
Hey, I heard he's really hot.

679
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:42,720
He's super hot.

680
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,070
- What are you saying? 
 - Who's super hot?

681
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:47,710
The guy that Assistant Manager Kim went on a blind date with yesterday.

682
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:51,130
Oh, really? You mentioned you had to go somewhere yesterday. Did it go well?

683
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,720
That's not it–

684
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,330
Yes, it was, Manager. It's a guy that I know, and he's a great person.

685
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:59,250
Wow.

686
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:14,860
Ruby, stop talking! Stop making the situation worse!

687
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:18,400
She's doing this on purpose, right? To spread all these rumors about Yumi's blind date.

688
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,100
That idiot. Does she think she will win over Wu Gi by doing that?

689
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:27,000
Eonni, here are the documents for Dongkuk Steel.

690
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,400
All right.

691
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:32,430
Eonni, should we see if your names are compatible?

692
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:35,580
- See if what's compatible? 
 - You don't know about name compatibility?

693
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:39,950
Like this, you write both of your names.

694
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:45,450
Kim Yumi. Gu Wung.

695
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:50,090
"Kim" has 5 strokes, "Gu" has–

696
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:53,060
What are you doing?

697
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,180
Mi is also three.

698
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,480
This is amazing. How could this happen?

699
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,240
Even your names are a perfect match.

700
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:07,340
- You– 
 - Miss Ruby?

701
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,910
- Could you come here for a second? 
 - All right.

702
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:14,420
Eonni, this guy is fated for you. Even your names match!

703
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,660
If this continues, the whole village is going to disappear! We need to do something!

704
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:34,700
What can we do? We don't even know if Love is dead or alive.

705
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:41,310
I'm hungry, but I don't feel like eating.

706
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:45,750
I think I'm slowly dying of hunger.

707
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:50,070
We need sugar to have energy. We haven't eaten anything all day.

708
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:53,810
Isn't there anything else we can try? You know what will happen to Yumi if this continues!

709
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,590
That–

710
00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:02,140
 There is a deep valley in the human mind called the valley of the unconscious. 

711
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:07,860
 Hysterius lives alone there. 

712
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:11,350
It's almost done. Almost done.

713
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:16,220
 He collects stress and uses it to build weapons. 

714
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:21,010
 After he builds enough weapons, he enters the village and causes a riot. 

715
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:24,080
I'm going to blow everything up!

716
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:30,360
 If Hysterius takes over the village, this is what will happen. 

717
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:34,100
Yumi, here's a macaron. It's from Assistant Manager Yun.

718
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,970
You should eat it. I don't have an appetite.

719
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:38,750
 - She will lose all her desires.   
 - Are you sure?

720
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,220
You didn't eat lunch either.

721
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:45,850
Ah, are you on a diet because you're dating someone now?

722
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:51,210
Wow, Kim Yumi is turning down a macaron. Dating must be fun.

723
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:55,550
 She'll get angry at anything anyone says. 

724
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:11,000
 I told you to wait for me! 

725
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:23,850
 In the movie theater, her worst memories will be played on repeat. 

726
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,690
 We'll fall into a swamp of negative thoughts. And in the end... 

727
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,190
 Her mind will be left empty, 

728
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:37,990
 and even her body will start to suffer. 

729
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,960
What's wrong?

730
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,440
My head really hurts. Do you have headache medicine by any chance?

731
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,570
There's probably some in the break room. Should I go get it for you?

732
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,950
No, no, I'll go.

733
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:19,500
Why does my head hurt so much?

734
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:36,270
 Did you eat lunch? What are you doing after work today? 

735
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:45,430
Yumi, let's send a reply.

736
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:52,290
Yumi! We can't let Hysterius win!

737
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:55,000
That's right! Gu Wung didn't do anything wrong!

738
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,540
You had fun yesterday, Yumi! Let's meet him one more time, okay?

739
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:01,730
You won't get hurt every time you meet someone!

740
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:05,280
 You might regret it if you decide not to try! 

741
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:25,260
 I don't have anything special planned. 

742
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:29,730
 Then, would you like to have dinner together? 

743
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:32,370
 I'll go to your workplace. 

744
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,580
 What time do you get off work, Yumi? 

745
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:47,900
Oh, I'm sorry. Please wait!

746
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,710
What the hell?

747
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,600
Did her cell phone just break?

748
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:07,730
Why did it have to happen now?!

749
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:21,900
Nothing is going right today.

750
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:29,120
It's not just the screen that's damaged,

751
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:33,520
but even the LED display is broken. There are many parts inside that are damaged too.

752
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,950
It'll take a day to repair it.

753
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:37,820
- A day? 
 - Yes.

754
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:41,600
You won't be able to use your phone, will that be all right?

755
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,430
Yumi!

756
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,160
What about your cell phone?

757
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,500
They said it's going to take a day to fix it.

758
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:01,900
What are you going to do without a phone all day? It must be frustrating.

759
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,150
Not a big deal. It's not like I have anything urgent going on.

760
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:08,420
There's that guy, the handsome guy you had a blind date with.

761
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:09,880
What if he calls?

762
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:13,360
You should send him a message telling him that your phone is broken.

763
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,980
No. It's fine.

764
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,220
- I was thinking of not seeing him. 
 - Why not?

765
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,580
I don't know.

766
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:31,460
I just replied because he sent a text.

767
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:34,330
I'm not quite sure.

768
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:38,570
We said that we would meet. But we don't have a specific reason why we should meet.

769
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:41,000
But why? You said that he was a nice guy.

770
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,170
He is nice all right,

771
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:47,560
but he's not that great either.

772
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:51,000
And when isn't it like that?

773
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,020
At first, they seem like nice guys, but it always ends the same way.

774
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:58,500
Hey, but you don't know if it'll be like that this time.

775
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,770
No. It's fine.

776
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:06,720
I'm tired of having hope each time. It's just better not to start anything in the first place.

777
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,780
Even so—

778
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:13,310
Even my cell phone broke, so maybe it's a sign that I should stop here.

779
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:16,560
Now that I've decided not to meet him, I feel at ease.

780
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,980
It's raining.

781
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:27,030
You're right.

782
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,670
"Did you get home safely?"

783
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:35,090
"Thanks to you, I had a great time today."

784
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:37,230
Smiling eyes. "Oh! Of course."

785
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:39,030
"I hope you have a good day at work today too."

786
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:42,550
"Have a good day! Oh, also, I..."

787
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:44,180
"shaved my beard."

788
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:47,560
That's what you said and there was no reply?

789
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,200
You sent another message.

790
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,700
 Did you eat lunch? 

791
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,320
 What are you doing after work today? 

792
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,910
"I don't have anything special planned."

793
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,190
"Then, would you like to have dinner together?"

794
00:58:56,190 --> 00:59:00,180
"I'll go to your workplace. What time do you get off work, Yumi?"

795
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:06,010
You sent this at 2 p.m. and it's past 4 p.m. now, but she didn't reply, right?

796
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:09,150
It's over.

797
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,900
- Over? 
 - The conversation is over.

798
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:16,460
If you wanted to continue the conversation, you should have asked a question like. Did you get to work all right?

799
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:19,440
Or asked her a question, such as, "What did you enjoy yesterday?"

800
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,230
It has to be something specific.

801
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:25,160
And on top of that, there aren't any emoticons.

802
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,770
You're right. There aren't any.

803
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:29,940
- Are emoticons important? 
 - Of course they are!

804
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:33,460
If you look at the texts before the blind date, there were a lot of emoticons.

805
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,320
She's someone who uses emoticons often.

806
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:38,250
But here, there aren't any.

807
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:40,500
There is, there's Smiling eyes right here.

808
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,940
That's your Smiling eyes.

809
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:47,380
No tildes, no exclamation marks, and no emoticons.

810
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:50,360
Here it says have a good day.

811
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,690
This period means that she wants to end the conversation.

812
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:57,100
But you didn't catch on and sent another message.

813
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:01,400
And talking about the beard is burdensome.

814
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,630
When you asked what she was doing in the evening, she probably already guessed that you were dangerous.

815
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:10,170
That's why she didn't answer. She already caught on to you.

816
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:14,770
That you're the style that will stick to someone forever if she keeps being nice.

817
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:19,960
Sae Yi, you're good at explaining. I'm understanding everything so easily.

818
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,140
It's really clear and accurate.

819
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:24,250
You said it's accurate?

820
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,910
I think I have a general understanding of who Yumi is.

821
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:31,800
She's a gentle, nice, and innocent person, right?

822
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,020
Of course! Some women are like that.

823
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:37,700
They are so nice that they can't turn people down easily.

824
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:42,940
Taking a long time to respond or not responding at all is her way of turning you down.

825
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,560
It was like that yesterday too, but in the end, she replied.

826
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:48,410
The fact that she responded in the end means that she sent the message reluctantly.

827
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:54,010
If you do something one more time, it makes Gu Wung look like what kind of guy?

828
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:55,740
A clingy guy.

829
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:56,790
Clingy?

830
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:59,990
Do you know what you need to do now?

831
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:04,600
Blind dating usually goes like that. Cheer up!

832
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,720
You telling me to cheer up is making me feel worse, for some reason.

833
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:13,070
It's raining today, should we go eat pajeon*? 
  (*Korean pancakes, many eat it during rainy days) 

834
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:15,000
- I'm buying. 
 - Let's go.

835
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,680
Let's go.

836
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,630
Pajeon! Oh yeah! Pajeon!

837
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:21,930
​♫ Pajeon, I like pajeon ♫

838
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:24,570
​♫ I like pajeon ♫

839
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:26,070
Let's also drink dongdongju*. 
 (*T/N: Traditional rice liquor)

840
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:28,120
Sure! Just one bottle.

841
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,380
Oh yeah! Just one bottle.

842
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:33,750
Why isn't he coming?

843
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:38,170
Wung, what are you doing?

844
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:40,000
We're leaving.

845
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,080
But

846
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:46,100
You know that I do the opposite of what I'm told to do.

847
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,340
What are you talking about?

848
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,790
I'm kind of dense.

849
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:52,370
Yeah. You're kind of dense.

850
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:54,870
But that's just me.

851
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:57,610
I've always been like this.

852
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:59,500
Early leave?

853
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:05,250
Yes. I think I'll have to go to the hospital.

854
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:07,970
All right. Hurry up and go get some rest.

855
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:10,300
I'm sorry.

856
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:18,260
Are you feeling really sick?

857
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:21,940
Your face is turning red. Do you have a fever?

858
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:23,410
I guess so.

859
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:26,440
Hold on. Should I call you a taxi?

860
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,840
No. I'm all right.

861
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,930
Yumi, go get some rest.

862
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:57,190
 Daehan Noodles 

863
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:11,980
 Daehan Noodles 

864
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:18,020
My umbrella.

865
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:29,350
Eonni Yumi.

866
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,440
- Are you going home? 
 - Yes.

867
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:41,380
You said you left your phone for repair. What will you do if Gu Wung sends you a message?

868
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:44,760
Use my phone. I have his number stored in it.

869
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,830
I'll take care of it.

870
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:50,700
If you wait too long, he'll get over you.

871
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:51,680
It's my choice.

872
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,790
I'm telling you that's bad manners.

873
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:58,900
Are you the one dating? Why are you so interested in my business?

874
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,310
I'm trying to help you.

875
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:04,740
Should I call him for you and tell him that you're sick?

876
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,970
Stop it.

877
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:09,990
He'll come immediately if I tell him you're sick.

878
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:13,560
I asked you to stop. I'm asking you to don't do anything!

879
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:19,200
I'm asking you to stop meddling in my personal life.

880
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,880
Are you angry?

881
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:29,010
I really had good intentions because I thought you two suited each other.

882
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:32,240
I thought it was like a godsend that Wu Gi introduced you to him.

883
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,380
- A godsend? 
 - Yes

884
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,180
It was probably like a godsend for you.

885
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:51,180
That's right. All of the things we just put up with. All of the things that I hated seeing.

886
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,640
Let's blow it all up Yumi!

887
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:57,200
Let's wipe them out completely.

888
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:03,670
Don't you think?

889
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,960
- I was just trying to help you. 
 - Why would you help me?

890
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,530
Because I was worried about you going home alone when you're sick.

891
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:15,480
If I call him, he'll come to pick you up.

892
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,590
I don't need your help.

893
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:18,590
You don't have anyone at home. Alone—

894
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:20,700
It doesn't matter.

895
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:24,750
When have I not been alone?

896
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:29,280
Going to the hospital or back home alone.

897
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,300
What's wrong with that?

 Yumi's Cells

01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,790
 Excuse me! Please help her, she's an emergency patient. 

921
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:35,330
 Your boyfriend left this. 

922
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:36,640
My boyfriend?

923
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,840
 Hi, Yumi's love cell. 

924
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,960
 Did you go find the woman who didn't respond to your messages? 

925
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,270
 I just followed the algorithm. 

926
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:46,400
 He's completely smitten with Kim Yumi. 

927
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,460
They must be having a good time.

928
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:49,900
I have to go. You two eat.

929
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,340
 This is also a bit... 

930
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:53,760
It's a good story.

931
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,300
But I want to go right now.
