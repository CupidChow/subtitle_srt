00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,510
 Yumi 

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:13,960


3
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,360
 Yumi's Cells

 Episode 09 
 Frog 

5
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,600
The lights came on!

6
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,720
- Sensitivity, are you all right? 
 - I'm all right.

7
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,670
What is this?

8
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,080
Isn't this snow?

9
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,010
- What is this? 
 - Why is it suddenly snowing?

10
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,030
Wow, it is sweet.

11
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,790
It is sweet!

12
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,250
- It's sweet! 
 - I'm mad!

13
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,990
Is it sugar snow? How is this happening?

14
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,990
Yumi didn't eat anything, though.

15
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,620
That's not it, Reason.

16
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,480
Then?

17
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,890
Why are you standing in the rain?

18
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,600
You'll catch a cold like that.

19
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,390
 There are so many other sweet things in the world besides sugar. 

20
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,870
Excuse me, hello.

21
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,590
Excuse me, Oppa Wung.

22
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,360
Hello, I'm Ruby.

23
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,310
Oh, yes.

24
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,110
Did you come to see Eonni? I was really surprised.

25
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,510
- Let's talk later. 
 - Ah, all right.

26
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,720
- Where are you going? 
 - Home.

27
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,660
Let's go. I will take you home.

28
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,960
There's something different about him from the last time I saw him. Why does he look so neat?

29
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,850
Taxi!

30
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,530
Because of the rain, there seems to be no available taxi. I can't even request one.

31
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,820
But...

32
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,080
Why did you come here? 
 - Huh?

33
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,020
Why did you come here at so late in the day?

34
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,750
Oh ...

35
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,460
I had something to do nearby.

36
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,950
Something to do?

37
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,420
Well ...

38
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,610
To be honest ... I was curious,

39
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,330
since you didn't reply.

40
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,990
I was curious why you didn't reply.

41
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,690
My phone was broken, so it is at the repair shop.

42
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,520
Really?

43
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,260
Ah, so that's what happened!

44
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,680
I thought...

45
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,640
I got rejected.

46
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,630
It has been a while since sugar snow came down like this. right?

47
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,710
True, I think it's been years since I last saw it.

48
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,690
That's right.

49
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,520
Who are you?

50
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,650
Gatekeeper cells, hello! I came from Wung's village.

51
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,750
Wung's cell? But why did you show up here?

52
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,610
I want to visit Yumi's village. What is the password?

53
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:28,560
What?! Do you think a man can easily get into Yumi's heart? Do you?!

54
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,260
This door has a password that is twenty-eight digits.

55
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:37,350
Twenty eight? Why is it so long? Wung's village password is only four digits.

56
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:42,370
If you know now, leave. For the past three years, nobody has been able to get through this door.

57
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,930
- Yumi is not an easy woman. 
 - That's right.

58
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,570
Can you just let me in? The mood is great right now.

59
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,240
- Get out! 
 - Why, I ought to...!

60
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,680
  Searching for an available taxi. 

61
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,860
Miss Yumi, the requests keep getting canceled. Should we go somewhere nearby--

62
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,110
Miss Yumi?

63
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,990
Miss Yumi?

64
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,650
 It isn't rain. It is sweat. 

65
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,310
 Her temperature seems to be around 38 degrees Celsius. 

66
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,630
It is an emergency! It is an emergency! Everyone focus

67
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,380
The goal from now on is to make sure we take Yumi to the hospital safely!

68
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,030
We don't have much time! Run the algorithm!

69
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,330
 Loading 

70
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,820
 We will start running Wung's algorithm. 

71
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,450
  Start 

72
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,930
 Is there a hospital nearby? 

73
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,820
 Yes or No 

74
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,600
Miss Yumi, wait a sec.

75
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,650
 Is there a hospital nearby? Yes or No. 

76
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,920
 Is there a hospital nearby?   

77
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,700
 YES 

78
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,300
 Is it a distance where you can run and carry her there?
 YES  

79
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,660
 Are you in a relationship where you can carry this princess? 

80
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,670
 NO 

81
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,690
 Is this the time to nitpick over that?  
 NO

82
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,500
It isn't.

83
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,490
 Use skills to carry the princess. 

84
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:52,220
  Complete 100% 
 Use skills to carry the princess. 

85
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,260
 Can you carry the umbrella? 

86
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,740
 NO 

87
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,630
 Forget about it 

88
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,020
Starting now, all the carbohydrates stored in the body will be released.

89
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,790
 Wung Sprint Mode. Start. 

90
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,770
 Start 
 Sprint mode

Wait! Please take a look at her she's an emergency patient!

101
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,870
She's an emergency patient. Hurry!

107
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,160
Guardian.

108
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,430
You are the guardian, right?

109
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,660
  Are you Kim Yumi's guardian? 
 NO  

110
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,570
 Although you are not the guardian, do you want to be her guardian? 

111
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,330
 YES  

112
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,630
Yes, I am the guardian.

113
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,400
Her fever went down, so she just needs to get some IV fluids.

114
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,490
All right, thank you.

115
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,640
But since the patient's clothes are all wet, I think it would be good to prepare a change of clothes.

116
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,060
It takes about an hour to get all the IV fluids.

117
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,430
All right, thank you.

118
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,960
 The situation is over. Mission clear. 

119
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,540
 Starting now begins self-admiring mode. 

120
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,040
 Self-admiring mode 

121
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,010
- Hello? 
  - Where are you?  
    

122
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:50,550
Why aren't you coming? We're eating pajeon*. Where are you? 
  (Savoury Korean pancake with green onions) 

123
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,610
- The hospital? 
 - The hospital?

124
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,380
Why are you at the hospital?

125
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,210
Miss Yumi? Why?

126
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,190
You punk, I wondered where you went. You went to her office?

127
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,570
If I hadn't gone, it could have been a disaster.

128
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,900
She had a high fever and she fainted.

129
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,080
 How were you able to take an unconscious person to the hospital? 

130
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,640
I carried her and ran. Of course, it definitely wasn't easy. 
    

131
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,390
I ran while holding her for about ten minutes.

132
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:23,830
You ran carrying her for ten minutes? You really have strong arms.

133
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,080
They're still numb.

134
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,350
Miss Yumi is light. She's light as a feather. I wonder why my arms are numb.

135
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,180
- Give it to me. 
 - You just wait! Hold on.

136
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,820
Say something.

137
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,360
Hello. You went after a woman who didn't reply to your message?

138
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,080
No, it turned out she broke her phone and left it to be repaired.

139
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,740
What is she supposed to say to someone who came to find her? It was an excuse.

140
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,950
An excuse?

141
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,820
You idiot.

142
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,920
- Well, so what? She's ill. 
 - You're hopeless.

143
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,720
- I just followed my algorithm. 
 - What?

144
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,250
According to my algorithm, this was the right choice.

145
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:05,270
You two have dinner on your own. I'm going to take miss Yumi home when she wakes up.

146
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,230
See you tomorrow.

147
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,650
Does he not have a brain? Why would he go there?

148
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,950
He's completely smitten with her.

149
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,440
He's just completely smitten with Kim Yumi.

150
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,200
It would look good on her.

151
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,260
Are you awake?

152
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,800
Your boyfriend left this for you.

153
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,250
My boyfriend?

154
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:06,920
Your boyfriend went through a lot of trouble, getting soaked in the rain.

155
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,810
I was afraid he might catch a cold, but he went out to buy some clothes.

156
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,600
Your old clothes got all wet, so you should change into this.

157
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,220
- Stay put for a moment. 
 - All right.

158
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,480
It's a dress.

159
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,790
It's cute.

160
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,920
Should we have just let in Wung's cell?

161
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,590
But the password is so long.

162
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,340
True, true. Yumi's heart isn't easy to reach.

163
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,330
- It's not easy. It's not easy. 
 - Of course not.

164
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,050
Hey! Who are you?!

165
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,750
It's a frog. What should we do?

166
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:12,310
Should we let it in? Cute things can enter without a password.

167
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,880
That is true, but ... hold on.

168
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,420
The things that Yumi thinks are cute are puppies,

169
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,630
cats, chicks,

170
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:29,370
panda bears, and ... Oh! Frogs aren't on the list.

171
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,960
So what? Let's just open the doors, it looks cute anyway.

172
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,250
- Should we? 
 - Ribbit.

173
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,480
All right, why not.

174
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,920
 On a rainy day, a frog 

175
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,650
 made its way into Yumi's heart. 

176
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,120
- Who are you? 
 - Ribbit.

177
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,690
 The frog that entered Yumi's heart like that, saved us cells. 

178
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,930
 It successfully sutured Hunger's taste buds back on. 

179
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,400
 He cleaned the village that had become polluted from stress, 

180
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,270
 and built a fence so Hysterius couldn't come back. 

181
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,750
Love, look! Someone's coming!

182
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,920
 He even found Love and Inner Feelings who had been stranded on a deserted island. 

183
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,920
 The frog did all of this by himself. 

184
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,430
Although we just met, thank you so much, Frog.

185
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,990
- Love, I'm actually not a frog. 
 - What?

186
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,720
I played a small trick so I could enter Yumi's heart.

187
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,650
The password to Yumi's heart is too hard, you see.

188
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,430
Then, who are you?

189
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,230
Hi, Yumi's Love cell.

190
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,530
- Who are you? 
- I am Wung's love cell!

191
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,170
- What? 
 - What?

192
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,570
- It's cute. 
  - Wung's love cell disguised himself as a frog 

193
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,090
 and entered Yumi's heart. 

194
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,800
Oh! You're up.

195
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,460
How are you feeling?

196
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,760
 Even Yumi didn't know 

197
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,800
 when he came into her heart. 

198
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,460
Are you still feeling unwell?

199
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,270
No. I'm fine.

200
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,990
But ... where did you buy this?

201
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,560
Somewhere nearby. I chose it as best as I could because I didn't know your size.

202
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
You don't like it?

203
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,590
I do like it.

204
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,970
You do?

205
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,490
Yes. I like it.

206
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,560
It reminded me of the frog festival.

207
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,570
Exactly, it's cute.

208
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,200
You wearing that is cuter.

209
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,230
You're really good at flattery.

210
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,860
It's not flattery. I told you I can't lie.

211
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,710
I'll go pay the bill.

212
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,460
Do you want to have dinner with me?

213
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,800
You didn't eat yet, right?

214
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,760
Let me repay you. I'll buy you something good.

215
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,670
Repay?

216
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,430
Yes, because I'm grateful.

217
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,340
There's nothing to be grateful for. Anyone would've done what I did—

218
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,060
To tell the truth, I'm trying to ask you out on a second date.

219
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,440
Eat dinner with me.

220
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,550
Oh.

221
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,100
Are you rejecting a second date?

222
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,820
No, not at all. It's just that it's so late, so I think most places are closed.

223
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,070
They'll still be open until 9 pm.

224
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,170
9 pm? What time is it now?

225
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:45,920
What time is it? It's Seoul*. 
  (*T/N: Seoul the city sounds the same as Seoul time.) 

226
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,790
I'm sorry.

227
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm a gentleman*.

228
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,850
  *(This sounds the same as "I am Sim Sa Im Dang," a Korean artist from the Joseon Dynasty. She is on Korea's 50,000 

229
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,070
That was good.

230
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:21,060
 Episode 10 
 Bulletin Board 

231
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,910
 When Yumi is asleep, in the middle of the night, 

232
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,320
 the Dream Theater starts its late-night screening. 

233
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,760
Wow, what's going to happen today?

234
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,190
 It reminded me of the frog festival. 

235
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,210
 Exactly, it's cute. 

236
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,300
 You wearing that is cuter. 

237
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,580
Must be nice.

238
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,280
 Today's screening is a romantic comedy production. 

239
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,950
It's over there.

240
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:05,450
- That house? 
 - Yes, I live on the fourth floor there.

241
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:12,320
Thank you for today and also for taking me home.

242
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,880
- Get some rest and make sure to take your medicine. 
 - All right.

243
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,560
I'll go now.

244
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,870
Text me when you get home.

245
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,920
Text you?

246
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,930
Because it is very late now.

247
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,700
But it will take more than thirty minutes.

248
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,520
It's all right.

249
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,190
But you don't have your cellphone.

250
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,350
Oh, right.

251
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,210
Good night.

252
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:46,040
I have my laptop. I can use Messenger on it.

253
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,120
- Are you serious? 
 - Yes.

254
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,760
Is it all right for me to wake you up?

255
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,140
I'm telling you that it's fine.

256
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,450
I'm not perceptive, so if you tell me to do it I really will do it.

257
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,120
Please do.

258
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,130
Go inside now.

259
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,710
 To be continued 

260
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,750
 Dream Theatre 

261
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,110
Wow! Every scene was good today.

262
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:27,560
 After the late-night screening is over and all the cells are asleep, 

263
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,210
 there is a cell that starts working only then. 

264
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,420
 When the cells post their thoughts on the bulletin board throughout the day, 

265
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:42,930
 - Ruby is so annoying! - Wound Documenter 
 - There's a lot of expenses lately. - Stingy  

266
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,820
 We need more masks. - Anxiety cell 

267
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,020
 Those thoughts have an impact on Yumi's life the next day. 

268
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,180
 What exactly is love? - Sensitivity cell 

269
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,830
 The Bulletin Board cell throws away the useless stories. 

270
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,850
 The dongaseu* restaurant we ate at today was the best! - Hunger 
 *(Pork cutlet)  

271
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,850
 Wung lives in Jeongbalsan. - Reason 

272
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,770
 And he moves the stories that she has to remember to the top of the bulletin board. 

273
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,480
Huh? What is this?

274
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,650
 Sometimes he finds old thoughts that he doesn't even know when they were written. 

275
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,660
Since when has this been here?

276
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:22,590
This is anonymous too. If these are left on here, Yumi gets stressed.

277
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,790
Chae Wu Gi is your destiny?

278
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:28,700
Destiny does not exist. It's all a choice.

 You got home home late. 

284
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,990
 It's because I couldn't get a taxi. Didn't you fall asleep yet?

 Everyone has their own bulletin board. Of course, Wung does too. 

306

 Yumi is cute.

 Yumi likes dongaseu.

 Kim Yumi looks cute in short hair. 

309

 The hoodie dress looks good on Yumi.

 Yumi's house is on the fourth floor.

She is Gu Wung's type.

319
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,060
Hello. Did you just get home?

320
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,190
Where are you? Why aren't you here? Only your bags are there.

321
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,270
 We're still at that pajeon restaurant. 

322
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,490
You guys are still eating?

323
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,840
 What happened? 

324
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,220
- What? 
 - You said Miss Yumi was sick.

325
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,430
- Is she all right? 
 - Yes, she got better.

326
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,470
That's good. And?

327
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,700
And, what?

328
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,090
And, did you ask her to meet you again?

329
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:47,930
Yes. It wasn't an excuse that her cellphone was broken.

330
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,120
She probably felt sorry and agreed to go on a second date.

331
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,290
No, she was the one to ask me to go on a second date.

332
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,620
- No way. 
 - I'm serious.

333
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,930
Oh! Gu Wung is finally dating?

334
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,790
- Congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

335
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,590
 I was going to call you anyway. Come and take Louis back home. 

336
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,990
- Why? 
 - He's totally knocked out.

337
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,480
 Wake him up. 

338
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,850
He won't wake up, no matter what I do.

339
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,170
All right.

340
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,840
Welcome.

341
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,060
You're here?

342
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,360
Did you drink a lot?

343
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,220
A little?

344
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,080
- Why? 
 - Since you got a girlfriend.

345
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,760
Louis, let's go. Get up

346
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,390
Sit down.

347
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,260
We should go. It is past midnight.

348
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,900
There is still some of this left. It would be a waste. Let's go after we finish it.

349
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,330
Thank you.

350
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,240
Ma'am, please give us another pajeon.

351
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,240
All right.

352
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,610
- We are going to leave soon, though. 
 - You like the pajeon from here.

353
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,480
I'm buying, so don't worry and drink.

354
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,180
Are you happy now that you're dating?

355
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,780
I've only met her twice until now.

356
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:31,760
That's why it is good. What a thrilling second meeting.

357
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,960
It was worth shaving off the beard you'd been growing for three years.

358
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,140
- I suddenly thought of that. 
 - What?

359
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:45,310
Sitting here with Louis is sleeping and while were drinking  dongdongju*, 
  (Traditional rice liquor) 

360
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,390
doesn't make you think of the past?

361
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,070
That dongdongju place in Hapjeong-dong.

362
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,800
You remember the dongdongju place

363
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,710
where we used to go to often, right?

364
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,010
 Danger detected! Danger detected! 

365
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,830
 Danger sensed! Sae Yi is trying to talk about the past. 

366
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:10,760
- No, when Sae Yi drinks and talks about the past, there's always a hidden motive. 
 - That's right!

367
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,870
It is dangerous. From now on Wung will be in defense mode.

368
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,440
Understood.

369
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,370
 Wung is switching to defense mode. 

370
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,830
 Changing to bear mode. 

371
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,340
 Starting now, Wung will be a bear. 

372
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,480
 Someone who doesn't understand what you're saying and has no perception. 

373
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,330
 He will be dull and won't be able to remember the past. 

374
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,220
Okay, this is good!

375
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,230
Back at that dongdongju place, when I was really drunk,

376
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,610
there was a time you came to pick me up. You remember, right?

377
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:52,280
- I did? 
 - You know, the day it was snowing a lot!

378
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,770
It snowed?

379
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,350
You came to pick me up and saw that I was drunk, so you got really angry.

380
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:01,900
Why were you so angry back then?

381
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,130
When?

382
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,760
When you were working at a company.

383
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,020
- Company? 
 - When you were living in Hapjeong-dong, there was a dongdongju place nearby. You don't remember?

384
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,520
Dongdongju place in Hapjeong-dong?

385
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,340
Where is that?

386
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,240
Nevermind. Forget about it.

387
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,430
 Defense successful. 

388
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,350
  You used to like me, right? 

389
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,750
That's right!

390
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:38,760
The cold wind keeps coming in. Is it all right there?

391
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,720
 The second attack is about to start. 

392
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,160
 Sae Yi's ulterior motive: I want to sit next to you. 

393
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,080
Should I move over there? It is cold.

394
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,560
Okay.

395
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,330
You should have told me sooner.

396
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,500
I was really hot, this works out.

397
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,660
- I wasn't asking you to change seats... 
 - Huh?

398
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,350
Nevermind.

399
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,920
 Defense successful. 

400
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:16,110
- Please enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

401
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,970
It looks good.

402
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,790
Aren't you going to eat?

403
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,020
I'm full.

404
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,060
This is a lot.

405
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,820
Wung...

406
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,520
 The third attack is about to start. 

407
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,970
 Sae Yi's ulterior motive: Saying the truth while drunk  

408
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,530
Should I tell you a secret?

409
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,120
- No. 
 - Why not?

410
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,160
It is a secret, so why would you tell? You don't have to tell me.

411
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:46,600
You know that I had a crush on someone when I was in college, right?

412
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:50,910
Do you know who that guy was?

413
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,940
- Seonbae Jin Su? 
 - What?

414
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,850
- Seonbae Jin Su. 
 - No, I really didn't like him.

415
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,690
- It is right! It was Seonbae Jin Su. 
 - I told you it wasn't!

416
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:02,560
I had such a hard time because there were rumors that I liked him.

417
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,810
Everyone knows that it was Seonbae Jin Su.

418
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:07,050
It isn't! Who started that rumor?

419
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,900
I did.

420
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,870
I'm right! It was Jin Su. It is a truth that everyone knows–

421
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,360
That's right.

422
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,830
- Louis is awake. Louis, let's go. 
 - It's a feast.

423
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,730
- It's smells good. 
 - Get up. 
 - Hi Wung.

424
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,520
But there's still some pajeon left.

425
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,720
- Ma'am, can you please wrap this up for me? 
 - All right.

426
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,000
- Wrap it up please. 
 - I'm full. Let's go.

427
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,650
Let's go.

428
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:30,210
Hey, bring this with you.

429
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:33,440
- Thank you. 
 - Goodbye.

430
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,550
 Defense successful. 

431
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:48,330
It is so hard to grab a taxi today.

432
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,540
It's chilly now that it's the evening.

433
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,590
 - The fourth attack is about to start.  
 - Again?!

434
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,120
 Sae Yi's ulterior motive: 

435
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,940
 Physical contact  

436
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,900
It's cold, right?

437
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,320
- Is it that cold? 
 - Yes.

438
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,230
Let's link arms, since it's cold.

439
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:26,230
Try this. You will be less cold.

440
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,640
 Defense successful. 

441
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,810
Don't stay up all night and go home. See you tomorrow.

442
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,550
You are not going to the office?

443
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:51,210
I'm tired. I want to go home. Good luck!

444
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:06,140
 Mission clear. Turning off bear mode. 

445
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,390
 Everyone has a bulletin board in their hearts. 

446
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,530
 The same goes for Sae Yi. 

447
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,490
 Become the best Art Director! Let's be a legend in the game world!  

448
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:54,100
 I can do it! We are the eagle trio! 

449
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,390
 I'm never going to get married! 

450
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:07,380
 But if someday I get married ...  

451
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,900
  I am never going to get married!    

452
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,910
  But if someday I do get married, it will probably be to Gu Wung. 

453
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:28,810
  Episode 11 
 Naughty versus Naughtysaurus 

454
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,230
It is 9 o'clock?

455
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,740
Crazy! Why did the alarm go off at 9 o'clock? What do I do?

456
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:54,100
 Yumi, today is Saturday. 

457
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,430
Ah...That's right, today is Saturday.

458
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:02,760
 Yumi, today is the day of your date with Wung. 

459
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,670
Yes, it is today.

460
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:18,570
Sleeping again? Are you all sleeping?

461
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:23,990
Fashion, the date is at 12 p.m. We can sleep more.

462
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:27,980
Are we not going to shop? I don't even remember the last time I did some shopping!

463
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,060
Do you want to meet Wung in the same old clothes?

464
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:34,170
Wung says Yumi looks cute no matter what she wears.

465
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:37,540
It might be cute the first couple of times, but for how long do you think that's going to work?

466
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,260
Forget it.

467
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,130
We need new clothes!

468
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,750
Yumi, wake up! We need to buy new clothes!

469
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:59,470
God, I am earnestly praying. Please wake up Yumi!

470
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:04,060
Please allow Yumi to go shopping!

471
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:13,710
Your prayer has awakened me, Fashion.

472
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,550
God! You have come! Spending God!

473
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:24,620
I will sing you a song because you are earnest.

474
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,230
A song?

475
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:29,730
♪ Do Re Mi– Do Re Mi Fa— ♪

476
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:34,340
♪ Pa Pa Pa, words that ends in Pa— ♪

477
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:41,070
♪ Onions, spring onions, chives, and leeks, I want to buy these ♪ 
  (all those end with "-pa" in Korean) 

478
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,840
Wow!

479
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,430
Repeat the song with me.

480
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:52,200
And Yumi will wake up.

481
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:58,210
♪ Pa Pa Pa, words that ends in Pa— ♪

482
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:04,050
♪ Onions, spring onions, chives, and leeks, I want to buy these ♪

483
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:10,310
♪ Onions, spring onions, chives, and leeks, I want to buy these ♪

484
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:16,850
♪ Onions, spring onions, chives, and leeks, I want to buy these ♪

485
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,750
That's right! Is it...

486
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,270
Did the sale not end yet?

487
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,770
It looks so good on you.

488
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,150
You found the perfect one right away.

489
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:38,350
I had my eye on it from before. I will get this.

490
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,460
Of course. You can bring it out when you change.

491
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,910
I'll just wear it out. Can you take the tag off?

492
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,570
Will you do that? It's perfect for today's weather.

493
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,360
- One moment, please. 
 - All right.

494
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,100
Thank you.

495
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,050
These are the clothes you wore, here.

496
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:00,900
Do you know if there are any lockers nearby? I don't want to carry this around.

497
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,430
Should we hold onto it for you?

498
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,040
Could you?

499
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,000
Yes, we can.

500
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,240
- Please write down your contact information here. 
 - All right.

501
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,550
Thank you.

502
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,100
 Gu Wung 

503
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,640
Hello?

504
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,090
Of course, I'm up. I'm already out.

505
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,910
Really? You stayed up all night?

506
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,860
Then I'll go somewhere close to your apartment.

507
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,560
I'm near there right now.

508
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,500
It's all right. I'll be drinking coffee.

509
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,320
Yes.

510
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:14,190
 I'm heading down now. Where are you? 

511
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,700
 I'll go to you. It'll take me less than five minutes. 

512
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,560
 It's perfect. Glad you bought it, right? 

513
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,700
 Yumi, undo two buttons. 

514
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:50,280
 So that your collarbone shows. That's your attractive point. 

515
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,670
Who is that?

516
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:02,030
Yumi's collarbone is sexy.

517
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,240
Naughty, you...!

518
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,570
Let's undo them.

519
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,240
 Yes. Just like that, Yumi. 

520
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,920
Don't give her useless advice. What do you know about fashion?

521
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,730
You don't even wear pants!

522
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,790
Stop it!

523
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:35,310
Fashion isn't important. When are they going to kiss?

524
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,380
- He said "kiss"! 
 - How could he say that!

525
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,940
- I'm so excited! 
 - Awesome!

526
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,270
Naughty, what are you doing? Don't provoke the others!

527
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,060
It's about time now.

528
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:49,320
We have to kiss today.

529
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:54,150
Stop getting so excited! They've only met a couple of times.

530
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,160
A kiss isn't a coupon. We don't need to fill out stamps.

531
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,390
You just do it if you feel like it!

532
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,240
- He's right. 
 - That's true.

533
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,290
Who's right?

534
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:08,020
- Yumi has waited long enough. I've waited long enough. 
 - That's right. 
 - He's right!

535
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:12,750
You can undo three buttons, Yumi! Undo them!

536
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,890
No!

537
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,690
It's not time for you to step in yet!

538
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:17,210
Come here.

539
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,480
Undo other things too!

540
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,320
 What just happened? 

541
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,000
 Oh no! No wonder I was nervous that we might spill the coffee. 

542
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,740
 This was so expensive! 

543
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,690
What happened?

544
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,350
Did you fall?

545
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:04,090
I spilled my coffee.

546
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,160
You spilled a lot.

547
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,670
So why would you call the Spending god? You're so dead!

548
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,420
Calm down, Stingy!

549
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,480
It'll be fine if we wash it right away.

550
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,340
She needs to change to continue their date.

551
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,630
There are the clothes she left behind at the store earlier.

552
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,580
You're right!

553
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,570
What should we do?

554
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:30,370
It's all right. Actually, at the clothing store—

555
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:32,350
Let's go to my place.

556
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,110
What?

557
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,980
He wants to go to his place? Let go of me!

558
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,510
Naughty, stay still!

559
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,070
If you come to my place and wash this immediately...

560
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:45,410
Your place?

561
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,810
Yes, my place.

562
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,680
Going to his place is a bit too much.

563
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,800
She can change at the clothing store and leave the dress at a dry cleaner.

564
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,140
It's a good thing we have another set of clothes.

565
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,610
Let's go to his place!

566
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:04,450
Let's go to Wung's place! It's an opportunity!

567
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,400
What opportunity?

568
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,720
Kiss!

569
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,660
It's right there.

570
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,450
But, at the clothing store...

571
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:23,540
 Yumi, let's go to Wung's place. 

572
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,840
The clothing store?

573
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,430
- What? 
 - What?

574
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:30,500
What do you mean?

575
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,130
Come in.

576
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,590
- Wait here. 
 - All right.

577
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,690
It's clean.

578
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:01,010
How is it so clean?

579
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:09,730
 Space Rabbit 

580
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:16,900
I don't have any size small clothes, but I think this is the smallest I own.

581
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,970
You should change so you can wash that dress right away.

582
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:53,450
 Oh, yeah! This is where Wung showers! 

583
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,870
 Would you like some coffee? 

584
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:59,500
Yes! That sounds great!

585
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:06,330
 He must have showered recently. The scent is still lingering. 

586
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,500
 The scent of sexy muskiness. 

587
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,510
 I love it. 

588
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:21,570
I like Wung because he's sexy.

589
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:50,760
 Yumi, what are you thinking about? 

590
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,830
%#*&amp;^#%!

591
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:04,570
Somebody drag him away before Yumi gets weird!

592
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:05,680
Let go of me!

593
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,230
- Sorry, guys! 
 - The tree, @!#$, the tree!

594
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:11,190
You @*$^^$%^#!

595
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,270
Guys, Wung wasn't thinking of this.

596
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:18,190
He invited her over with innocent intentions, so let's not get excited!

597
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:20,770
Yes, let's not get excited.

598
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:25,560
The clothes are too big, right?

599
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,380
Yes, a bit.

600
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,670
That was the smallest size I had.

601
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,430
No! No!

602
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,830
Naughtysaurus, calm down.

603
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,830
Calm down.

604
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,270
Yumi is wearing my clothes!

605
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:06,800
Her collarbones are so sexy.

606
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,770
Everyone grab him!

607
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:11,320
- Come together. 
 - All right. All right.

608
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,470
Grab him! Grab him!

609
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,950
It is very big.

610
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,020
It is.

611
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,730
But that's the smallest that I have.

612
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:35,170
But you're still cute.

613
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,690
Am I cute again? I guess I am the embodiment of cuteness.

614
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,500
Give it to me.

615
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:58,220
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

616
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:01,050
You should act like a gentleman, okay?

617
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:04,770
You did well till now. Good job.

618
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,780
You can't mess up here.

619
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:11,180
Yumi will be disgusted to find you–

620
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,960
Calm down, okay?

621
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,500
Isn't that fabric softener?

622
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,080
What?

623
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,180
That's fabric softener!

624
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,960
They're going to kiss! Kiss!

625
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,480
Stay still!

626
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:21,130
 Danger detected! Danger detected! 

627
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:24,440
 Entering into the carbon dioxide zone. 

628
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,510
 It's an area where you can feel the carbon dioxide emitted from each other. 

629
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:33,700
 If you enter this area, Naughtysaurus will get out of control.  

630
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,420
Step back, Wung!

631
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,950
I said step back!

632
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,270
You're getting ...

633
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,410
What?

634
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,940
You're getting a call.

635
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,700
I'll do this.

636
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:23,160
 Leaving the carbon dioxide zone. 

637
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,100
Hello?

638
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,500
Yes, I'm home, why?

639
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:37,330
 I think you have to come here. The file isn't opening all of the sudden. 

640
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:38,640
What?

641
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,010
Something must have gone wrong while updating the Unity version. Louis can't open it either.

642
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:46,810
Ask him to come quickly. No, let me talk to him.

643
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:50,570
Hello. Wung, there's a problem.

644
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:52,650
 Come quickly. 

645
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,550
Okay.

646
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,660
Did something happen?

647
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:06,150
Unfortunately, I think I have to go to my office.

648
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:08,120
- Right now? 
 - Yes.

649
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,690
There seems to be a problem. It's a bit urgent.

650
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,030
I just started the washing machine.

651
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,230
Do you want to stay here? I'll be right back.

652
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:22,960
When will you come back?

653
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,700
I'm not sure.

654
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,110
I don't think it will be over soon.

655
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:29,300
Being here alone is ...

656
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,150
- Is that a bit too much? 
 - Yes.

657
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,210
A bit.

658
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:36,000
But you can't go out dressed like this anyway.

659
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,610
You need something to change into.

660
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:44,690
I do have something to wear.

661
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:54,850
- Excuse me. 
 - Welcome.

662
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:58,350
Do you have the clothes that a woman left here this morning?

663
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:59,910
Yes.

664
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,200
- Her name is... 
 - Kim Yumi.

665
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,810
Yes. Here it is.

666
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,990
- Thank you. 
 - No problem.

667
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:43,620
The taxi is here.

668
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:47,090
Go ahead.

669
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,730
Let's ride together. I'll drop you home and then go.

670
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,750
There's no need. You're already late.

671
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:55,020
Go quickly. I can just take the bus.

672
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:00,350
Go quickly.

673
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,470
I-I'll call you.

674
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,110
♫  We know  ♫

675
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:23,420
Today's date is over, Naughty.

676
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:26,670
Get some sleep now.

677
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:31,610
They could have kissed.

678
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,240
He's calmed down now.

679
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,570
The house is too dangerous. He almost went out of control!

680
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:44,550
Let's not bring her home again.

681
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:50,760
♫  I feel I am changing  ♫

682
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,970
♫   For us, now even the small things  ♫

683
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:56,870
It worked!

684
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,650
Did it?

685
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,050
I think so.

686
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,480
It's done!

687
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:09,480
Good job, Wung!

688
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:14,730
Wung, if it weren't for you ... Seriously, we almost lost everything!

689
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:15,880
What time is it?

690
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:20,560
You must be hungry. Let's go out! Let's eat something really good today, okay?

691
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,960
I have to go, you two just eat together!

692
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,130
Why? Aren't you hungry?

693
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,010
- I'm not hungry. 
 - He came here in the middle of a date.

694
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:27,630
- Go ahead, CEO. 
 - I'll get going.

695
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:33,770
- See you on Monday. 
 - Good job.

696
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:37,600
  What did I do wrong? Yes, it's all been revealed anyway.  

697
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,900
  Yes, I'm going to say something to Comedy Big League*. 
 (Korean comedy show) 

698
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,120
 Jang Do Yeon, this dance. 

699
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,280
 - This will be broadcasted, right? 
 - Yes. 

700
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,160
 But why isn't what I did broadcasted? 

701
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,780
 Why can't it? 

702
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,180
  Gu Wung 

703
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:56,130
Hello?

704
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:58,690
Yes, I'm home. Are you done?

705
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:02,600
I just finished and came home now. I'll bring you your dress.

706
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,210
Oh, no, it's fine. Give it to me next time.

707
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:06,710
I'll stop by now.

708
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:09,730
  Give it to me next time we see each other. You must be tired now. 

709
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:12,100
But I would like to stop by now.

710
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,720
Can't I come to see you now?

711
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,990
All right. Come by.

712
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:25,510
I'll contact you when I arrive.

713
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:42,970
 There's something weird about Yumi's behavior. 

714
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:46,880
She left her clothes at the clothing store.

715
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,960
That clothing store is only a 3-minute walk away from where the coffee was spilled.

716
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,700
It was closer than Wung's house which is a 5-minute walk away.

717
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:00,700
Yet, she came to our home and changed into Wung's clothes.

718
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,610
Why?

719
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,770
 I'm in front of your house. 

720
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,950
Why are you so late?

721
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,100
I wanted to iron it before coming.

722
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,310
You didn't have to iron it.

723
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,870
Have you had dinner?

724
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,000
No, not yet.

725
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,200
Oh, really? Let's go eat then. I'll pay!

726
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:07,110
But...

727
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:11,570
why did you come to my place when you had clothes?

728
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:12,590
Sorry?

729
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:15,970
The clothing store was closer than my place.

730
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:20,690
I ...

731
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,630
didn't think of that.

732
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:27,700
You didn't think of that?

733
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,620
That's right, because I was flustered.

734
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:35,850
I remembered later that I had bought clothes.

735
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,870
Oh, really?

736
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:42,350
Then what else could it be?

737
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:46,260
I don't know what it could be, that's why I'm asking.

738
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,510
I told you I didn't think of that.

739
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,350
All right.

740
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:56,700
Why are you laughing?

741
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,720
Because you're cute.

742
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:04,560
You're ridiculous. You always say I'm cute.

743
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,140
What do you feel like eating? This area is famous for ...

There's something I really want to do with you.

01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,960
 I don't know whether you will like it or not.

 - Then let's go to my place. 
 - What? 

768
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:26,170
  Naughty, don't get too ahead of yourself.

 This is really good. Who made this?

  A man and a woman can't be just friends!

 Is this Sae Yi? She is pretty. 

773

 I have to stop by the office, do you want to go with me after eating this?
