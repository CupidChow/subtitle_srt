 Yumi 
 A tvN original series 

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:13,480

00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:51,480
  Episode 12 
 Yuja tea 

4
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,240
Who are you?

5
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,270
It's a frog.

6
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,690
 You will probably remember the cell that entered Yumi's heart disguised as a frog, 

7
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:16,810
♫  When I am wandering the street after a tiring day  ♫

8
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,890
Hi, Yumi's love cell.

9
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,900
Who are you?

10
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,180
I'm Wung's love cell.

11
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,350
 We remember Wung's love cell. 

12
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,760
That's what happened.

13
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,790
But aren't you going back home?

14
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,850
I have to go back, but when the time is right.

15
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,090
The time is right?

16
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,930
Usually, when a man and a woman kiss, a love wormhole opens up.

Yumi.

45
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,720
 The wormhole opened up frequently since then 

46
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,400
They are kissing again.

47
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,930
Hi, Hunger. I'm back again.

48
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,710
 He often came to hang out in the village. 

49
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,990
Can't you just give me one?

50
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,890
No.

51
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,910
Good boy.

52
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,590
Wung, I'm hot.

53
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,090
You're hot? No, no, no.

54
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,140
It's hot even at night now. It must definitely be summer.

55
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,620
You're right. We have an hour left before the movie starts.

56
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,680
Should we go somewhere cool to wait?

57
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,920
- Yeah, that sounds good. 
 - Let's go.

58
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,670
Go and sit. I'll bring it.

59
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:45,320
Wung, there is something I really want to do with you.

60
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,290
What is it?

61
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,410
What that is ...

62
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,470
- It's something you use your body for. 
 - Huh?

63
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,160
Something you use your body for?

64
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,460
I don't get it.

65
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,920
You know... that ...

66
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:17,980
After you do it, you get really out of breath and really sweaty.

67
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,680
Yeah?

68
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,420
- Is there something like that? 
 - Yeah.

69
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:43,260
But... Honestly, I want to do it...

70
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,390
but I'm not sure if you'll like it or not—

71
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,880
I like it.

72
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,990
- I didn't say what it is yet. 
 - I like it.

73
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,660
Don't say otherwise later.

74
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,260
There's no way I would.

75
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,590
Then let's do this.

76
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,430
Marathon.

77
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,720
I participated alone every year, but I don't think I will be lonely this year.

78
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,270
What?

79
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,500
You got me.

80
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,700
Why? What were you thinking of?

81
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,360
What? What?

82
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,670
- Two brown sugar milk teas you ordered are ready. 
 - Thank you.

83
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,060
Wait for me.

84
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,020
This is refreshing. It's good.

85
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,880
Hold on. I keep getting texts from the office.

86
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,520
They must be having trouble with resolving something.

87
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,760
Hm.  The person cannot be reached. You'll be directed to voicemail. 

88
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,390
- What? 
 - What?

89
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,970
- Why are you staring at me? 
 - Just because.

90
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,860
Just because?

91
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,620
- Can't I stare at you? 
 - You can.

92
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,590
I'm kind of handsome, right?

93
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,120
You're not handsome but you are cute.

94
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,950
 You are the cute one and I'm kind of the sexy one. 

95
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,150
 Sexy? 

96
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,970
- Hello? If you called won't you say something? 
  - Who is? 
 - Aren't I sexy? 

97
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,710
Hello? I didn't realize you answered.

98
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,400
What's the problem?

99
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,420
Yes, Louis didn't answer the phone.

100
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,000
Tell him to try it with mine. Mine had no problem.

101
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,490
Yeah. Tell him to call me when he gets back. Yeah.

102
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,860
What is it? Is there a problem?

103
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,430
No. It's nothing.

104
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,990
It's that friend, right? Your closest friend.

105
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:19,350
- Louis? 
 - Not Louis. Wasn't it the one who's the art director?

106
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,860
- Was it Sae Yi? 
 - It was Sae Yi.

107
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,320
But I'm not really close with Sae Yi.

108
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,380
Did you guys start up a company because the three of you were close?

109
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,640
Well... I needed an art director.

110
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,870
But we're like cats and dogs. We always fight.

111
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,160
That makes you two sound closer.

112
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,740
We really are  like enemies.

113
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:45,490
But he has a feminine name. People must get confused by him a lot.

114
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,960
But she is a woman.

115
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,290
- What? 
 - Sae Yi is a woman.

116
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,070
It's my first time hearing that she's a woman.

117
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,040
Didn't I tell you?

118
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,630
 One-second discussion 
 Can friendship exist between a woman and a man? 

119
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,680
Since we don't have much time, I'll start right away.

120
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,940
- First, Reason—  
 - Me first! I want to go first!

121
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,310
Friendship can't exist between women and men! Because...

122
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,080
Because?

123
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,900
It just doesn't.

124
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,430
Bull. Friendship or whatever, it's a no!

125
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,190
It's a no ... Just because.

126
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,440
It can't be because ... Never ever.

127
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,840
What are you saying? Say it so we can understand.

128
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,960
Reason, go ahead.

129
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,740
I will logically explain that friendship can exist between girls and boys.

130
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,960
- I've prepared plenty of data— 
 - I don't want to hear it!

131
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,030
Reason might approve, but I can never approve.

132
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,330
There is no friendship between women and men!

133
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,450
Sensitivity, discussion time is almost over.

134
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,440
It's been over one second. If we just leave it like this, her expression will be too serious.

135
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,370
I'm also really serious.

136
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,940
This won't do. Come out Reaction #1.

137
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,760
Did you call for me? What kind of reaction should I do?

138
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,290
What the? I thought it was a guy.

139
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,970
Did you?

140
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,740
No wonder, I thought the name sounded feminine.

141
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,460
Right. It's definitely not a guy name.

142
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,230
Exactly.

143
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,540
 This guy's name is Hunch. 

144
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,900
 He lives alone away from the village. 

145
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,840
 Because he has a unusual ability. 

146
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,490
No!

147
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,800
 Hunch can know Yumi's future in advance. 

148
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,210
Guys! Guys!

149
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,720
Guys, Hunch is here.

150
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,510
Hunch, what's going on?

151
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,060
Guys, I just got a hunch.

152
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,700
I heard that Sae Yi, the one close to Wung, is a woman.

153
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,380
That's right. So what?

154
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,240
Is something happening to Yumi?

155
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,000
This Sae Yi ...

156
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,170
I feel she's super pretty. Super pretty.

157
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,910
- And... 
 - And?

158
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,340
- And... I don't think she has a boyfriend. 
 - What?!

159
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,190
- So, that's why. 
 - What?

160
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:33,330
Only Louis came for drinks last time.

161
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,720
Then, I guessed that Sae Yi couldn't come because she was on a date with her boyfriend.

162
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,670
I don't think so. She doesn't have a boyfriend.

163
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,110
I'm going to the restroom.

164
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,930
She doesn't have a boyfriend? Why? Did they break up?

165
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,600
No... I've never seen her having a boyfriend.

166
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,530
I'll be right back.

167
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,140
I got it, I got it, I got another hunch!

168
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,570
Guys!

169
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,260
What's going on? He's here again.

170
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,530
Why did you come again?

171
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:20,880
That woman, Sae Yi. Somehow, I think she likes Wung.

172
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,770
- And, that once Wung also— 
 - Enough!

173
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't think it's time for you to interfere, Hunch. There is no basis for what you're saying.

174
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,730
I have no basis.

175
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,850
Moreover, you don't even know whether it's true or not.

176
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,760
I just wanted you to keep that in mind.

177
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,190
Yumi is doing so well with Wung now. She's happy.

178
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,330
So why should we worry in advance about a hunch with no basis?

179
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,830
There's no need to worry about it in advance ...

180
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,850
Then... I'll just be going!

181
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,090
What's his deal, seriously?

182
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,310
Let's not worry about it. It doesn't matter if she's a man or a woman when it comes to work.

183
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:06,620
That's childish. Mind your business, Kim Yumi.

184
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,950
Hello?

185
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,560
Yes, Section Chief.

186
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,420
I left work already.

187
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,930
Yes, I'm out right now–

188
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,620
Pardon?

189
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,920
 Nam Ju Hyeok 

190
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,660
Can you fix it quickly and send it to me? I have to hand it over by 9 o'clock.

191
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,990
 Oh, really? 

192
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,580
But I'm already in Ilsan.

193
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,510
Going back to the company is...

194
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,580
All right.

195
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,230
Then, I'll call you when I get to the internet café.

196
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,510
All right, thank you.

197
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,470
What? Did something happen?

198
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,450
He suddenly said that I need to revise the report.

199
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,750
-There's still time before the movie, right? 
 - Yes.

200
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,720
- There are 40 minutes left. 
 - Then, do you want to stay here?

201
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,220
I'll go to an internet café. Since I don't have my laptop.

202
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,960
- Let's go to my place then. 
 - What?

203
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,850
My place is close. Why bother going to an internet café?

204
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,840
It'll be comfortable here, right?

205
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,030
I keep coming here somehow.

206
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:39,000
You didn't leave your laptop somewhere on purpose and not look for it on purpose today either, right?

207
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,840
What?

208
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,530
I'm joking.

209
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,320
It's all set.

210
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,390
Thank you! It will take me some time.

211
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,090
It won't take long, will it? Do we have to cancel the movie?

212
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:01,780
Huh? No, it'll be enough time. I only need 20 minutes.

213
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,190
Do you want some coffee?

214
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,520
Instead of coffee...

215
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,980
Do you have anything else? I had too much coffee today.

216
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,810
Just wait.

217
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,400
No coffee... Let's see.

218
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,330
Yuja* tea, juice ... 
  (tangy and bitter sweet citrus fruit, similar to yuzu) 

219
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:29,100
This one has expired. Oh, I also have wild parsley juice!

220
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,680
I want citron tea. Please make it cold.

221
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,530
Okay!

222
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,490
Cold...

223
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,500
Wild parsley juice.

224
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,830
 Assistant Manager Kim Yumi 

225
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,490
Assistant Manager Kim, are you done?

226
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,720
I'll check it out.

227
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,860
This is good.

228
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,490
Yes, Section Chief.

229
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:28,450
Okay, I've checked it. Thank you!

230
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,740
That's a relief.

231
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,580
If you have problems again, please contact me.

232
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,360
Wung, where are you?

233
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,760
I went to buy some drinks.

234
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,750
You're done already? That was fast! I'll be right there.

235
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,920
We still have time before the movie, so take your time.

236
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,360
Yeah.

237
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,720
It's always clean. How is it so clean?

238
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,530
Does he clean every day?

239
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,390
Wow, this is really good!

240
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,530
Did he make this at home instead of buying it?

241
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:53,690
 The yuja slices are thick and not uniform. 

242
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:58,700
 The sugar grains are telling me that the yuja syrup for the tea was homemade.  

243
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:04,580
Homemade? If it's homemade, was it made by Wung's mom?

244
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,560
Then, Yumi is drinking her mother-in-law's yuja tea right now. Right?

245
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,790
Yeah! Yeah!

246
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:20,490
Is that so, really? There's no brand name.

247
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,990
No, something is suspicious.

248
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,490
That jar of yuja syrup, isn't it something that young people like?

249
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,270
- And the amount is too small. 
 - So what?

250
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,800
Moms usually don't put it in those jars.

251
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:55,830
It's normal for moms to excessively fill it up in jars like that. Am I wrong?

252
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,520
Then what's your conclusion?

253
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,430
 Get well soon, Gu Wung. 

254
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,960
- Don't tell me... 
 - According to my reasoning,

255
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,720
 The person who first bought yuja lemons, 

256
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:18,630
 then washed them in bicarbonate, sterilized the jars, 

257
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,030
 Sliced the yuja thinly 

258
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:28,390
 and offered it as a gift to Wung after filling it up with sugar is... 

259
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:38,330
Isn't it Sae Yi? "Get well soon, Gu Wung"

260
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,130
- You're back. 
 - Are you completely done?

261
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,260
- Yes. 
 - Then, let's go. I'll just put this in the fridge.

262
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,430
There wasn't anything to drink, so I bought some.

263
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,660
- Why? The yuja tea was good. 
 - Really?

264
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,020
Yes, it was really good. Is it homemade?

265
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,250
Who made it?

266
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,830
Gu Wung, take this.

267
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,120
- What's that? 
 - Yuja tea.

268
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,760
Are you planning on creating a yuja tea business or what?

269
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,590
There's one for you too. Take it.

270
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,250
For me?

271
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:23,150
You said you got a cold. Drink it in the morning and evening. I'm sure you'll get much better.

272
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,320
 Get well soon, Gu Wung. 

273
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,790
You didn't make it yourself, right?

274
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,960
Oh, this?

275
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,860
When I caught a cold—

276
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,920
 When I caught a cold Sae Yi gave it to me as a gift so that I could get better soon. 

277
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,560
You want us to say it like this?

278
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:53,190
I don't want to hide anything from Yumi. Lying is a no-no-no.

279
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:59,360
Who said to lie? I'm just saying let's not say unnecessary things.

280
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,170
  Someone gave it to me.  

281
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,360
Someone gave it to me.

282
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,890
 Someone gave it to you? Is that it? 

283
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,190
 I think something huge was omitted. 

284
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,680
It's good! I don't know who made it, but it's really good.

285
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,620
Let's go! We'll be late for the movie.

286
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,260
Again?

287
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,690
No, I can't. The guys won't want to hear it.

288
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,630
  The hunch cell, who had such a scary ability that he couldn't live in the village, 

289
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,860
No one will hear it here, right?

290
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,500
I have a hunch again! I said I have a hunch!

291
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,530
Yumi and Wung will end up ...

292
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:04,000
 sometimes finding out facts they don't want to know.  

293
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,620
 July 23rd 

294
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:11,160
 Episode 13 
 Yumi's Birthday 

295
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,430
I probably don't have to do my feet.

296
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,120
You can't see them when I have socks on anyway.

297
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,890
 What if you have to take them off? 

298
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:43,310
 You never know. 

299
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:46,130
 Tomorrow's a special day. 

300
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,110
 Yumi. 

301
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,050
 What about underwear? 

302
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:09,940
 You should pick out underwear, too. Tomorrow's a special day. 

303
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,450
You should care more.

304
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,570
Naughty, stop getting ahead of yourself.

305
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:27,170
You never know. It's her birthday.

306
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,950
So what if it's her birthday?

307
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,930
You know...

308
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,650
What's wrong with him?

309
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,240
Sensitivity, you're not sleeping?

310
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,200
I can't sleep. Do you think she'll be happy this birthday?

311
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,820
She's been so lonely for the past three years.

312
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:52,120
I know. It's been so long since she's not been lonely on her birthday.

313
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,450
But what is that?

314
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:58,100
- It's the moon. 
 - The moon's over there.

315
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,110
Then what's that?

316
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:06,560
It's got a stem. A green...

317
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,000
- It's a yuja lemon! 
 - It's a yuja lemon!

318
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,750
- It's a yuja! 
 - Why is that moon a yuja?

319
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,420
 The yuja Sae Yi might have given him. 

320
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,630
Wung doesn't use social media.

321
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,710
Wung is Wu Gi's college sunbae.

322
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,250
Sae Yi is Wung's college friend, so...

323
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,010
Right.

324
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,220
Let's go to Wu Gi's social media.

325
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,490
   

326
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,030
 See all 97 comments. 

327
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,170
 ssayso__ : It looks good. Did you go with Wung? 

328
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,190
Found her.

329
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,390
So this is Sae Yi?

330
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,870
Seo Sae Yi.

331
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,130
She's pretty.

332
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:21,970
 We're working overtime again. Three Eagles, bravely working. 

333
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,450
 Day off. I made yuja syrup. 

334
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,110
 to give as a gift to my dear ones. 

335
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,070
 Who made it? 

336
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,720
 Oh, this? Someone gave it to me. 

337
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,980
It was Sae Yi who gave him that yuja syrup!

338
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,690
He said someone gave him it and it was Sae Yi!

339
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,660
Uhhh... Sensitivity... Calm down.

340
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,380
First it's Ruby then Sae Yi! Seriously?

341
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:00,210
No, Sensitivity. Tomorrow's her birthday. We can't meet Wung feeling like this.

342
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,310
Let go of me! Let go!

343
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:07,690
- Let go! Let go of me! 
 - Come here.

344
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,380
Repeat after me. We're chill.

345
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,380
We're chill.

346
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,140
We'll forget about the yuja now.

347
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,870
We'll forget.

348
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,980
What do you think, cells? Have you reached inner peace?

349
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,510
Master.

350
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:30,670
Oh, Sensitivity, did you finally find inner peace?

351
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:34,860
I think finding inner peace is very difficult.

352
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,390
So I will just... I won't let this go!

353
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,110
Sensitivity, hold it in!

354
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:45,900
I can't hold it in. I've got to figure it out with Wung. Let's warn him right now!

355
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,770
 This late? It's almost midnight! 

356
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:04,220
 Who cares how late it is? If they're not honest with each other, it could be a problem that will end them. 

357
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:09,160
 Wung, who gave you the yuja syrup? 

358
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,260
 Happy birthday. 

359
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,170
 It's past midnight, so it's your birthday, right? 

360
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,590
 Good night. 

361
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,860
- Wow! It's a heart! 
 - Wung sent that.

362
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,450
Sensitivity, do you really have to warn Wung?

363
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:41,330
No, it's fine. I suddenly found inner peace.

364
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,700
 Thanks, Wung. 

365
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,940
 Good night, too. 

366
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,920
 Let's add one more heart. 

367
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,820
 One more. 

368
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,830
 Thanks, Wung. Good night, too. 

369
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,780
Is this place all right?

370
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,770
Yes, it's good. It's really really good.

371
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:49,280
Right, I almost forgot, because I was so hungry.

372
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,270
Don't eat yet.

373
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,110
I have to take a picture.

374
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:57,730
I have to upload what I ate with whom on my birthday.

375
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:01,210
Or my friends will send me consolation messages.

376
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,000
I didn't write a card.

377
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,790
I'm bad at that sort of thing.

378
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,440
Wung...

379
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,530
I have to take a picture with this too.

380
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,970
All done.

381
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,410
Then you should open it.

382
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,930
- Here? 
 - Why not?

383
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,470
What could it be?

384
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:50,280
 The length of the box is approximately 45 centimeters. It's pretty light. 

385
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,470
Then... the present is a clutch bag!

386
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,480
I'll bet this much that that's a clutch bag.

387
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,860
Wow.

388
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,340
I think I know what this is.

389
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,230
Really?

390
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,160
Isn't it something that starts with a c?

391
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,940
I'm not sure.

392
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,650
I don't think it starts with a c.

393
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:15,470
What? It was a trick? Then I'll guess again.

394
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,850
- There is a faint scent from the wrapper. 
 - Yeah?

395
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,020
The worker must have sprayed it.

396
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,910
So it's probably...

397
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:31,020
The present in the box is a perfume. I'm sure.

398
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,700
It doesn't look like a perfume, right?

399
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,870
What is this?

400
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:52,320
Is it earrings?

401
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,400
I'm not sure.

402
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:03,100
It's too big to be an earring box. So that is...

403
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,180
I bet everything I have that it's a necklace. All in.

404
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:13,070
If you've made your choices, I will spin it. All right.

405
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,800
Dang!

406
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,220
A neck...

407
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,220
A necklace! All right!

408
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:49,850
- What is that? It stopped! 
 - What does it say?

409
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,680
No, no.

410
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,370
It shouldn't do that!

411
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,200
No!

412
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,580
- What? 
 - What is that?

413
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,790
A present that makes you mad when you receive it?

414
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,440
It's a portable charger.

415
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,220
It seemed like you needed a portable charger when I saw you last time.

416
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,740
- Didn't you? 
 - You're right.

417
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,560
- Thanks. 
 - Do you like it?

418
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,180
Yes, of course. I really needed one.

419
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,370
That's a relief.

420
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,850
Thank you. I'll really put it to good use.

421
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:50,760
What the hell is that? That's the birthday present?

422
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,000
It's because Wung is an engineer. Engineers are obsessed with electronics.

423
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,120
Are you kidding me? There are levels on electronics.

424
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,460
It's not even a bluetooth speaker but a portable charger?

425
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,150
Still, that's probably pretty expensive. It's a large-capacity one.

426
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,200
But it's not romantic at all!

427
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,000
It's been three years since she spent a birthday with a boyfriend.

428
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,590
I was really looking forward to it this year.

429
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:18,190
There's a lot of trash.

430
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:26,010
Press the power button to see if it works.

431
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,890
I'll try when I get home later.

432
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:34,160
Press it. Press it just once to see whether it lights up.

433
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,650
I'm sure it works.

434
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,760
Wait, wait.  It didn't stop yet.

435
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,580
- Oh my! What? 
 - What's going on?

436
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,170
Happy birthday.

437
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,710
Wung...

438
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,530
Wung...

439
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,680
It's pretty.

440
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:43,110
- I got it right! 
 - Here you go.

441
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,620
I believed in Wung.

442
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:50,250
My Wung never disappoints!

443
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,590
It's pretty.

444
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,750
Yes.

445
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,520
What?

446
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,840
I love it very much. Thanks.

447
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,460
Yeah.

448
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,320
Really?

449
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,630
Then, what time do I have to be there by, Sae Yi?

450
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,620
Yeah. Okay, I'll call you back. See you later.

451
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,480
Are you going somewhere?

452
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:51,780
Well, the thing is... Oh! Yumi, you said you wanted to visit my office, right?

453
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,090
What? Yes.

454
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:59,080
I think I have to stop by the office for a bit. Do you want to come with me after we finish this?

455
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,430
- If not, do you want to wait at a coffee shop for a little— 
 - It's fine. I'll go with you.

456
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:08,210
- No, if you're uncomfortable– 
 - I'm not uncomfortable at all. I'll go with you.

457
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,850
Ah, all right.

458
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:16,940
When we go, they all will be there, right? Louis and Sae Yi?

459
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,750
Right.

460
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,720
 How does Yumi look right now? 

461
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,620
She's wearing new clothes, additionally, she got a manicure and pedicure done.

462
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:30,220
She put on a face mask last night, so her skin is in the best condition.

463
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,160
Even her underwear.

464
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,150
And she even has the necklace on to top it off.

465
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,680
Yumi is perfect today!

466
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,470
All right!

467
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:50,000
 If she has to meet Seo Sae Yi someday, it should be today. 

468
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,470
- I'm done. Let's go. 
 - All right.

469
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,110
Let's go.

470
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,230
This is my company.

471
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:17,100
You're using the whole building?

472
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:21,010
No, I'm renting one office space.

473
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,740
- Let's go. 
 - All right.

474
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,600
 SLW Studio 

475
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,290
It's here.

476
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:42,070
- Just a sec. I need to use the restroom. 
 - It's over there.

477
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:44,840
- Go ahead. 
 - I'll be inside.

478
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:01,650
What's going on? Why am I nervous?

479
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,770
Guys, there's nothing to be nervous about. It will be fine.

480
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:08,350
Just follow my plan. Listen carefully.

481
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,570
 First, we'll greet Sae Yi as soon as we see her. 

482
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:17,840
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

483
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,910
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Yumi.

484
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,680
Right. I'm Seo Sae Yi.

485
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:30,180
 Sae Yi must be tired after working overtime. But Yumi has an exceptionally perfect girlfriend look today. 

486
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,140
 Of course she'll overpower her. 

487
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:37,230
 What the heck? She's really pretty. 

488
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,950
At that time, you should keep the smiling face, Reaction #1.

489
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,610
Yes, leave it to me.

490
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:46,700
 Okay, the important thing here is that the eyes shouldn't be smiling. 

491
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,350
 Why not? 

492
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:52,940
 At the same time as the greeting, she'll be shooting a Yumi beam with her eyes. 

493
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:58,240
- It's nice to meet you, Sae Yi. 
 - You too.

494
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,670
 What the heck? Her aura is no joke. 

495
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:08,780
- After we get a head start, Sae Yi will be the loser and Yumi will take the lead. 
 - Okay.

496
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,880
 First we'll take the lead and then throw a bait. 

497
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,440
Right, I enjoyed the yuja syrup tea.

498
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,140
From when I went to Wung's place. It was made well. You made it, right?

499
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:24,670
I finished what you gave to Wung.

500
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:31,120
At that moment, get all the information that shows on Sae Yi's face.

501
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,470
You should scan everything about Sae Yi without losing a thing.

502
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:40,280
I, Detective, can figure out everything about Sae Yi in ten seconds.

503
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,810
Okay! Perfect.

504
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:45,950
- Guys, let's do this! 
 - Let's do this!

505
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:50,310
Ummm... Guys, what do we do? I think we're in big trouble.

506
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:53,470
- What kind of big trouble?  
 - Look behind you.

507
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,270
Huh?

508
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,550
 It's Sae Yi! 

509
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,670
What? I can't believe we're meeting here. Our plan is ruined!

510
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,580
For now, we should say hello.

511
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,240
We can't. Yumi is meeting Sae Yi for the first time today.

512
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:20,240
If we recognize her here, it's like confessing we've been snooping around her social media.

513
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,220
Let's pretend we don't know her for now.

514
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:39,110
Are you... Yumi?

515
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,370
You are Kim Yumi, right?

516
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,690
Uhh...

517
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,940
What the ...? Sae Yi recognized her first. That wasn't part of the plan.

518
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,110
Guys, what should we say?

519
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:00,250
Guys! Where are you?

520
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,750
This can't happen!

521
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,770
She's drawing a blank.

522
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,870
Aren't you Kim Yumi?

523
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,910
Well... I am.

524
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:23,640
You are. Hello, I'm Wung's work friend.

525
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:28,540
It's funny we get to meet in a place like this. So nice to meet you.

526
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,910
I really wanted to see you.

527
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,390
 Episode 14 : Yumi's Birthday 2 

528
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:46,740
Oh, right. Hello.

529
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,910
How do you know me?

530
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:54,980
You're Wu Gi's seonbae. I saw your picture through his social media.

531
00:41:54,980 --> 00:42:00,650
It's been so long since Wung has had a girlfriend, so I was curious of who it was.

532
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,870
Oh, I see.

533
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:07,940
But you look so much cuter in person.

534
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,320
Thank you.

535
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,680
Use this one, Miss Sae Yi.

536
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,920
Thank you.

537
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:24,690
But ... you know my name?

538
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,710
Guys! I'm scared of her.

539
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:40,750
- Guys! Where are you? 
 - Reason!

540
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:44,280
Love, what do we do? She's too strong.

541
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,160
She's no ordinary woman. At this rate, we might fall in.

542
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,420
Yumi, pull yourself together.

543
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:58,380
How do you know my name?

544
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:07,480
Wung said that you're the only girl at work.

545
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,390
I see. Wung must even talk about me?

546
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:18,050
I only heard that you've known each other since college.

547
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:20,890
I guess there is no way he wouldn't talk about me.

548
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:25,180
I've known him since we were twenty.

549
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:29,950
Wow, it's already been over ten years.

550
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,750
Actually, he was like that since then.

551
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,210
Don't listen to old memories. Ignore them.

552
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,240
We had the same classes since we were freshmen.

553
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,340
Because we had the same hobbies, we always hung out together.

554
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,750
After a while, we had same free periods...

555
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,120
so we played games together,

556
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,720
we just did everything together.

557
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,880
Sorry?

558
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,480
Did you say something?

559
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,530
I was saying, Wung and I used to

560
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:11,430
hang out together all the time at college, with Louis too, so people ...

561
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:17,370
... called the three of us...

562
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,480
Called the three of us The Three Eagles.

563
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,470
I'm sorry.

564
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:30,900
Why isn't this stopping?

565
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,030
What's wrong with this?

566
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,970
There.

567
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,460
What did you just say? I didn't hear it.

568
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,050
It wasn't anything important.

569
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,250
Oh, it wasn't anything important.

570
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,390
Nice. Good one, Yumi.

571
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,970
Now, let's go as we planned.

572
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:53,830
The fatal blow, citron!

573
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,780
It's this way.

574
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:02,870
Right. I enjoyed the yujacheong

575
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,450
From when I stopped by at Wung's place. You really made it well.

576
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,830
You made it, right?

577
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:15,650
Thank you for taking such good care of Wung.

578
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,320
There you go! Nice one, Yumi!

579
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,500
No need. We're friends.

580
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,990
Of course I should take care of him.

581
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:25,630
Still, I should be grateful.

582
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,550
But...

583
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:30,880
As expected, it looks good on you.

584
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,930
Pardon?

585
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,390
That necklace. We picked it out together.

586
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:38,390
He said it was your birthday.

587
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,640
He kept picking weird things, so I picked that for him.

588
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,010
It looks good on you. You like it, right?

589
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,710
Let's go.

590
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:04,610
How are you coming in together?

591
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:06,610
We met in the restroom.

592
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,550
We already introduced ourselves.

593
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,130
Then you met everyone. You've already met Louis.

594
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:15,900
- Yes. Hello. 
 - Hello.

595
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,380
You disturbed their date. You should take responsibility.

596
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,610
I'm sorry, Yumi.

597
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:22,930
It's all right.

598
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:26,250
Yumi, it'll be done in about ten minutes. Just wait for a bit.

599
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:29,400
All right. It's fine. Don't worry about me and take your time.

600
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,930
Come sit over here.

601
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:34,200
Sure.

602
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,190
Let's hurry. Hurry.

603
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,970
Would you like something to eat?

604
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:41,310
I already ate a lot. I'm full.

605
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:43,130
Still.

606
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,800
We have some yuja syrup here, too. The one I made.

607
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,810
Would you like some?

608
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:51,350
I'm fine.

609
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,990
Okay.

610
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:59,010
Perhaps it's C ...

611
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:01,400
C, vector.

612
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,590
Isn't this how it goes?

613
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,880
- No. No. 
 - I'm right.

614
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:13,770
The fog is gone, but where did everyone go?

615
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:16,070
Why can't I see anyone?

616
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:20,330
What is this?

617
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,800
I've never seen this flower.

618
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,850
It's over there, too.

619
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:33,010
Over there, too.

620
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,330
Don't get close to it!

621
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:40,200
Love.

622
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,010
Be careful. If you inhale the pollen, you'll get addicted.

623
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,740
Addicted?

624
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:47,900
This is the flower of doubt, that causes suspicions.

625
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,130
I think Sae Yi planted them. Look at that.

626
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,100
It's a flower...

627
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,520
Sensitivity!

628
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,560
What's your relationship with Sae Yi?

629
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:13,300
Yuja tea makes me mad.

630
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:17,960
Why are you coming out from there?

631
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:23,410
Why did you pick the necklace together?

632
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,980
Did you check that the UI was cut off at the notch screen?

633
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,340
I just left it for now, since I couldn't do anything right now.

634
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,300
How about the new icon patch in the store?

635
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,280
I revised it and ran the build.

636
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,870
How about that in-app payment problem that happened during our testing?

637
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:49,810
I don't think it was a problem from our end.

638
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,560
Then, is it from the store?

639
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,020
I think so.

640
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,530
Let's try this for now and we'll ask if it doesn't work.

641
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:17,270
You're bored, right?

642
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,130
I'm fine.

643
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:23,610
It's taking longer than I thought. What should we drink after I'm done?

644
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:24,820
Anything.

645
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,830
Anything. Anything is hard.

646
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:29,970
You should go there.

647
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:33,590
- Where? 
 - The place we go all the time. The pajeon place.

648
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,680
But I don't think Yumi will like dongdongju.

649
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,940
You don't like dongdongju?

650
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,800
Well, it's not that I don't like it.

651
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,080
Dongdongju is Wung's favorite.

652
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,260
When we work overtime, pajeon and dongdongju is a must.

653
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,050
It's not my favorite.

654
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,450
Yes, it is.

655
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:55,740
Even if you don't really like it, you should drink with him from time to time.

656
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:59,340
He is crazy for dongdongju.

657
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,360
They drink dongdongju together all the time.

658
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,840
What's going on between you two?

659
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,860
What do we do, Love? The flowers keep increasing.

660
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,770
No matter how many I cut, they don't decrease because of Sae Yi.

661
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,620
Sae Yi keeps spreading seeds.

662
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:37,970
- What do we do? 
 - For now, I think we need to get away from her.

663
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,050
The code is running well right now.

664
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:48,590
Let's run it one more time and wrap it up for today.

665
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,920
Okay. Let's take a break.

666
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,380
I'm so stiff. I got to go pee.

667
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,440
Yumi, you're bored, right? We're almost done.

668
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:05,490
Where did she go?

669
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:09,100
She probably went to the restroom.

670
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:25,480
♫  I think I missed it again, your heart   ♫

671
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,580
 Wung, it seems like it'll take longer than expected so I'll get going. 

672
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:34,460
 I just left because I didn't want to disturb you. Call me later. 

673
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:38,130
♫  Our time​  ♫

674
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:47,690
♫  Even if I try to look back the already twisted road  ♫

675
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:51,280
♫  Our story which went off track  ♫

676
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,920
 Incoming call - Gu Wung 

677
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:58,960
 Incoming call - Gu Wung 

678
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,190
Hello?

679
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,370
 Yumi, where are you? 

680
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,910
Are you done?

681
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:09,130
Almost. I didn't even know you sent me a text.

682
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:11,560
I thought you went to the restroom.

683
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:16,910
You seemed busy and me being there seemed to be bothersome.

684
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,900
 I told you I'd be done soon. 

685
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,910
It took longer than expected.

686
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:23,920
Still, you left without telling me?

687
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,300
I couldn't disturb you. That's why I sent you a text.

688
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:32,240
I wanted to take you to a nice bar.

689
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,700
It's fine. You can drink with your friends. You guys worked hard.

690
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,350
It's your birthday today.

691
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,570
You bought me a nice dinner earlier.

692
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:42,340
Still...

693
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:46,910
And you got me a present. That is enough.

694
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:48,860
You don't have to try any harder.

695
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,970
Try?

696
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:53,550
I'm telling you to not worry.

697
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:56,580
Yumi.

698
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,970
Are you mad about something?

699
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:07,660
Me? Why would I be mad?

700
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:11,710
I had a nice dinner and even got an expensive necklace as a gift.

701
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:14,060
I'm not mad.

702
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:17,470
If I were mad, I'd be a bad person. But ...

703
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,170
But?

704
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:24,600
But did you have to pick out the necklace with Sae Yi?

705
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:28,070
Why couldn't you tell me that Sae Yi's the one who gave you the yuja syrup?

706
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:29,880
Yumi.

707
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,890
I'm hanging up. Enjoy the dongdongju.

708
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:34,160
- Good night. 
 - Wait.

709
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,980
Hello?

710
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:38,930
Hello?

711
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:58,180
♫  I want to hang onto you​  ♫

712
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:04,310
♫  Before we get farther apart  ♫

713
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:11,120
♫  On top of my pillow, our beautiful times  ♫

714
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,290
Where is Yumi?

715
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,860
She went home.

716
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:14,920
Why?
♫  keep falling  ♫

717
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,160
It seemed to take long and she didn't want to be bothersome.

718
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,760
It would've been nice if we could go together. You said it's her birthday today.

719
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,660
Did something happen?

720
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:27,300
Why did she leave without a word?

721
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,680
Is she mad?

722
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,230
Why is she mad?

723
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:39,990
Don't you know?

724
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:42,750
How would I know?

725
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:45,160
I think you would know.

726
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,250
Where are you going?

727
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,610
Home.

728
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:55,000
Are we not going out for dongdongju?

729
00:54:57,110 --> 00:55:00,510
Louis, let's get dongdongju before we go.

730
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,790
I'd like that.

731
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,350
You think my favorite is dongdongju?

732
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:15,180
My favorite is beer. I just drink it because you order it.

733
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,560
Thank you.

734
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:58,490
Are there any left?

735
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:19,510
I shouldn't have said that.

736
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:22,980
I should've just said good night and hung up.

737
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:40,120
Sensitivity, are you all right?

738
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,280
Reason, how are things here?

739
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,860
The flowers aren't blooming anymore.

740
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:48,590
It's probably because we got away from Sae Yi. Her toxicity is no joke.

741
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:52,080
I think we did well avoiding her, but what do we do now?

742
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,750
We can't end her birthday like this.

743
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,110
She has to see Wung.

744
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,100
 Wung, where are you right now? 

745
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:19,890
I'll take care of the rest of the flowers and be back, so you get ready to go out until then.

746
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:28,530
- Fashion, get up! 
 - Why?

747
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:32,770
We're getting ready to go out.The date isn't over yet.

748
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:40,610
Face Wash Up, we're going out. Don't wash your face and just check the areas where the makeup rubbed off.

749
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:43,950
All right, I'll fix it up naturally.

750
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:52,850
 Wung, where are you right now? 

751
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:13,650
Reason, did Wung respond?

752
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:16,990
He didn't read the message. He didn't call either.

753
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:19,250
Maybe he didn't see it because he's drinking dongdongju with friends.

754
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:23,320
Do you think he's ignoring it on purpose? He's probably mad too.

755
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,570
We shouldn't have said that.

756
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:29,360
Let's wait. He'll contact us when he sees it.

757
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:53,360
Reason, I feel weird.

758
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,520
I feel so anxious.

759
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,230
Right now, feeling anxious is normal.

760
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:01,410
Do you think they'll break up at this rate?

761
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,400
Stop saying negative things!

762
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,450
If he doesn't respond by tomorrow, will they break up?

763
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:10,740
It's been years since she's been in a relationship. It's so futile.

764
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:21,180
 I'm the one who's upset. It's also my birthday.  

765
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:24,500
 Why does it feel like I'm the one being punished? 

766
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:31,050
 I'm upset and hate myself. 

767
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,260
 I miss you. 

768
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,250
 Let's call him. 

769
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,050
He won't even read the message.

770
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:56,700
 Exactly, so let's call him. 

771
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:02,820
 If it's not now, it'll be harder tomorrow. 

772
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,940
He's not answering. He's not answering.

773
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:27,370
It must really be over.

774
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:30,170
Be quiet!

775
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,420
 Hello? 

776
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,410
 Yumi? 

777
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,810
- Hello? 
 -  Yes, this is Louis. 

778
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:51,850
 Wung left his phone in the office. 

779
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:53,630
I see.

780
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:57,290
 I thought you'd want to know since you couldn't reach him. 

781
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:00,990
Then ... where is he now?

782
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,630
He said he was going home.

783
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,190
Ah yes, I see.

784
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:08,300
Thank you.

785
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:41,330
He's here!

786
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:44,690
Wung is here! He's in front of the house!

787
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:47,290
They're not breaking up!

788
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:50,820
You must've been really anxious.

789
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:14,570
Where are you going?

790
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:21,810
Where are you going at this hour?

791
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:25,570
Well,

792
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:27,970
What?

793
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:34,550
Then why are you here?

794
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,960
Why am I here?

795
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:44,220
 I'm here because I was bothered by the sound of your voice before and came here to explain myself. 

796
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:48,280
And we didn't even get to light a cake and blow out candles so I came here to do that.

797
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,260
Let's eat and talk about it together.

798
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:52,110
Let's say this.

799
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:53,690
It's too long.

800
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:57,490
Let's take out stuff we don't need to say.

801
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,710
 Let's eat this together. 

802
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:05,640
Let's eat this together.

803
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,970
And about the necklace,

804
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:16,530
 I wanted to buy you the prettiest necklace, but I don't have an eye for those things. 

805
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,750
 That's why I asked Sae Yi for help. 

806
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:22,840
 I wanted to buy you a necklace that would suit you best. 

807
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:26,470
 I just needed a woman's opinion. 

808
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:28,080
 I don't have an eye for those things. 

809
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:32,610
I don't have the eye for those things. That's why.

810
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:34,360
And the yuja tea,

811
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:38,870
 There wasn't a reason why I didn't tell you that Sae Yi gave me the yuja syrup, 

812
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:41,630
 I just thought it was unimportant. 

813
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:44,990
 I even forgot Sae Yi was the one who gave it to me. 

814
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:46,920
 I'm sorry for not telling you clearly. 

815
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,210
 But it's really a misunderstanding. 

816
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:50,720
 It's a misunderstanding.  

817
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,500
It's a misunderstanding.

818
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:59,710
- Is that all? 
 - Yes.

819
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,790
Is that what you call an explanation?

820
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:04,980
Since that's all there is to it.

821
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:13,940


822
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:26,190
♫  We know  ♫

823
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,540
♫  the hidden things inside  ♫

824
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,870
Let's eat this together.

825
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:35,600
It's your favorite strawberry cake.

826
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,350
But you're late. My birthday is over.

827
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:42,260
No it's only eleven—

828
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:44,690
It's past twelve.

829
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:49,330
But bars should be open until dawn, is there a bar nearby?

830
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:53,180
♫  I feel I am changing  ♫

831
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:56,190
♫  For us  ♫

832
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:59,650
Come up.

833
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:03,370
Let's eat it together.

834
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:07,930
♫  In my favorite movie  ♫

835
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:14,710
♫  will we be somewhere in that scene?  You and I.  ♫

836
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:16,490
♫  Nightfallin ♫

837
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:20,420
♫  At the end of the setting sun ♫

838
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:22,200
♫  In me ♫

839
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:24,790
♫  I feel you intensifying ♫

840
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:27,750
♫  Sweet cologne ♫

841
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:30,750
♫  Truth be told  ♫

842
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:33,650
♫  You and I ♫

843
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:37,590
♫  We are walking in sync ♫

844
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:39,380
♫  Nightfallin ♫

845
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:43,360
♫  Because you are within my two eyes ♫

846
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:48,980
♫  I'm hiding the especially red cheeks ♫

847
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:51,060
♫  Yes I know ♫

848
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:53,670

♫  are headed toward the same place ♫

851
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:05,370
 Yumi's Cells 
 ~ Preview ~ 

852
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:06,940
 Should we go on a trip? 

853
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:09,550
 - A trip? 
 - Over the weekend, for three days and two nights. 

854
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:14,630
 The sandy beach is right in front. We can even take a walk early in the morning. 

855
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:16,620
 That is so indecent! 

856
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:17,900
 This is nice. 

857
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:20,190
 They only take reservations over the phone from 12 p.m. 

858
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:22,190
 That place is popular and we might not get it if we're late. 

859
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:23,630
 Don't worry. It doesn't matter! 

860
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:26,680
 I like the full-glass bathroom. I'll take the full-glass bathroom! 

861
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,550
 Just deny it. 

862
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,040
 We can't be a pervert. 

863
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:33,030
 I'm complaining because I got that room when I didn't want it. 

864
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:35,750
 Wung, no!
