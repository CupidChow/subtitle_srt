 Episode 4 
 Flower festival 

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,380
Oppa Wu Gi.

6
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,020
Let's not make Eonni uncomfortable and next time let's all-

7
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,240
Why would I be uncomfortable?

8
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,410
- Excuse me? 
 - What's wrong with just the two of us going?

9
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,200
I don't mind. I like it this way even more.

10
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,820
Let's go together, Wu Gi.

11
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,820
  ♫ Do our eyes keep meeting? Or were you just looking at something behind me? ♫ 

12
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,400
♫  It's busy inside my head all day long  ♫

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,150
  ♫ 'm going to continue to hide it so you won't know how I feel. ♫ 

14
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,300
Answer her, answer her!

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,060
Answer her!

16
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,170
Reply to her, Chae Wu Gi!

17
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,160
Reply to her!

18
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,950
Boo! 
 ♫  Whether you know it or not, you make my heart flutter  ♫

19
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,750
Sure, sounds good.

20
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,180
♫  I really want to know how you feel  ♫

21
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,130
Let's go with each other, Seonbae.

22
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,930
Then, should we meet late in the afternoon?

23
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,730
If we want to see the fireworks too.

24
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,050
Sure, sounds good.

25
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,350
Chae Wu Gi! Just a moment, please.

26
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,740
Yes.

27
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,720
- I'll give you a call tomorrow morning. 
 - Okay.

28
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,530
You said you liked fireworks, right?

29
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,830
♫   I want to hear your heart  ♫

30
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,700
This coffee tastes good.

31
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,740
Guys, I'm feeling dizzy.

32
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,330
Hooray, Love! Hooray, Yumi!

33
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,250
But, someone is missing.

34
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,700
- Who? 
 - Fashion.

35
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,050
- Where is she? 
 - Well...

36
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,120
Well, about that...

37
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,970
 There is a prison in the cells' village. 

38
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,050
 Criminal cells that were ruining Yumi are imprisoned here. 

39
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,900
Fashion has been in solitary confinement for two years.

40
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,550
  The tragedy started with a dress. 

41
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,260
- Yi Da. 
 - Yes?

42
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,700
- How does this look on me? 
 - Incredible

43
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,980
It looks so good on you.

44
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,680
- It's nice, right? 
 - Yes.

45
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,220
This is 50% off, so it's 70,000₩  (≈$60) .

46
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,440
Buy it, buy it! You absolutely have to.

47
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,450
Just by looking at it, I know it's for you.

48
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,480
But I have nowhere to go wearing this.

49
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,730
It's so pretty though.

50
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,930
It's pretty but would I wear this to the office? Or to the market?

51
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,250
Go on vacation. You can just wear it on your vacation.

52
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,150
Vacation?

53
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,250
Do you want to go there? You know that place I told you about last time.

54
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,990
Phuket in Thailand, for 499,000 won  (≈ $420) .

55
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,070
- Phuket? 
- Yes!

56
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,530
You have to go to Phuket at least for this. This is destiny.

57
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,150
Hey. It really looks good on you.

58
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,320
Where did you find it?

59
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,340
Phuket?

60
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,470
 In order to wear a 70,000₩ dress, 

61
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,600
 Fashion made her go for a 499,000 won trip to Phuket. 

62
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,670
They don't match.

63
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,320
 And then made her buy sandals to match the dress. 

64
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,700
I was going to buy them anyway.

65
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,160
To wear the sandals, she had a pedicure.

66
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,870
For the new dress, the new sandals

67
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,150
and the new pedicure, she made her get a perm.

68
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,330
- How much is it? 
 - 100,000 won  (≈ $85). 

69
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,560
- I'll pay— 
 - Together please.

70
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,640
It's all right.

71
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,750
Is this all mine?

72
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,380
But it was still fun.

73
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,400
Let's really work hard starting tomorrow.  See you.

74
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,530
The Phuket trip that started with a 70,000 won dress

75
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,100
ended in using up three months' worth of her salary.

76
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,790
 Total 11,390,000 won  (≈ $9,500) . 

77
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,430
What's the point of being a penny pincher,

78
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,030
saving money using the account books and being thrifty?

79
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,360
There's nothing left because of Fashion.

80
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,010
Even the savings.

81
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:15,710
If this continues, Yumi won't ever own a house in her lifetime.

82
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,870
Please, punish Fashion severely.

83
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,410
That's right, that's right!

84
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,370
Punish severely!

85
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,000
Fashion cell is guilty!

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,120
Let go of me!

87
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,950
Hey, penny pincher! Try saving for the rest of your life!

88
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,180
Do you think you can buy a house if you do that?

89
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,220
At that rate, you won't be able to live that way anyway.

90
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,570
Why are you putting this on me?

91
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,430
What did I do wrong in this damn world?

92
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,430
Prisoner number 32931, Fashion cell.

93
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,960
What?

94
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,300
Come out. You got released on parole.

95
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,700
Fashion. You had a hard time, right?

96
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,930
What happened?

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,900
You unanimously got a special pardon.

98
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,300
Do you want some tofu?* 
 (In Korea, people eat tofu when they get out of prison) 

99
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,160
Since when do you put people in prison and then give them a special pardon out of nowhere?

100
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,630
Well... It's because Yumi got a date.

101
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,800
- A date? 
 - Fashion, it's been three years since we had this opportunity.

102
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,950
We need your help.

103
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,240
Today is the day.

104
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,780
Hey now! Guys, guys!

105
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,510
Everyone come get one of these! It's a special price quiz.

106
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,480
How far will today's physical contact go?

107
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,370
If you guess the answer correctly,

108
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,390
there will be a lot of prizes given out after the date.

109
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,360
- Me! 
 - Me too!

110
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,480
Hey.  How far will it go today?

111
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,800
I think number three. They are both grownups.

112
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,290
Wow, so many have gathered.

113
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,670
It's been a while since we had a date, so everyone must be excited.

114
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,800
You guys, can you come here?

115
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,970
Are you all set?

116
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,900
You guys didn't buy any clothes

117
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,630
while I was in prison. Huh?

118
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,230
I need things to wear. What am I supposed to do?

119
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,130
That's why we needed your excellent fashion sense.

120
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,570
Exactly!

121
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,110
Today's date concept is an effortless natural look.

122
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,340
What is an effortless natural look?

123
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,010
Don't you know?

124
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,230
We see each other every day at the office. 
  Dressed up but not dressed up. 

125
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,060
It will be weird if I suddenly dress up too much. 
  Effortless natural look 

126
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,890
 That's why I went for an effortless natural look. 

127
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,950
 A no makeup-makeup look. 

128
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,330
 But it's a delicate different touch. 

129
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,010
 It looks like you're wearing something roughly put together, but it's an intentional match. 

130
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,910
 Ta-da! That's exactly an effortless natural look.  

131
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,280
What is that?

132
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,730
It's the same as usual.

133
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,720
It's not an effortlessly natural look, but just no effort.

134
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,940
What are you talking about? The details make the difference.

135
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,030
What about wearing something like a dress?

136
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,790
It's still the first date.

137
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,050
That's right. There's a date romance that men look forward to.

138
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,320
Why are you guys acting so tacky?

139
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,550
Since when is a dress romantic?

140
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,280
Is it too simple?

141
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,390
I look like a farmer.

142
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,300
 No, it's an effortless natural look! 

143
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,200
Should I change?

144
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,870
Who could it be?

145
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,520
- Hello? 
  - Hello? 

146
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,190
- Who is this? 
 -  Seonbae, it's Wu Gi. 

147
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,280
Oh, Wu Gi! Whose phone is this? This is not your phone number.

148
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,290
Oh, I am borrowing someone's phone right now.

149
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,300
- I realized that I forgot my cell phone at home. 
 - Oh really?

150
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,690
That's why I am calling you in case we miss each other.

151
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,200
I am at the flower festival right now

152
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,510
Already?! Oh no! I'm still at home.

153
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,740
Take your time. I'll be taking a look around.

154
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,420
I am in front of the fountain right now.

155
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,380
Do you know where the garden fountain is?

156
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,530
Yes, I know where the garden fountain is.

157
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,240
Good, I will wait here.

158
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,470
All right, I will be there soon. I can get there in 10 minutes by taxi.

159
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,090
Fine.

160
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,050
Oh, right! But...

161
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,590
Yes?

162
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,690
But how did you know my number?

163
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,670
You said you don't have your cell phone.

164
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:58,050
I somehow remembered it. I must have memorized it naturally.

165
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,770
 I gave it a try and I got the number right. 

166
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,100
Oh my gosh, this is crazy! He memorized Yumi's phone number!

167
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,750
This definitely means he likes her, right?

168
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,230
This is so nice!

169
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,310
- Let's even get a kiss today! 
 - I am going to pick number 4.

170
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:29,630
- Is number four... number four is kissing? 
 - Then, I want to do number four, too! 
 - I like number four.

171
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,590
I will be there soon! Please wait a little bit.

172
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,390
Yes, please come soon. Today's weather is so nice!

173
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,070
I will hang up now.

174
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,580
Thank you for your phone.

175
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,240
 Day of Celebration for Yumi's Date 

176
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,970
Love is here!

177
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,950
Guys! That day has finally come!

178
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,610
Let's cheer for Yumi so that she can have

179
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,110
a great date, because it's been a really, really, really long time. Come on, let's cheer!

180
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,880
- Yumi! 
 - Ride the wave!

181
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,560
Let's go Yumi! Wu Gi is waiting!

182
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,240
♫  Are you paying attention to me?  Or  is it meaningless?  ♫

183
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,210
Taxi!

184
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:02,120
♫  Do our eyes keep meeting? Or were you just looking at something behind me?  ♫

♫  It's busy inside my head all day long  ♫

186
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:12,550
Taxi! 
♫  I'm going to continue to keep it hidden so you won't know how I feel  ♫

187
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,000
Driver, please go to Eungaram Park.

188

♫  Am I the only one you're nice to?  ♫

189
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,260
♫  Am I the only one who thinks so?  ♫

190
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,960
Thank you!

191
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:33,120
♫  I really want to know how you feel  ♫

192

♫  I want to hear your heart  ♫

194
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,500
 Ruby 

195
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,990
Oh no! It's Ruby!

196
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,800
Why is she calling me?

197
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,820
What is it? Why is Ruby calling?

198
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,540
Didn't Ruby say she was going to a wedding in Busan?

199
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,340
- Does she have something to say? 
 - Maybe it's to check if the two of them are on a date?

200
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,920
Oh, that must be it! Then let's pick up that phone

201
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,110
and tell her that they are having fun so Ruby can get even madder.

202
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,570
This girl. What is she so curious about?

203
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,720
Wait...

204
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,910
Something does not feel right.

205
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,730
- I don't think it is a simple call. 
 - Then what is it?

206
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,890
- I don't know what it is but I think it is to mess things up.

207
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,250
There is no need to ruin a good day.

208
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,630
  Missed Call - Ruby    

209
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,310
Don't call because I am not going to answer it.

210
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,970
Ruby is here! Ruby is here!

211
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,670
Guys, calm down!

212
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,120
She's crazy! Did she really show up?

213
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,420
She said she was going to Busan! Didn't she go?

214
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,450
She probably came from Busan on a train to interfere, that psycho!

215
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,960
But ... isn't what Ruby is wearing the real date look?

216
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,520
Exactly...Who was the one that advocated the ''effortless natural" style...?

217
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,430
We requested Fashion's parole for nothing.

218
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,970
Yumi! Run!

219
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,870
Run, Yumi!

220
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,950
Run, Yumi!

221
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,390
Run, Yumi! 
  #RunYumi 

222
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,140
Run, Yumi!

223
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,630
Eonni!

224
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,400
Eonni Yumi!

225
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,690
This is bad! What should we do?

226
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:24,020
Did you hear? Ruby called Yumi. She must have seen Yumi.

227
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,150
It does not matter. That is not what is important!

228
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,690
The important thing is this moment, today.

229
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,750
Wu Gi left his phone at home, so as long as they can get rid of Ruby, they can go on a date.

230
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,920
- That's right. 
 - Run, Yumi!

231
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,730
Stay strong, Yumi!

232
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:43,630
Love is about winning!

233
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,390
Eonni Yumi!

234
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,720
I'm sorry!

235
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,760
Eonni!

236
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,960
1, 2, 3!

237
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,690
Gosh!

238
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,520
Stay strong, Yumi!

239
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,860
 800 meters Garden Fountain 

240
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,360
Why is she so fast?

241
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,460
 800 meters Garden Fountain 

242
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,560
What is that?

243
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,070
Oh! What's going on? What was that?

244
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,160
Oh, be careful!

245
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,930
 Love is about winning. 

246
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,830
Stay strong, Yumi!

247
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,650
Wu Gi!

248
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,270
Seonbae!

249
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,830
I'm here.

250
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:09,400
Did you run here? Why? You are not late.

251
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,350
Oh, I was worried you might be waiting.

252
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,760
I'm all right, though.

253
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,670
- Should I go buy some drinks? 
 - No, never mind.

254
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,370
- I'll get some water at least. If you wait– 
 - Never mind!

255
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,440
That's okay. I'm okay, so let's leave.

256
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,730
What?

257
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,320
It's because I'm so hungry.

258
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,410
Let's leave and get something to eat, then we can come back, that's okay, right?

259
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,790
Of course, that's okay. But why lunch...?

260
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,160
- Good! 
 - Seonbae. Seonbae. If we want to leave, it's this way.

261
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,890
Let's go to the back exit. There are a lot of restaurants there.

262
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,660
- Back exit? 
 - Yes, there are a lot of good places to eat there.

263
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,080
Ah, wai—

264
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:50,540

267
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,200
♫  My heart is running far away there  ♫

268
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,720
There aren't any restaurants.

269
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,790
Oh...there used to be some somewhere here.

270
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,980
I don't think there will be any.

271
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,100
I must have been mistaken.

272
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,670
Let's go back in and leave from the front...

273
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,150
- Taxi! We can ride the taxi. Let's ride the taxi! 
 - What?

274
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,450
Taxi! Taxi!

275
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,210
- Do we need to take a taxi? 
 - Yes, we'll get there quickly.

276
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,810
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

277
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,180
Where are you going?

278
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,170
Oh, yes. Please take us to Baekma Station, sir.

279
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,750
Baekma Station is quite far from here, isn't it?

280
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:51,150
Since we are going to eat, let's go to a good place in Ilsan. I will buy.

281
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,230
All right. I would like that.

285
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,330
Where is she?

286
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:27,030
Kim Yumi! Kim Yumi!

287
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:34,410
Sunbae. Your phone is ringing.

288
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,430
I don't need to pick it up. It is spam.

289
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,600
Nice, Yumi!

Wow! Woohoo!

293
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,750
Eonni, are you really going to be like this?

294
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,190
I saw everything!

295
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,010
Are you really not going to answer your phone?

Sorry, Ruby.

298
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,500
Please order.

299
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,160
I am so hungry.

300
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,220
But you still haven't had lunch yet?

301
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,570
It just happened that way.

302
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,160
But will you be all right?

303
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,380
What?

304
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,650
We're delayed because of me.

305
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,600
Ah ... that's fine with me.

306
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,480
It's not important to see the flowers.

307
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,980
It's nice to meet and talk together like this.

308
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,090
I mean, I'm worried you might be busy.

309
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,700
I have a lot of free time today.

310
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:56,500
We can hang out here, and once the sun goes down, we can go back when the fireworks start.

311
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,360
Let's do that.

312
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,850
- Woohoo! 
 - Yay!

313
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,530
He looks good even when he talks.

314
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,950
That's why you can't help but like him.

315
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:16,660
But... just looking at this place, I can tell the food is going to be good.

316
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,300
This place is really good! I guarantee it.

317
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,990
I already had lunch, but I am getting hungry again.

318
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,770
You should eat. It would be a waste if you don't eat here.

319
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,780
What should I eat?

320
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:43,380
Do you have a type that you like, Seonbae?

321
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,070
I like all the food here.

322
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,130
I mean, not food but men.

323
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,510
What?

324
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,630
What type of man do you like?

325
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,590
I am not sure...Why?

326
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:06,360
I just... suddenly got curious.

327
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,000
I was always curious about you, Seonbae.

328
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,260
About what?

329
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:18,180
Just... like getting to know you personally.

330
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,790
Yumi!

331
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,940
What do you mean by getting to know me personally?

332
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,790
For example...

333
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,620
For example...?

334
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:43,000
Is there a secret boyfriend that the coworkers do not know about?

335
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,480
Is there one?

336
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,090
- I don't. 
 - Really?

337
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,180
I really don't.

338
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,160
That's a relief.

339
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,420
Oh my gosh. I think my heart will explode.

340
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,120
Restrain yourself. I think an important comment will be made.

341
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,500
Then...Sunbae...

342
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,550
Yes?

343
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,410
Do you..

344
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:35,260
want to go on a blind date?

345
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,660
What did he just say? A blind date?

346
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,840
Love. What happened?

347
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,720
What's going on here?

348
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:32,600
♫   I am here   ♫

349
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:38,180
♫   I am comfortable   ♫

350
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,730
A blind date?

351
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,370
Yes.

352
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:47,300
There's a great guy I know and I'd like to introduce you to him.

353
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,790
Are you interested?

354
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,740
So...

355
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:02,680
you want to introduce me to that man?

356
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,760
Yes. I thought you two would match well, so I keep thinking about it.

357
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,530
Actually, he lives in Ilsan.

358
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:15,980
So that's why when we both went to Ilsan that time, I was thinking of introducing him to you naturally.

359
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,350
 Seonbae, you live in Ilsan, right? I'm also going to Ilsan because I have plans there today. 

360
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,410
 I was thinking of giving you a ride there if you ended early. 

361
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:34,300
 Yumi's Date Day 

362
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,420
That was what it was?

363
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,310
He wanted to set her up on a blind date?

364
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:43,710
I can't believe this. Why would he confuse her?

365
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,040
Guys, let's escape for now. It is a downpour.

366
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,160
Love, hurry up!

367
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,410
So, I...

368
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:12,470
But because Ruby interrupted that day, she met him instead.

369
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,130
I see.

370
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,090
He is a really great guy! I guarantee it.

371
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,840
But ...why me?

372
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,420
There are a lot of female workers at our company.

373
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:36,360
- Because you are a very, very great person. 
 - I am?

374
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,290
Seonbae, you have a great personality

375
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,660
and you are also pretty.

376
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:50,350
If I am that great, then you can just date me.

377
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,790
If I am that great,

378
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,050
then you can just date me.

379
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,370
What?

380
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,040
I'm just joking.

381
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:25,270
But ... what about you?

382
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:29,690
Are you just matchmaking when you don't have a girlfriend either?

383
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,050
Or is that not it?

384
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:41,730
Ah... did you have a girlfriend?

385
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,620
No, I don't.

386
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,640
- But you have someone you like, right? 
 - Yes.

387
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,840
I do.

388
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,050
Guys, escape!

389
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,550
It is a big flood.

390
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,700
Oh, really?

391
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,090
That's surprising.

392
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,260
Don't tell me, that person works with us?

393
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,320
I guess she really does work with us.

394
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,410
Don't tell me... Is it Ruby?

395
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,660
- No, it isn't. 
 - It isn't?

396
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,480
Then who could it be ...

397
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,200
Oh ...I am curious.

398
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,120
The person is not a woman.

399
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:17,070
Hurry up and escape before you get washed away!

400
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,030
What about you?

401
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:28,970
If I give up right now, Yumi might start crying.

402
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,530
I will stay back and protect Yumi's dignity.

403
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:36,140
- Then I can't go either. 
 - I will stay too.

404
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,210
Yumi! Stay strong!

405
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,700
You can't cry!

406
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,910
I see.

407
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,990
I see.

408
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:59,590
- It's a secret, Seonbae. 
 - Of course! Don't worry!

409
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,520
But ...is it all right for you to tell me these things?

410
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:11,440
I just... think that you will be able to keep my secret.

411
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,770
I feel like I can trust you, Seonbae.

412
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:21,180
Really? Thanks for trusting me.

♫  In my favorite movie  ♫

414
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,890
- Then... about the blind date? 
 - I'll do it.

415
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,550
- You want to do it? 
 - Yes. I'll do it.

416
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,320
That's great. I think you two will match well.

417
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,400
Then, can you give me your cell phone?

418
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,600
Why?

419
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,800
Since we are on the topic, I will ask him, and I'll save his number here.

420
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,830
His name is Gu Wung.

421
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,020
 Gu Wung 

422
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:59,330
Did you also memorize his number?

423
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:05,920
I'm naturally good at memorizing numbers. Even if I don't try, I can memorize them well.

424
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,360
Is that so?

425
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:17,390
I see. It's because you can memorize numbers well.

426
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,040
Seonbae. You are getting a call from Ruby.

427
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,700
Can you please pick it up for me?

428
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,610
- Where are you going? 
 - I need to go to the bathroom.

Guys!!

450

 Hello, Kim Yumi. I got your contact information from Wu Gi and am leaving you a message. I'm Gu Wung.

 Chae Wu Gi 

454
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:56,160
Hello? Yes, Wu Gi. This is Sae Yi.

455
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,930
Gu Wung just stepped out for a moment. I will have him call when he comes back.

456
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,480
Oh, he's here. Just a second.

457
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,560
Get the phone.

458
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,110
- Me? 
 - It's Wu Gi.

459
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,690
- I can see all the missed calls. 
 - So?

460
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:16,140
- So you don't have to answer. 
 - I answered it because it was loud. Otherwise, you should put it on silent mode.

461
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:23,880
Hello? Yes, I went to get coffee.

462
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,790
I'm busy. Hurry up and tell me.

463
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,380
A blind date?

464
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:37,580
With that seonbae you mentioned before? Was it Yumi?

465
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:42,980
This weekend? I don't have much going on. Yes.

466
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,740
All right.

467
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,460
Hey, are you going on a blind date?

468
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,090
I didn't even ask for it but he keeps insisting.

469
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:55,960
- I'm jealous. Why doesn't anyone recommend me? 
 - Why would that be?

470
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,810
Why don't I have any offers?

471
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,430
Think carefully about why no one's asking you.

472
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,300
So, are you going on a blind date?

473
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,970
I have no reason not to.

474
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,920
- Is it the seonbae at Wu Gi's company? 
 - Yes.

475
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,360
He keeps saying that we'll get along well.

476
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,780
- Didn't he say you were the same age? 
 - Yes.

477
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:22,010
But did you know that women at your age think about getting married?

478
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,170
- Really? 
 - Didn't you know?

479
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,890
They are all like that.

480
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,350
It's just a blind date though.

481
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:33,060
You really don't know women.

482
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:38,810
Don't take it seriously, just think you're going to have a cup of tea and leave.

483
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:44,990
I don't want to. I want to have tea, food, and even have alcohol.

484
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,330
I'm just going to do whatever I want.

485
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,730
What? I'm saying this because I'm worried about you.

486
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,200
What are you guys doing? Having a couple's fight?

487
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,870
 Assistant Manager Kim Yumi 
 Here's Yumi's contact information. You should contact her first. 

488
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,620
 Assistant Manager Kim Yumi 
 Here's Yumi's contact information. You should contact her first. 

489
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,920
 Save a new contact number 

490
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,540
 Hello 

491
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,920
 Hello Kim Yumi. 

492
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,870
 I got your contact information from Wu Gi and am leaving you a message. 

493
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,620
 I am Gu Wung. 

494
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,110
Hey, 'Let's bite my nails'

495
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,160
and 'Should I cut my bangs or not' cells are both missing.

496
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,240
- We also couldn't find the 'Sensitive' sisters or the 'Easy-going' brothers. 
 - Health...

497
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,930
Are you really going to name all the cells that are missing?

498
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:26,420
Ah, all right. To summarize.

499
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,220
Including Love and Inner Feeling,

500
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,640
a total of 389,216 cells

501
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,770
have gone missing due to the flood of tears.

502
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:36,430
This kind of record flooding is the first since three years ago.

503
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,010
Love, are you all right?

504
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,960
I'm fine, Inner Feeling.

505
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,720
How do we get out of here now?

506
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,460
I don't know either.

507
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,480
Are we going to just stay here?

508
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,390
It might be better to stay here.

509
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,950
What do you mean?

510
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:10,880
I don't think we are that helpful in Yumi's life.

511
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,410
When I woke up and once you came out from her heart,

512
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,740
I think Yumi became more unhappy.

513
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,970
- Don't you think so? 
 - Yes.

514
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,160
It might be better for Yumi

515
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,870
to live without love or sincerity.

516
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,680
Yes, that's right.

517
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,100
The rest of the file can be sent via email.

518
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,120
Yes, thank you.

519
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,710
Goodbye.

520
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:52,240
They are so picky.

521
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,370
Did they say to check again?

522
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:57,050
No, it is all done. Job well done.

523
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,710
Good work.

524
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,390
Assistant Manager Kim, you did well too.

525
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,290
Job well done.

526
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:05,260
You two worked hard, even coming in on a Sunday.

527
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,250
I will buy you something really delicious for lunch. Let's go out.

528
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,800
Really?

529
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,210
What are you going to buy?

530
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:15,700
Choose whatever you both want to eat. I'm in a good mood!

531
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,760
Hey Yumi. What should we eat?

532
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,010
- Anything. 
 - Let's tell him to buy us something expensive.

533
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,450
Should we go to New Yorker?

534
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,270
What about steak and wine?

535
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,260
All right.

536
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,990
Are you not feeling well?

537
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,600
I'm fine.

538
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,580
You don't seem that fine. Why do you seem to be down?

539
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,790
It's not that way.

540
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,760
Did you decide what to eat?

541
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,890
Manager, since the weather is so nice, can we take a drive and eat in the suburbs...

542
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,130
We probably can't, right?

543
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:45,270
Why not? That sounds good.

544
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,380
Really? Then can we go to Yangpyeong—

545
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:52,080
Sorry, but I have other plans so I cannot go out too far.

546
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,320
What plans do you have for the weekend? You are free.

547
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,190
I really have plans.

548
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:01,190
Assistant Manager Kim, you're not mad at me because I made you come in on Sunday, right?

549
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,350
No, that's not it.

550
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,550
But why do I feel like you are mad?

551
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,270
You wouldn't be making up plans today that you don't even have, right?

552
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,110
That's right.

553
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:12,700
You have plans on the weekend.

554
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,990
Facial expression control lever?

555
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:17,680
is completely broken. 
 - Can't you fix it?

556
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,820
It is a discontinued product, so it cannot be fixed.

557
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,930
No, that can't be. Since we can't control her facial expressions,

558
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,790
everyone is walking on eggshells around her.

559
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:28,100
There's nothing we can do about it. How can someone always be in a good mood?

560
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,470
But today is her blind date. How can she be like that even on her blind date?

561
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:33,420
Can't she just cancel?

562
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,380
If she agreed and suddenly cancels,

563
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,690
what would Wu Gi think?

564
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:40,700
Why did she say she will go to  the blind date? Especially today!

565
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,320
What is the rush?

566
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,470
Sensitivity, it's already arranged.

567
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:49,260
I really do not want to go!

568
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,550
Then, do you want to try using this?

569
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:55,760
- What is that? 
 - The name is Reaction Version 1.

570
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,770
It is a doll that automatically gives reactions.

571
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:00,160
Automatic reactions?

572
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,100
Yes. It's very easy to use too. Just press this button.

573
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,120
No way! That is so funny!

574
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,910
Oh my stomach! Hahaha

575
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:13,480
It gives reactions appropriate to the situation.

576
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,660
Wow! That's good!

577
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:18,720
Give me that.

578
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,540
Assistant Manager Kim, if you don't want to go, we can just go somewhere close by–

579
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,900
I really have plans! I agreed to go on a blind date!

580
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,390
- What? 
 - Really?

581
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,610
I wasn't going to tell you. Darn it.

582
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,080
You are going on a blind date today?

583
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,960
Yes, so I have to go hurry home to wash up and look good.

584
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,060
Please understand!

585
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,970
Of course. Then hurry and go home so you can get ready!

586
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,930
Hey, what's up? You're going on a blind date?

587
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,050
I'm jealous, Assistant Manager Kim.

588
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,020
Don't go overboard.

589
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,060
Enjoy your blind date and tell me all about it.

590
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,380
- Assistant Manager Kim. 
 - Yes?

591
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,560
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

592
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,380
Thank you!

593
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:04,240
It is an automatic reaction so it isn't that fine-tuned.

594
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:08,580
Side effects are overreacting and putting on an act.

595
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,990
But this is enough. It is better than being sad.

596
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:14,940
All right, let's go with this.

597
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,950
It won't be obvious that she's putting on an act from one blind date.

598
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:21,820
I'll do well and promise to tell you all about it, Section Chief.

599
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:26,120
I'll do well and promise to tell you all about it, Section Chief.

600
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:33,030
Is she all right?

601
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:35,160
I am not sure.

602
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,900
I'll be back.

603
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,020
- Where are you going? 
 - I'll be back.

604
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:47,190
- Where are you going? 
 - On the blind date.

605
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:48,870
Wait.

606
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,840
You are going like that?

607
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,810
Why?

608
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,710
How can you go on a blind date wearing that?

609
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:56,900
- Do I look bad? 
 - Of course, it's bad.

610
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,710
Don't you think of how Wu Gi would look?

611
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:00,850
I put an effort into my appearance.

612
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,880
If this is what you call putting in an effort, then it's a bigger problem.

613
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,490
Hey, Louis! Hey, friend!

614
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,410
Do I look bad?

615
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,820
You always look bad. When are you not?

616
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,450
He needs to at least have some courtesy.

617
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:17,920
I don't think the blind date will go well.

618
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,280
But you told me to not be serious and just have a casual tea.

619
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,080
If you say that this outfit is impolite, then I should just head out like this.

620
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:29,280
Do you always have to do the opposite?

621
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,660
Sae Yi is a bit odd.

622
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,260
Nuna* Sae Yi? Why? 
 (=lit "older sister", but also used to non-related slightly older women) 

623
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,360
She makes me confused.

624
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,710
Like how?

625
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:52,670
Christmas Eve? Of course I have plans.

626
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:55,020
Why are you even asking?

627
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,890
Did someone say we look like a couple?

628
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:05,180
People in the next-door office.

629
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,780
Oh my... What can I do?

630
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:11,140
I've never thought of you as more than a friend.

631
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,200
She would say that and then...

632
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,000
- What is this? 
 - Some side dishes.

633
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,890
Don't order out too much.

634
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:31,330
It's time we take care of our health.

635
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:37,540
Give me your hand.

636
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:46,070
- What is this? 
 - Chew it. It is vitamin jelly.

637
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:48,400
No, that's all right.

638
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:24,670
Wung! I cannot sleep. Can I call?

639
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,270
It's cold!

640
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,380
Ah it is warm.

641
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,830
She is always like that.

642
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:45,230
What does she think of me?

643
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:48,370
What else could she think? She thinks you're a total pushover.

644
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:52,640
- What? 
 - I don't want him but don't want to give him to others.

645
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,640
- Isn't that it? 
 - Is that what she thinks?

646
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:59,180
Gosh...

647
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,350
That's why I told you.

648
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,660
- Blind date. 
 - Are you talking about Yumi again?

649
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,110
The Kim Yumi whom I have not even seen before?

650
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:08,670
She is really a great person!

651
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:11,960
- You guys would get along well. 
 - I really don't like blind dates.

652
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,040
Please just trust me once.

653
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,980
I am too busy for a blind date. Is she pretty?

654
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,380
She is cute.

655
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,180
I guess she's ugly.

656
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,240
Hey...

657
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,160
Hey, come here. Pass!

658
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,270
Hey, you sly...

659
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:02,470
 Then I'll see you in front of the Bonjour Fountain at 3 p.m. 

660
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:06,720
 All right. I am carrying a red bag today.

Are you Gu Wung?

 What's going on? 

677
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,100
 She's pretty. 

678
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,090
By any chance, are you Gu Wung?

679
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:18,260
 Even her voice is cute. 

680
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:21,760
You're not Gu Wung?

681
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,370
I'm sorry.

682
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:27,390
I am.

683
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:34,360
I am Gu Wung.

684
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,480
 I'm nervous. 

685
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,970
But don't be nervous, Wung! All right?

686
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:57,710
We just have to follow "The Blind Date Manual."

687
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:00,550
First, take her to a café and ask her if she wants to get some tea.

688
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:02,350
After that ... What?

689
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,550
What is this?

690
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:10,490
Don't tell me his mind is going blank!

691
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:11,920
Everybody!

692
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,380
His mind is going blank.

693
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,190
 This is the first time since he was a senior taking the college entrance exam. 

694
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:23,890
 Foreign Language Section 

695
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,830
This is bad!

696
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:31,410
His mind is going blank in front of his blind date!

697
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:35,360
Is anybody there?

698
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:38,270
Someone help me!

699
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:43,500
I have no idea what to say!

700
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,750
 Why isn't he saying anything? Is he an idiot? 

701
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,800
 What's with his hairstyle? Does he think he's Beethoven? 

702
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,500
 He has a beard. I hate it a lot. 

703
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,620
 Look at his shorts and flip-flops. 

704
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:06,980
 Clearly, this man has no manners. 

705
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,650
I don't like him.

706
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:13,490
I'm scared of that type of guy. He looks like a bully.

707
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:15,240
But he has a handsome face.

708
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,830
Who cares if he's handsome? He looks the type who doesn't shower.

709
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:21,660
His beard is messy.

710
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,790
There's nothing more to see. I don't like him.

711
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:27,080
Still, let's not make it so obvious, for Wu Gi's sake.

712
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,890
Don't worry. We have this.

713
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:32,030
You know the drill. Show us some reactions.

714
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:33,800
Hello!

715
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,490
Hello!

716
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:39,010
Wu Gi has told me so much about you.

717
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:42,390
He told me numerous times that you're a good friend.

718
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:45,140
That's why I wanted to meet you once.

719
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,230
Ah...

720
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,770
Pardon?

721
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:52,710
Why isn't he saying anything?

722
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:54,450
Doesn't he like Yumi?

723
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:57,020
Does he have high standards? He's really annoying.

724
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,380
Let's just hurry up to get some coffee and leave.

725
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:02,480
It's hot today, isn't it?

726
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,620
The weather is so hot today, isn't it?

727
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,180
Do you want to go for some coffee?

728
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:10,410
There is a place that I regularly go to, I really recommend it. It's right up front here.

729
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:12,460
Do you not want to go?

730
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,590
It's really close, though.

731
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:22,610
Then where should we go?

732
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:28,290
Where are you going?

733
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:30,620
Excuse me, Mr. Gu Wung.

734
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:38,080
Where are you going?

735
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:38,880
What?

736
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,120
I asked, where you were going?

737
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,020
The place you recommended.

738
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:52,460
I was confused. It's not that way, we have to go this way.

739
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,830
It's here.

740
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:19,160
They specialize in pour-over coffee. It's good.

741
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,590
Do you want to go in?

742
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:26,190
If not, we can go somewhere else...

743
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,040
I'm sorry.

744
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,540
Are you all right?

745
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,730
Wow, what is wrong with him?

746
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:46,940
Isn't he really an idiot?

747
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,880
Guys!

748
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,070
Wung became a total idiot!

749
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:54,990
Please, anyone, answer me. Please?

750
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:56,770
Over here.

751
00:57:56,770 --> 00:58:00,290
- What, who's there? 
 - I'm over here.

752
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:01,820
Put aside your worries.

753
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:05,210
I will control Wung.

754
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:06,760
Who's talking right now?

755
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,470
Me? I'm an essential element of a blind date.

756
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:11,440
An expert of adlibs.

757
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,440
Who?

758
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,770
Don't tell me you're...

759
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:15,750
It's me!

760
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:18,020
Wung's humor cell!

761
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:22,420
I'll make him be a hit today too! Pang! Pang!

762
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:27,770
Are you all right?

763
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:31,620
I think you need to put on some ointment.

764
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:36,190
Are pharmacies open today too?

765

What time is it now?

766
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,100
Did you ask what time it is?

767
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,240
- Yes. 
 - It's Seoul*. 
  (*T/N: Seoul the city sounds the same as Seoul time.) 

768
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:58,820
What time? It's Seoul.

769
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:04,120
That's funny.

770
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,420
- Do you know this one? 
 - What?

771
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,740
Do you know what a gentleman says when he introduces himself?

772
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:10,980
I'm not sure.

773
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,010

01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,540
 That's why I told you to hurry up and go home! 

797
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,430
 I don't want to go home yet. 

798
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:46,770
 How did your blind date go? 

799
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:48,730
 Who's the really handsome guy? 

800
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:50,510
 There are women that are like that. 

801
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:55,590
 If she's replying late every time or not replying at all like this, just think of this as a rejection. 

802
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:57,850
 Don't lose to Hysterius! 

803
01:00:57,850 --> 01:01:01,020
 You might regret letting him go. 

804
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:05,620
♫  I'm so curious it's driving me crazy  ♫
