00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:46,217
Medical scanning.

3
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:05,130
Mr. Hong, you have visceral fat.

4
00:01:05,213 --> 00:01:08,971
We developed this AI scanning system.

5
00:01:09,055 --> 00:01:12,436
It can detect all kinds of illnesses.

6
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:15,025
You can come down now.

7
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,987
Goodness, well done.

00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:18,156
EPISODE 10

9
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,327
I think you should visit our hospital.

10
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:23,668
When can we see the cultured organs?

11
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,462
Ah, before we do that,

12
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:28,385
you should know that this system contains

13
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:30,890
all transplant-related information
that's been revealed to the public.

14
00:01:30,973 --> 00:01:33,688
But that's information
that's already been disclosed.

15
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:35,817
This AI needs to be at a level

16
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,446
where it could perform
mistake-free surgery if it had arms.

17
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:42,079
But to do this, we need your help.

18
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:46,462
Please input all the information
and technology that you have.

19
00:01:46,547 --> 00:01:50,888
Right. As well as your operation videos.

20
00:01:50,972 --> 00:01:55,021
How can we possibly digitalize
our expertise?

21
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:57,944
It'd take months.
My ten years of expertise--

22
00:01:58,027 --> 00:01:59,948
I'm not in any rush.

23
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:03,246
My life is on the line here.

24
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,004
I'm not going to get on this bed
until everything is perfect.

25
00:02:08,465 --> 00:02:09,467
As you all know,

26
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:13,726
one mistake,
and everyone here will pay a hefty price.

27
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:18,067
We're trying to avoid any mistakes,
not steal your knowledge.

28
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:20,740
No, that's not what we're concerned about.

29
00:02:20,823 --> 00:02:22,284
Do you want to see the organs?

30
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:24,371
They're in there.

31
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:32,346
It took us ten years to get that far.

32
00:02:36,062 --> 00:02:37,481
So please begin.

33
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:47,292
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

34
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:51,927
RESEARCH DIRECTOR
RESEARCH TEAM 2 LEADER

35
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:57,479
What an irresponsible research director.

36
00:03:11,717 --> 00:03:12,719
Were you gaming?

37
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:14,723
Are you my mom?
Why are you checking on me?

38
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:18,354
Do you have the killer's number from
when he was masquerading as a pastor?

39
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:23,532
I do, but why do you ask?
Even the police couldn't track it.

40
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:27,039
That just means he's still using it.

41
00:03:27,122 --> 00:03:29,043
I sent the number.

42
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:35,723
And his social security number?

43
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:42,069
Your call cannot be connected.
You will be redirected--

44
00:03:42,152 --> 00:03:43,822
It's somewhere here. Here it is.

45
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:47,580
Jang Yeongsil,
send a voice message to this number.

46
00:03:47,664 --> 00:03:48,666
Yes, ma'am.

47
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:53,341
"Ji Sunwon. Born on January 2, 1988.

48
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:56,222
I know who you are.

49
00:03:56,305 --> 00:04:00,690
Come meet me if you want to live.
This is Yun Jayu." Send.

50
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,109
Message sent.

51
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,031
Why would you meet a killer?

52
00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:07,745
You can tag along if you're worried.

53
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:11,628
Hey, he's probably with DORSON.

54
00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:13,799
Do you think he'd read that and show up?

55
00:04:15,928 --> 00:04:18,141
That's what I thought at first.

56
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:21,857
I thought DORSON was hiding him,
but the text Haedeun sent…

57
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:26,323
SISTER
ENGINEER MIGHT GET CAUGHT

58
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:31,292
She would've known if he fled to DORSON
after committing the murder.

59
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,298
But we tricked her into thinking
that he would get caught,

60
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:36,803
and she even tried
to report back to DORSON. Why?

61
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:40,060
Does DORSON not know where he is?

62
00:04:40,143 --> 00:04:43,650
-Why did he run--
-Because his instincts told him to.

63
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:46,907
Don't try to resolve this on your own.

64
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,964
Don't feel pressured to resolve everything
before your surgery

65
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:56,342
by meeting up with him.

66
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:59,389
It's bad enough your bodyguard is gone.

67
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:05,443
-Carry on with your game.
-I wasn't--

68
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,080
Don't do it. Okay?

69
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:13,544
Don't say I didn't warn you.

70
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:22,102
Ji Sunwon. Born on January 2, 1988.

71
00:05:23,312 --> 00:05:24,941
I know who you are.

72
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,864
Come meet me if you want to live.
This is Yun Jayu.

73
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:39,971
I'm going to chase you
to the ends of the Earth, Ji Sunwon.

74
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:43,562
It doesn't matter where you are.

75
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:47,193
You killed my people, and I will find you.

76
00:06:20,218 --> 00:06:24,769
You're just a ticking bomb to DORSON.
A killer forever.

77
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:29,403
Do you think they'll embrace you
or get rid of you?

78
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:32,033
You already know.

79
00:06:33,244 --> 00:06:36,000
Everything from your identity
to your entire life is a lie.

80
00:06:36,793 --> 00:06:41,636
Their best option is for your body
to be at the bottom of a river.

81
00:06:42,596 --> 00:06:44,141
It's their easiest solution.

82
00:06:51,113 --> 00:06:54,620
You also know who can save you.

83
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:01,091
POISONING SPECULATION

84
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:03,220
Make up your mind
before you end up like Professor Kim.

85
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:10,778
All right. Let's go. I'll go to him.

86
00:07:10,861 --> 00:07:13,950
I'll beg if I have to.
So put in a good word for me…

87
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,581
…and say I came willingly.

88
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,351
BLOOD FREE

89
00:08:38,995 --> 00:08:40,958
Hae-- Haedeun.

90
00:08:42,085 --> 00:08:43,087
Goodness.

91
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:44,882
Can you see me?

92
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,262
Can you see me?

93
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,434
Doctor! Doctor!

94
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:53,608
Who are you?

95
00:08:56,446 --> 00:08:58,535
Yeongsil, look up articles about BF germs.

96
00:09:00,162 --> 00:09:01,833
Jang Yeongsil, call Ms. Yun Jayu.

97
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,962
Yeongsil--

98
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:06,718
What?

99
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:08,178
What's wrong, Jang Yeongsil?

100
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:12,228
-Jang Yeongsil.
-Yes, sir?

101
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:13,397
What was that?

102
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,900
What do you mean?

103
00:09:16,863 --> 00:09:18,115
System stability test.

104
00:09:25,004 --> 00:09:26,298
Yes?

105
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:28,427
Speaking.

106
00:09:29,387 --> 00:09:30,389
What?

107
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:36,068
When did she wake up?

108
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:52,100
I couldn't speak with her doctor,
and her mother was too frantic.

109
00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:54,187
"Mother"? As in Ms. Jeong's mother?

110
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,941
Yes, she's at the hospital.

111
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:01,619
We don't know if she's faking it or not.

112
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:02,788
But if it's really memory loss,

113
00:10:02,871 --> 00:10:04,917
she won't be able
to tell her mom about what happened.

114
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,506
Want to go instead?

115
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:13,726
How could I forget
she's someone's daughter too?

116
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,729
This is Ji Sunwon.

117
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:42,408
Yun Jayu, I want you to come. No one else.

118
00:10:45,498 --> 00:10:46,709
Where is she going?

119
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:49,047
Why is she going that way?

120
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:56,813
Promise me this.

121
00:10:56,896 --> 00:11:00,486
We don't know if he was sent by DORSON

122
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,410
or if he's really showing up
to make a deal with you.

123
00:11:04,494 --> 00:11:06,791
-Whatever it is, don't corner him.
-Okay.

124
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,128
Don't provoke him when he's up close.

125
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:10,841
I'll be behind you.

126
00:11:11,592 --> 00:11:12,426
I know.

127
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,101
We need him here.

128
00:11:18,898 --> 00:11:20,109
Mr. Woo Chaewoon.

129
00:11:26,664 --> 00:11:27,666
I know.

130
00:11:58,686 --> 00:12:00,774
Checking Area B.

131
00:12:00,857 --> 00:12:03,236
Area C, all clear until now.

132
00:12:07,704 --> 00:12:09,374
Find him at all costs.

133
00:12:10,794 --> 00:12:11,796
There.

134
00:12:15,553 --> 00:12:16,639
MR. ON SAN

135
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:19,060
A vehicle just entered.

136
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:23,778
There are two men inside,
but neither of them is him.

137
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,629
Stop the car.

138
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:35,510
Ms. Yun.

139
00:12:35,593 --> 00:12:36,595
What is it?

140
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,432
What's wrong?

141
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:43,776
Ji Sunwon! Open the door!

142
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:46,448
-Allow us.
-Move aside, ma'am.

143
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,178
Who sent you? Who gave you the orders?

144
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:06,906
Take me to BF. Save me.

145
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:10,997
Take him out.

146
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:18,638
No, Yun Jayu is taking him.

147
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:20,349
Stop her at all costs!

148
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,752
Catch them.

149
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:17,631
Where's Ms. Yun?

150
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:24,310
Jayu, no way…

151
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:29,863
No!

152
00:14:53,703 --> 00:14:56,040
Her liver, kidneys,
and femoral arteries have ruptured.

153
00:14:56,124 --> 00:14:58,754
-Her small intestine too.
-I'll bring the organs.

154
00:14:58,838 --> 00:15:00,758
Transplant initiative.

155
00:15:00,842 --> 00:15:02,929
Hold on. Where are the other doctors?

156
00:15:03,013 --> 00:15:04,683
There needs to be more than two of us!

157
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:05,768
Huh?

158
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:09,025
-What's this?
-This is based on your input.

159
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,613
That's you in your optimal state.

160
00:15:11,697 --> 00:15:13,199
The same goes for the rest of you.

161
00:15:13,283 --> 00:15:15,747
-I barely input half of mine.
-Same here.

162
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,251
This isn't our optimal state.
It's not complete.

163
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,715
We're running out of time.
You can already see your images.

164
00:15:22,217 --> 00:15:23,554
What will you do?

165
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:31,737
Scalpel.

166
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:42,007
All I know is that he was alive
when BF took him in their helicopter,

167
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:43,928
and he wasn't admitted to any hospitals.

168
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:54,783
That only leaves one place.

169
00:16:27,222 --> 00:16:29,101
The bench surgery is complete.

170
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,817
SENIOR RESEARCHER
BAE HUIJIN

171
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:02,794
What is it?

172
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:07,219
I just received the news.

173
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:09,306
They're doing a search and seizure
on our lab.

174
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,810
They want our hard drives too.

175
00:17:11,728 --> 00:17:13,356
They'll be here soon. What do we do?

176
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,905
What do you mean? You were just notified.

177
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:21,205
They told us on their way here
and considered that prior notice.

178
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,752
Where's Ms. Yun?

179
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,631
Was she really brought in injured?

180
00:17:25,715 --> 00:17:29,471
A few of the employees saw her.
What should we do?

181
00:17:29,556 --> 00:17:31,434
All right, I understand.

182
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:34,858
Tell everyone in there to leave.
I'm hanging up.

183
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:41,705
-Yeongsil.
-Yes, sir?

184
00:17:41,788 --> 00:17:42,832
Seal off the basement

185
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:45,462
except for the areas where On San,
Seo Hui and Hong Saeip are located.

186
00:17:45,546 --> 00:17:47,842
The entire basement has been sealed off.

187
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:19,238
I'm the chief investigator
at Jinchon Police Station!

188
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:22,369
We'll be carrying out
a search and seizure on BF's HQ and lab

189
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:26,419
due to BF's illegal activities
and violation of medical laws.

190
00:18:26,503 --> 00:18:29,926
Refusing will be considered
an obstruction of justice.

191
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:34,727
Obstruction of justice is only
valid if violence or threat is involved.

192
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:40,823
We'd appreciate your cooperation!

193
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:44,539
Simply refusing to cooperate
without committing assault

194
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:47,169
can't be considered
an obstruction of justice.

195
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:22,489
Why can't I see it anymore?

196
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:32,217
I'll fix it right away.

197
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:39,774
Jang Yeongsil. Jang Yeongsil.

198
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:18,095
BL2 LAB

199
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,435
What was that noise?

200
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:22,521
What noise?

201
00:21:22,605 --> 00:21:25,276
We need a large intestine too.

202
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,361
Okay.

203
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:29,994
They're providing us
with any organ we need.

204
00:21:30,078 --> 00:21:31,371
I hope we succeed.

205
00:25:25,464 --> 00:25:27,218
Drop the guns. Hands up.

206
00:25:29,055 --> 00:25:30,391
Drop the guns!

207
00:25:41,288 --> 00:25:42,833
Take me to the incubation room.

208
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,421
I don't know where it is.

209
00:25:52,476 --> 00:25:54,607
One, two…

210
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,171
The portal vein has been connected.

211
00:26:06,922 --> 00:26:09,636
The reperfusion is a success.
Now, the liver.

212
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,640
Drop the scalpel.

213
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:13,393
Hands up!

214
00:26:20,115 --> 00:26:21,117
Get down.

215
00:26:22,411 --> 00:26:23,413
Hurry up!

216
00:26:34,227 --> 00:26:35,647
Where are the cultured organs?

217
00:26:36,774 --> 00:26:38,068
Where are they?

218
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:39,445
They're in there.

219
00:26:40,406 --> 00:26:42,159
-The cultured organs.
-Bring him.

220
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:10,842
Look, officers.
May we resume the operation?

221
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:31,205
You can let him go.

222
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:16,755
VEHICLE CARRYING YUN JAYU

JTN NEWS BRIEFING

227
00:31:23,764 --> 00:31:24,766
Hello, Mr. Prime Minister.

228
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,060
Hello.

229
00:31:26,143 --> 00:31:29,693
I believe this is our first time meeting.

230
00:31:29,776 --> 00:31:32,824
First off, I'd like to thank you
for agreeing to do this interview.

231
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,455
It's very rare

232
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,754
for a high-ranking politician
to appear on our news.

233
00:31:39,838 --> 00:31:44,889
That's because many think
that we are critical of the government.

234
00:31:44,973 --> 00:31:50,943
Nevertheless, you agreed
to participate in this interview.

235
00:31:51,653 --> 00:31:53,114
I'll cut to the chase.

236
00:31:53,197 --> 00:31:56,663
Is it safe to say that you chose
to take the bull by the horns?

237
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,376
I'm not sure.

238
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:02,675
Is there even a need for that?

239
00:32:04,303 --> 00:32:06,600
I won't beat around the bush either then.

240
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:12,653
People said my father,
Chairman Seonu Geun, was a terrorist.

241
00:32:12,737 --> 00:32:16,160
They said he was behind
the horrendous tragedy

242
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:18,081
that injured his own father-in-law,

243
00:32:18,164 --> 00:32:20,085
countless government officials,
and foreign children.

244
00:32:22,464 --> 00:32:23,634
Do you believe that?

245
00:32:24,218 --> 00:32:26,263
Do you think it makes any sense?

246
00:32:27,057 --> 00:32:30,355
So who spread this ridiculous rumor first?

247
00:32:30,438 --> 00:32:35,365
It was BF, who took 11 innocent lives
in the recent shooting.

248
00:32:35,448 --> 00:32:37,662
They committed a massacre,

249
00:32:37,745 --> 00:32:41,711
then suddenly accused my father
of being a terrorist.

250
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:43,256
Yes, it was a massacre.

251
00:32:43,339 --> 00:32:46,470
But there's something
we shouldn't overlook.

252
00:32:46,555 --> 00:32:50,813
It's that the BF employee
who captured the terrorist

253
00:32:50,896 --> 00:32:55,238
served at AZORAN during the explosion.

254
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:58,745
He's Captain Woo of the naval forces

255
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:01,668
who escorted Lee Mungyu,
the former president.

256
00:33:01,751 --> 00:33:03,881
What are your thoughts on this?

257
00:33:03,964 --> 00:33:05,759
What are your thoughts on this then?

258
00:33:05,843 --> 00:33:11,897
That the same Captain Woo
was jailed for assaulting police officers.

259
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,403
I'm afraid I wasn't aware of that.

260
00:33:15,486 --> 00:33:17,700
What we know about him is--

261
00:33:17,783 --> 00:33:20,496
Well, to be honest,

262
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,835
I've known Captain Woo
for a very long time.

263
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,048
A very long time? How so?

264
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:31,268
He frequently visited my grandfather,
Lee Mungyu, the former president.

265
00:33:31,352 --> 00:33:33,189
He also wanted to meet my parents.

266
00:33:33,272 --> 00:33:36,278
He relentlessly asked them
to allow him to visit the terrorist.

267
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:38,784
I understand that he wasn't of sound mind,

268
00:33:39,535 --> 00:33:43,292
since he witnessed
that horrific tragedy in person.

269
00:33:44,754 --> 00:33:47,802
Are you insinuating
that Captain Woo accused Chairman Seonu

270
00:33:47,885 --> 00:33:50,724
of ordering the terrorist attack
due to a mental issue?

271
00:33:50,808 --> 00:33:52,102
Is that what you're saying?

272
00:33:52,185 --> 00:33:54,732
I'm asking you about Woo's stance.

273
00:33:55,316 --> 00:33:58,281
I've never heard him claim

274
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:02,540
to have unveiled the true mastermind
behind the terrorist attack.

275
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:06,005
We've reached out to BF as well
to do an interview--

276
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:09,344
I'm just saying that BF
is using the poor soldier.

277
00:34:09,428 --> 00:34:11,891
He's a retired soldier
suffering from severe PTSD.

278
00:34:11,975 --> 00:34:15,607
They're trying to make him look credible
by emphasizing his past feats.

279
00:34:16,693 --> 00:34:20,450
I understand that they were panicking
since they lost 11 of their workers.

280
00:34:21,368 --> 00:34:22,538
As for me,

281
00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:26,504
I won't simply beg you to believe
that my father is innocent.

282
00:34:26,588 --> 00:34:28,675
They said the former soldier

283
00:34:28,759 --> 00:34:32,015
captured an individual
who knew the real culprit.

284
00:34:33,017 --> 00:34:35,689
Fine. Let's start from there then.

285
00:34:36,315 --> 00:34:41,492
They claimed that my father
paid the terrorist.

286
00:34:42,077 --> 00:34:44,916
I will clear up
all the suspicions you have about it.

287
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,170
That bastard.

288
00:34:48,507 --> 00:34:49,759
He knows.

289
00:34:49,842 --> 00:34:52,681
By "all suspicions,"
do you mean the AZORAN attack

290
00:34:52,765 --> 00:34:57,065
as well as the armed group that raided BF?

291
00:34:57,148 --> 00:35:01,825
Some people say that Chairman Seonu did it
to keep BF's mouth shut.

292
00:35:03,745 --> 00:35:06,960
Let's be professional, shall we?

293
00:35:07,795 --> 00:35:11,051
Ms. Yun's bodyguard was murdered,

294
00:35:11,135 --> 00:35:14,642
and her life was in danger
when she was in the car with the killer.

295
00:35:14,725 --> 00:35:18,399
Couldn't it be possible
that these two cases are related?

296
00:35:18,482 --> 00:35:22,867
Captain Woo, who accused Chairman Seonu,
is also her bodyguard.

297
00:35:23,535 --> 00:35:24,411
I…

298
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,459
trust my father.

299
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:32,595
It's not because I'm the prime minister
or because he owns DORSON.

300
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:35,308
I trust him as his son.

301
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:37,938
Let me issue one warning

302
00:35:38,523 --> 00:35:43,157
to BF and Yun Jayu who refuse to apologize
for causing this great commotion

303
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,328
and continue to talk nonsense.

304
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:49,545
You'll be responsible
for more than just defamation.

305
00:35:49,629 --> 00:35:55,056
Then it should be concluded
that everything BF said was untrue.

306
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:57,143
We have already come to that conclusion.

307
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,696
Sir, would you have a listen
to this voice recording?

308
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,909
-Sir.
-Where are you?

309
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:08,374
I'm at the hospital.
BF thinks I'm suffering from memory loss.

310
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:12,841
What? And they bought that?
No, first things first.

311
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:15,304
What did the engineer say?
Did he mention me before he died?

312
00:36:15,388 --> 00:36:19,104
I'm not sure. They caught me
the day I sent you that text.

313
00:36:19,187 --> 00:36:21,776
Is Yun Jayu dead or alive? Do you know?

314
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,281
Do you not know either?
Didn't your men report back?

315
00:36:24,364 --> 00:36:26,661
They shouldn't report back.
They were caught.

316
00:36:28,038 --> 00:36:29,584
I don't know either.

317
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:32,463
I'm pretending not to remember anything
about DORSON or Ms. Yun.

318
00:36:33,048 --> 00:36:34,175
Hey, hang up.

319
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:39,019
Okay. First, I'd like to apologize
to our viewers.

320
00:36:39,102 --> 00:36:44,195
The female voice in that recording
is fake.

321
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,749
It was created by AI technology
using a real BF employee's voice.

322
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,376
However, the male voice is real,

323
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,592
and the conversation
was recorded in real time.

324
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:58,642
This female employee is suspected
of having acted as a spy at BF.

325
00:36:58,725 --> 00:37:03,108
BF has identified the male individual
in the phone conversation

326
00:37:03,192 --> 00:37:06,616
by conducting a voiceprint analysis.

327
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:11,083
However, we've agreed to only disclose it
once it's proven to be true.

328
00:37:15,341 --> 00:37:16,426
Father.

329
00:37:19,684 --> 00:37:21,688
How could you make such a mistake?

330
00:37:24,902 --> 00:37:26,321
Were you in on it too?

331
00:37:27,616 --> 00:37:29,996
You ruined your son's life.

332
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,500
Why do you think I left you unscathed?

333
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:37,176
It was because of Jae.
I didn't want to hurt him.

334
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,807
But this is what I get in return?
How could you?

335
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:42,688
You're so pathetic.

336
00:37:43,606 --> 00:37:46,403
Honey… Honey…

337
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,535
Persuade him.

338
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:53,292
He shouldn't do this to me. We're family.

339
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:58,385
Tell him that I'll take care of everything

340
00:37:58,469 --> 00:38:01,308
and that he should sit tight.

341
00:38:02,936 --> 00:38:05,734
Answer me. I'm talking to you.

342
00:38:08,072 --> 00:38:12,539
I'll kill everyone
who refuses to listen to me!

343
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,958
Try me, you bastard.

344
00:38:20,096 --> 00:38:21,516
Did he know as well?

345
00:38:23,352 --> 00:38:24,187
Sorry?

346
00:38:25,397 --> 00:38:29,447
Did Jae also know who harmed me?

347
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,953
That it was his father?

348
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:35,752
No, he didn't know.

349
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:38,967
How could he?

350
00:38:59,215 --> 00:39:02,013
Dear citizens, I apologize.

351
00:39:02,598 --> 00:39:04,935
I've thought long and hard
about what I should say.

352
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:09,737
And the only thing I can think of
is apologizing to you all.

353
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,782
I'm sorry.

354
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:19,130
The AZORAN investigation committee
sent me their results today.

355
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:21,594
They had traced the flow of money

356
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:24,516
that was supposedly given
to the terrorist.

357
00:39:25,602 --> 00:39:28,315
And as a result,
the suspicions surrounding my father

358
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,862
were proved to be true.

359
00:39:31,864 --> 00:39:35,496
What a relief it would've been
if the results weren't as damning

360
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:38,878
and made me only slightly embarrassed

361
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:41,884
by how vehemently
I denied the allegations.

362
00:39:41,968 --> 00:39:42,970
DORSON SEONU GEUN

363
00:39:43,053 --> 00:39:44,055
You're still here.

364
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,775
Did you think I'd just sit still
if you feigned ignorance?

365
00:39:52,531 --> 00:39:54,409
What do you think I know?

366
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:58,876
Everything! The shooting and how I planned
to take everything from BF!

367
00:39:59,628 --> 00:40:02,091
The shooting? Me?

368
00:40:03,553 --> 00:40:06,767
And you're talking about
the search and seizure, aren't you?

369
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:10,775
Yes, I did tell you that I'd take
BF's illegal research results.

370
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:12,069
Even before then!

371
00:40:12,738 --> 00:40:14,783
South American gang, my foot.

372
00:40:17,163 --> 00:40:21,964
No one has ever linked that to our family.

373
00:40:22,048 --> 00:40:23,175
So why would you?

374
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,726
Do you have proof?

375
00:40:31,942 --> 00:40:36,326
I trusted my father completely,
so I never thought he'd do such a thing.

376
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:41,336
Would you understand if I told you
it was because one of the terror victims

377
00:40:41,419 --> 00:40:43,591
is someone I love deeply?

378
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:46,429
You don't care
that your grandfather is disabled

379
00:40:46,514 --> 00:40:49,853
as long as you can use him
as your excuse to overthrow me.

380
00:40:51,022 --> 00:40:52,400
And you provided that excuse.

381
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:57,577
He never listened to me.

382
00:40:57,661 --> 00:41:01,794
He thought he was still above me
when I made him the president.

383
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,463
And you're no different.

384
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,098
I won't let anyone steal anything from me!

385
00:41:10,854 --> 00:41:12,189
Steal?

386
00:41:12,691 --> 00:41:14,068
They're mine anyway.

387
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:18,326
Yes, they are. All of this.

388
00:41:19,078 --> 00:41:20,205
I'll give them to you.

389
00:41:21,374 --> 00:41:22,334
My one and only son.

390
00:41:22,919 --> 00:41:24,130
When will you do that?

391
00:41:25,508 --> 00:41:28,472
You said you were going to live forever.
Then what about me?

392
00:41:29,473 --> 00:41:31,477
Should I be your son forever?

393
00:41:33,816 --> 00:41:36,864
I'll let you live forever.
I'll keep my word.

394
00:41:37,657 --> 00:41:41,540
So going to prison for a few years
won't be a big deal.

395
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,922
-But you're the prime minister.
-So I have a term.

396
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,092
Unlike you, a chairman.

397
00:41:48,428 --> 00:41:52,729
Thanks to my profession,
I can cover up for you in many ways.

398
00:41:52,812 --> 00:41:53,981
So what will it be?

399
00:41:54,065 --> 00:41:56,904
Will you take responsibility
for what's been revealed so far?

400
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,950
Or shall we go the distance?

401
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,246
Is it really because you want this?

402
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:03,208
Or is it because
of what I did to your mom?

403
00:42:03,793 --> 00:42:06,799
What's the biggest reason
you're doing this to me?

404
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:08,426
What?

405
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,640
To hide his actions,

406
00:42:10,723 --> 00:42:14,355
my father attempted
to harm more individuals.

407
00:42:14,438 --> 00:42:20,535
Now that he has harmed Ms. Yun
as well as many others,

408
00:42:20,618 --> 00:42:24,585
I can only promise you two things.

409
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:28,216
First, a strict investigation
will be carried out

410
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,304
regarding any additional suspicions.

411
00:42:31,097 --> 00:42:33,561
Second, I, Seonu Jae,

412
00:42:33,644 --> 00:42:36,984
acknowledge my shortcomings
and will resign from my position.

413
00:42:41,034 --> 00:42:45,292
I will step down from my position.

414
00:42:49,216 --> 00:42:50,385
Thank you for everything.

415
00:42:51,387 --> 00:42:55,312
I offer my sincere apology
to all the victims of the AZORAN attack

416
00:42:55,395 --> 00:43:00,447
as well as the numerous incidents
that came afterward.

417
00:43:02,661 --> 00:43:05,374
Dear citizens,
I apologize for disappointing you all.

418
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:09,966
However, this is a failure
merely within our family.

419
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,346
It has nothing to do with this country.

420
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,020
This proud country of ours

421
00:43:16,855 --> 00:43:20,738
will shine even brighter
through this tragedy.

422
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:24,871
If you allow me,

423
00:43:24,955 --> 00:43:29,548
I'd like to support our country
as a mere citizen.

424
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:34,933
I am truly sorry
and grateful for everything.

425
00:43:36,394 --> 00:43:37,354
AS A MERE CITIZEN

426
00:43:37,939 --> 00:43:39,483
As a sinner.

427
00:43:44,578 --> 00:43:45,580
A sinner?

428
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,196
You weren't a traitor.

429
00:44:06,037 --> 00:44:07,832
You were used too.

430
00:44:12,382 --> 00:44:14,345
Or is it the same thing to them?

431
00:44:15,598 --> 00:44:17,519
You visited me at the hospital before.

432
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,484
You work for BF, don't you?

433
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:32,047
You've been diligently visiting
your psychiatrist.

434
00:44:32,632 --> 00:44:33,884
For whom?

435
00:44:33,968 --> 00:44:37,684
You fabricated my voice
and turned me into a spy in the media.

436
00:44:38,644 --> 00:44:41,482
I'm not a fool.
I just can't remember. That's all.

437
00:44:47,494 --> 00:44:51,335
We've known each other
for about three years now.

438
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:54,593
But it feels like we met
in our past lives.

439
00:44:59,351 --> 00:45:01,063
We're no longer watching you.

440
00:45:05,865 --> 00:45:08,369
Does that mean
you've been watching me all along?

441
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:15,926
Ms. Jeong Haedeun.

442
00:45:16,595 --> 00:45:18,933
Take care of yourself from now on.

443
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:23,483
Don't be like Professor Kim
or that engineer.

444
00:45:28,911 --> 00:45:30,330
What happened to them?

445
00:45:37,637 --> 00:45:39,766
Who are they?

446
00:45:43,649 --> 00:45:46,530
Ms. Jeong, please come inside.

447
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:52,875
What kind of person was I?

448
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,428
I hope my memory comes back soon.

449
00:46:02,645 --> 00:46:06,277
Perhaps, I lived such an ordinary life…

450
00:46:08,489 --> 00:46:11,412
that I could've been boring.

451
00:46:14,919 --> 00:46:18,510
But still,
I hope my memory comes back soon.

452
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,102
DORSON SEONU JAE

453
00:46:23,186 --> 00:46:26,150
There were many items,
so it took us some time to move them.

454
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,824
But we brought everything
from the search and seizure.

455
00:46:31,703 --> 00:46:35,210
Thank you for all your hard work.
I hope to work with you again soon.

456
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,464
Thank you, Chairman Seonu.

457
00:46:37,548 --> 00:46:41,472
Also, congratulations
on becoming the new chairman.

458
00:46:42,057 --> 00:46:43,894
You've already said that many times.

459
00:46:47,527 --> 00:46:50,240
Oh, yes. We believe Ms. Yun is dead.

460
00:46:52,118 --> 00:46:56,586
We suspect they're keeping it secret
that she died during the operation

461
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:59,007
in case it affects
the organ culture business.

462
00:46:59,091 --> 00:47:01,847
Though we don't know
how long it can be kept under wraps.

463
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:04,101
Goodbye then.

464
00:47:10,656 --> 00:47:11,658
You're dead?

465
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:20,676
After giving me this…

466
00:47:25,143 --> 00:47:26,186
Jayu…

467
00:47:28,232 --> 00:47:29,401
are you really dead?

468
00:48:03,177 --> 00:48:05,849
Why didn't you report it
to the police right away?

469
00:48:05,933 --> 00:48:09,189
I thought the armed men
were part of the police force.

470
00:48:09,273 --> 00:48:11,235
It looked like they came
for the search and seizure.

471
00:48:13,072 --> 00:48:17,414
The deceased were shot,
had their necks broken or were suffocated.

472
00:48:17,497 --> 00:48:18,792
Who did that?

473
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:23,301
It wasn't the work of one individual.
We all played a part.

474
00:48:23,384 --> 00:48:25,764
We were trying to stay alive.

475
00:48:27,852 --> 00:48:29,271
Even Ms. Yun?

476
00:48:30,023 --> 00:48:31,275
Of course not.

477
00:48:35,534 --> 00:48:37,037
Was she gravely injured?

478
00:48:37,621 --> 00:48:41,086
She didn't participate in the fight.
She's the CEO, after all.

479
00:48:51,608 --> 00:48:53,570
No!

480
00:49:06,053 --> 00:49:08,642
What about now? How is she doing?

481
00:49:10,394 --> 00:49:13,442
She told me
to explain everything to the prosecution.

482
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:18,662
Why can't we reach Mr. Woo Chaewoon?

483
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:23,295
You can't?

484
00:49:24,422 --> 00:49:26,218
I haven't gotten around to it yet either.

485
00:49:41,583 --> 00:49:42,626
You did it.

486
00:49:44,714 --> 00:49:46,008
You did everything and…

487
00:51:09,759 --> 00:51:12,055
Jang Yeongsil, where am I?
