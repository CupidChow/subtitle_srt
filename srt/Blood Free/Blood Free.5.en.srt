1
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:43,921
BLOOD FREE

2
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:54,442
Hold on tight!

3
00:01:17,906 --> 00:01:19,075
EPISODE 5

4
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:35,566
Jang Yeongsil, what's going on?

5
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,323
The detection of firearm use
within a 2 km radius of the center

6
00:01:39,407 --> 00:01:41,077
has triggered the alarm.

7
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:46,713
Yeongsil, turn the screen on.

8
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:52,600
Here is the recorded surveillance footage.

9
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,002
TO BF CENTER

10
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:13,349
Yeongsil, fly the drones.

11
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:27,252
-Hello?
-Hello.

12
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:30,510
The location is 37.4769 degrees north.

13
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:31,720
Hello? Where are you now?

14
00:02:31,804 --> 00:02:34,016
And 127.1592 degrees west.

15
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:36,062
Sounds like a video game.

16
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,941
What's the matter?

17
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:45,581
CRIME HISTORY CHECK

18
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,587
I have located Ms. Yun Jayu.

19
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:56,018
Between the Mt. Cheonggak entrance and BF.
About ten armed individuals.

20
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,519
You're okay.

21
00:04:19,602 --> 00:04:21,982
Breathe. Keep breathing.

22
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,175
They're down there. Along with our people.

23
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:36,343
-Go.
-Four.

24
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:38,014
One woman and three men.

25
00:04:38,097 --> 00:04:41,353
And two of the men are armed.
Don't shoot them. They're bodyguards.

26
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:17,802
Over here!

27
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:18,887
The injured first!

28
00:05:26,235 --> 00:05:30,034
BLOOD FREE

29
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,459
Jayu!

30
00:05:36,422 --> 00:05:39,428
He needs blood right now,
or he won't make it.

31
00:05:39,512 --> 00:05:42,225
I'm a doctor. This way.
Please remove that!

32
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:47,235
I've got him.

33
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,864
One, two.

34
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:51,953
Ms. Yun, you should go.

35
00:05:52,037 --> 00:05:53,665
-Mr. Seo, hurry.
-Yes, sir.

36
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:54,918
Ms. Yun!

37
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,934
The bullet didn't penetrate.

38
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:05,396
I'm okay. He's the one who needs help.

39
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,150
There's nothing I can do right now.

40
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,462
-Jang Yeongsil.
- Yes, ma'am?

41
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:19,424
Activate the basement at HQ.

42
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:24,268
Let's head to HQ's basement.

43
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:23,010
One, two, three.

44
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:24,931
Done. Let's go.

45
00:07:25,014 --> 00:07:26,266
Join us after you treat him.

46
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,770
-Okay.
-Move aside.

47
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:29,565
Let's hurry.

48
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:57,830
Yeongsil, open the bed.

49
00:08:23,297 --> 00:08:24,675
Mr. Woo.

50
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:27,556
Does he have no pulse? Are we too late?

51
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:35,321
Jang Yeongsil, start the medical scan.

52
00:08:57,616 --> 00:08:58,743
It's beating.

53
00:08:59,537 --> 00:09:00,622
But it's slow.

54
00:09:08,888 --> 00:09:09,974
Does he need a transplant?

55
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:12,521
No, his organs aren't damaged.

56
00:09:13,105 --> 00:09:15,484
But that muscle is shredded.
A transfusion won't suffice.

57
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,280
We're not ready for this just yet.

58
00:09:56,859 --> 00:09:58,404
What about the necrosis?

59
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:00,867
We'll use cultured tissue.

60
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,746
Have we completed it?

61
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,334
Let's consider this
our first clinical test.

62
00:10:06,461 --> 00:10:07,296
It's not a test.

63
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:19,822
This is

64
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:22,368
our first success.

65
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,876
They raided the place
when only one person was on duty,

66
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,796
meaning they must've been here before.

67
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:32,430
We're analyzing the surveillance footage,
so we'll be able to identify them soon.

68
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:35,979
Eight died, and five were captured.

69
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,781
We got all 13 of them.

70
00:10:40,864 --> 00:10:44,287
However, Mr. President,
we have a bigger problem.

71
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,043
What could be worse than gang members?

72
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:51,511
The mastermind behind this incident
seems to have gathered the ex-convicts.

73
00:10:51,594 --> 00:10:53,598
With drugs as bait.

74
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:55,727
Correct. Drugs.

75
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,944
That they took the firearms and went
to Mount Cheonggak to attack means…

76
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,989
"A group of ex-convicts
gathered together to kill

77
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:04,745
a tycoon in exchange for drugs.

78
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:08,418
And what they had were police firearms
meant for protecting the civilians."

79
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:10,256
That'll be the gossip.

80
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:12,051
There's been a casualty at BF?

81
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:13,262
Who was it?

82
00:11:13,345 --> 00:11:15,057
They've yet to be identified,

83
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,896
but they were unconscious
and bleeding heavily when help arrived.

84
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,652
We believe they won't make it.

85
00:11:20,735 --> 00:11:24,158
I'll update you
on the casualties when I see you. Goodbye.

86
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:29,419
The National Police Agency will report
on the casualty once confirmed.

87
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:30,505
Let's go.

88
00:11:31,214 --> 00:11:33,511
A shoot-out in broad daylight
is already shocking,

89
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:37,226
but their boldness and aggressiveness
are unprecedented as well.

90
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,399
Yun Jayu, the CEO of BF, and her employees

91
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:42,111
fled the scene--

92
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:46,077
Jang Yeongsil, call Ms. Yun Jayu.

93
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:49,835
Yes, ma'am. Calling Ms. Yun Jayu.

94
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,214
Your call cannot be connected--

95
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:54,260
Jang Yeongsil, call Woo Chaewoon.

96
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:56,933
Yes, ma'am. Calling Woo Chaewoon.

97
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:00,189
WOO CHAEWOON

98
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:01,942
Can someone please pick up?

99
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:03,613
Call Kim Hoseung.

100
00:12:53,713 --> 00:12:55,717
DASHBOARD

101
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,210
Is it an immune rejection?

102
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,548
There's nothing more we can do.

103
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:19,263
They need to fuse together.

104
00:13:23,731 --> 00:13:25,192
What's the matter?

105
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:43,061
Breathe. Keep breathing.

106
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:44,063
Mr. Woo!

107
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:05,188
His vestibulocochlear nerve is damaged.

108
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:06,859
Huh?

109
00:14:06,942 --> 00:14:08,361
Yeongsil, is there an infection?

110
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:10,533
Mr. Woo's vestibulocochlear
and cochlear nerves

111
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,871
are 60% damaged at most.

112
00:14:12,954 --> 00:14:16,294
He may suffer from hearing loss,
ringing, or vertigo in his left ear.

113
00:14:17,463 --> 00:14:20,595
But his right ear is fine.
Could he have injured it before?

114
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:23,308
The explosion.

115
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:24,895
Explosion?

116
00:14:24,978 --> 00:14:27,692
Did he get hit by that grenade?

117
00:14:27,776 --> 00:14:29,738
No, it looks like an old wound.

118
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:31,240
At least a few years old.

119
00:14:32,284 --> 00:14:34,121
Where were you injured?

120
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:35,457
It doesn't affect my current job.

121
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,294
You left the military because of it.

122
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:38,923
It doesn't affect me.

123
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:41,929
Did he not get treated for it?
Doesn't that seem to be the case?

124
00:14:43,557 --> 00:14:45,561
Hey. It's working.

125
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,786
Gosh. I…

126
00:14:54,538 --> 00:14:56,332
I can't believe it worked.

127
00:14:57,459 --> 00:14:58,713
I've never seen this before.

128
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:00,717
None of us has.

129
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,749
Mr. Seo.

130
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:38,667
Yes?

131
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,005
We just need to treat
his outer wounds now. You can go.

132
00:15:42,382 --> 00:15:44,930
Well… That's okay.

133
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:49,480
Yes?

134
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:52,069
I'm okay.

135
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:57,162
I'm really fine.

136
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:01,797
The police are coming here?

137
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:05,303
Hold on.

138
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:12,234
Come to the lobby in five, Mr. Seo.
You'll be escorted.

139
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:14,823
I-- I will?

140
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:20,793
I can't believe I'll have bodyguards.

141
00:16:20,877 --> 00:16:22,839
"They took a byway due to construction,

142
00:16:22,922 --> 00:16:24,759
and that's where the shoot-out happened."

143
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:27,014
Just say that.

144
00:16:27,097 --> 00:16:30,437
The police asked about the victim
who was severely injured when rescued.

145
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:34,571
Ms. Yun.

146
00:16:35,488 --> 00:16:36,490
I'm okay.

147
00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:40,457
Are the police outside?

148
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,085
Yes, they want to know what happened.

149
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:45,217
But where are your bodyguards?
Why are you alone?

150
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,764
Tell them we'll cooperate
with the investigation.

151
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:50,561
As for the victim,
tell them he's been taken to a hospital.

152
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:52,523
-Who was the victim?
-My bodyguard.

153
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:54,443
Both of them?

154
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,199
Have Mr. Seo escorted
so he can go home in five.

155
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:23,669
The last time I saw Ms. Yun,
she was headed to the basement.

156
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,046
The basement?

157
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,554
Yeongsil, show me the basement floor plan.

158
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:31,183
I'm sorry,
but you don't have access to that.

159
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:32,603
Surveillance footage of HQ's basement.

160
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:35,610
I'm sorry,
but you don't have access to that.

161
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:04,041
-Yeongsil.
-Yes, ma'am.

162
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,630
Don't let anyone in.

163
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,509
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:32,264
Yeongsil, turn the noise off.

165
00:18:32,974 --> 00:18:36,397
The outside noise
currently measures at 27 decibels.

166
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,484
I don't detect any particular noises.

167
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:41,658
Turn that noise off.

168
00:18:41,742 --> 00:18:43,202
What noise are you talking about?

169
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,290
Please turn that noise off.

170
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:47,085
What noise are you talking about?

171
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:37,352
His surface antigen is being replaced
with cultured blood cells.

172
00:19:37,435 --> 00:19:38,730
And his heartbeat--

173
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,161
Ms. Hong was right.

174
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:48,750
She said you looked fine
when that was impossible.

175
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:52,758
Did she and Mr. Seo leave?

176
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:55,263
Yes. You should go and rest up too.

177
00:19:58,645 --> 00:19:59,814
Where should I go?

178
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:03,446
The owner of that house is here.

179
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:09,751
Exactly when
will they finish building your house?

180
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:12,172
In a few months.

181
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,596
I'll stay here for the night.

182
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:25,114
Those men were after you.

183
00:20:25,198 --> 00:20:27,285
You shouldn't be worrying
about him right now.

184
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,646
Who will take care of Mansik?

185
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:27,907
Your call cannot be connected.
You will be redirected to voicemail--

186
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:50,326
They approached me first.

187
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,704
YOON ***, BF TERROR SUSPECT

188
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:52,915
They promised

189
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:56,714
to give me
the supply rights if I cooperated.

190
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:58,760
By "they,"

191
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:01,473
he meant a gang
called Bosque Archi, right?

192
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:02,518
That's correct.

193
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:03,645
They became infamous

194
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:06,943
for kidnapping and murdering
a tropical rainforest environmentalist.

195
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:11,076
They even put a bounty
on BF's Yun Jayu's head last year.

196
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:12,746
The suspect just said

197
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,796
that the gang offered
to give him the supply rights

198
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,261
if he cooperated.
What are these "supply rights"?

199
00:22:20,344 --> 00:22:23,100
The supply rights of methamphetamine.
This overseas gang persuaded

200
00:22:23,183 --> 00:22:25,522
a Korean drug addict
to murder a company's CEO

201
00:22:25,606 --> 00:22:29,530
in exchange for access to drugs.

202
00:22:30,323 --> 00:22:34,707
It sounds too surreal to believe
that this is happening in Korea.

203
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,669
And boldly enough,

204
00:22:36,753 --> 00:22:39,675
the suspects raided
a police station's armory.

205
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,596
Mr. Seonu Jae, the prime minister,

206
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,810
just gave a public apology
regarding that matter.

207
00:22:44,894 --> 00:22:46,773
We feel deeply responsible

208
00:22:46,856 --> 00:22:50,614
for this unprecedented security failure
and promise our dear citizens

209
00:22:51,323 --> 00:22:52,826
that we will make improvements

210
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:54,956
regarding this matter.

211
00:22:55,498 --> 00:22:59,089
Any updates on the safety
of Ms. Yun or her employees?

212
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:02,220
Thankfully, there are no fatalities yet.

213
00:23:02,303 --> 00:23:05,978
What's even more shocking,
though only claimed by a minority,

214
00:23:06,061 --> 00:23:09,067
is that some believe this shoot-out
was planned by Ms. Yun herself.

215
00:23:10,027 --> 00:23:13,367
They claim that Ms. Yun, whom they think
murdered Kim, a BF executive,

216
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,793
may have planned this shoot-out
as a distraction.

217
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:23,095
Why is this CEO being criticized
when she almost lost her life?

218
00:23:23,972 --> 00:23:27,980
We must think about the pros and cons
that cell culture technology

219
00:23:28,063 --> 00:23:30,986
has brought to this society.

220
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:32,155
They criticize me…

221
00:23:32,238 --> 00:23:33,157
PARK CHEOLWON
FISHING SHIP CAPTAIN

222
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,330
…and say that I'm destroying
the environment. They say I'm old-school.

223
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:45,849
And now, they're going to culture fish?

224
00:23:46,768 --> 00:23:47,770
How--

225
00:23:52,362 --> 00:23:53,197
Hello, Father.

226
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,282
Is this what you meant

227
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:57,539
when you said
you'd use the soldier differently?

228
00:23:58,332 --> 00:23:59,334
I'm not following.

229
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:02,758
Jayu would do anything in her power
to save him.

230
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:05,179
Given how she even slept at his place.

231
00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:09,395
If BF saves him, then it's finally time.

232
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:12,443
If they fail,
it means they're not ready yet.

233
00:24:13,028 --> 00:24:14,782
I can just sit back and watch
thanks to you.

234
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:17,830
Your imagination has gone wild, Father.

235
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,459
I'm the prime minister.

236
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:24,426
Those lunatics raiding the armory
disrupted our peace and security.

237
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,846
Our people are trembling in fear.

238
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:27,724
And yet, you think I was behind it?

239
00:24:27,808 --> 00:24:29,937
How dare you play innocent
in front of me.

240
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,356
I'm not playing innocent!

241
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,989
Is this what you took me for?

242
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,450
Do you really think

243
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,832
I ordered those men

244
00:24:39,915 --> 00:24:42,963
to shoot Ms. Yun's bodyguard

245
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:44,174
to see how she'd react?

246
00:24:45,594 --> 00:24:46,721
So it wasn't you?

247
00:24:46,804 --> 00:24:48,390
Of course not.

248
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:51,271
All right.

249
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,622
We're almost certain that Whole-Omega

250
00:25:20,705 --> 00:25:23,753
is pulling out
of the cultured meat market.

251
00:25:23,836 --> 00:25:29,765
I'm not sure if the US
and Europe will respond differently.

252
00:25:29,848 --> 00:25:36,821
We said we'd invest more
in microbial plastic,

253
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:39,367
but we never said
we'd give up on cultured meat.

254
00:25:40,327 --> 00:25:41,496
Ms. Yun?

255
00:25:45,922 --> 00:25:47,843
Reach out to Whole-Omega.

256
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:50,097
Not the cultured meat department
but microorganisms.

257
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,521
Tell them we're interested in investing
in their microorganism technology.

258
00:25:53,604 --> 00:25:55,274
But we agreed
not to invest in bioproducts.

259
00:25:55,357 --> 00:25:56,192
We won't.

260
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:00,367
We'll be able to sound them out
if we say we're interested in bioproducts.

261
00:26:00,451 --> 00:26:03,624
Then they'll decide whether or not
to pursue cultured meat.

262
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:07,006
-Right.
-I understand.

263
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:09,302
We'll meet again after we hear the result.

264
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:22,161
Yes?

265
00:26:22,244 --> 00:26:23,497
I have to go somewhere.

266
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:28,758
I'll leave you to it.

267
00:26:28,841 --> 00:26:29,843
Got it.

268
00:27:27,124 --> 00:27:28,376
What?

269
00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:31,090
Look at you.

270
00:27:31,634 --> 00:27:33,804
I'm okay. This is nothing.

271
00:27:36,602 --> 00:27:39,148
I scanned the entire house once more.

272
00:27:39,232 --> 00:27:40,985
You don't need to worry, ma'am.

273
00:27:41,987 --> 00:27:42,989
Thank you.

274
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,666
Can you all gather here?

275
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:51,924
Let me explain.

276
00:28:06,537 --> 00:28:07,581
Mansik.

277
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:10,043
Hi.

278
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:14,260
I'm sorry.

279
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,932
You must've been lonely and scared.

280
00:28:33,173 --> 00:28:34,383
How did he do it again?

281
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:40,980
What's going on? Where's Mr. Woo?

282
00:28:41,064 --> 00:28:43,653
I was going to ask you that.
Don't you know?

283
00:28:43,736 --> 00:28:45,865
-Was he not with you?
-No.

284
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:49,873
By the way, are those men new hires?

285
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:49,821
CHECK IT OUT

286
00:30:49,905 --> 00:30:51,365
THE BED WAS OPENED
IN MANUAL MODE

287
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:25,706
You're awake? Are you okay?

288
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,628
Are you okay, ma'am?

289
00:35:31,634 --> 00:35:32,761
I'm okay.

290
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:36,519
Why am I okay?

291
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,483
Did you extract a bullet from my body?

292
00:35:40,193 --> 00:35:41,403
Yes, you got shot.

293
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,075
But…

294
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,789
I see no exit wound.

295
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:50,631
How's the pain? Can you move?

296
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:52,843
How are your ribs?

297
00:35:52,927 --> 00:35:56,266
They were cracked, so it must be painful
to move. Do you feel pain?

298
00:35:57,143 --> 00:35:58,980
Did you put these in my body?

299
00:36:01,068 --> 00:36:02,530
"These"?

300
00:36:02,613 --> 00:36:03,615
Pig organs.

301
00:36:05,201 --> 00:36:06,328
Did you transplant them?

302
00:36:07,706 --> 00:36:08,708
No.

303
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,257
Neither is true.
No pig organs, no transplant.

304
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:19,104
Then they're human organs.

305
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,118
Get out now.

306
00:36:28,372 --> 00:36:30,836
You were culturing human organs

307
00:36:31,504 --> 00:36:33,007
in this laboratory.

308
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:36,556
I said, get out.

309
00:36:46,743 --> 00:36:48,370
Now I get why you were worried…

310
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,586
about the government
keeping an eye on you.

311
00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:52,963
Who are you talking to?

312
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:56,386
Go back to your bed.
You can't move just yet.

313
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,223
I'll explain everything later.

314
00:36:58,307 --> 00:37:01,229
It's okay. I heard all I needed to.

315
00:37:01,313 --> 00:37:02,315
Mr. Woo.

316
00:37:04,194 --> 00:37:05,196
Go back to your bed.

317
00:37:06,073 --> 00:37:07,618
I'll do as you say.

318
00:37:19,558 --> 00:37:22,564
You were severely injured.
Your life was on the line.

319
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:29,870
I get that you can't remember,

320
00:37:29,954 --> 00:37:32,208
but you have no right to get mad at us.

321
00:37:37,761 --> 00:37:39,724
You shouldn't leave yet.

322
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,819
I don't know what to do anymore.

323
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:50,871
Hey.

324
00:38:06,611 --> 00:38:08,322
You shouldn't have let him go.

325
00:38:08,907 --> 00:38:11,996
Then tell him to come back here.
He's probably going home anyway.

326
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:15,085
I did everything I could, okay?

327
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,518
Neither of them will listen.

328
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:58,631
Was I too harsh?

329
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,766
Maybe I should've thanked them.

330
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:20,842
Hello?

331
00:39:24,474 --> 00:39:25,560
Who is this?

332
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,964
But they were unconscious
and bleeding heavily when help arrived.

333
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:42,385
We believe they won't make it.

334
00:39:48,898 --> 00:39:50,109
Right.

335
00:39:51,069 --> 00:39:52,196
My grandfather is asleep.

336
00:39:53,115 --> 00:39:55,494
He couldn't get much sleep yesterday.

337
00:39:55,578 --> 00:39:57,582
He was worried that you got hurt.

338
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,964
After all,
he was the one who sent you there.

339
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:04,847
Please give him my apologies.

340
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,057
Of course.

341
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:10,357
That's why I'm here instead.

342
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:11,276
Please sit.

343
00:40:12,028 --> 00:40:12,863
I'm okay, sir.

344
00:40:14,157 --> 00:40:15,994
You do look fine indeed.

345
00:40:18,123 --> 00:40:19,333
I'm truly relieved.

346
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:22,674
I had received a report

347
00:40:22,758 --> 00:40:25,972
about a civilian
who was critically injured.

348
00:40:26,974 --> 00:40:28,393
He's okay too.

349
00:40:29,938 --> 00:40:30,857
You both

350
00:40:32,276 --> 00:40:34,197
recovered swiftly.

351
00:40:36,827 --> 00:40:38,246
This is a good sign.

352
00:40:40,627 --> 00:40:42,129
Please tell Mr. President

353
00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:46,388
that I'll pay him another visit soon.

354
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:51,231
Don't provoke him
when he's already so feebleminded.

355
00:40:51,314 --> 00:40:53,694
Just agree with him every now and then.

356
00:40:54,278 --> 00:40:56,992
That way, you can keep him entertained.

357
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,288
What am I

358
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,879
supposed to agree with him on?

359
00:41:06,637 --> 00:41:07,973
Don't tell me

360
00:41:09,392 --> 00:41:12,774
you really think
there's another terrorist at large.

361
00:41:19,453 --> 00:41:21,416
The gravity of the situation.

362
00:41:22,627 --> 00:41:24,798
The magnitude of the circumstances.

363
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,512
The victims' identities.

364
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:33,023
All our investigative resources
went toward finding the mastermind.

365
00:41:37,782 --> 00:41:42,124
Your comrade who's imprisoned right now
wasn't set up. He was the one who did it.

366
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:47,092
My grandfather accepted
that fact right away.

367
00:41:47,176 --> 00:41:50,725
That is, up until he learned
that a delusional ex-soldier

368
00:41:51,727 --> 00:41:53,689
had his suspicions

369
00:41:54,942 --> 00:41:56,027
about the incident.

370
00:41:58,448 --> 00:41:59,492
Goodbye then.

371
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,456
You don't have the power.

372
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:06,966
There's no way you can turn the tables
regarding that case.

373
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:10,472
Then do you, sir?

374
00:42:14,898 --> 00:42:18,363
Will you be able to handle the aftermath

375
00:42:18,948 --> 00:42:20,535
if I catch the real culprit?

376
00:42:36,065 --> 00:42:38,320
Are you asking me

377
00:42:38,403 --> 00:42:43,288
if I can disclose and handle it
if your delusions turn out to be true?

378
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,171
Listen up, Captain Woo.

379
00:42:49,258 --> 00:42:50,469
Bring me evidence

380
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:53,141
if you're so confident.

381
00:42:54,645 --> 00:42:56,565
And I'll show you.

382
00:42:57,734 --> 00:43:01,491
You'll get a front-row seat
to watch how I deal with the bastards

383
00:43:03,203 --> 00:43:05,082
who blew off our president's legs.

384
00:43:31,718 --> 00:43:32,846
Care to have breakfast?

385
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:41,905
I'm freezing to death here.

386
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:44,619
It's only going to get
even colder at night.

387
00:43:46,289 --> 00:43:47,291
What are you craving?

388
00:43:58,522 --> 00:44:00,693
RINGTONE VOLUME

389
00:44:27,287 --> 00:44:29,124
10 YEARS AGO

390
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,089
Does it hurt that much?

391
00:44:39,688 --> 00:44:42,527
There's no treatment
that can beat old age.

392
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:47,954
How is the treatment?

393
00:44:49,164 --> 00:44:51,419
The best. I appreciate the invitation.

394
00:44:54,133 --> 00:44:56,513
I'm honored.
Where else could I meet an NBA player?

395
00:44:58,057 --> 00:45:01,480
How wonderful it would be
to live forever with your body.

396
00:45:02,357 --> 00:45:04,654
You want to exchange it with your company?

397
00:45:05,155 --> 00:45:06,575
Not with my company.

398
00:45:06,658 --> 00:45:10,332
But with money? For sure.
With the youth and strength.

399
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:14,298
You shouldn't be sure about it. The youth?

400
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:15,383
It doesn't last long.

401
00:45:16,678 --> 00:45:18,181
You think so, Ruz?

402
00:45:18,264 --> 00:45:20,811
Rookies who play my position
are coming up all the time.

403
00:45:20,895 --> 00:45:24,778
Like 18, 19 years old.
They never get exhausted.

404
00:45:24,861 --> 00:45:25,863
I hate them.

405
00:45:26,865 --> 00:45:28,661
I hate dying.

406
00:45:28,744 --> 00:45:31,499
I really hate dying. It's madly horrible.

407
00:45:31,583 --> 00:45:35,298
I don't need reincarnation.
I have zero interest in the next life.

408
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:39,641
Well, you might not be the fourth richest
man in the world in your next life.

409
00:45:39,724 --> 00:45:41,143
I have tons of money.

410
00:45:41,227 --> 00:45:44,233
With my power, there's nothing
that can't be done with my words.

411
00:45:44,316 --> 00:45:46,530
I should live 1,000 years.

412
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:49,284
Can a human body survive for 1,000 years?

413
00:45:49,368 --> 00:45:53,418
The day will come when the human body
can live up to 10,000 years,

414
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,296
not just 1,000 years.

415
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,092
I will make that happen.

416
00:45:57,175 --> 00:46:00,473
Then I'm first in line, Mr. President.

417
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:01,518
Of course.

418
00:46:01,601 --> 00:46:03,856
Then you can play basketball
like a teenager

419
00:46:03,939 --> 00:46:06,235
for the next 100 or 200 years.

420
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:09,324
And I'll always be there to watch.

421
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:12,247
Yeah!

422
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,178
It took a decade.

423
00:46:23,562 --> 00:46:24,773
Saggy skin.

424
00:46:25,566 --> 00:46:27,110
Brittle teeth.

425
00:46:27,862 --> 00:46:29,866
Aging organs.

426
00:46:30,993 --> 00:46:34,208
I'm going to replace them all
with new ones and live forever.

427
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,965
I deserve immortality.

428
00:46:38,049 --> 00:46:39,511
More than anyone else.

429
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:45,063
Why wait?
You confirmed it with your own eyes.

430
00:46:45,648 --> 00:46:47,777
His wound may not have been that deep.

431
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,073
Maybe the bullet just grazed him.

432
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:52,160
We'll dissect him and find out.

433
00:46:53,664 --> 00:46:54,498
Dissect him?

434
00:46:54,582 --> 00:46:56,168
The man's still alive and well.

435
00:46:56,795 --> 00:46:58,841
That way, we'll know
what transplants he got

436
00:46:58,924 --> 00:47:01,555
and compare our cloning technology
to their technology

437
00:47:01,638 --> 00:47:03,266
and see why only they succeeded.

438
00:47:06,606 --> 00:47:08,861
I'm going to fire all my researchers.

439
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:12,409
Let's put the dissection on hold.

440
00:47:12,492 --> 00:47:13,871
I've been waiting all my life.

441
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:17,460
What if his body

442
00:47:17,545 --> 00:47:20,008
rejects the transplants
and they rot inside?

443
00:47:20,091 --> 00:47:22,972
I understand your concerns.
You can wait. You're still young.

444
00:47:23,055 --> 00:47:25,393
I'm not young. I'm nearing my forties.

445
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:27,189
And I'm nearing my seventies.

446
00:47:27,272 --> 00:47:29,193
You don't look your age.

447
00:47:29,276 --> 00:47:30,529
But I feel it.

448
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,577
Even after a good night's rest,
my entire body aches

449
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,496
as if I've been beaten.

450
00:47:36,123 --> 00:47:39,087
Ms. Yun was just subjected to a shoot-out.

451
00:47:39,171 --> 00:47:42,302
We'll only heighten their wariness
if something happens to Captain Woo.

452
00:47:42,385 --> 00:47:47,062
Are you on their side?
Why are you always so eager to defend her?

453
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,109
Being bold and reckless
are two different things.

454
00:47:50,193 --> 00:47:53,157
I didn't make you the prime minister
so you could lecture me.

455
00:47:53,241 --> 00:47:55,203
These are your words.

456
00:47:55,286 --> 00:47:57,082
I learned them from you.

457
00:47:58,167 --> 00:47:59,169
Father.

458
00:48:02,217 --> 00:48:04,471
He's a goose that lays golden eggs.

459
00:48:05,473 --> 00:48:06,893
Let's take our time.

460
00:48:08,145 --> 00:48:10,274
We can make it seem like
someone who was after her

461
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:12,530
ended up kidnapping her bodyguard instead.

462
00:48:13,281 --> 00:48:16,913
Come to think of it,
we owe those men. Bos…

463
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:19,001
What was their name again?

464
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,715
-Bosque Archi.
-Right.

465
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:24,637
Her bodyguard got injured thanks to them.

466
00:48:24,721 --> 00:48:27,810
And we finally know
that it's time to take over BF.

467
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:52,400
What?

468
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:56,325
It's okay. He's with us.

469
00:48:57,452 --> 00:48:58,830
But…

470
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:05,259
Where were you?

471
00:49:10,311 --> 00:49:11,355
Let's go inside.

472
00:49:22,127 --> 00:49:25,509
We transfused 1.6 L of cultured blood
due to severe bleeding.

473
00:49:25,592 --> 00:49:29,141
We also added cultured muscle fibers
to your exit wound,

474
00:49:29,224 --> 00:49:32,690
fractured ribs, and ruptured arm muscles.

475
00:49:32,773 --> 00:49:35,779
The procedure itself was too simple
to be called a transplant.

476
00:49:35,863 --> 00:49:37,825
What's important is whether they'll fuse

477
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:40,246
with your cells,
or if your body will reject them.

478
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:41,916
But seeing how you're here,

479
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,335
it's a total success.

480
00:49:45,924 --> 00:49:48,680
Artificial blood could cause issues
with the red blood cell count

481
00:49:48,763 --> 00:49:50,183
and cause a heart attack.

482
00:49:51,226 --> 00:49:52,646
Is this wrong?

483
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:54,357
No.

484
00:49:54,441 --> 00:49:56,278
Your artificial blood was the only one

485
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:58,240
that passed the screening test
and was approved.

486
00:49:58,324 --> 00:49:59,827
Was I the only one in the dark?

487
00:49:59,911 --> 00:50:01,330
It hasn't been approved yet.

488
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:07,133
And I imagine the cultured muscle fibers
don't have any side effects.

489
00:50:07,968 --> 00:50:08,803
We're not sure yet.

490
00:50:08,887 --> 00:50:10,306
Excessive cell division.

491
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:14,272
And cell cycle issues caused by it.

492
00:50:14,356 --> 00:50:16,861
We don't know when that'll happen.

493
00:50:19,157 --> 00:50:21,078
You don't know?

494
00:50:21,161 --> 00:50:23,332
You must know
since you've worked out a lot.

495
00:50:23,415 --> 00:50:25,127
You could only recover swiftly

496
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:28,927
from the bone fractures and bullet wound
thanks to the strong muscle fibers.

497
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:31,306
And the blood also plays a major role

498
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:32,559
in bone recovery.

499
00:50:35,189 --> 00:50:36,734
Then why did you treat my ear?

500
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:38,404
Your ear?

501
00:50:39,657 --> 00:50:41,118
-Did you?
-Yes. Hold on.

502
00:50:48,675 --> 00:50:50,595
What was that?

503
00:50:58,402 --> 00:50:59,487
Turn that off!

504
00:51:04,372 --> 00:51:07,295
That was 30,000 Hz.
Humans shouldn't be able to hear that.

505
00:51:07,378 --> 00:51:08,673
Did you implant a chip in him?

506
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:10,677
You wanted to try it too.

507
00:51:10,761 --> 00:51:12,806
Why hesitate if we can fix him?

508
00:51:14,476 --> 00:51:15,311
Fix?

509
00:51:16,229 --> 00:51:17,231
You inserted a chip?

510
00:51:17,315 --> 00:51:18,860
If you don't like it,

511
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:20,697
-we can always remove it.
-Be quiet.

512
00:51:21,281 --> 00:51:22,241
Damn it.

513
00:51:24,914 --> 00:51:25,999
The electronic chip…

514
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,880
To be exact, it's electronic skin.
It's nothing illegal.

515
00:51:29,548 --> 00:51:31,009
It's still under development,

516
00:51:31,093 --> 00:51:34,057
but it's almost identical to real skin.

517
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,144
You can expect it to heal you.

518
00:51:36,228 --> 00:51:38,440
Who asked you to treat me? It wasn't me.

519
00:51:40,111 --> 00:51:42,073
Is that what you told the doctor
when you got hurt?

520
00:51:42,156 --> 00:51:43,743
To leave your ear as is?

521
00:51:46,123 --> 00:51:47,626
Why didn't you treat it?

522
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,755
Why were you punishing yourself?

523
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,133
I never said I was.

524
00:51:51,216 --> 00:51:54,431
You knew you could get surgery,
but you chose not to. Why?

525
00:51:57,478 --> 00:52:00,276
I was afraid
I'd become completely useless.

526
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:03,616
Why would receiving treatment
make you useless?

527
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,704
The injury was close
to the vestibular system.

528
00:52:05,787 --> 00:52:07,081
Treating it could've harmed it.

529
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,377
The doctor said
I might not be able to walk well.

530
00:52:09,962 --> 00:52:13,385
I didn't want to burden my family,
so I chose not to.

531
00:52:15,974 --> 00:52:17,226
Even the faintest sounds

532
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:19,523
feel unbearably loud
without noise cancellation.

533
00:52:19,607 --> 00:52:21,944
Everything sounds like an explosion now.

534
00:52:22,613 --> 00:52:23,865
So how will this treat me?

535
00:52:25,201 --> 00:52:27,371
You had turned on noise cancellation?

536
00:52:27,455 --> 00:52:29,501
Yet you could still hear us?

537
00:52:30,085 --> 00:52:32,006
Jayu, our technology
has greatly improved--

538
00:52:37,935 --> 00:52:38,937
That's enough.

539
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,407
I said, that's enough.

540
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:50,376
Let him go!

541
00:53:02,024 --> 00:53:03,987
-How high is it?
-The highest.

542
00:53:04,655 --> 00:53:05,824
Have you gone mad?

543
00:53:05,907 --> 00:53:08,036
It was my first time,
so I didn't know how to set it.

544
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,919
I begged him to stay yesterday,
but he still left.

545
00:53:12,003 --> 00:53:13,297
Lower it this instant.

546
00:53:15,384 --> 00:53:16,804
Receive treatment.

547
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:18,766
Keep your word.

548
00:53:21,271 --> 00:53:24,402
You told me that everything would be okay.

549
00:53:24,485 --> 00:53:25,906
It's okay.

550
00:53:26,866 --> 00:53:28,620
No one will get hurt, okay?

551
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:30,456
You said no one would get hurt.

552
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:32,753
You'd be lying if you left.

553
00:53:33,337 --> 00:53:34,172
Keep my word?

554
00:53:36,384 --> 00:53:37,721
On the first day we met,

555
00:53:37,804 --> 00:53:40,434
I asked you not to experiment with me
as if I were cultured meat.

556
00:53:41,646 --> 00:53:44,359
When will you stop being money-hungry?

557
00:53:44,943 --> 00:53:47,323
How much are you planning
to charge for those organs?

558
00:53:47,406 --> 00:53:50,997
Don't run your mouth
when you don't even know--

559
00:53:51,749 --> 00:53:53,001
Hey!

560
00:55:43,221 --> 00:55:45,225
