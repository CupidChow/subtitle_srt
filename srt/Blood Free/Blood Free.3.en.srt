00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:44,919
PREVIOUSLY

3
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,963
Let me introduce the individual
who achieved the impossible.

4
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,631
Ms. Yun Jayu, the CEO of BF.

5
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,759
[Yun] I have a dream.

6
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,260
I promise you all.

7
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,220
We will succeed in culturing all types.

8
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,889
We will succeed in culturing them.

9
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,225
[protester] We demand an apology
from Yun Jayu, the murderer!

10
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,810
[clamoring]

11
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,020
Who is he?

12
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,938
[Yun] He just happened to pass by.

13
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,732
He just happened to be a paramedic.

14
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,942
And you recognize him.

15
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,278
Hang in there for a bit, Ms. Yun.

16
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,072
-Who are you?
-[Seonu] Did they identify him?

17
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,158
-I believe Ms. Yun was his target.
-How's Ms. Yun?

18
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,534
[Jeong] What if the bodyguards

19
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,287
leaked the route
Ms. Yun was planning to take today?

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,081
I always felt uneasy about that.

21
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,832
Should we get a full-time bodyguard?

22
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,293
[Mungyu] Don't make the same mistake.
That should never happen.

23
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,378
So the next target is BF?

24
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,381
Go to Yun Jayu.
Become her right-hand man. Gain her trust.

25
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,716
What is this?

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,511
[Saeip] They told us to follow
the directions to decrypt the files.

27
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,221
So I opened the description file.

28
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,266
-And I got this.
-[Seo] This is how they got in.

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,728
Ransomware rarely opens the files.

30
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,564
But we can't guarantee it.

31
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:50,193
"Chaewoon." It all makes sense. But why?

32
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,195
Is he a resource that I should use?

33
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,322
Or should I avoid him?

34
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:58,076
Ms. Yun is the one
who needs close protection.

35
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,954
[Yun] I'd like you to be someone we need.

36
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,122
You know CitizenX, right?

37
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,541
The culture fluid rumors
are true, aren't they?

38
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,000
That's why you couldn't report this.

39
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:10,255
Someone is pretending to be them
to hide their identity.

40
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,631
[Yun] If it was Mr. On…

41
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,216
The closer, the more dangerous.

42
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,510
Was it all an act?

43
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,429
Did Professor Kim do it himself
and pretend like he was upset?

44
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,890
Why was she speeding at that hour?

45
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,017
The first person
who knew the money was being wired…

46
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,520
Could it really be

47
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,355
one of them?

48
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,162
[Seo] I turned it on.

49
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:53,298
Track all our workers who have access
to our central lab's internal network.

50
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,508
[Yeongsil] That violates
the Location Information Act…

51
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:59,220
We can only do that with their consent.

52
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,680
Track their location.

53
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,016
[Yeongsil] Would you like
to initialize the input code?

54
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,688
Initialize the code.

55
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,274
I need the initial directive code.

56
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,193
[sighs]

57
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,528
Input code.

58
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,405
[machine buzzing]

59
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,789
[Seo] Track the employees
who are accessing

60
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,458
the central lab's internal network.

61
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,964
Show me the individuals who departed
their countries after 4:00 p.m. today.

62
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,341
[Seo sighs]

63
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,634
[beeping]

64
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,304
And those who purchased tickets
for flights after 4:00 p.m.?

65
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,935
We'll need to open
their payment records, ma'am.

66
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,686
That's definitely illegal.

67
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,896
Jang Yeongsil.

68
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,900
Show me those who purchased plane
or ferry tickets that left after 4:00 p.m.

69
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,193
[beeping]

70
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,909
[typing]

71
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,165
[machine buzzing]

72
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,312
[Seo] Is Professor Kim going somewhere?

73
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,731
-[Yun] Did you hear anything?
-[Seo] No.

74
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,899
[Yun] Zoom in to South Korea.

75
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,694
Plane and ferry ticket details.

76
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,991
January 19, Phoenix.

77
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,243
Ah.

78
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,162
Isn't January 16
Professor Kim's last day at work?

79
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,541
If he's going to Phoenix,
he's probably visiting his son.

80
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,295
[chuckles] Right as soon as he retires.
I doubt his kids would like that.

81
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,757
Jang Yeongsil, find any employees
who had 100 million won or more

82
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,385
wired to their personal account
after 4:00 p.m. today.

83
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,761
The currency doesn't matter.

84
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,723
Fifty million won or more?

85
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,391
[Seo sighs]

86
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,684
[Yun] Ten million won or more?

87
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,729
[Seo scoffs] It would take 67 years

88
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,356
to find 80 billion won
if we found 100 million a month.

89
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,441
Jang Yeongsil.

90
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,401
Notify me immediately

91
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,113
if any employee makes a transaction
worth over 30 million won

92
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,491
or crosses any borders
from this moment on.

93
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,951
[Yeongsil] Yes, ma'am.

94
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:31,497
By the way, what made you think
the culprit could be one of us?

95
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,791
Well done.

96
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,212
You may go home now.

97
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,130
Where are you going?

98
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:40,757
To headquarters.

99
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,343
-So…
-I'll see you on Monday then.

100
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:49,223
I feel bad that someone as rich as her
sleeps at the company.

101
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,436
Well, we have great facilities.

102
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,646
I see.

103
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,122
[Yun]
Mr. Seo will be the first to find out

104
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,751
that I'm suspecting someone inside BF.

105
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,086
[engine starts]

106
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:22,715
So let's see what he does
after leaving the lab tonight.

107
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,930
Cryptocurrency. Hacking.

108
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,392
Mr. Seo has the most knowledge
about those matters.

109
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:40,942
But with his expertise… [sighs]
…he could've just siphoned money off BF.

110
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,156
You can speak Russian?

111
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,158
I used a translator.

112
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,993
Only Koreans use these.

113
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,455
And Russians rarely uses these symbols.

114
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,376
There isn't a single symbol
that only Russia uses.

115
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,044
There was someone else.

116
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,295
You know CitizenX, right?

117
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,297
He's more skilled than Mr. Seo.

118
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:07,510
Your only chance
is when they exchange the Bitcoin.

119
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,469
Let's…

120
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:09,929
pay the ransom.

121
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,391
-Jang Yeongsil.
-Yes, ma'am?

122
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,976
Search for Woo Chaewoon.

123
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,769
Okay, I'll search for him.

124
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:21,607
That's unlikely
if they want to continue doing this.

125
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:25,153
In any case, I need to pay
if I want to catch them.

126
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,656
[sighs]

127
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,993
Why did I blindly believe a stranger?

128
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,131
[beeps]

129
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,471
[breathes shakily]

130
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:04,233
[Yeongsil] He left the Recon Team
in 2024. As for his family--

131
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,360
Tell me something
that's not on his résumé.

132
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,697
Here's the image search result.

133
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,823
PRESIDENT VISITS AZORAN

134
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,538
What is this?

135
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,082
Are you saying he's in the photo?

136
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,128
[Yeongsil] Yes, this is him.

137
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,467
[Yun] Was this taken
just before the explosion?

138
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,303
PRESIDENT AND AZORAN GET BOMBED

139
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,763
PRESIDENT IN CRITICAL CONDITION

140
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,531
Is this…

141
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,116
Woo Chaewoon?

142
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,494
[Yeongsil] I'm sorry.
I can't identify the individual.

143
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,831
[Yun] He left the Recon Team in 2024.

144
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:04,085
APRIL 2024: DISCHARGED
FROM NAVAL CENTRAL COMMAND

145
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,670
This is it.

146
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,257
-[phone buzzing]
-[gasps]

147
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,885
WOO CHAEWOON

148
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,064
Mr. Seo went straight home.

149
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,233
I'll wait here for a bit.

150
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,362
Ma'am?

151
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,948
[Yun] Why did you hide it?

152
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,911
What did I hide?

153
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,623
President Lee Mungyu.

154
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,961
[Woo sighs]

155
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,296
Why did you join BF?

156
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,760
BF contacted me first.

157
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,014
They saw my name
on the list of pro bodyguards

158
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,683
and asked if I was interested.

159
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,603
[Yun] You must've also met
Prime Minister Seonu Jae

160
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,646
while escorting President Lee.

161
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,316
[Woo sighs]

162
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,111
You've met him before, haven't you?

163
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,240
Yes, I have.

164
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,620
Come back and let's talk.

165
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,583
[sighs]

166
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,919
I'd love to.

167
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,149
I was a soldier back then.

168
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,151
I know.

169
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,404
I was told only 40 minutes prior
that the head of state was arriving.

170
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,990
A few of the officers
were picked to escort him.

171
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,160
I escorted him for a total
of only 30 minutes from the landing field

172
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,120
to the command center.

173
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,288
I'm also aware of that.

174
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,208
I also know that you evacuated him

175
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,293
after the explosion
when everyone was down.

176
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,378
[scoffs]

177
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,549
It seems you're criticizing my actions,
though they don't warrant any.

178
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,761
You just wrote
"overseas service" on your résumé.

179
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,638
I'm sure you knew I was there too,

180
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,015
so why didn't you mention it?

181
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,811
Including me, you know three people
who were at the explosion.

182
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,771
Is this also a coincidence?

183
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,191
Or am I delusional
and nitpicking everything?

184
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,360
I'm sorry, but I don't know

185
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,445
what you're nitpicking at.

186
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,322
I wonder what Chairman Park said

187
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,741
when he recognized you.

188
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,160
He knew from the get-go.

189
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,371
We were both treated at AZORAN.

190
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,872
That's why he hired me.

191
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,833
So why did you hide it from me?

192
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,002
I didn't.

193
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,338
It was obvious you didn't recognize me,

194
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:58,467
so I didn't see the need
to bring up the past.

195
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,886
I don't even know
if our reunion is favorable.

196
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,764
Yet you used the ill-fated relationship
to work with Chairman Park.

197
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,517
I wonder what you and Lee Mungyu did.

198
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:08,936
Did you stay in touch?

199
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,275
I visited him once
at the hospital I was taken to,

200
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,777
which was the first and last time
I met the prime minister.

201
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,362
Why does this matter?

202
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,323
Where were you injured?

203
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,577
It doesn't affect my current job.

204
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,495
You left the military because of it.

205
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,580
It doesn't affect me.

206
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,333
Why are you upset about my time in AZORAN?

207
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,837
-Because it's a trauma for you?
-[laughs]

208
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,839
You're not afraid. You just don't like it.

209
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,592
That's understandable.

210
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,594
You may go.

211
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,829
I only found out later
that you had visited AZORAN too.

212
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,623
I read about you in the news.

213
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,670
Lee Mungyu was the worst president
for me as a businesswoman.

214
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,006
And now,
his grandson is the prime minister.

215
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,927
I'm sure they planted
an informant in our company.

216
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,220
You think that's me?

217
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,848
Do you think I'm handing over
BF's secrets to him?

218
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:28,933
Maybe.

219
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,229
If I could, I'd plant a spy
by his side in a heartbeat.

220
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,440
I don't do that. I don't snitch.

221
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,692
Then what about…

222
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,238
planting ransomware?

223
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,996
You think I sent ransomware to your lab?

224
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,165
[laughs]

225
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:58,128
Have you been suspecting me all this time?

226
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,258
You seem more worked up now
than when I called you an informant.

227
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,553
How could I not be?
Even now I'm desperate to catch CitizenX.

228
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,971
If it wasn't for them, we'd be…

229
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,358
I had no idea
you were even suspecting me of that.

230
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,820
I think I trusted you too much.

231
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,866
You should suspect your lab first.

232
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,993
After getting hacked,
a researcher got injured,

233
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,494
and that culture fluid rumor…

234
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,414
Instead of me,

235
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,375
shouldn't you suspect the lab?

236
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,295
Good job today.

237
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,048
[sighs]

238
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,025
PRESIDENT LEE MUNGYU

239
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,118
A visitation?

240
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,245
[Woo] Do you remember someone named Kir?

241
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,413
[sighs]

242
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,291
How could I not? He's a terrorist.

243
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,376
He's been refusing to see me.

244
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,253
I was wondering if you could help.

245
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,547
[sighs]

246
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,342
You'll be able to see him
right away with my help.

247
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,343
Thank you, sir.

248
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,012
How's Yun Jayu doing?

249
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,722
She just recognized who I was.

250
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,516
She recognized you?

251
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,727
From your AZORAN days?

252
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,729
She was bound to find out one day.

253
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,273
[Seonu]
She would've found out sooner or later.

254
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,861
Did he mention anything else
apart from the visitation?

255
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,574
Like news about the laboratory perhaps?

256
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,992
[Mungyu] What about it?

257
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,953
It was just an example.

258
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,121
He hasn't found out anything yet.

259
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,208
Today was his first day at work.

260
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,459
Right.

261
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,795
You're right.

262
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,505
I was impatient.

263
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,216
[sighs]

264
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,135
I'm the most impatient one,
given my health.

265
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,472
Just sit back and relax. I'll do the work.

266
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,350
Don't do anything. You're not well either.

267
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,727
Tell your father to do it.

268
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,062
Okay.

269
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,439
What about the visitation?

270
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,275
One word from me will get the job done.

271
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,112
Uh, don't worry about it and go to bed.

272
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,490
Night.

273
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,456
A mole shouldn't be tight-lipped.

274
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:52,386
BLOOD FREE

275
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,495
You shouldn't be here alone.

276
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,914
The weekend is for resting.

277
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,249
We could've taken turns.

278
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,334
I was talking about me.

279
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,171
[officer 1] I don't see it.

280
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,422
EPISODE 3

281
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,133
-[officer 2] Maybe it's underwater.
-Don't come out.

282
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,596
[officer 1] It wasn't that windy though.

283
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,933
[officer 2] That's strange.
The current isn't strong either.

284
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,352
Maybe the dashcam fell out
when they broke the window

285
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,979
to rescue the victim.

286
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,981
[officer 2] Even still.

287
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:50,235
The glass shards didn't fall out,
so how come only the cable is left?

288
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,198
May I help you?

289
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,583
Let's go.

290
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,963
[officer 1] Do you think we need to
search the bottom of the reservoir?

291
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,549
[officer 2]
Let's go back and report it first.

292
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,967
[officer 1] Yes, sir.

293
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,765
[phone buzzing]

294
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,938
CHEONGSU POLICE STATION

295
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,275
Hello?

296
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,987
She's our researcher.

297
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:41,203
We briefly spoke on the phone yesterday
and hung up. What's this about?

298
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,498
Resentment?

299
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,251
[sighs]

300
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,585
Toward Ms. Hong?

301
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,640
BF WON'T EVEN APOLOGIZE
FOR MURDER! REMOVE YUN JAYU!

302
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,451
Are you having lunch?

303
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,205
Do you want some?

304
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,375
-No, thank you.
-What about coffee?

305
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,459
No, thank you.

306
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,795
Thank you.

307
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,347
Ah.

308
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,226
Did you stay up all night, ma'am?

309
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,646
It's not working hours.
You can talk casually.

310
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,400
Did you just wake up?

311
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,615
What's going on?

312
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,784
Right. The police called.

313
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,164
They asked if I knew anyone
who resented Ms. Hong.

314
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:11,251
That means
it may have not been an accident.

315
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,302
Were you aware of this?

316
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,230
What's going on?

317
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,026
The ransomware

318
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,278
could've been an inside job.

319
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,905
What could've been--

320
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,037
How do you know that?

321
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,164
Those hackers aren't from CitizenX.

322
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,291
When did you learn that?
Why didn't you tell me?

323
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,877
-I'm telling you now.
-You didn't learn that now.

324
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,380
You should be asking me
if it's a coincidence that

325
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,882
these incidents occurred
one after another.

326
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,011
Already that deep into your findings?

327
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,847
You think the ransomware
and Ms. Hong's accident are related?

328
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,476
Why did the police contact you?

329
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,396
Apparently, I was
the last person she spoke with.

330
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,690
And what time was that?

331
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,025
Around 5:00 p.m.

332
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,863
Her accident was reported
an hour later at 6:00 p.m.

333
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,949
She called me at 4:58 p.m.

334
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,077
[sighs]

335
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,706
-Jang Yeongsil.
-Yes, ma'am.

336
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,375
[Yun] At 4:58 p.m. yesterday,

337
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,836
were there any employees
within 100 meters--

338
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,589
within 50 meters of Hong Saeip?

339
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,009
Yes, there was.

340
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,969
Are you tracking us?

341
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,346
-Who was it?
-Since when? Am I included?

342
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,639
Kim Singu.

343
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,021
-Jang Yeongsil.
-Yes, ma'am.

344
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,606
[Yun] Any employees
who were with her at 5:10 p.m.?

345
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,067
Kim Singu.

346
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,321
[Yun] At 5:30 p.m.?

347
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:04,865
Kim Singu.

348
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,325
[Yun] At 5:50 p.m.?

349
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,536
Kim Singu.

350
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,455
Locate Kim Singu right now.

351
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,332
He's in Dongmun-ro, Taepyeong-gu,

352
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,708
-Gyeonggi Province.
-He's home.

353
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,418
-If you want the exact address--
-Quiet.

354
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,629
[line ringing]

355
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,268
PROFESSOR KIM SINGU

356
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,146
Your call cannot be connected.
You will be redirected--

357
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,696
[On] Hold on.

358
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,782
Ms. Hong must've gone
to his house yesterday.

359
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,367
She often drives him home.

360
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,829
Think about it.

361
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,290
The accident occurred
along her route from his house.

362
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,668
Right.

363
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,097
She was on her way home

364
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,850
from his place by herself
when her car slipped.

365
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:17,187
How far is the scene of the accident
from his place?

366
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,941
About 20 to 30 minutes by car--

367
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,735
No.

368
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,115
Had she been at his house until 5:50 p.m.,

369
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,993
then the accident that occurred
that far from his house

370
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,205
couldn't have been reported at 6:00 p.m.

371
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,255
There are protesters downstairs.

372
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,716
I'll see you there.

373
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,555
[elevator door closes]

374
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,144
We go back 20 years.

375
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,773
We went through many ups and downs.

376
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,193
We even started BF together.

377
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,490
Could he have…

378
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,326
-[elevator dings]
-[door opens]

379
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,252
Time spent together rarely guarantees

380
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,754
a bond of trust.

381
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:41,813
YESTERDAY AT 4:49 P.M.

382
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,152
MS. YUN PAID THE RANSOM

383
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,866
-[Kim cheers] It worked!
-[grunts]

384
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,284
[Kim] Eighty billion won!

385
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,735
Ah. I'm sorry, sir.

386
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,321
I brought your belongings.

387
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,698
Allow me.

388
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,160
By the way, is something wrong?

389
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,621
I just heard something.

390
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,253
Maybe it was the TV.

391
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,341
Leave it. I'll take care of it.

392
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,097
Rest up then.

393
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,307
Ms. Hong.

394
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,643
Yes, sir.

395
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,651
-What is this?
-Oh, that?

396
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,904
I got you a small gift
for your retirement.

397
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,577
Thanks.

398
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,744
It's nothing big.

399
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,329
Goodbye.

400
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,587
MS. YUN PAID THE RANSOM

401
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,797
Professor Kim, the lab…

402
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,510
You know…

403
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,267
I think it's been resolved.

404
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,660
-[Kim cheers]
-[grunts]

405
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,621
"It worked."

406
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,456
[Kim] Eighty billion won!

407
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,791
Maybe it was the TV.

408
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,712
Did I hear him wrong?

409
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,757
[sighs]

410
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,721
Professor Kim, the lab…

411
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,474
[Kim cheers] It worked!

412
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,731
[line rings]

413
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,943
Mr. On, can you talk right now?

414
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,111
[On] Well…

415
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,655
Where are you right now?

416
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,990
I'm sorry, but I'll have to call you back.

417
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,241
[line disconnects]

418
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:55,840
Professor Kim.

419
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,594
What's the matter?

420
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,223
What's the matter

421
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:05,809
with you?

422
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,612
Thankfully, she had a witness.

423
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,157
[On] There was a witness?

424
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,871
[phone buzzing]

425
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,427
[On] Ms. Hong got into a car accident.

426
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:44,431
The sleet on the road likely made her
crash into the water while speeding.

427
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,729
She wasn't underwater for long.
She should wake up soon.

428
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,566
They can't get the car out until tomorrow.

429
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,401
[On] Her vehicle went underwater at 5:00.

430
00:28:56,484 --> 00:29:00,739
[detective] We'll find out what happened
once we check the dashcam.

431
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,579
[Kim] Why did you have…

432
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,123
to come at that hour?

433
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,585
No one had to get hurt.

434
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,045
[On] Okay. Mmm.

435
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,465
[Kim] It could've ended well.

436
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,220
I can't get caught like this.

437
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,181
[thunder rumbling]

438
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,099
I finally managed to fool her.

439
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,311
I finally got that hefty sum.

440
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,731
This was just your fate.

441
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:39,986
[detective] We'll find out what happened
once we check the dashcam.

442
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,322
[Kim]
They won't find the dashcam. However…

443
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,867
If they find out
that it was forcibly removed…

444
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,799
-[knocks]
-[On] Professor Kim?

445
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,638
[phone buzzing]

446
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,696
[On] Where are you?

447
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,991
Sir? Hello?

448
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,576
Sir?

449
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,286
Hey, Mr. On.

450
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,248
We're in front of your house.
Could you open the door?

451
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,041
My house?

452
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,586
Yes, we're here.
We have something to tell you.

453
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,796
Hello?

454
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,174
Sir. Hello?

455
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,970
Where are you?

456
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:48,763
Answer me.

457
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,099
-"Answer me"?
-It was you, right?

458
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,768
Hey, what did you just say?

459
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,103
"Answer me"?

460
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,106
You bitch. I'm not your friend.

461
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,066
Don't order me around, you cocky bitch!

462
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,609
Who are you calling a bitch?

463
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,738
You hacked the system
and stole money from me.

464
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,782
That's rich coming from you.

465
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,492
What about you then?

466
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,286
You killed someone!

467
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,247
She could've lived a few more months
if it weren't for you!

468
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,164
But you interfered--

469
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,667
You were the one
who begged me to do the surgery.

470
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,919
And you have blood on your hands.

471
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,589
Ms. Hong truly cared about you.

472
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,841
She's still alive. I didn't kill anyone.

473
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:28,845
You tainted your reputation the moment
you claimed your culture fluid was trash.

474
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,972
You devoted 20 years to the research.

475
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,557
-How could you--
-No!

476
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,142
It wasn't me! It's all a lie!

477
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,618
[On] Ms. Yun.

478
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,063
[line ringing]

479
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,192
I'll be back soon.
Could you stay here until then?

480
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,157
[Jeong] Hello, ma'am.

481
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:36,329
Put Kim Singu on the no-fly list.

482
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,206
[Jeong] What's going on?

483
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,087
[sighs]

484
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,759
[line ringing]

485
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,137
SECRETARY KIM

486
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,014
The secretary's office texted.

487
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,891
[Seonu] Mmm.

488
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,603
[aide] Ms. Yun from BF called,
so they told her you were away.

489
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,648
She then asked them to relay a message.

490
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,443
She had personally asked you for a favor

491
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,654
but found out who was behind it.

492
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,115
A personal favor?

493
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,867
[aide] She says
she needs to file a formal report.

494
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,538
[sighs]

495
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,790
She's asking me for help.

496
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:29,048
[Yun] I'm sorry.
I didn't expect this to be an inside job.

497
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,512
I know it's too late,

498
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,766
but I reported him right away
so he'd be on the no-fly list.

499
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,394
Why do you think it's too late?

500
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,439
Given his attitude…

501
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,609
I think he's already abroad.

502
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,029
What did he say to you?

503
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,906
[Kim] That's rich coming from you.

504
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,992
What about you then?

505
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,536
[Seonu] What did he say to you?

506
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,246
[Kim] You killed someone!

507
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,498
[Seonu] Ms. Yun.

508
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,542
He…

509
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,879
[Kim] She could've lived
a few more months if it weren't for you!

510
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,964
-But you interfered!
-[Yun clears throat]

511
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,136
It seemed like he had nothing to fear.

512
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,764
He wasn't afraid of getting caught.

513
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,098
One minute.

514
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,101
Find out
if Kim Singu has left the country.

515
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,062
Tell them to promptly approve BF's request

516
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,314
of putting him on the no-fly list.

517
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,607
[aide] Yes, sir.

518
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,609
[Seonu] Ms. Yun?

519
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,071
-Yes?
-They'll call you with the results.

520
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,448
Thank you, sir.

521
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,328
[metal clanks]

522
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,649
[Woo] He must have forwarded his calls.

[sighs]

524
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,988
[On] Can you unlock this phone?

525
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,658
Come on.

526
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,077
Do you guys think I'm James Bond?

527
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,328
Whose is this?

528
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,122
Professor Kim was behind

529
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,916
the ransomware, cryptocurrency,
and the culture fluid rumor.

530
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,504
Did you catch him?

531
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,133
Where is he right now?

532
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:39,262
[aide, on phone] He left the country
and flew to Vietnam at 9:00 a.m. today.

533
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:43,850
He arrived there two hours ago
and disappeared.

534
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:48,187
Kim Singu's passport has been revoked,
and we informed the embassy.

535
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,439
Thank you, sir.

536
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,401
Please tell the prime minister
I said thank you.

538
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,330
[Kim] This is my wife's stomach.

539
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,875
Her large intestine
is teeming with cancer cells.

540
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,003
Ms. Yun, let's give it a try.

541
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,463
You know it's not complete yet.

542
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,215
We can't guarantee anything.

543
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,885
I know. I'm fully aware of that.

544
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,012
You should have told him no.

545
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,096
He wanted it.

546
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,974
Of course. He wants to grab on
to any sliver of hope he can.

547
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,392
And you're using him.

548
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,644
We'll only find out once we try it!

549
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,479
On his wife, of all people?

550
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,898
Then how will we experiment?

551
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,733
Must we do nothing forever?

552
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,903
Our company can't even do animal testing.

553
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,447
We need human subjects. We need bodies!

555
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,618
She's bound to die if we do nothing.

556
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,163
We're not gambling. It's a last resort.

557
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,791
She'll live a bit longer
if you let her be. And you know this.

558
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,544
[Kim] She could've lived
a few more months if it weren't for you!

559
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,546
[Yun grunts]

560
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,234
[Woo] Should I pull over?

561

562
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,353
Professor Kim…

563
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,149
is one son of a bitch, isn't he?

564
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,946
Should I take that back?

565
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,554
[Yun] Let's go.

566
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,973
[phone buzzing]

567
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:14,977
DIRECTOR JEONG HAEDEUN

568
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,605
Professor Kim left the country.

569
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,733
He must have prepared this ages ago
to have fled so quickly.

570
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,903
I checked where he fled to and…

571
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,696
-[Yun] Vietnam.
-That's right.

572
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,492
The embassy there already knew.
Did you contact them?

573
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,621
Wait. Where are you right now?

574
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,206
No, right?

575
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,541
What do you mean?

576
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,211
You're not by the river
to do something foolish, are you?

577
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:44,006
Ms. Yun, the world isn't ending. Okay?

578
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,841
Why would I be foolish?

579
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,094
I'm not alone either.

580
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,138
Come on now.

581
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,432
You should've told me…

582
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:54,975
[Woo clears throat]

583
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,602
…if someone was with you.

584
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,686
[Yun] Ms. Jeong.

585
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,606
Please check in real time
and see if Professor Kim

586
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,982
ever uses his card.

587
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,610
But then again,
I doubt he'd be that stupid.

588
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,112
Yes, ma'am.

589
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,218
[Yun] Why didn't he use a fake passport?

590
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:33,139
Had he done that,
no one would've been able to find him.

591
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,976
He prepared everything thoroughly
except for the most important thing.

592
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:38,853
-Arizona?
-Phoenix?

593
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:47,319
No one would've suspected him
if he went to his son after retiring.

594
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,989
He wouldn't need to risk it
and make a fake passport.

595
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,491
That must have been his original plan.

596
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,661
But Ms. Hong caught onto something,

597
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,289
and he had to sink her car.

598
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,416
Because he had to flee in a hurry.

599
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,336
He'll make a new passport in Vietnam.

600
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,257
We'll never be able to find him then.

601
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:24,440
Yeongsil, send an e-mail
to our legal representative in Vietnam.

602
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,025
Yes, ma'am. What should I write?

603
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,986
Send people to the departure areas
at all the airports in Vietnam.

604
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,779
Send them various photos of Kim Singu.

605
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,615
Him wearing a hat and with no glasses.

606
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,368
Tell all our production workers,
contract workers, and subcontractors

607
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,704
to upload photos of him
on their social media.

608
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,624
Say I'll reward anyone who reports him

609
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,627
or catches him at the airport
with 50 million won.

610
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,172
Tell the legal representative to request
immediate help from the Vietnamese police.

611
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:51,592
Call the legal representative
after sending the e-mail.

612
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,845
Yes, ma'am. Calling
the Vietnamese legal representative now.

I want the truth.

632

we'd be going to the command center?

How did you know where to bomb?
