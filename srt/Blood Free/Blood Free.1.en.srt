1
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,960
BLOOD FREE

2
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,008
"What kind of meat would you like?"

3
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,309
I asked you all this question
just four years ago.

4
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,564
"What kind of meat would you like?"

5
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,618
But I don't need to ask you this anymore.

6
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,707
Because BF successfully commercialized
cultured meat for the first time

7
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,501
in 2022.

8
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,963
Consumers worldwide showed
an overwhelming preference for our meat.

9
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,174
And that was our solution.

10
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,682
But I did ask a similar question.

11
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,103
About what kinds of clothes you preferred.

12
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,247
Killing. Slaughtering.

13
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,001
"Is there no way to enjoy meat
without sacrificing animals?"

14
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,588
BF SUCCEEDS AT CULTURING FUR

15
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,050
Fifteen years ago,

16
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,053
BF was founded
on the basis of this question.

17
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,181
And thanks to you, we were able to achieve

18
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,100
a phenomenal market share of 72%.

19
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,818
We can now confidently say

20
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,112
that what we put on our tables

21
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,199
is more transparent and safe than ever.

22
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,409
Meat that requires slaughter

23
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,453
is in the past now.

24
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,121
This is a remarkable achievement

25
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:11,542
made by you and BF,
a biotechnology company.

26
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,941
BF 2025 UNPACKED SHOW

27
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,902
Ladies and gentlemen.

28
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,447
Let me introduce the individual
who achieved the impossible.

29
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,866
Ms. Yun Jayu, the CEO of BF.

30
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,844
Hello, I'm Yun Jayu.

31
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,180
First, I'd like to thank you all

32
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:10,018
for attending
BF's new product presentation

33
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,352
on Christmas Eve.

34
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,689
How are you all doing?

35
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,693
Last year, a news channel picked me

36
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,905
as the greediest woman on earth.

37
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,825
It's okay.
You can agree with them.

38
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,952
It's true that I'm greedy.

39
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,787
I'm never satisfied.

40
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,873
Did you know?

41
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,668
Cell culture requires only 1% of the land

42
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,504
originally needed
to raise and feed livestock

43
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:43,509
to produce the same amount of food.

44
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,095
You already knew this?

45
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,389
Then what about this?

46
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,516
Did you know that one cow

47
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,519
produces more greenhouse gas
than a car does?

48
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,314
Why would I mention something
you already know?

49
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,607
KIM SINGU
BF RESEARCH TEAM 3 LEADER

50
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,484
Because I wanted to brag.

51
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,527
I'm extremely proud that BF contributesâ€¦

52
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,445
SEO HUI

53
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,574
â€¦to the prevention of global warming.

54
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,410
But we're not perfect just yet.

55
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,246
"BF."

56
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,790
"Blood Free."

57
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,044
Some people pronounce it as "beef."

58
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,214
Well, it does befit a company

59
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,049
that produces meat.

60
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,009
However,

61
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,054
perhaps it is time

62
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,764
to change our company name.

63
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:42,193
We have expanded our territory
to include underwater production.

64
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,695
We refuse to be complacent

65
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,447
and only culture what's on land.

66
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,533
Ladies and gentlemen.

67
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,452
We'd like to introduce

68
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,705
our new masterpiece for the end of 2025.

69
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,513
How does our new product taste?

70
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,641
All of these dishes were cultured?

71
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:14,934
That's correct.

72
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,770
Not only did BF succeed
in culturing livestock,

73
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,648
but we also succeeded in culturing

74
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,775
the four most consumed seafood items,

75
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,570
tuna, salmon, mackerel, and shrimp.

76
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,066
All the fish in the ocean are dead.

77
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,776
I can't catch a single one.

78
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,779
Oh, no.

79
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,910
JEONG HAEDEUN - BF
LEGAL ADVISER, PLANNING DIRECTOR

80
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,663
I need to tell you something.

81
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,501
Our seafood doesn't include three things.

82
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,921
Parasites, microplastics, and mercury.

83
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,924
Not only are our products blood free,

84
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,717
but they're danger free as well.

85
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,845
Enjoy, everyone.

86
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,680
We can produce an unlimited amount.

87
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,608
I have a dream.

88
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,489
There's something I need to achieve.

89
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,076
The very day when we don't need to destroy

90
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,286
this world for food.

91
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,540
My company and I will bring

92
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,375
that day closer.

93
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,919
I promise you all.

94
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,005
In six months' time,
we will succeed in culturing

95
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,757
all types of grain and food crops

96
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,551
such as rice and potatoes,

97
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,261
and even palm oil, which destroys jungles.

98
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,596
We will succeed in culturing them.

99
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,307
I give you my word.

100
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,059
In six months,

101
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,062
I will see you all again right here.

102
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,908
Please welcome
Professor Kim Singu from BF Laboratory.

103
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,797
Hello.

104
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,716
I'm Kim Singu

105
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,093
from BF Laboratory.

106
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,638
I'll take a peek at this
only when I'm stuck.

107
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,392
I will be

108
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,978
retiring soon.

109
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,648
As a doctor of biotechnologyâ€¦

110
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,739
They've already surrounded
the entire building.

111
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,743
We demand an apology from Yun Jayu,
a murderer!

112
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:22,121
The government should actively support BF!

113
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,748
Support them!

114
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,626
Yun Jayu is innocent!

115
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,544
- We support her!
- We support her!

116
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,670
Yun Jayu isâ€¦

117
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,713
Yun Jayu is innocent!

118
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,847
-We support her!
-We support her!

119
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,515
The government

120
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,643
-should actively support BF!
-Support them!

121
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,455
The government should actively support BF!

122
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,547
A GLOBAL COMPANY FOR A REASON!

123
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,024
MURDERERS, BF

124
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,578
BF CARES ABOUT
OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE

125
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,206
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WEAR
ANIMAL FUR ANYMORE

126
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,540
A COMPANY THAT SAVES THE EARTH

127
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,678
BLOOD FREE

128
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:05,344
This was the only route
to the highway, but there's a traffic jam.

129
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,428
I'm sorry, ma'am.

130
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,140
What did you say?

131
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,351
This was the only route to the highway,

132
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,770
but there's a traffic jam.
I'm sorry, ma'am.

133
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,537
Well, it's the end of the year.

134
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,624
Ms. Yun.

135
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,002
The door is stuck!

136
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,423
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

137
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,508
Move!

138
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,677
Don't touch her!

139
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,928
You could injure her spine.

140
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,097
You have to wait for the ambulance.

141
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,351
Hang in there for a bit, Ms. Yun.

142
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,397
Who are you? Do you know him?

143
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,482
No.

144
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,608
Is he alive?

145
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,818
Yes, until a while ago.

146
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,403
As of now…

147
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,447
I'm not too sure.

148
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,546
-Enjoy your Christmas.
-You too, sir.

149
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,258
Did they identify him?

150
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,011
He was a stockbreeder in his 50s
who went bankrupt because of BF.

151
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,804
He was spotted on CCTV

152
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,598
hanging around the overpass
for an hour and a half.

153
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,059
I believe Ms. Yun was his target.

154
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,437
He died in the ambulance.

155
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,981
How did he know she'd be there?

156
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,818
BF asked the detective in charge
the same question.

157
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,737
The detective said

158
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,197
that was the only road
leading out from BF's venue.

159
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,907
Plus, traffic jams are common there.

160
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,951
He said it would've been the ideal spot

161
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,703
to jump and land on a vehicle.

162
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,329
How's Ms. Yun?

163
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,665
Thankfully, she only got a few bruises.

164
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,210
Gosh.

165
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,047
Schedule a visit to the funeral home

166
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,174
and send some flowers under my name.

167
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,925
-To the other side too.
-"The other side"?

168
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,637
-Ms. Yun.
-Yes, sir.

169
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,399
Do you have to watch that?

170
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,611
He waited for the best moment
to break your neck.

171
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:01,830
Ms. Jeong went to the police
to ask about the deceased.

172
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,332
ON SAN - RESEARCH DIRECTOR
& TEAM 2 LEADER

173
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,418
Whether it really was suicide
or something else,

174
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,753
we'll have to see.

175
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,423
Is the cause of death ruptured organs?

176
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,466
That's what they said.

177
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,512
Ruptured organs.

178
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,181
What a shame.

179
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,517
Had he fallen right on top of you,

180
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,103
you would've gotten ruptured.

181
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,604
Don't you think so?

182
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,830
He must've failed
to correctly calculate his fall.

183
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,373
I heard he went through a lot.

184
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,127
Even his final moments
didn't go as planned.

185
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,298
Who is he?

186
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,182
Beats me.

187
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,144
Can you not make me watch that?

188
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,814
I brought some clothes.

189
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,484
Don't tell me you're working right now.

190
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,987
What did the police say?

191
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,823
I asked them to look into things
such as the possibility

192
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,950
of him being incited to do this,
his call records,

193
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,244
how many times he had visited the spot,

194
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,871
and whether he was alone or not.

195
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,665
But the police want
to speak with our bodyguards.

196
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,625
What for?

197
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,295
What if the bodyguards

198
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,132
leaked the route
Ms. Yun was planning to take today?

199
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,967
I'm sorry, ma'am.

200
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,345
This was the only route to the highway,
but there's a traffic jam.

201
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,805
I'm sorry, ma'am.

202
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,516
Only the driver would've known

203
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,935
the exact route she'd take.

204
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,104
I always felt uneasy about that.

205
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,689
Should we get a full-time bodyguard?

206
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,357
That could be even more dangerous.

207
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,902
She doesn't like
being escorted all the time.

208
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,322
We should be thorough
and find someone who best suits the job.

209
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,365
We can't always hire private security.

210
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,491
You think so?

211
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,704
To be honest, it has been a nuisance

212
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,707
to contact new services every time--
Actually, no.

213
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,919
Um, we just don't know whom we're hiring.

214
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,047
Did they hear us?

215
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,891
Gosh.

216
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:29,603
Check out these flowers.
Guess who sent them?

217
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,357
"Wishing you a speedy recovery.
Prime Minister Seonu Jae."

218
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,569
Who is he?

219
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,199
He said

220
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,035
he was just passing by.

221
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,870
- Do you know him?
- No.

222
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,622
Is he alive?

223
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,831
Yes, until a while ago.

224
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,378
A passerby who's willing to intervene?

225
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,046
And touch a bloodied man?

226
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,132
I don't think I could ever do that.

227
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,844
He did seem like a paramedic.

228
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,638
I think I've seen him somewhere.

229
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,140
I was so out of it during the incident.

230
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,980
Where in the world did I see him?

231
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,941
I'm curious about that too.

232
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,115
He just happened to pass by.

233
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,659
He just happened to be a paramedic.

234
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,537
And you recognize him.

235
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,624
What's the chance of that, Ms. Jeong?

236
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,295
I'll make sure I remember

237
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,505
where I saw him, ma'am.

238
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,658
Mansik.

239
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,662
Mansik.

240
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,924
CONTROVERSY BEHIND BF'S CULTURE
FLUID BEING FULL OF GERMS

241
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,769
CURRENT NEWS HEADLINES
BF'S CULTURE FLUID CONTROVERSY

242
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,483
30 MINUTES AGO

243
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,739
Hello, Ms. Hong.

244
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,159
TEAM LEADER OF RESEARCH TEAM 3
KIM SINGU

245
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,660
Don't worry about it.

246
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,204
I can do it by myself just fine.

247
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,665
I'm sorry. I should be helping you.

248
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,293
Ms. Yun is at the hospital,
and I'm still home.

249
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,837
Please put aside
the things you need to move.

250
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,213
I'll move them later.

251
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,298
All right then.

252
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:29,801
What?

253
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:30,886
What's the matter?

254
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,140
What is this?

255
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,102
Professor Kim,
all the files have been encrypted.

256
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,438
I think the computer got hacked.

257
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,820
They told us to follow the directions
to decrypt the files.

258
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,530
So I opened the description file.

259
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,450
And I got this.

260
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,703
They want 80 billion won in Bitcoin
within the next 48 hours.

261
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,539
Only then will they unlock
our lab's computers

262
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:00,916
and files.

263
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,251
CitizenX is a ransomware organization.

264
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,420
They target companies
and government agencies,

265
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,797
then render their files inaccessible.

266
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,841
No one, to this day,

267
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,177
has successfully decrypted any files.

268
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,847
We got hacked?

269
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,724
How?

270
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,060
One of our security staff
is coming from home.

271
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,353
We'll have to ask him.

272
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,604
Is only our lab hacked?

273
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,648
How about HQ or the Seoul branch?

274
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,400
They're both unscathed. It's only our lab.

275
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,987
Are the hackers behind the article

276
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,532
claiming how our culture fluid
was full of germs?

277
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,909
I just arrived at the newspaper agency.

278
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,703
I'll ask them
where they got that information

279
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,163
and report to you right away.

280
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,498
What we know so far is that

281
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:45,168
there's been an anonymous tip
about how our research has been illegal

282
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:48,088
and how the culture fluid

283
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:51,383
for the cultured meat was full of germs.

284
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:52,926
That is all.

285
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:57,639
I'm on my way,
but the traffic is terrible.

286
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,558
Everyone must be going somewhere.

287
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,351
I'll be there soon. I'm hanging up.

288
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,435
Me too.

289
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,437
Me too. Goodbye.

290
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,606
How does this make any sense?

291
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,567
I can't open the files I made

292
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,901
on my own computer.

293
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,070
That's what ransomware is.

294
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,031
Imagine someone
changing the passcode to your house

295
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,367
and demanding a ransom in exchange

296
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,410
for the new passcode.

297
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,872
What about the culture fluid?

298
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,500
I made those serums myself.
Who in the worldâ€¦

299
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,710
This makes no sense.

300
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,395
Yeongsil, look up articles about BF germs.

301
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,815
There are 1003 related articles.

302
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:49,899
I see.

303
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,151
That's a hell of a number.

304
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,653
If you want me to read them, please say,

305
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,364
"Jang Yeongsil,
read articles about BF germs."

306
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,283
No, it's okay. Just get lost.

307
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,244
Ms. Jeong,
you need to be kinder with your words.

308
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,039
Had we been the only ones
who received the tip-off,

309
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,749
we would've confirmed with you.

310
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,126
"Rumor has it that your research

311
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:11,254
is illegal and your culture fluid
is full of germs. Is that true?"

312
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,674
After all, you and I are acquaintances.

313
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,553
How did you know
that every news agency got this tip-off?

314
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,930
Because there were dozens of recipients.

315
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,682
They were all news agencies.

316
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,352
It was sent through email?

317
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,355
I debated deleting it

318
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,066
because I was worried I'd get scammed.

319
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,736
But it was sent to pretty much everyone
in this line of work.

320
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,781
I didn't want to be left out.

321
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,664
"Most would think culture fluid is clean
since it's fed to the meat,

322
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,165
but that's not true.

323
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,751
BF's culture fluid is full of germs.

324
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,212
Simply put, it's bacteria.

325
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:57,050
BF had been selling meat
that had been fed bacteria."

326
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,303
Is it true?

327
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,057
Whoever said that made a mistake.

328
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:05,975
So it's not true?

329
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,269
As Korea's biggest portal site,

330
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,563
I'm sure you could find out who sent it.

331
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,110
They even sent it anonymously,
but I guess they'll get caught soon.

332
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,448
I traced the IP address on KISA
and Googled their email address.

333
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,908
And?

334
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,577
It was in Canada,
but the address didn't exist.

335
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,162
As for the email address…

336
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,456
"Schrosky"?

337
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,083
"Schrosky"?

338
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,086
That was their name?

339
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,298
The IP address and the name…

340
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,345
directed me to this.

341
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,514
So I opened the description file.

342
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,475
And I got this.

343
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,479
Can you forward the email to me?

344
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,733
So are the rumors true?

345
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,152
Come on. This isn't your first rodeo.

346
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,405
Only BF is worthy enough
to be set up every single day.

347
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,073
Right.

348
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,242
What did Ms. Yun say
about the stockbreeder's death?

349
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,577
Thanks for your cooperation.

350
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,916
Hold on.

351
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,337
Shouldn't she be vehemently denying
the allegations?

352
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,298
They're the ones behind it.

353
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,633
The ones who hacked our lab.

354
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,763
I see.

355
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,767
This is how they got in.

356
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,228
They hacked us remotely
using the router on the fourth floor.

357
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,565
They got in this afternoon at 4:19 p.m.

358
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,525
How do we send the money?

359
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,944
This is their account number.

360
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,822
They want us to send the Bitcoin
within the next 48 hours.

361
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,449
That's their account?

362
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,035
Then can't we catch them?

363
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,870
We can track them down.

364
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:52,248
Right? There must be a name
behind that account.

365
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,751
It may be a false name,
but if we keep digging--

366
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,212
You don't need
to verify your identity when making

367
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,546
a cryptocurrency account.

368
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,965
And it's probably not
an official exchange.

369
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,425
So we can't track them down.

370
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,635
How is this possible?

371
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,138
Forget about this.

372
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,683
Can we catch those bastards
who treated my culture fluid like trash?

373
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,477
Sir, they didn't say that.

374
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,062
They said it was full of germs!

375
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,898
Then the news reported that
and people believed them!

376
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,567
They're all the same!
I devoted my entire life to this.

377
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,987
They're practically bad-mouthing me.

378
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,823
Those bastards.

379
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,288
How could they only give us two days
to prepare 80 billion won?

380
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,625
They happened to hack us
right when we presented our new product.

381
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,044
Do you think they knew
we'd be at the event

382
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,380
and the lab would be vacant?

383
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,634
It only took them 20 minutes
to hack our system.

384
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,554
Who knew our lab was this unprotected?

385
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,685
We can't block the ransomware
unless we cut off

386
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,228
our external network entirely.

387
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,108
Shut down the lab for the next two days

388
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,068
and don't let anyone in this weekend.

389
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:03,987
You want to do this covertly?

390
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,822
We need to report this to catch them.

391
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,282
Reporting this won't guarantee

392
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,658
that we'll catch them though.

393
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,286
Ms. Yun, what's your plan?

394
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,663
Will you really pay the ransom?

395
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,249
Eighty billion won
is pretty cheap if you think about it.

396
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,167
Due to these allegations,

397
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,004
the market cap of the third market
transactions is dropping.

398
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,636
What do you think
you should do right away?

399
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,432
We need to find out if anyone used…

400
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,517
…the external network.

401
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,562
But we told the employees numerous times

402
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,731
to only use the company network.

403
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:45,111
Isn't it crucial to find out
if they only locked the files

404
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,529
or if they actually read them?

405
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,991
The computers contain
the core technology of our lab.

406
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,077
Ransomware rarely opens the files.

407
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,664
But we can't guarantee it.

408
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,083
Then we need to assess the damage

409
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,585
and see how much work

410
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,712
we can do without opening the files.

411
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,716
Then do that. And set up a new firewall.

412
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,261
Deny all allegations
and threaten to take legal action.

413
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,264
Request a culture fluid analysis
from food safety organizations

414
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,433
and report the results.

415
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,809
As for this hacking incident…

416
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,897
let's keep it among ourselves.

417
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,402
Sir.

418
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,413
Right, Ms. Yun.

419
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:43,002
It's about that man
I said looked familiar.

420
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,340
Chairman Park Daeseong of Sanghwa.

421
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,093
You had a meeting with him previously.

422
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,929
I saw this man when I was waiting outside.

423
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,099
He had been standing guard at that time.

424
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,059
That's why he looked familiar.

425
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,185
Standing guard for what?

426
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,728
He's Chairman Park's bodyguard.

427
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,855
I asked Sanghwa,

428
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,066
and this man no longer works there.

429
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,609
As in he quit?

430
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,819
Or got fired.

431
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,404
They didn't elaborate.

432
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:10,863
Well done.

433
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,533
I only did a simple background check.
Should I dig further?

434
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,370
Are you okay, ma'am?

435
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,753
He'd be perfect
if he wasn't fired from Sanghwa.

436
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,463
Perfect for what?

437
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,065
- Yeongsil.
- Yes?

438
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:50,111
Give me a list of all the companies
and organizations attacked by CitizenX.

439
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,781
There have been seven
that were attacked by CitizenX.

440
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,243
July of 2025.
Maypal, a pharmaceutical company.

441
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,620
January of 2025. Pacific Bank.

442
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,289
-September of 2024--
-Jang Yeongsil.

443
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,791
-Yes?
-Did any of them pay the ransom?

444
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,793
I'm sorry. There are no related articles.

445
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,837
Any cases in Korea?

446
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,173
The Naval Intelligence Command in 2022.

447
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,884
The navy?

448
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,595
Read me some related news.

449
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,014
I'm sorry. I can't find any.

450
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,434
They're all covering it up.

451
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,606
The Intelligence Command?

452
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:36,240
He worked at the NIC
from 2020 to February of 2023.

453
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,161
- Jang Yeongsil.
- Yes?

454
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,246
When did CitizenX attack the NIC?

455
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,998
It was in September of 2022.

456
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,959
OCTOBER 2020
NAVAL INTELLIGENCE COMMAND

457
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,796
"Chaewoon."

458
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,341
It all makes sense.

459
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,219
But why?

460
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,348
Is he a resource that I should use?

461
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,811
Or should I avoid him?

462
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,260
It's nice to meet you. Please sit down.

463
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,265
LEE MUNGYU
FORMER PRESIDENT

464
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,239
It's been years.

465
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,452
I should've visited you sooner.

466
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,954
I apologize, sir.

467
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:07,915
Don't be sorry.

468
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,795
You must be curious
as to why I suddenly contacted you.

469
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,425
I am. What is this about, sir?

470
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,596
Did you attend BF's presentation?

471
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,851
Were you the one who sent me the invite?

472
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,021
Yes, it was me.

473
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,731
You know why, right?

474
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,652
No, sir. I'm afraid I don't.

475
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,613
Captain Woo.

476
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:44,410
The reason why you accepted the invite
from someone you didn't even know.

477
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,789
The reason why you quit
even when Chairman Park dissuaded you.

478
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,500
Or, from the very start,

479
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,171
the reason why you decided
to work for Chairman Park.

480
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,967
Did you identify the terrorist?

481
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,389
Not yet, sir.

482
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:07,767
You asked me

483
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,813
when I had told those I was with
about visiting the troops.

484
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,982
And you said it was

485
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,026
seven hours prior.

486
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:18,945
I did.

487
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,655
Because it was the truth.

488
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,367
JANUARY 2024

489
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,494
It was normal

490
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,580
for me to be accompanied by CEOs
on overseas trips.

491
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,500
But it was a last-minute decision
to visit the dispatched troops.

492
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,585
So I explained to them that

493
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,171
I wanted to make a surprise visit
to those who were abroad.

494
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,717
The area was still a former battlefield
despite the war being over.

495
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,885
So I told them in advance.

496
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,513
After all,
they were all influential individuals.

497
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,183
I said they could wait in the plane
since I wasn't going to take long.

498
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,186
They were all delighted to hear this

499
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,313
and wanted to accompany me.

500
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,439
It all happened within 30 minutes.

501
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,610
The two ministers died,
so it couldn't have been them.

502
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:45,031
Or my attendants who retired
due to severe internal injuries.

503
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,908
In that case,

504
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,537
Chairman Lee Namjin of STL.

505
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,123
Park Daeseong of Sanghwa Group.

506
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,417
Han Giho of Tech Games.

507
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,503
Yun Jayu of BF.

508
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,047
It was one of them.

509
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:07,011
Even the dispatched troops didn't know
I was coming due to security reasons.

510
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:11,182
One of them violated the orders
to keep it top secret.

511
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,727
If someone was trying to kill me

512
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,645
in the explosion,

513
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,106
it was one of those four.

514
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,485
You thought so too.

515
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,071
That's why you approached Park Daeseong.

516
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,573
The fact that you left him

517
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,658
means it wasn't him.

518
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,453
You have changed your target.

519
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,043
So the next target is BF?

520
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,170
Thus the invite?

521
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,590
It was Yun Jayu. I'm sure of it.

522
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,554
May I ask why you think it was her?

523
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,475
Are you also insinuating
that I have no proof?

524
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,939
You wouldn't have called me if you had it.

525
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,360
Yet you're convinced it was her.
I'd like to be sure as well.

526
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,280
I want to be assured
that the person behind bars is innocent.

527
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,366
I want to be assured that

528
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,244
my time spent
after the military wasn't wasted.

529
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,123
Why do you think it was her?

530
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,836
As soon as I took office,

531
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,964
she requested a meeting with me.

532
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,675
She wanted me

533
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,053
to abolish the law
requiring cultured meat to be labeled

534
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,596
as genetically modified foods.

535
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:37,726
She said both the US and France
finally accepted cultured meat

536
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,478
as normal meat.

537
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,022
She wanted me to follow suit.

538
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,610
That brazen woman tried to slyly coax me

539
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,695
into changing the law.

540
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,116
And she got what she wanted.

541
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,742
Because I had to step down.

542
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,163
After losing my legs.

543
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,376
Do you know

544
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,212
how big BF got after that incident?

545
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,214
They grew exponentially.

546
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:12,052
Do you know how much BF
is helping the incumbent president?

547
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,358
I've kept an eye on you

548
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,361
ever since you visited me at the hospital.

549
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,829
From the moment you asked me

550
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,874
when I had told the others
about the surprise visit.

551
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,340
You pursued this matter
despite receiving no help.

552
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:53,010
You were tenacious despite the individuals
you were up against.

553
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,515
Captain Woo.

554
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,391
It's my time to aid you.

555
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,560
Let me support you.

556
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:07,358
Even if it's too late
to bring up the past incident,

557
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:12,196
I'm certain that
she's still committing illegal actions.

558
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,324
Find out what it is.

559
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,201
Then we can bring her down.

560
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,080
Sir.

561
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,416
I'm not trying to bring anyone down.

562
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,336
You failed to protect me.

563
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,506
It was your duty
to protect the head of state.

564
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,426
Don't make the same mistake.

565
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,262
That should never happen.

566
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,351
Go to Yun Jayu.

567
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,311
Become her right-hand man.

568
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:45,813
Gain her trust.

569
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,285
PRESIDENT LEE MUNGYU

570
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,248
BLUETOOTH AUDIO

571
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,584
Yun Jayu of BF

572
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:10,379
is currently facing a lawsuit
against USMEF…

573
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,755
"And NCBA, and is receiving

574
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,716
many death threats."

575
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,690
"She's building a safe house
with state-of-the-art security.

576
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,693
She seems to be staying
at different hotels until it's complete.

577
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,910
Her younger sibling succumbed
to a degenerative brain disease.

578
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,704
She doesn't speak to her family.

579
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,706
Other than those affiliated with her work,

580
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,042
she doesn't seem to have
any acquaintances."

581
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,501
Do you think he'll believe it?

582
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:54,506
He wouldn't be a soldier if he doubted me.

583
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,888
Obeying the commands
of one's superior at all times.

584
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,641
That's what a soldier does.

585
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,268
Hmm.

586
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,021
I hope he's a soldier to the bone.

587
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,900
"There's a rumor that On San,
the research director and alumnus

588
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,985
of her school,
got a divorce because of her.

589
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,112
If the two are indeed lovers,

590
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:20,783
he could be her only relationship in life

591
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,159
and weakness."

592
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,538
BF will be hiring a bodyguard.

593
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,582
I can help you get in.

594
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,585
How will you do that?

595
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,673
You think I don't have
that much power because I'm disabled?

596
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,175
No, sir.

597
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,385
I apologize.

598
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:44,181
Many filed for bankruptcy
and even committed suicide

599
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,684
after BF expanded.

600
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,352
But Yun Jayu didn't bat an eye.

601
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,772
She was only interested
in making even more money.

602
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,315
I tried to stop her.

603
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,109
And that's why…

604
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,071
she got rid of me.

605
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:01,949
Captain Woo.

606
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,993
Isn't it a soldier's duty
to protect the people?

607
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:09,039
Have you already forgotten
the humiliation you felt that day?

608
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,169
Salute!

609
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,761
At ease!

610
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,349
I will catch you

611
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,269
no matter what.

612
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:38,652
Hello.

613
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,863
This is Woo Chaewoon.
