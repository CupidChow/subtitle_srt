BLOOD FREE

00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:44,840
PREVIOUSLY

3
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:46,927
Let me introduce the individual

4
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:48,597
who achieved the impossible.
Ms. Yun Jayu, the CEO of BF.

5
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,727
I have a dream.

6
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,191
I promise you all.
We will succeed in culturing all types.

7
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:55,611
We will succeed in culturing them.

8
00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:58,158
Don't make the same mistake.
That should never happen.

9
00:00:58,241 --> 00:01:01,039
Go to Yun Jayu.
Become her right-hand man. Gain her trust.

10
00:01:01,122 --> 00:01:03,251
-What is this?
-They told us to follow the directions

11
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:04,420
to decrypt the files.

12
00:01:04,504 --> 00:01:07,301
I'd like you to be someone we need.

13
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:08,470
You know CitizenX, right?

14
00:01:08,554 --> 00:01:12,604
Someone is pretending to be them
to hide their identity.

15
00:01:12,687 --> 00:01:14,273
-Jang Yeongsil.
-Yes, ma'am?

16
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:15,860
Search for Woo Chaewoon.

17
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,196
Why did you hide it from me?

18
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:19,450
I didn't see the need
to bring up the past.

19
00:01:19,534 --> 00:01:21,412
I don't even know
if our reunion is favorable.

20
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:24,753
A mole shouldn't be tight-lipped.

21
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:27,676
The ransomware
could've been an inside job.

22
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,428
Is Professor Kim going somewhere?

23
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:31,307
Locate Kim Singu right now.

24
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,896
We go back 20 years. Could he have…

25
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:38,488
I kept going back over it in my head.
"Was everything he said afterwards a lie?"

26
00:01:38,572 --> 00:01:40,367
I finally managed to fool her.

27
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,789
Ms. Yun from BF called.

28
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:44,375
She found out who was behind it.

29
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:47,381
What are your thoughts
on the rumor about you poisoning him?

30
00:01:47,464 --> 00:01:48,341
Damn it.

31
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:50,680
Did you kill someone?

32
00:01:50,763 --> 00:01:53,435
We're dealing
with more lunatics now.

33
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,067
But I don't plan to do that.
I have no intention of stopping.

34
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:00,449
I regret it. But now,
I'm going to do something about it.

35
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:05,710
I'll protect you.
I'll be by your side. Do you hear me?

36
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:09,551
Breathe. Keep breathing! You're okay!

37
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:12,557
Mr. President,
we have a bigger problem.

38
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,851
Activate the basement at HQ.

39
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,980
We're not ready for this just yet.

40
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,696
You were culturing human organs

41
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,199
in this laboratory.

42
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:22,952
On the first day we met,

43
00:02:23,036 --> 00:02:24,998
I asked you not to experiment with me
as if I were cultured meat.

44
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:28,714
Don't tell me you really think
there's another terrorist at large.

45
00:02:28,797 --> 00:02:29,758
You don't have the power.

46
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:33,014
There's no way you can turn the tables
regarding that case.

47
00:02:33,097 --> 00:02:34,518
Then do you, sir?

48
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:37,105
Are you saying there's a spy?
I wonder who it is.

49
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:39,193
I said I couldn't stop you
from leaving.

50
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:41,155
Thank you for saving my life.

51
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:44,078
Thank you for keeping me safe.

52
00:03:58,184 --> 00:03:59,938
Even a conglomerate's bodyguard like you

53
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:02,192
can't beat a stray like me.

54
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:09,749
Kim Hoseung!

55
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:17,765
Hoseung. Stay awake. Breathe.

56
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:22,399
-A scar…
-Don't talk. It's okay.

57
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:24,946
-Jang Yeongsil, call 911!
-Yes, sir.

58
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,787
Hoseung, wake up.

59
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:32,085
You're okay. Breathe. Hoseung!

60
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:40,393
Over here!

61
00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:42,314
Stop right there!

62
00:04:42,397 --> 00:04:44,485
Right there! Hey!

63
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:59,223
The culprit is still nearby.
He couldn't have gotten far!

64
00:05:12,165 --> 00:05:14,963
Stay still!

65
00:05:20,975 --> 00:05:21,977
Are you okay?

66
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:23,564
Yes.

67
00:05:44,856 --> 00:05:47,193
We're ready to culture grain.

68
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:49,448
The issue is
if we can make a profit or not.

69
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:55,836
I just got a call from the police station.

70
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,257
One of our bodyguards died,

71
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:01,932
and another one was arrested
at the scene as a murder suspect.

72
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:05,146
Make sure you meet them in person.

73
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:08,236
Tell them we'll cover the cost
of his funeral and everything.

74
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,739
Send our sincere condolences.

75
00:06:09,822 --> 00:06:10,741
Yes, ma'am.

76
00:06:53,994 --> 00:06:55,789
Yun Jayu's bodyguard died.

77
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,752
No, not him. Someone else.

78
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:02,678
Has the Engineer called you?
He should've reported in by now.

79
00:07:02,762 --> 00:07:04,807
Was it his doing? Are you positive?

80
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:08,272
What did he say?
Don't tell me you can't reach him.

81
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:10,694
Hold on.

82
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,119
- Find him at all costs.
-Yes, sir.

83
00:07:15,704 --> 00:07:19,086
-Damn it. That bastard must've run away.
-Hey.

84
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:21,423
-I'm going to flee now.
-No.

85
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,970
Jayu isn't an idiot.

86
00:07:24,555 --> 00:07:27,310
She'll wonder how the culprit knew
where her bodyguards would be.

87
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:28,688
It'll only be a matter of time.

88
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:30,943
Do you think
she won't be able to find you?

89
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:34,575
The Engineer disguised himself
from the get-go. But what about you?

90
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:37,540
Running away will just prove
that you tipped him off.

91
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,084
What if she catches me?

92
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,211
Deny it at all costs.

93
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,716
There won't be any proof
of your involvement.

94
00:07:43,384 --> 00:07:45,263
All she can do is guess.

95
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:47,016
So don't run away and just deny it.

96
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,068
I'll find that jerk,
so stay there and keep me updated.

97
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:52,987
Yes, sir.

98
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:57,580
These bastards are all the same.

99
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:56,823
-It's my favorite restaurant.
-Yeah?

100
00:08:56,906 --> 00:08:58,660
-I'm going there.
-Me too.

101
00:08:58,743 --> 00:09:00,872
-Follow me.
-I doubt it'll taste good.

102
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:03,460
-It's really good.
-I agree.

103
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:05,632
-It's delicious.
-Really?

104
00:09:05,716 --> 00:09:07,845
He's gone already.
What should we do?

105
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:09,014
What do you think?

106
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:11,143
Find him at all costs and bring him to me.

107
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:18,533
This is why I told you
not to hire someone from the outside.

108
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:20,453
An internal hire would've made it worse.

109
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:21,914
It can't get any worse than this.

110
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:26,381
He went into hiding. You could be
charged for conspiring with him.

111
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,845
So find him before the police do
before it's too late.

112
00:09:28,928 --> 00:09:31,851
Why should I? This is your mess.

113
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,274
It's obvious what they'll say

114
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:37,780
if the culprit claims
the DORSON Group made him do it.

115
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:40,702
"This is why the prime minister
stepped up for a bodyguard's death.

116
00:09:40,786 --> 00:09:42,288
He had something to do with it."

117
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:45,169
So catch him first
instead of complaining about it.

118
00:09:45,796 --> 00:09:48,258
Why do you think
I helped you become prime minister?

119
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:50,429
He's skilled
at putting the blame on others.

120
00:09:50,514 --> 00:09:52,643
We must find him
before he's caught and questioned.

121
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,396
You need to find him first.

122
00:09:55,398 --> 00:09:56,400
Are you listening?

123
00:09:56,483 --> 00:09:58,571
I am. I'm hanging up.

124
00:09:58,655 --> 00:10:00,366
That's no way to talk to your father.

125
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:02,538
How am I supposed to find him quickly

126
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:04,542
if you won't stop talking?

127
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,169
As if I talked more than he did.

128
00:10:09,593 --> 00:10:10,846
Call the chief of police.

129
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:11,931
Yes, sir.

130
00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:17,400
Hello, sir.

131
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,070
You see…

132
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:23,955
…I just heard some bad news.

133
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,753
I heard there was another casualty at BF.

134
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:28,464
Was the gang behind it?

135
00:10:29,048 --> 00:10:30,886
Do I have to make another public apology?

136
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,225
Hold on.

137
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:39,570
This means your men were after
someone else when they lost the culprit.

138
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:41,448
Why are you so incompetent?

139
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:48,378
How could a single man
fling three police officers in the air?

140
00:10:53,806 --> 00:10:54,809
Who was he?

141
00:11:04,537 --> 00:11:08,335
He had superhuman strength.
He was unbelievably strong.

142
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,801
He was dangerous,
so we had no choice but to arrest him.

143
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:18,940
Superhuman strength.

144
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:25,077
Unbelievably strong.

145
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,355
Ms. Yun.

146
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:45,577
You're making
all my childhood dreams come true.

147
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:57,559
BLOOD FREE

148
00:12:06,076 --> 00:12:08,539
Why did she have to send me here?

149
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:13,256
Good night.

150
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,802
I'm okay. This is nothing.

151
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:17,098
I scanned the entire house once more.

152
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:21,189
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

153
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:24,237
That damn bastard.

154
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,953
Why did he have to kill an innocent man?

155
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:33,548
EPISODE 7

156
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:34,967
God, this is annoying.

157
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:38,140
-Who is it?
-Hello, I--

158
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:40,520
Is this Mr. Kim Hoseung's house?

159
00:12:40,603 --> 00:12:41,939
He's not here right now.

160
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:44,737
I'm his coworker.

161
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,826
Can we talk?
There's something I need to tell you.

162
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,621
Do I have to open the door?

163
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:53,713
What the hell is he saying?

164
00:12:58,096 --> 00:13:01,436
My name is Jeong Haedeun.
What's your relation to Mr. Kim?

165
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,773
He's my parents' son.

166
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,402
-Sorry?
-He's my older brother.

167
00:13:19,848 --> 00:13:22,896
It wasn't then.
Everyone had left by then.

168
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,410
Who overheard us?

169
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:33,166
Who knew we were headed
to the welfare center?

170
00:13:34,753 --> 00:13:37,424
Let's go now
since Ms. Yun isn't going out.

171
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:42,561
Ma'am. Ms. Jeong said

172
00:13:42,644 --> 00:13:45,023
-I could go to the police station today.
-Excuse me.

173
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:47,236
Sir. Excuse me.

174
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:13,789
He injured one of our men

175
00:14:13,873 --> 00:14:16,002
and caused a scene
before getting arrested.

176
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,171
I cleared your murder charges.

177
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:41,553
I'm sorry.

178
00:14:41,637 --> 00:14:44,935
As for Mr. Kim, there was nothing…

179
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:48,901
we could do.

180
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:53,368
I shouldn't have sent you.

181
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:55,999
I should've ignored it.

182
00:14:57,376 --> 00:14:58,879
Can I get out of here?

183
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:03,346
You didn't murder anyone,
but you assaulted the police.

184
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,231
What happened?
Why did you assault the officers?

185
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:09,901
They said you flung their men.

186
00:15:10,987 --> 00:15:12,489
I don't know what happened.

187
00:15:12,574 --> 00:15:14,243
My body suddenly felt hot…

188
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,667
in that moment.

189
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:25,850
I'm not sure.

190
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:27,729
Do you mean your arm?

191
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,275
I think so.

192
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:33,281
Get a checkup
as soon as you get out of here.

193
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:34,701
After catching that bastard.

194
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:36,079
Right.

195
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:39,418
But we need to sort something out first.

196
00:15:42,382 --> 00:15:44,470
How did he know?

197
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:46,767
He could've approached
Professor Kim,

198
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,521
disguised as a cancer group member.

199
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:51,317
He would've given a fake address too.

200
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,785
But why was he there today
when he doesn't even live there?

201
00:15:56,369 --> 00:16:00,168
He knew we'd be there.

202
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,928
Did anyone else know
you were going to the welfare center?

203
00:16:05,513 --> 00:16:08,059
No, I only told Mr. Kim.

204
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:10,565
Hey, do you want to come with me
to the welfare center?

205
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:13,821
It was just us two.
No one could've heard us.

206
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:16,033
Then was it one of my people?

207
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:18,914
Hong Saeip? Seo Hui?

208
00:16:18,998 --> 00:16:20,668
Saeip knew

209
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:22,212
about Professor Kim's cancer group.

210
00:16:22,296 --> 00:16:23,298
Ms. Yun said that?

211
00:16:23,381 --> 00:16:26,053
Mr. Seo gave me the address
to the welfare center.

212
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:28,642
Saeip wouldn't have told me
about the group

213
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:30,980
if she were the spy.

214
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:33,109
And she wouldn't have drowned.

215
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:35,071
That leaves one person.

216
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:38,746
If Hoseung didn't tell anyone,

217
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:41,000
then it was Hui.

218
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:46,929
Do you think he hired the killer?

219
00:16:47,012 --> 00:16:50,060
The killer called himself a stray.

220
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:53,984
Did you speak with him?

221
00:16:54,068 --> 00:16:55,529
I heard him from afar.

222
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:58,326
By "stray," he must've meant he was hired.

223
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:02,125
He didn't attack Kim Singu or BF
due to personal reasons.

224
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,052
Let me know if you need anything.

225
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:07,971
Ms. Yun.

226
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:14,275
We wouldn't have found out about this mole
without Hoseung's sacrifice.

227
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:18,283
And this just proves
that Kim Singu could've been murdered.

228
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,126
Is that supposed to comfort me?

229
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,380
Because we got something out of it?

230
00:17:25,463 --> 00:17:26,675
Even so,

231
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,309
do you regret sending us there
and not sweeping this

232
00:17:32,937 --> 00:17:34,064
under the rug?

233
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,162
We must hunt down the traitor.

234
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:48,092
I shouldn't have sent you.

235
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,560
I should've gone instead.

236
00:17:57,069 --> 00:17:59,031
I need to tell you something once I'm out.

237
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,795
You're giving me a heads-up.

238
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:08,509
You were shot once,
and you lost your colleague today.

239
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:12,015
You don't think
you can continue working for me.

240
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:14,186
Is that it?

241
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:17,860
In conclusion, I guess you could say that.

242
00:18:19,614 --> 00:18:20,741
I'm sorry.

243
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,454
I failed to protect you.

244
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:27,547
Even now.

245
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:38,443
Wait.

246
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:41,825
It won't take long. Please.

247
00:18:42,618 --> 00:18:43,912
Hey, are they done?

248
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:45,373
Yes, they are.

249
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,877
Okay. Let's go.

250
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:52,889
Goodbye then.

251
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:13,972
-I need you to get me something.
-What is it, ma'am?

252
00:19:16,393 --> 00:19:18,732
Hello, Ms. Yun.

253
00:19:20,068 --> 00:19:21,988
I'm Lee Daesik, chief of Euljung Station.

254
00:19:23,534 --> 00:19:25,453
I'm sorry for what my bodyguard did.

255
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:27,708
I asked to see you
so I could apologize in person.

256
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:31,758
Don't worry about it. It's okay.
Please come this way.

257
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:37,435
Our dashcam recorded
the culprit running away.

258
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:39,816
That's the suspect.

259
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:43,907
We had all rushed to another site,

260
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:46,120
so we weren't present at this time.

261
00:19:47,957 --> 00:19:49,627
Right.

262
00:20:06,035 --> 00:20:09,333
This dashcam footage was
retrieved from your late bodyguard's car.

263
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,120
Weren't we only able to retrieve this

264
00:20:28,204 --> 00:20:31,251
because we swiftly reached out
to the control center?

265
00:20:31,335 --> 00:20:32,212
Correct, sir.

266
00:20:44,194 --> 00:20:45,656
-Jang Yeongsil.
-Yes, sir?

267
00:20:45,739 --> 00:20:50,331
Show me the route that our vehicle took
20 minutes prior to Kim Hoseung's death.

268
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,045
Connect to the CCTV cameras
that recorded said vehicle.

269
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,307
Rewind ten minutes.

270
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:01,521
Stop.

271
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,608
Rewind four seconds.

272
00:21:05,278 --> 00:21:06,280
Two seconds forward.

273
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:12,960
Combine the footage
from 60 seconds before and after.

274
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:18,930
Yeongsil, remove his glasses.

275
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,569
I got his face.
I'll send it to you right now.

276
00:21:26,445 --> 00:21:27,990
AGE: LATE 30S TO EARLY 40S

277
00:21:28,074 --> 00:21:32,248
Even the control center
couldn't locate where he went.

278
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,506
So we're doing our best to track him down.

279
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:41,433
We got his license plate number.

280
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:44,607
But the car is a lease
that he used a fake ID to get.

281
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:51,871
Is there a photo of the victim
when he was first found?

282
00:21:51,955 --> 00:21:55,629
Yes, of course.
Didn't the body cam record him?

283
00:21:55,712 --> 00:21:57,298
Yes, it did.

284
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,595
Let me show you the photos first.

285
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:14,709
As for the autopsy photos…

286
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,130
Please.

287
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:18,382
…we don't have them yet.

288
00:22:19,092 --> 00:22:22,558
We're currently looking for the vehicle,
so we'll find it soon.

289
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:25,313
I hope so.

290
00:22:25,396 --> 00:22:29,780
But I doubt he fled in his car
simply because he needed transportation.

291
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:32,536
I guess you could say that.

292
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:37,755
He'll probably get rid of it first
since his DNA is all over it.

293
00:22:37,838 --> 00:22:38,673
-Yeongsil.
-Yes?

294
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,345
Were any Travelers scrapped-- No.

295
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:43,767
Did any Traveler
go up in flames, explode,

296
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,021
or go underwater after 11 a.m. today?

297
00:22:46,104 --> 00:22:47,650
Did my bodyguard tell you

298
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,321
about the welfare center
and the post office?

299
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:52,868
The suspect must be on their CCTV cameras.

300
00:22:53,745 --> 00:22:56,416
We're currently trying
to get our hands on the footage.

301
00:22:59,924 --> 00:23:04,558
I heard that my bodyguard
unintentionally hurt an officer.

302
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,984
I apologize.

303
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:11,739
It's okay, ma'am. It was nothing serious.

304
00:23:13,576 --> 00:23:15,622
Please take your time
to investigate this case.

305
00:23:15,706 --> 00:23:17,543
We'll cooperate as much as possible.

306
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:23,555
By the way,
your bodyguard is unusually strong.

307
00:23:24,222 --> 00:23:25,642
He's a bodyguard after all.

308
00:23:25,726 --> 00:23:27,604
Yes, that's true. But still…

309
00:23:27,688 --> 00:23:30,443
I located his vehicle.

310
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:33,825
A vehicle was reportedly set on fire.

311
00:23:33,908 --> 00:23:34,785
Sorry?

312
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:38,626
The Gangbyeon Fire Station got a call
about nearby repair shops and the car

313
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,714
going up in flames,
fueled by the inflammables.

314
00:23:40,797 --> 00:23:42,258
But I think it's the same model.

315
00:23:42,342 --> 00:23:45,766
Clean Repair Shop in Gangbyeon.
That's where the fire began.

316
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:47,185
How did you know that?

317
00:23:48,187 --> 00:23:50,567
-Look into it.
-I should get going. Goodbye.

318
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:53,948
Have a safe trip back, ma'am.

319
00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:02,508
How did she know that?

320
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:11,859
KG LOW TO MID 70S
LATE 30S TO EARLY 40S

321
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:12,945
What?

322
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,116
-I sent it, ma'am.
-And the earphones?

323
00:24:16,536 --> 00:24:17,453
I passed them on.

324
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:40,458
Mr. Seo, could you deactivate this?
It popped up.

325
00:24:47,723 --> 00:24:48,558
Is that him?

326
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:49,643
Yes.

327
00:24:50,562 --> 00:24:52,816
He's something else. A total professional.

328
00:24:53,651 --> 00:24:55,362
He subdued our bodyguard.

329
00:24:55,446 --> 00:24:59,663
No, the sensor suit-- Never mind.

330
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,667
What is it?

331
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:05,257
What is it? Did Mr. Kim die
because of the sensor suit?

332
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:06,636
That's not why.

333
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:11,186
-Yeongsil, the crime scene photos.
-Yes, sir.

334
00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:20,412
He was stabbed through this small opening.

335
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,381
Pick a suit that fits you.

336
00:25:25,464 --> 00:25:27,343
Am I getting one? For free?

337
00:25:27,928 --> 00:25:29,598
Yes, it's free.

338
00:25:29,682 --> 00:25:32,854
Gosh, this is amazing.
Mr. Seo, this is amazing.

339
00:25:45,547 --> 00:25:49,722
-Why did I have to design it like that?
-It's not your fault--

340
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:50,974
What?

341
00:25:57,236 --> 00:25:59,365
That's all the help I needed.
I'm sure you're busy.

342
00:26:39,822 --> 00:26:42,076
It's great to have connections.

343
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,663
He's walking free
after assaulting police officers.

344
00:26:43,746 --> 00:26:45,625
That's enough.

345
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:50,384
Ms. Yun asked us
to give this to you before you left.

346
00:26:57,189 --> 00:26:58,024
May I go now?

347
00:26:58,651 --> 00:26:59,695
Yes, you may.

348
00:27:00,822 --> 00:27:03,536
-Sorry about everything.
-That's okay.

349
00:27:13,305 --> 00:27:15,392
Where are you? Are you out already?

350
00:27:15,476 --> 00:27:17,271
I thought you got me out.

351
00:27:18,273 --> 00:27:19,108
It wasn't me.

352
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:23,116
But the officer said I had connections.

353
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:30,507
Hello?

354
00:27:42,238 --> 00:27:44,116
-Yeongsil, locate Woo Chaewoon.
-Yes, ma'am.

355
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,779
Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?

356
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:36,012
I thought she just saved your life,
not turned you into an android.

357
00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:38,893
What did BF do to you?

358
00:28:40,437 --> 00:28:43,193
I'm afraid I don't follow, sir.

359
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,248
No, you do. You definitely do.
So quit playing dumb.

360
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,843
I don't understand
what you're talking about, sir.

361
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,336
I heard you easily subdued
a group of police officers.

362
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:17,386
I heard you flung them in the air.

363
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:21,645
It was this sensor suit.

364
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:24,568
BF gifted me with this sensor suit.

365
00:29:24,651 --> 00:29:26,864
It's bulletproof
and makes the wearer stronger.

366
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,243
But I can still feel things,

367
00:29:29,326 --> 00:29:32,332
-so please don't throw anything.
-How dare you

368
00:29:33,753 --> 00:29:35,255
act cheeky in front of me?

369
00:29:39,723 --> 00:29:41,685
Then how about this for a serious topic?

370
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:44,649
Kir.

371
00:29:45,526 --> 00:29:46,695
You know him, don't you?

372
00:29:47,947 --> 00:29:50,076
His family left AZORAN
with Special Immigrant Visas

373
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,582
right after the explosion occurred.

374
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,339
They're enjoying
a comfortable life abroad as we speak.

375
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:01,892
You're not surprised to hear

376
00:30:02,811 --> 00:30:05,398
that a terrorist's family is living well.

377
00:30:06,192 --> 00:30:11,118
I can't believe
you thought I wasn't aware of that.

378
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,331
That's fascinating.

379
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:19,218
Had you been aware of it,
you should've been doubtful like I was.

380
00:30:23,142 --> 00:30:27,067
And you wouldn't have thought
I was purely delusional for thinking

381
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,946
there was a mastermind behind the attack.

382
00:30:30,616 --> 00:30:32,537
It must've upset you a lot
when I said that.

383
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,456
Have you been holding a grudge?

384
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,920
You're the one
who should have reasonable doubts.

385
00:30:37,797 --> 00:30:41,053
But you concluded that the culprit
was caught and that it was over.

386
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:42,640
It just doesn't make any sense.

387
00:30:43,224 --> 00:30:44,811
There must be a reason.

388
00:30:47,525 --> 00:30:49,278
I've always been curious.

389
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:53,494
Getting a Special Immigrant Visa in AZORAN
back then was almost impossible.

390
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:56,208
So how did his family get it?

391
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,087
And one more thing.

392
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:04,350
How could the Korean embassy
issue the visas?

393
00:31:07,064 --> 00:31:08,066
Was it you?

394
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:17,292
Do you think I'd use my power for that?

395
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,378
No, sir.

396
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:23,429
I'm asking if you attempted
to murder former president Lee Mungyu.

397
00:31:26,268 --> 00:31:31,571
He was against all forms
of synthetic biology.

398
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:36,581
Had he been in office
for a few more years,

399
00:31:36,665 --> 00:31:40,046
he would've shut down BF,
a company you're very much interested in.

400
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:44,179
You've gone insane.

401
00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:49,899
Do you think I would've harmed
my own grandfather? My own blood?

402
00:31:49,983 --> 00:31:52,613
Then it must've been someone higher up
who's not related to him.

403
00:31:52,697 --> 00:31:54,241
Someone above you.

404
00:31:55,661 --> 00:31:57,957
Was it a coincidence
that Chairman Seonu Geun

405
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,086
got a divorce soon after
the incident at AZORAN?

406
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:05,723
His ex-wife put up with him for decades
despite his countless scandals.

407
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:10,023
Did the lady of DORSON Group…

408
00:32:12,027 --> 00:32:14,616
ever explain the reason to you, her son?

409
00:32:30,856 --> 00:32:32,150
You weren't lying.

410
00:32:33,277 --> 00:32:36,075
That sensor suit is well made.

411
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:37,823
Water!

412
00:33:40,036 --> 00:33:41,623
Water.

413
00:33:48,595 --> 00:33:49,764
You have hemophilia.

414
00:33:50,473 --> 00:33:52,477
Shut up.

415
00:33:58,281 --> 00:34:00,285
What is it?

416
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,917
Okay. I got it.

417
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,792
Get lost.

418
00:34:29,594 --> 00:34:30,721
I said, get lost.

419
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:46,418
Why now when I'm in this condition?

420
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:50,426
If he cared so much about his appearance…

421
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:14,224
Where is he?

422
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:20,696
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

423
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:22,992
The prime minister knows a lot, ma'am.

424
00:35:23,075 --> 00:35:24,745
And he has no intention of hiding it.

425
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:00,399
So the rumors were true.

426
00:36:01,653 --> 00:36:03,072
About your relationship.

427
00:36:06,036 --> 00:36:09,000
What kind of relationship
could we have when we're not even related?

428
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,879
You came to his rescue.

429
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:12,465
And much sooner than I expected.

430
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,933
Sir, I never pegged you
as the romantic type.

431
00:36:17,726 --> 00:36:19,312
I've known you for many years.

432
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:25,032
You were never interested in others,
let alone men.

433
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:27,997
So why did you rush over here?

434
00:36:30,126 --> 00:36:31,378
To protect the company's secret.

435
00:36:32,171 --> 00:36:35,303
Because that man is your walking secret.

436
00:36:37,725 --> 00:36:41,524
You've found a way to prolong life,
haven't you?

437
00:36:43,945 --> 00:36:46,450
You succeeded in culturing organs,
haven't you?

438
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,086
Yes, I have.

439
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:06,658
Just show it to me. Only me.

440
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:09,037
I won't even tell my father about it.

441
00:37:09,956 --> 00:37:11,876
It's simple if you want to know.

442
00:37:13,295 --> 00:37:15,926
Please revise the bioethics law.

443
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:19,182
Then we'll make an announcement.

444
00:37:19,265 --> 00:37:22,731
"BF has successfully cultured human organs
that can be commercialized now.

445
00:37:23,692 --> 00:37:25,696
Humanity will suffer no more pain--"

446
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:29,119
No. Not all of humanity.

447
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,123
Why would you announce that?

448
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:38,680
What'll happen if everyone
is granted immortality?

449
00:37:38,763 --> 00:37:41,143
Those people outside
won't be able to handle it.

450
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:45,902
They'll become extremely reckless
because they can live forever.

451
00:37:49,325 --> 00:37:50,954
"Those people outside"?

452
00:37:51,037 --> 00:37:53,960
What about our natural resources?
They'll still reproduce.

453
00:37:54,044 --> 00:37:55,421
We can always produce more meat.

454
00:37:55,505 --> 00:37:58,762
But what about land?
Natural resources? Jobs?

455
00:37:59,638 --> 00:38:03,061
Generations must be replaced, Ms. Yun--

456
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:08,447
"Life may be unfair, but there's one thing
that everyone will face.

457
00:38:09,992 --> 00:38:10,994
Death.

458
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:15,461
Culturing organs will take away
that remaining fairness from us."

459
00:38:15,545 --> 00:38:16,923
I've heard this countless times.

460
00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:19,093
And I made this decision every time:

461
00:38:20,722 --> 00:38:23,561
"I will create a future
that is equal for all."

462
00:38:25,649 --> 00:38:27,611
But this is a first.

463
00:38:27,694 --> 00:38:31,034
You think everyone else but you
should get sick and die?

464
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:35,209
You gave me other excuses,
but are you actually worried about them?

465
00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:40,219
Is it not that you, the high and mighty,
don't want to be like the rest of them?

466
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:43,308
We can't be the same.

467
00:38:44,227 --> 00:38:46,148
It's impossible.

468
00:38:46,231 --> 00:38:48,485
Let's say your dream came true.

469
00:38:49,195 --> 00:38:53,036
Let's say purchasing organs becomes
as cheap as buying over-the-counter drugs.

470
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,876
Let's say everyone can live for centuries.

471
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,671
Regardless, the poor will remain poor.

472
00:38:58,255 --> 00:39:00,635
We'll only be prolonging their pain.

473
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:02,221
Then who will suffer their fury?

474
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,394
Us. The rich.

475
00:39:05,937 --> 00:39:08,776
There's only so much wealth,
but they can live forever.

476
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,657
Don't you think that'll cause a riot?

477
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:14,538
Just look at those commoners.

478
00:39:15,331 --> 00:39:16,792
They think the rich are evil.

479
00:39:17,586 --> 00:39:20,842
And you were their biggest victim.

480
00:39:22,094 --> 00:39:23,806
Side with humanity.

481
00:39:25,267 --> 00:39:26,938
Which side do you think I'm on?

482
00:39:27,689 --> 00:39:28,858
You're on your own.

483
00:39:31,112 --> 00:39:34,410
Achieving it together would be
considered human evolution. But alone,

484
00:39:35,245 --> 00:39:36,540
you'd just be a mutation.

485
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:41,299
You're the wealthiest
and most powerful individual I know.

486
00:39:42,468 --> 00:39:45,809
You've lived comfortably all your life.

487
00:39:46,769 --> 00:39:49,900
And despite it all,
what you've always wanted

488
00:39:51,027 --> 00:39:52,572
is to become a mutation?

489
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,787
To be different from the rest?

490
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:59,628
That's rich coming from someone
who created a mutation herself.

491
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:02,049
I heard he has superhuman strength.

492
00:40:02,926 --> 00:40:06,391
He should be dead right now,
but he has superpowers.

493
00:40:07,602 --> 00:40:09,272
If that's not a mutation, then what is?

494
00:40:09,355 --> 00:40:11,736
I see. He was your first subject.

495
00:40:12,612 --> 00:40:14,282
Fine. He was your lab rat.

496
00:40:14,992 --> 00:40:16,787
You said we had to do this together.

497
00:40:16,871 --> 00:40:20,002
That's why I'm volunteering
to be the next subject.

498
00:40:24,218 --> 00:40:26,849
Or I'll just dissect that lab rat.

499
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,314
I have the right to order a search

500
00:40:30,397 --> 00:40:32,527
and seizure for the illegal acts
committed by BF.

501
00:40:32,611 --> 00:40:34,990
I'll confiscate all evidence
and related technology.

502
00:40:43,215 --> 00:40:46,137
Is this your only way of threatening me?

503
00:40:46,764 --> 00:40:48,851
What more do I need to say?

504
00:40:54,153 --> 00:40:56,951
Frustrated, aren't you?

505
00:40:59,706 --> 00:41:00,708
Ms. Yun.

506
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:05,050
I care…

507
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,935
about you.

508
00:41:22,084 --> 00:41:27,386
Grab onto me before you lose everything
and regret it all.

509
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,810
This is your last chance.

510
00:41:35,612 --> 00:41:37,031
I can see that.

511
00:41:38,492 --> 00:41:42,500
You're about to reveal your true colors
and challenge me.

512
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:44,505
I can see that.

513
00:41:46,466 --> 00:41:49,055
You did a good job
pretending to be someone useful until now.

514
00:42:09,095 --> 00:42:10,180
Yes, sir.

515
00:42:11,474 --> 00:42:12,978
Okay, I'll go right now.

516
00:42:18,906 --> 00:42:20,785
I'll drive.

517
00:42:30,387 --> 00:42:31,640
It was Ms. Jeong.

518
00:42:32,976 --> 00:42:34,395
Did you catch her?

519
00:42:34,478 --> 00:42:38,236
Did you tell Hoseung
about your plans this morning?

520
00:42:44,415 --> 00:42:47,004
Ms. Jeong knew as well.

521
00:42:51,638 --> 00:42:55,730
He said we should head out now
because you didn't have plans today.

522
00:42:55,813 --> 00:42:59,403
Ma'am, Ms. Jeong said I could go
to the police station today.

523
00:42:59,487 --> 00:43:03,453
He must've asked Ms. Jeong
about your plans like he did last time.

524
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:07,712
MS. YUN
JEONG HAEDEUN COULD BE THE MOLE

525
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,641
"Why do you want to know
about Ms. Yun's plans for the day?"

526
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:16,145
Ms. Jeong probably asked him that.

527
00:43:19,151 --> 00:43:21,990
We need to know what she did afterward.

528
00:43:22,074 --> 00:43:24,120
We found out.

529
00:43:30,257 --> 00:43:32,010
-Hello?
-Are you still outside?

530
00:43:32,971 --> 00:43:35,183
Go to Nakyeon-dong. The suspect is there.

531
00:43:35,267 --> 00:43:36,477
Did he get caught?

532
00:43:36,562 --> 00:43:37,856
Go to Corner Motel in Nakyeon 1-dong.

533
00:43:53,178 --> 00:43:54,890
SISTER
ENGINEER MIGHT GET CAUGHT

534
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:59,148
What was that? Give that back!

535
00:43:59,231 --> 00:44:02,906
What's your problem? Let go of me!
What's wrong with you?

536
00:44:02,989 --> 00:44:04,910
What's your deal?

537
00:44:04,993 --> 00:44:07,665
-Who was she texting?
-They can't track the recipient.

538
00:44:07,749 --> 00:44:09,251
Any records of them communicating?

539
00:44:09,335 --> 00:44:10,671
-Not at all.
-Damn it.

540
00:44:10,755 --> 00:44:11,840
You have it all wrong.

541
00:44:11,924 --> 00:44:14,094
Aren't you embarrassed
now that we got you?

542
00:44:15,263 --> 00:44:16,098
Aren't you upset?

543
00:44:16,182 --> 00:44:20,315
"Why did San tell me
to go see the suspect?"

544
00:44:20,398 --> 00:44:23,071
I bet you were in too much of a hurry
to consider that.

545
00:44:26,202 --> 00:44:30,628
Who is this "sister"
that you hurriedly texted? Tell us.

546
00:44:32,966 --> 00:44:34,134
Ms. Yun.

547
00:44:34,678 --> 00:44:37,057
How could you do this to me?

548
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,063
Look. You were the one
who asked me to quit my job as a lawyer

549
00:44:40,146 --> 00:44:42,276
and work for you instead.

550
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:44,071
How could I have possibly killed anyone?

551
00:44:44,154 --> 00:44:46,660
Ms. Yun, it's me! Jeong Haedeun!

552
00:44:46,743 --> 00:44:48,706
Get your damn hands off of me.

553
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:52,129
Not only were you a spy,
but you killed a man.

554
00:44:52,212 --> 00:44:53,172
It wasn't me.

555
00:44:54,174 --> 00:44:56,763
How many times must I tell you?
Call the police.

556
00:44:56,847 --> 00:44:58,391
And tell them I'm a spy.

557
00:44:58,474 --> 00:45:03,192
Let them interrogate me and find out
what classified information I leaked!

558
00:45:03,276 --> 00:45:06,115
How much is DORSON paying you to do this?

559
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:08,913
If it's not money,

560
00:45:09,496 --> 00:45:12,002
are you secretly dating Seonu Geun?

561
00:45:13,171 --> 00:45:14,298
Or is it Seonu Jae?

562
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:16,511
Maybe it's both of them.

563
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,561
Ms. Yun.

564
00:45:22,481 --> 00:45:23,609
How could you--

565
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,282
How could you let him say such a thing?

566
00:45:28,535 --> 00:45:30,038
Damn it.

567
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:43,398
Professor Kim's wife died
in our laboratory.

568
00:45:45,695 --> 00:45:48,032
The ill woman died
after visiting her husband's workplace.

569
00:45:48,617 --> 00:45:49,619
Seonu Jae must know that.

570
00:45:49,703 --> 00:45:52,792
It was probably the first thing
Professor Kim told the killer.

571
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:56,173
But Seonu Jae didn't mention it
when he threatened me.

572
00:45:57,467 --> 00:45:58,721
He had to play dumb.

573
00:45:58,804 --> 00:46:01,685
Even a prime minister
couldn't have known that

574
00:46:01,768 --> 00:46:04,481
unless he was the one
who sent the spy or the killer.

575
00:46:05,275 --> 00:46:06,277
Exactly.

576
00:46:07,112 --> 00:46:09,158
He knew it would've been
my biggest weakness

577
00:46:09,241 --> 00:46:10,745
both legally and socially.

578
00:46:11,454 --> 00:46:14,501
But he remained tight-lipped
to protect himself.

579
00:46:14,586 --> 00:46:17,717
He would've been confessing to his crimes
had he mentioned it.

580
00:46:22,392 --> 00:46:23,854
What about Ms. Jeong?

581
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:28,655
She was their spy.

582
00:46:29,574 --> 00:46:31,202
So will she confess?

583
00:46:32,037 --> 00:46:33,289
This is unlawful imprisonment.

584
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,592
You know I'm a lawyer, don't you?

585
00:46:40,053 --> 00:46:41,138
Did the prime minister

586
00:46:42,182 --> 00:46:44,729
say that you'd live forever as well?

587
00:47:12,743 --> 00:47:13,996
Damn it.

588
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,628
Are you trying to jump on the bandwagon?

589
00:47:19,757 --> 00:47:21,260
Who do you think you are?

590
00:47:22,262 --> 00:47:25,561
Just hit me.
I'll add assault to the charges.

591
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:37,250
You put me on the interview list.

592
00:47:38,795 --> 00:47:40,799
That way, I'd become her bodyguard,

593
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:43,555
and DORSON would send me here.

594
00:47:44,766 --> 00:47:46,561
Seonu Jae didn't send me here to find out

595
00:47:47,229 --> 00:47:49,776
who was responsible
for injuring his grandfather.

596
00:47:50,569 --> 00:47:53,115
We're hacking BF.
Infiltrate their security system now.

597
00:47:54,284 --> 00:47:57,792
Shut down their system completely
and get the data in the next two days.

598
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:04,137
He was using the disabled, old man

599
00:48:05,098 --> 00:48:07,018
to swallow BF whole.

600
00:48:15,911 --> 00:48:17,205
However…

601
00:48:19,293 --> 00:48:21,673
I guess he has no plans
to protect his spy.

602
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,562
Let go of me!

603
00:48:33,446 --> 00:48:36,201
I'm not like the rest of these people.

604
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:42,130
-Who killed Hoseung?
-Damn it! Let go of me!

605
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,186
Who killed him?

606
00:48:57,912 --> 00:49:01,544
Ms. Yun, please help me.

607
00:49:02,755 --> 00:49:03,632
You should all leave.

608
00:49:03,715 --> 00:49:06,053
Ms. Yun, please help me.

609
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:12,440
Ms. Yun--

610
00:49:12,525 --> 00:49:14,946
How long have you been working for him?

611
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:18,662
-Since the terror attack?
-What are you saying?

612
00:49:18,745 --> 00:49:20,039
What are you talking about?

613
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,962
Ms. Yun.

614
00:49:23,045 --> 00:49:24,882
Ms. Yun, help.

615
00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:28,843
