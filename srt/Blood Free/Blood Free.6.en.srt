1
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:43,921
BLOOD FREE

2
00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:54,651
BL1 LAB

3
00:01:01,497 --> 00:01:03,418
Hey. So you were here.

4
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:09,681
I have to head to the police station
to give a statement about the incident.

5
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:10,767
I see.

6
00:01:11,727 --> 00:01:13,146
Want to come with me?

7
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,528
No thanks.

8
00:01:16,612 --> 00:01:17,446
I'm sure…

9
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,574
EPISODE 6

10
00:01:18,657 --> 00:01:19,993
…they're more curious to hear from you.

11
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,375
What in the world happened?

12
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,337
You should at least tell me.

13
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:27,132
Why should I?

14
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,969
What?

15
00:01:29,053 --> 00:01:31,725
Because we work together.

16
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:34,773
I feel left out.

17
00:01:34,856 --> 00:01:36,568
It won't happen again.

18
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:38,823
What won't happen again?

19
00:01:39,574 --> 00:01:42,539
Where are you going? Ms. Yun is--

20
00:01:46,087 --> 00:01:47,089
She's alone.

21
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:49,553
The other bodyguards
are private security, so I--

22
00:01:53,309 --> 00:01:54,729
Are you serious?

23
00:01:55,397 --> 00:01:57,067
What do you want me to do?

24
00:01:58,445 --> 00:02:00,867
You're so stubborn.

25
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:16,230
Damn it. Why am I being excluded?

26
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:21,073
I got this job fair and square too.

27
00:02:33,516 --> 00:02:34,601
Keep your word.

28
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,897
You'd be lying if you left.

29
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:45,873
Excuse me.

30
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:57,396
I just got visual confirmation
of the first successful case

31
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,941
of our cultured muscle fiber.

32
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:03,576
It's impossible to believe
that the subject had been fatally wounded.

33
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,584
I owe it to you all. Thank you.

34
00:03:08,418 --> 00:03:09,754
You did it.

35
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,469
People naturally want to brag
when they create something.

36
00:03:13,554 --> 00:03:14,681
Especially engineers.

37
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,812
But please refrain
from doing that for now.

38
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:19,189
This is still classified.

39
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,820
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

40
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:25,160
You didn't have to call us here
just to say that.

41
00:03:25,243 --> 00:03:26,329
We're not kids.

42
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,335
I want to speak with Ms. Hong.

43
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:40,900
What? Already?

44
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:42,987
I guess we really did it.

45
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:46,285
What did you want to talk about?

46
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:52,590
I'm sure you never want to hear
his name again,

47
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:55,178
but you two had
the closest working relationship.

48
00:03:58,686 --> 00:03:59,813
Professor Kim?

49
00:04:04,572 --> 00:04:06,158
I kept going back over it in my head.

50
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:09,123
"Was everything he said afterwards a lie?"

51
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,001
After what?

52
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:13,799
After his wife passed away.

53
00:04:18,474 --> 00:04:19,769
"I know you did your best."

54
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:24,654
"You all did well."

55
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:26,449
-Warning. EEG, ECG…
-Yeongsil, open the bed.

56
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,119
…and EMG measurements not possible.

57
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:31,793
Warning. EEG, ECG,
and EMG measurements not possible.

58
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:32,837
-100 joules.
-Charging.

59
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,049
Shoot.

60
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:37,137
-200 joules.
-Charging.

61
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,724
Shoot.

62
00:04:38,807 --> 00:04:40,895
One more time. Shoot.

63
00:04:44,611 --> 00:04:46,447
One more time. Shoot.

64
00:05:15,506 --> 00:05:16,842
I'm truly sorry.

65
00:05:20,516 --> 00:05:21,768
What?

66
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:26,820
It's okay.

67
00:05:28,532 --> 00:05:29,826
I know you did your best.

68
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:33,291
You all did well.

69
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:43,729
Honey, let's go home.

70
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:50,491
Let's go home.

71
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,838
Do you think he had resented me ever since

72
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:03,059
but hid his feelings all along
just so he could retaliate one day?

73
00:06:05,104 --> 00:06:07,067
Because if I knew he resented me,

74
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,822
then he would've been
the first person I suspected.

75
00:06:10,824 --> 00:06:12,452
Let's say this for the sake of argument.

76
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:15,291
He was the one
who begged you to perform the surgery.

77
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,172
But as a result,
his wife's health deteriorated.

78
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:22,305
So as any human would do,
he started to resent you.

79
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,059
Even if that were the case,

80
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:27,525
do you think he would have hidden
his feelings from the get-go?

81
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:29,486
Do you think he was planning his revenge?

82
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:32,200
That's the only way
to explain what happened.

83
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:34,831
He died right before his arrest
without revealing the truth.

84
00:06:34,914 --> 00:06:38,212
And, as a result,
people suspect me of poisoning him.

85
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:42,012
So you think he committed suicide?

86
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:44,016
To complete his revenge?

87
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,478
Though he barely got revenge.

88
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:48,692
Do you think he wanted

89
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:52,240
to cause you as much harm as possible
before getting arrested?

90
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:55,079
That would be a better ending for him

91
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:57,292
since it would be his choice.

92
00:07:00,173 --> 00:07:02,385
But he didn't know about his fate.

93
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:06,226
He didn't know
he'd get arrested after landing.

94
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,938
That's why he drank champagne.

95
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:10,401
He was celebrating his success.

96
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:13,825
If you think it wasn't his choice, then…

97
00:07:14,577 --> 00:07:16,790
If he hadn't planned this from the get-go,

98
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:18,960
then he had a change of heart.

99
00:07:20,547 --> 00:07:21,966
There must have been a point

100
00:07:24,054 --> 00:07:25,139
when he suddenly changed.

101
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:33,114
Maybe he did something out of character
or met someone new after losing his wife.

102
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:42,298
I just thought
he was adjusting back to his old life.

103
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:46,223
-He had joined a group too.
-What group?

104
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:47,893
It wasn't anything special.

105
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:51,233
Early last year
after his wife passed away,

106
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:54,949
he would leave work
at 6:00 p.m. sharp every Wednesday.

107
00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:56,451
-You're going today too?
-What?

108
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:59,040
I asked him later,
and he said he was meeting with a group.

109
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:01,003
I'll leave you to it then.

110
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:04,594
A group for bereaved families
of cancer patients.

111
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:06,096
That would be unlike him.

112
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:08,017
Exactly.

113
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,483
I thought he must be in a lot of pain,
given how he wasn't very social.

114
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:15,949
But it must have helped.
I could see him improving.

115
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:18,204
He must've befriended someone.

116
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,794
But it didn't last long.

117
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:24,007
Aren't you leaving?

118
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:26,220
-What?
-It's Wednesday.

119
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:28,349
-You have that group meeting.
-Right.

120
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:31,856
Everyone there is a coward.

121
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:33,442
A coward?

122
00:08:37,492 --> 00:08:38,745
I don't understand

123
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:44,089
how he could have become so evil.

124
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:57,741
I won't ask you to bring him to mind
ever again.

125
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,409
Team Leader Hong Saeip.

126
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:20,996
What?

127
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:23,375
I'm not a team leader.

128
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:24,712
Why not?

129
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:27,593
It's a given
for the chief researcher to become one

130
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:31,475
since the position
for Research Team Three is vacant.

131
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:34,022
It's not a given.

132
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:35,609
Once you become the team leader

133
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:40,201
and the work you do
in the basement becomes a success,

134
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:43,457
your future will be paved out for you.

135
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:53,394
I beg to differ.

136
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,028
We don't even know how long cultured
meat will remain as the core item at BF.

137
00:09:58,112 --> 00:10:00,742
It's true that our IT sector
has grown significantly.

138
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:03,706
I'm the one who should be worried.

139
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,627
Why you?

140
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,215
If our company's future
lies in the basement,

141
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:12,140
I might eventually get kicked out
since it has nothing to do with me.

142
00:10:12,223 --> 00:10:15,522
I wasn't a doctor like you were.

143
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:22,452
We always need someone
with legal expertise.

144
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:24,707
Goodbye then.

145
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:34,434
So it's related to medical science.

146
00:10:36,773 --> 00:10:38,442
You tainted your reputation

147
00:10:38,526 --> 00:10:40,655
the moment you claimed
your culture fluid was trash.

148
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:43,243
No! It wasn't me! It's all a lie!

149
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,370
It wasn't him?

150
00:10:44,454 --> 00:10:46,082
They said it was full of germs!

151
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,378
Then the news reported that
and people believed them!

152
00:10:48,462 --> 00:10:51,051
They're all the same!
I devoted my entire life to this.

153
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,432
They're practically bad-mouthing me.

154
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:57,396
I'm not sure.

155
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:03,868
Yes, ma'am?

156
00:11:03,952 --> 00:11:05,622
I need to track an employee.

157
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:11,091
Do I need their consent
even if they're dead?

158
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:13,011
-Sorry?
-It's Kim Singu.

159
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:17,688
You never asked for it when he was alive.

160
00:11:17,771 --> 00:11:19,315
He had been going somewhere regularly

161
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,614
at 6:00 p.m. every Wednesday
since the beginning of last year.

162
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:25,954
Please find the address
and send it to Mr. Kim Hoseung.

163
00:11:26,037 --> 00:11:28,751
Mr. Kim is currently
at the police station.

164
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:30,964
I just spoke with him
about his sensor suit.

165
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:32,885
To give it to him right now?

166
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:36,016
Yes. We just received the samples
for the bodyguards too.

167
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:39,147
He said he'd be done soon.
Should we give it to him when he comes?

168
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,821
Do my two bodyguards have similar builds?

169
00:11:42,905 --> 00:11:46,161
Yes. They're getting the same size.
Why do you ask?

170
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:49,208
Then one of them can take both.

171
00:11:52,131 --> 00:11:54,970
What? Why would she give
both of them to one bodyguard?

172
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:57,016
Yeongsil, the location tracker.

173
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:58,101
Yes, sir.

174
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:21,314
I said I couldn't stop you from leaving.

175
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,404
-You did.
-But?

176
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:26,324
I still have work left to do.

177
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:33,673
If you go to room 503,
Mr. Seo will give you an address.

178
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,054
For a location where Kim Singu
met with a cancer support group.

179
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:40,603
And what's there?

180
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:43,108
Hopefully nothing.

181
00:12:44,485 --> 00:12:46,156
Where will you be while I'm gone?

182
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:50,497
I have no plans
to leave this building today.

183
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:54,172
It'll be safer for you to work from home.

184
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,229
I'll get out of your place
as soon as possible.

185
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:05,570
My neighbors will be sad to hear that.

186
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,544
Mr. Seo.

187
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:16,717
-Was it hard to find me?
-Ah. I came to the right place.

188
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:18,470
Our HQ is like a maze.

189
00:13:18,554 --> 00:13:19,723
That's okay.

190
00:13:20,642 --> 00:13:23,773
Right. Pick a suit that fits you.

191
00:13:23,856 --> 00:13:26,194
Am I getting one? For free?

192
00:13:26,277 --> 00:13:27,823
Yes, it's free.

193
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:31,246
Wow. It's a formal suit.

194
00:13:32,414 --> 00:13:35,505
By the way,
thank you for protecting me last time.

195
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:38,051
-I didn't get to thank you.
-That's okay.

196
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:39,930
I was just doing my job.

197
00:13:40,013 --> 00:13:42,184
I'm just glad you were unharmed.

198
00:13:43,771 --> 00:13:46,067
And Chaewoon recovered too.

199
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,698
Right. This is from Ms. Yun.

200
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:49,867
Yes?

201
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:52,288
What?

202
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,883
I came here to get an address.

203
00:13:57,966 --> 00:14:00,429
What? Ms. Yun said that?

204
00:14:00,513 --> 00:14:01,389
Is that it?

205
00:14:05,648 --> 00:14:08,738
Uh, you guys should pick a suit.

206
00:14:17,714 --> 00:14:19,676
They're a bit heavy
since they're prototypes.

207
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,137
Oh, but check this out.

208
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:28,819
They can withstand most blades.

209
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:31,157
They're bulletproof.

210
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,827
Too bad we didn't get them sooner.

211
00:14:32,911 --> 00:14:36,000
Gosh, this is amazing.

212
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,419
Mr. Seo, this is amazing.

213
00:14:39,298 --> 00:14:42,847
It's not perfect yet, but look.

214
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:49,193
That's carbon fiber.

215
00:14:49,987 --> 00:14:53,451
That sizzling sound means
that the binding has been torn.

216
00:14:53,536 --> 00:14:56,750
The fibers absorb the heat instead of you.

217
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:59,338
Ah. If this were a car,

218
00:14:59,923 --> 00:15:02,177
the car would get damaged
but keep the driver safe.

219
00:15:02,261 --> 00:15:03,764
Exactly.

220
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:05,768
PARK SANGMIN

221
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:08,858
I expected some meat as a holiday gift
since BF is a meat company.

222
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:12,197
"Some" meat?
We give out our meat in boxes.

223
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:13,283
Really?

224
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:18,251
That's good. I have a skinny sibling
who could do with some meat.

225
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:28,188
What's that address for?

226
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:29,273
I'm not sure.

227
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:33,866
Damn it. I can't deal
with this condescension anymore.

228
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:39,168
Don't I deserve an explanation?
You snatched that from me.

229
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:41,715
-"Snatched"?
-Do you think I'd tell someone?

230
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:45,305
I'm also a bodyguard, you know.
You're not working alone.

231
00:15:45,388 --> 00:15:47,017
But I can do this alone.

232
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,073
Now that Ms. Yun is staying at your place,

233
00:15:55,952 --> 00:15:57,287
do I look like a small fry to you?

234
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,043
You're being arrogant--

235
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:13,529
What?

236
00:16:14,488 --> 00:16:18,998
What? What are you doing? Wait…

237
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:21,460
What's going on?

238
00:16:25,595 --> 00:16:28,057
That's enough! Why are you two fighting?

239
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:34,779
He was being obnoxious.

240
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:36,407
Fight again, and I'll report you.

241
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,581
Why the hell are you two fighting?
Was getting shot at not enough?

242
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:41,083
-Goddamn it.
-I'm sorry.

243
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,256
You got a text! You got a text!

244
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:00,247
At least wear your suits
so I can see how well they work.

245
00:17:03,504 --> 00:17:05,549
Get away from me. I can't stand you.

246
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:07,302
You can get lost instead.

247
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:08,388
What did you say?

248
00:17:08,471 --> 00:17:10,016
You said I looked older than you.

249
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,062
So can I not talk down to you?

250
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:15,026
Geez. You still remember that?

251
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,114
What a petty bastard.

252
00:17:17,197 --> 00:17:19,243
"Bastard"? "Petty"?

253
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:21,790
I shouldn't have worried
about a petty bastard like you.

254
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:24,587
I shouldn't have cared.

255
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:33,187
I never said I saw you as a small fry.

256
00:17:33,271 --> 00:17:35,400
You came to that conclusion and got upset.

257
00:17:36,193 --> 00:17:37,655
I didn't know you were worried.

258
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:41,747
You were bleeding profusely

259
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,627
and looked pale
when they carried you away.

260
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:46,548
So who wouldn't worry all night?

261
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:48,009
You worried all night long?

262
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:49,846
No. I didn't.

263
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,400
-I'll drive.
-Forget it.

264
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:58,279
You hurt your arm, so let me drive.

265
00:17:58,363 --> 00:18:00,200
Look who's talking.

266
00:18:02,162 --> 00:18:03,832
Are you trying to steal my job?

267
00:18:14,562 --> 00:18:17,025
I heard about the fight,
but you guys seem to be fine.

268
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:18,529
You're so reliable.

269
00:18:21,242 --> 00:18:22,494
Damn it.

270
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:38,234
Why are you both here?
You should move separately.

271
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,825
That's okay. I apologize.

272
00:18:42,994 --> 00:18:43,996
Ma'am.

273
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,377
Ms. Jeong said I could go
to the police station today

274
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:48,964
since you weren't going out.

275
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:50,968
I know you're trying
to change the subject.

276
00:18:52,012 --> 00:18:53,389
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:55,101
We won't fight again.

278
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:56,813
This was unplanned.

279
00:18:57,397 --> 00:18:59,569
Are you being nosy again?

280
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:02,073
Go to that address.

281
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:04,161
If you tell us what this is about,

282
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:08,211
then we can deploy bodyguards in advance.

283
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,010
I doubt I'll need any.

284
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:14,933
The prime minister
will have enough of them.

285
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:16,018
The prime minister?

286
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:18,147
Starting route guidance.

287
00:19:36,768 --> 00:19:40,483
BLOOD FREE

288
00:20:12,882 --> 00:20:14,301
I'm going to the hospital.

289
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:16,598
-The hospital?
-I won't be late.

290
00:20:22,568 --> 00:20:24,029
He must still be in pain.

291
00:20:40,604 --> 00:20:41,898
Goodness.

292
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,238
Thank you for coming.

293
00:20:53,421 --> 00:20:55,466
You're okay. Like they said.

294
00:20:57,262 --> 00:20:58,264
Yes.

295
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:04,067
I didn't know about this place.

296
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:08,660
I come here every now and then
when I want to be alone.

297
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:23,189
I know you're busy,
but you still need to eat.

298
00:21:23,272 --> 00:21:24,483
And so do I.

299
00:21:25,611 --> 00:21:29,827
So I invited you over for a meal.

300
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:33,668
It isn't much, but I hope you like it.

301
00:21:34,504 --> 00:21:35,672
All right.

302
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:37,885
Dig in.

303
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:47,195
Not that great, right?

304
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:49,534
It melts in your mouth.

305
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:51,955
Even more so since it's our meat.

306
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,255
I told them to use your meat.

307
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,804
Everything on this table is takeout.

308
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:05,691
I'll make sure your table is filled
with our products in the future.

309
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,032
I'm relieved.

310
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:18,090
After hearing about the shoot-out,

311
00:22:18,174 --> 00:22:21,388
I wanted to check on you right away.
But I didn't want to impose.

312
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:24,436
I knew a strong woman like you
would pull through.

313
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,402
But then I thought,
"That's easier said than done.

314
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:32,828
Seeing someone wielding a knife
on the street is terrifying enough.

315
00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:36,586
But all those men were shooting at her.

316
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:39,090
So how could she be okay?"

317
00:22:39,174 --> 00:22:43,182
However, you just nonchalantly promoted
your own products.

318
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:44,810
You're definitely

319
00:22:46,021 --> 00:22:47,065
a strong one.

320
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:51,365
I didn't know this was your hobby.

321
00:22:52,408 --> 00:22:53,912
Me neither.

322
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:56,208
I don't know if it is.

323
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,254
I've never gone camping, you see.

324
00:22:59,464 --> 00:23:03,640
If you do go,
I'll send you 100 servings of meat.

325
00:23:05,894 --> 00:23:08,190
You only think about your products.

326
00:23:11,906 --> 00:23:15,079
Are your products
the only things on your mind?

327
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,002
Yes.

328
00:23:42,008 --> 00:23:43,469
Sir, you're not allowed inside.

329
00:23:44,137 --> 00:23:45,974
That's okay. Give us a minute.

330
00:23:51,193 --> 00:23:52,654
Could you excuse us?

331
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:59,334
I told you to come to my house later.
Why did you come here?

332
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,678
Do you know a man named Kim Singu?

333
00:24:06,974 --> 00:24:08,018
I do.

334
00:24:08,645 --> 00:24:11,274
His death caused a commotion.
What about him?

335
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,742
And the ransomware?

336
00:24:17,411 --> 00:24:20,251
You think I wouldn't know that
because I'm old?

337
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:24,217
I know better than anyone else
about what's going on these days.

338
00:24:27,014 --> 00:24:31,148
How was I chosen to work at BF?

339
00:24:34,738 --> 00:24:35,907
Here.

340
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:37,243
I should get going.

341
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:43,840
How should we catch
those scumbags?

342
00:24:45,802 --> 00:24:47,221
Bosque Archi, I mean.

343
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,566
How dare a mere gang like them attack you?

344
00:24:56,616 --> 00:24:58,995
I don't know how powerful they are,

345
00:24:59,997 --> 00:25:01,499
but they were quite impactful.

346
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,297
Their method was quite bold.

347
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:05,842
Not that.

348
00:25:07,554 --> 00:25:08,681
The timing.

349
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:10,560
Not that.

350
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:14,818
I know I passed their test.
I'm asking about the process.

351
00:25:14,902 --> 00:25:18,785
How did BF know to contact me
out of everyone?

352
00:25:20,204 --> 00:25:21,624
Because you're competent.

353
00:25:23,252 --> 00:25:27,051
Sir, were you involved in any way?

354
00:25:28,262 --> 00:25:31,644
Or what about your son-in-law?

355
00:25:31,727 --> 00:25:35,484
He's no longer my son-in-law.
He and my daughter are divorced.

356
00:25:37,948 --> 00:25:39,033
That means…

357
00:25:40,411 --> 00:25:41,831
it was the prime minister.

358
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:47,091
Was he at your house
when I visited for the first time?

359
00:25:48,427 --> 00:25:50,807
I called you over. It was my decision.

360
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:53,353
Sir.

361
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,571
I'm serving you, not the prime minister.

362
00:25:58,488 --> 00:26:00,785
Please don't let him know that I was here.

363
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:03,081
What are you talking about?

364
00:26:03,165 --> 00:26:05,210
I sent you there to get Yun Jayu.

365
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:12,183
BF hired me because their laboratory
was hacked right before I joined.

366
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:14,145
And Kim Singu died as a result.

367
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:22,036
Are you claiming that we killed a man
just to send you there?

368
00:26:22,913 --> 00:26:25,125
That's nonsense.

369
00:26:27,213 --> 00:26:28,215
No, sir.

370
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:31,471
I'm just a small piece of the puzzle.

371
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,561
You said the timing was impactful.

372
00:26:35,145 --> 00:26:37,066
That means you suffered a great loss.

373
00:26:38,778 --> 00:26:41,324
You said you were okay, but you weren't.

374
00:26:41,408 --> 00:26:42,619
Did you get hurt?

375
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,917
No, not me.

376
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,211
Then who?

377
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:50,134
Was someone else injured?

378
00:26:54,016 --> 00:26:57,983
A mere gang, like you said,
on the opposite side of the world,

379
00:26:59,528 --> 00:27:02,659
just happened to commit a crime
at the perfect time.

380
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:06,751
As if they were up to date
with the current affairs here.

381
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:11,217
What current affairs?

382
00:27:11,802 --> 00:27:16,352
People had been suspecting me
of poisoning Kim Singu

383
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:18,816
and would easily be led to think
I concocted the shoot-out.

384
00:27:21,237 --> 00:27:23,492
That's just an absurd rumor.

385
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:30,840
Are you saying there's a spy?

386
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:35,307
Someone who told the gang
that this was the perfect time?

387
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:37,771
It's possible.

388
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:41,486
I wonder who it is.

389
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,795
The ex-convicts.

390
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:52,216
Those men with guns probably told them.

391
00:27:53,636 --> 00:27:55,097
I see.

392
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,436
You're right.

393
00:28:00,023 --> 00:28:04,156
I thought you meant
that there were still criminals at large.

394
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:08,583
They say misfortunes come
one after another.

395
00:28:11,004 --> 00:28:14,553
I'm afraid I took too much of your time.

396
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:16,097
Thank you for the invite.

397
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:20,940
-Have a safe trip back.
-Thanks. See you later.

398
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,843
Isn't he coming?

399
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:40,855
Why are you alone?

400
00:28:40,938 --> 00:28:43,360
Sorry? After you.

401
00:29:15,132 --> 00:29:16,342
Hello?

402
00:29:16,426 --> 00:29:17,344
Where are you?

403
00:29:19,473 --> 00:29:20,893
You know where I am, don't you?

404
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:25,485
It can't be a coincidence
that you called right after my guest left.

405
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,780
Your guest?

406
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:28,826
How disgusting. Don't say that.

407
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,832
What's so disgusting about meeting a CEO?

408
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:36,592
Father.

409
00:29:37,426 --> 00:29:39,430
I asked you not to pry
into my personal affairs.

410
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:42,311
Would you have met with her alone
if she were a man?

411
00:29:42,394 --> 00:29:44,858
When it comes to politicians,
where there's smoke, there's fire.

412
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:46,779
You don't even let me go there.

413
00:29:46,862 --> 00:29:48,031
But you let her in.

414
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:50,118
What are you going on about?

415
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:52,164
She lives with her bodyguard.

416
00:29:52,247 --> 00:29:53,124
I'm hanging up.

417
00:29:56,507 --> 00:29:58,051
He's becoming more reckless.

418
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,361
It's not healing well.

419
00:30:09,114 --> 00:30:11,202
I believe the prime minister
summoned her.

420
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:14,543
Could he seriously be interested in her?

421
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:33,622
Who was it?
Which one of you told the chairman?

422
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:41,429
I remember how you shed tears
over the death of a single soldier.

423
00:30:41,513 --> 00:30:42,347
However,

424
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:45,563
there is someone else
who doesn't value human life.

425
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:47,901
Was their goal

426
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:50,656
just to terrorize?

427
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,159
Or could it be BF's downfall?

428
00:30:54,664 --> 00:30:56,125
What an impudent bastard.

429
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,906
It's nothing.

430
00:32:15,743 --> 00:32:17,079
What I fear

431
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:20,210
is fear itself.

432
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:50,103
Are you okay?

433
00:32:55,238 --> 00:32:56,073
Ms. Yun.

434
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:59,873
Ms. Yun.

435
00:32:59,956 --> 00:33:03,505
I thought you were asleep.
I'm sorry for alarming you.

436
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:07,429
I wasn't alarmed.

437
00:33:15,236 --> 00:33:16,238
There's this one man

438
00:33:17,157 --> 00:33:19,954
who still hears the footsteps of soldiers
from 30 years ago.

439
00:33:21,123 --> 00:33:25,465
The footsteps of those searching the house
while he was hiding under the floor.

440
00:33:27,469 --> 00:33:28,471
Who was he?

441
00:33:28,555 --> 00:33:31,853
An officer who was chased
by the Nazis during WWII.

442
00:33:33,397 --> 00:33:36,070
The war had ended 30 years prior,

443
00:33:36,655 --> 00:33:38,575
but he'd hear the footsteps
out of nowhere.

444
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,332
He was a soldier

445
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:46,006
who trained his entire life.

446
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:51,100
Did he overcome his trauma? Or…

447
00:33:54,816 --> 00:33:56,861
Did he live with it forever?

448
00:33:57,613 --> 00:33:59,909
Despite having trained all his life.

449
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,293
He never commented on that.

450
00:34:06,923 --> 00:34:08,009
He couldn't overcome it.

451
00:34:10,263 --> 00:34:11,348
That's understandable.

452
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:13,895
Perhaps not.

453
00:34:14,564 --> 00:34:17,235
Not everyone overcomes trauma
in the best way possible

454
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,657
like you did.

455
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:25,168
What did I do?

456
00:34:26,504 --> 00:34:28,341
You took the bull by the horns

457
00:34:30,094 --> 00:34:31,556
after the trauma.

458
00:34:41,534 --> 00:34:43,496
I heard the story

459
00:34:44,164 --> 00:34:45,416
of how BF was born.

460
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,351
What? Already?

461
00:34:54,977 --> 00:34:57,357
I guess we really did it.

462
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,027
I need to talk to you.

463
00:34:59,111 --> 00:35:00,113
Did San tell you?

464
00:35:00,196 --> 00:35:01,198
Yes.

465
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:07,043
We should've just watched the news
instead of going there.

466
00:35:08,087 --> 00:35:10,592
We witnessed hell.

467
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:12,763
Everyone who went there witnessed it.

468
00:35:12,847 --> 00:35:14,851
Hit them so they won't climb up!

469
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:17,773
Hey, there! And here!

470
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:19,569
Are you okay?

471
00:35:19,652 --> 00:35:21,155
Hit them with your shovels!

472
00:35:22,365 --> 00:35:23,869
Hit the head!

473
00:35:23,952 --> 00:35:27,208
Keep hitting them! There!

474
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,465
The civil servant who kept ordering
to hit the pigs seemed like the devil.

475
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:35,349
Then I heard he committed suicide.

476
00:35:39,525 --> 00:35:42,656
After that incident, the smell
of pork belly would make us nauseous.

477
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,827
We resented Professor Kim.

478
00:35:45,662 --> 00:35:48,585
He could've done
the epidemiological survey by himself.

479
00:35:48,668 --> 00:35:51,716
We couldn't understand why he had
to bring his innocent students along.

480
00:35:53,637 --> 00:35:54,680
But Jayu left--

481
00:35:56,141 --> 00:35:58,312
Ms. Yun left the university.

482
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,403
Then she returned after two semesters.

483
00:36:03,405 --> 00:36:05,702
"Don't you want to become
a perfect dominant species?"

484
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,004
That's the first thing
you say after returning?

485
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:14,929
Don't you want to become
a perfect dominant species?

486
00:36:16,306 --> 00:36:19,354
Humans are already apex predators
whether we like it or not.

487
00:36:19,437 --> 00:36:22,402
The apex of the pyramid
that dominates the ecosystem.

488
00:36:23,195 --> 00:36:24,532
Humans need to eat to live.

489
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:27,078
We must eat living things to survive.

490
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:28,707
How can you say we're perfect

491
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,295
when our lives directly depend
on other animals and plants?

492
00:36:31,963 --> 00:36:34,259
She never pitied the animals

493
00:36:34,342 --> 00:36:37,725
or questioned our right to kill them.

494
00:36:37,808 --> 00:36:40,021
Humanity is an imperfect dominant species.

495
00:36:41,649 --> 00:36:44,739
We must cut the chain
if we want to be perfect.

496
00:36:45,364 --> 00:36:47,703
We need to break free from the food chain.

497
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:53,213
We'll end it here.

498
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:55,134
In our time.

499
00:36:56,136 --> 00:36:58,683
That was the start of BF.

500
00:37:01,313 --> 00:37:03,944
People have two misconceptions
about our company.

501
00:37:05,112 --> 00:37:06,616
One, that we're doing it for money.

502
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,458
If that was her goal,
she would've sold the company

503
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:13,253
and lived a comfortable life.

504
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:16,218
So you shouldn't have accused her

505
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:20,393
of trying to make more money
when she had just saved your life.

506
00:37:22,438 --> 00:37:23,566
Another misconception.

507
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:28,075
They think cultured meat is just a way

508
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:32,500
to not slaughter animals
and to protect the environment.

509
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:37,260
Look. It's only natural for humans
to eat meat and plants, right?

510
00:37:37,343 --> 00:37:38,722
But she changed that.

511
00:37:41,978 --> 00:37:43,690
Yun Jayu's accomplishments

512
00:37:44,315 --> 00:37:46,821
are just as commendable
as finding a way for humans

513
00:37:46,904 --> 00:37:48,198
to live without oxygen.

514
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:54,628
And yet, there are people out there
who want her gone.

515
00:37:56,966 --> 00:37:58,553
And here at the company,

516
00:37:58,636 --> 00:38:01,475
I was the one
who misunderstood and criticized her.

517
00:38:02,895 --> 00:38:04,230
While Mr. On

518
00:38:04,314 --> 00:38:09,032
was only debating on whether or not
to become a vegetarian,

519
00:38:09,617 --> 00:38:11,077
he said

520
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:14,000
you changed the ways of nature
that had started since humanity began

521
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:16,254
millions of years ago.

522
00:38:19,637 --> 00:38:21,139
How wonderful would it be…

523
00:38:24,563 --> 00:38:26,066
if that were how it all began?

524
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:31,409
If that were it…

525
00:38:35,752 --> 00:38:38,550
She had lost most of her brain functions

526
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:41,471
within one month of returning
from her studies abroad.

527
00:38:44,895 --> 00:38:48,778
CJD. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

528
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:49,905
Mad cow disease for humans.

529
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:52,870
They call this
the mad cow disease for humans.

530
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:57,796
My once bright younger sister

531
00:38:58,756 --> 00:39:01,219
became an old woman with dementia.

532
00:39:03,766 --> 00:39:05,937
My identical twin

533
00:39:06,814 --> 00:39:10,404
showed all the signs of CJD
and was dying slowly.

534
00:39:13,995 --> 00:39:15,540
The government, however,

535
00:39:15,624 --> 00:39:18,671
refused to acknowledge
that it was due to the mad cow disease.

536
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,719
Some even said this.

537
00:39:23,388 --> 00:39:27,313
"How much beef did she have
during her time abroad?"

538
00:39:35,454 --> 00:39:37,960
Why couldn't I do anything back then?

539
00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:44,013
Why didn't I express my rage or scream?

540
00:39:45,934 --> 00:39:47,729
How was I

541
00:39:49,357 --> 00:39:50,568
so apathetic?

542
00:39:59,545 --> 00:40:00,421
I'm sorry.

543
00:40:01,507 --> 00:40:03,218
I should've preserved you.

544
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:07,978
I shouldn't have cremated you.

545
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,986
I should've replaced your organs

546
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:15,200
and filled up your brain.
I should've revived you.

547
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:21,630
Had I buried you,

548
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:25,638
I would've dug you out
and gave you new flesh.

549
00:40:26,515 --> 00:40:28,143
I would've given you life.

550
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,865
I miss you.

551
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:39,750
I want to chat

552
00:40:41,419 --> 00:40:42,756
and laugh with you again.

553
00:41:15,279 --> 00:41:16,740
Can Mr. Kim come with me tomorrow

554
00:41:18,536 --> 00:41:20,915
to the address Mr. Seo gave me?

555
00:41:22,501 --> 00:41:23,336
Sure.

556
00:41:31,562 --> 00:41:32,772
How are you feeling?

557
00:41:34,943 --> 00:41:36,029
The same.

558
00:41:40,538 --> 00:41:42,291
Do you need a new dominant species?

559
00:41:44,212 --> 00:41:47,677
If your first goal was for humans
to break free from the food chain,

560
00:41:47,761 --> 00:41:48,888
then is your second goal

561
00:41:48,971 --> 00:41:51,769
for humans to become immortal?

562
00:41:52,478 --> 00:41:54,190
Is that why you culture human organs?

563
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:56,904
And make skin that doesn't age?

564
00:41:57,488 --> 00:42:00,160
If that's what you call
a new dominant species,

565
00:42:00,244 --> 00:42:04,418
it means immortal humans
will dominate something else.

566
00:42:04,502 --> 00:42:07,299
They'll probably dominate those
who are old and sick.

567
00:42:07,383 --> 00:42:09,638
Those who are too poor to replace

568
00:42:10,222 --> 00:42:12,059
their failing organs.

569
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,529
Do you know how much
cultured meat cost in the beginning?

570
00:42:19,448 --> 00:42:22,037
Meat the size of my palm
cost 300 million won.

571
00:42:22,121 --> 00:42:24,543
But look how cheap it is now.

572
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:28,258
The same goes for human organs.

573
00:42:29,343 --> 00:42:30,888
We shouldn't restrict it.

574
00:42:30,972 --> 00:42:34,103
The prices will drop
due to mass production and price wars.

575
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,775
That just means…

576
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,583
We can't be perfect
simply by not slaughtering animals.

577
00:42:45,877 --> 00:42:48,799
We must be immortal to reach perfection.

578
00:42:49,383 --> 00:42:51,262
Humans can't live forever.

579
00:42:51,346 --> 00:42:53,475
That would be an error, not perfection.

580
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,565
But what if there's a way

581
00:42:57,149 --> 00:42:59,403
to feel no pain until the day we die?

582
00:43:00,364 --> 00:43:02,911
Why do you think I strived
to perfect this top-notch technology

583
00:43:02,994 --> 00:43:04,413
and save up money all this time?

584
00:43:07,378 --> 00:43:09,549
Top-notch technology has always been used

585
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:12,429
to create weapons.

586
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:16,647
I was amazed when I first received

587
00:43:17,231 --> 00:43:18,693
the weapons.

588
00:43:20,153 --> 00:43:21,615
Then I realized later on

589
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,579
that they were created to take lives.

590
00:43:25,372 --> 00:43:29,255
People invested money and technology
just to kill others.

591
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,766
If there's technology for killing,
there should be one for saving lives too.

592
00:43:37,104 --> 00:43:38,314
Right.

593
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,820
I probably think this way

594
00:43:41,947 --> 00:43:44,201
because I don't know much about science.

595
00:43:44,828 --> 00:43:47,499
What I witnessed in the basement
made me uneasy.

596
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:50,548
It was probably because

597
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:52,844
I've always believed
that humans fed on wars

598
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:55,725
as well as meat.

599
00:44:01,152 --> 00:44:02,947
I just came here to change clothes.

600
00:44:15,848 --> 00:44:16,975
Thank you

601
00:44:18,311 --> 00:44:19,313
for saving my life.

602
00:44:25,618 --> 00:44:26,662
Thank you…

603
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,586
for keeping me safe.

604
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:55,385
He's Gilgamesh.

605
00:44:55,468 --> 00:44:57,599
Can you say, "Gilgamesh"?

606
00:44:57,682 --> 00:44:58,851
Gilgamesh.

607
00:44:58,934 --> 00:45:01,982
Gilgamesh was big and strong.

608
00:45:06,157 --> 00:45:09,204
-What were you talking about?
-I told them the story of Gilgamesh.

609
00:45:09,288 --> 00:45:10,583
"Gilgamesh"?

610
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,087
He was a hero in mythology.

611
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:17,095
After enduring countless hardships,
he was able to obtain a rejuvenating herb

612
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:18,682
that made him immortal.

613
00:45:19,266 --> 00:45:21,103
But a snake ate it instead.

614
00:45:21,187 --> 00:45:23,734
The kids went crazy when they heard this.

615
00:45:23,817 --> 00:45:26,238
They said
he should've eaten it right away.

616
00:45:28,911 --> 00:45:30,790
He should've eaten the snake then.

617
00:45:30,873 --> 00:45:32,835
-What?
-Soup.

618
00:45:34,923 --> 00:45:37,135
Would that have worked?

619
00:45:38,806 --> 00:45:42,437
So what happened to him?

620
00:45:44,693 --> 00:45:46,028
I wonder.

621
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,589
It's not like Kim Singu would've said,

622
00:45:55,673 --> 00:45:59,723
"I hate BF!
I'm going to take revenge on Ms. Yun,"

623
00:45:59,806 --> 00:46:01,267
at the support group meetings.

624
00:46:02,895 --> 00:46:05,108
I doubt we'll find anything here.

625
00:46:05,693 --> 00:46:08,782
Who knows? Everyone who had worked
with him for a long time said that

626
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:10,786
he had changed all of a sudden.

627
00:46:12,832 --> 00:46:13,917
You're right.

628
00:46:14,794 --> 00:46:17,675
Seeing how he tried to drown
his colleague proves just that.

629
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,854
Did the group members
treat him like an outsider?

630
00:46:25,733 --> 00:46:28,029
Could that be why that old man acted out?

631
00:46:28,112 --> 00:46:29,657
Or maybe someone influenced him.

632
00:46:30,826 --> 00:46:32,872
I hope it's neither.

633
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,628
I hope it was indeed a heart attack.

634
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:39,468
-Geez, this is heavy.
-What is?

635
00:46:40,053 --> 00:46:44,144
This suit. Are sensor suits
normally this heavy?

636
00:46:48,194 --> 00:46:49,989
WELFARE CENTER

637
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:09,696
Hello.

638
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,869
Are you Mr. Kim Singu?

639
00:47:12,952 --> 00:47:15,081
He started coming here
after my mother passed away.

640
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,004
He said this place
offered him great comfort.

641
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:24,182
He was going to visit me soon.

642
00:47:26,312 --> 00:47:27,648
Did he talk about me?

643
00:47:28,232 --> 00:47:31,238
Of course. He told us on many occasions
about his son

644
00:47:31,322 --> 00:47:33,492
who lived in the US.

645
00:47:34,161 --> 00:47:36,457
I can't believe he took his own life.

646
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:43,221
-I'm sorry.
-I was shocked when I saw the news.

647
00:47:44,264 --> 00:47:46,603
I didn't know him for that long,

648
00:47:46,686 --> 00:47:49,107
but I knew he was a good man.

649
00:47:56,246 --> 00:47:59,253
Did he say anything that stood out?

650
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:01,925
Did he seem agitated during your meetings?

651
00:48:02,969 --> 00:48:04,764
He's my maternal uncle.

652
00:48:04,847 --> 00:48:05,975
I see. Hello.

653
00:48:09,732 --> 00:48:10,818
This kid

654
00:48:12,404 --> 00:48:16,663
just can't understand
why his father made such a decision.

655
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,587
There was nothing in particular.

656
00:48:21,422 --> 00:48:23,969
In fact, he was on the quiet side.

657
00:48:25,346 --> 00:48:26,390
What about his friend?

658
00:48:26,473 --> 00:48:28,937
He told me that he had befriended someone.

659
00:48:29,522 --> 00:48:30,858
-A friend?
-Yes.

660
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:36,243
There was one man he often spoke to.

661
00:48:37,287 --> 00:48:40,334
I'd like to ask him about my father.

662
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,590
Could I get his number?

663
00:48:42,673 --> 00:48:43,842
Gosh.

664
00:48:43,925 --> 00:48:47,641
We're not allowed to give out
other people's phone numbers.

665
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:51,398
I'll tell him my father gave it to me,
not you.

666
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:53,612
I'm sorry.

667
00:48:53,695 --> 00:48:55,616
-But ma'am--
-Hey, you!

668
00:48:57,035 --> 00:48:59,916
You should've visited your father
more often when he was alive.

669
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,341
What about you then? What did you do?

670
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,932
I'm your maternal uncle.

671
00:49:11,271 --> 00:49:14,194
Maternal uncle…

672
00:49:14,277 --> 00:49:15,363
Maternal uncle.

673
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:18,995
Who says uncles can't visit
their sisters' husbands? Huh?

674
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,916
He was your brother-in-law!

675
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,168
Aren't I right?

676
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:24,924
-Hold on.
-They visit too, right?

677
00:49:24,966 --> 00:49:27,262
-Hold on.
-Are you serious?

678
00:49:27,345 --> 00:49:29,433
Look. You don't need to fight.

679
00:49:32,397 --> 00:49:33,441
Ma'am.

680
00:49:33,525 --> 00:49:36,155
Ma'am, I beg you.

681
00:49:36,238 --> 00:49:37,240
Please tell me.

682
00:49:39,286 --> 00:49:41,165
Why isn't he picking up?

683
00:49:42,668 --> 00:49:46,466
We're not supposed to give out addresses.

684
00:49:47,469 --> 00:49:48,555
What was his name again?

685
00:49:51,101 --> 00:49:52,187
HAEJEONG BUILDING, UNIT 101
PARK SANGMIN

686
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:53,355
"Park Sangmin"?

687
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,250
Excuse me.

688
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,923
Does Mr. Park Sangmin work here?

689
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:07,217
"Park Sangmin"?

690
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,135
No.

691
00:50:09,221 --> 00:50:11,559
Is this Haejeong Building, unit 101?

692
00:50:11,643 --> 00:50:14,649
Yes, this is Haejeong Building, unit 101.

693
00:50:14,732 --> 00:50:15,734
Thank you.

694
00:50:18,072 --> 00:50:20,117
Didn't she say this was his home address?

695
00:50:22,831 --> 00:50:25,837
Even if this were his work address,
there's no one here

696
00:50:25,921 --> 00:50:27,131
by that name.

697
00:50:28,133 --> 00:50:30,304
Something smelled fishy
when he didn't pick up.

698
00:50:32,851 --> 00:50:35,649
By the way,
you always wear only one earphone.

699
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:38,947
-Is it just for fashion?
-Is that what you think?

700
00:50:50,177 --> 00:50:51,221
What is it?

701
00:50:52,558 --> 00:50:53,685
Get in for now.

702
00:50:57,776 --> 00:51:01,450
OSARANG CHURCH

703
00:51:01,534 --> 00:51:05,124
I saw that same black car
in front of my house

704
00:51:05,207 --> 00:51:06,544
the day Ms. Yun first came.

705
00:52:45,115 --> 00:52:46,368
What is he doing?

706
00:52:51,712 --> 00:52:54,008
Pull over.
Plate number 213N 6064.

707
00:52:54,092 --> 00:52:55,135
Pull over.

708
00:52:55,971 --> 00:52:59,394
Plate number 213N 6064. Pull over now.

709
00:52:59,477 --> 00:53:00,522
Pull over.

710
00:53:02,066 --> 00:53:04,404
-6064. Pull over.
-Keep chasing him.

711
00:53:04,487 --> 00:53:08,705
We have two vehicles on the run
between Euljeongro 3-ga and 4-ga.

712
00:53:08,788 --> 00:53:11,042
Plate number 213N 6064

713
00:53:11,126 --> 00:53:13,548
and 301B 1269.

714
00:53:13,631 --> 00:53:15,301
We need backup.

715
00:54:19,303 --> 00:54:21,141
What a mean mug.

716
00:54:21,726 --> 00:54:23,938
Did Kim Singu give you that scar?

717
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:44,432
Even a conglomerate's bodyguard like you

718
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:46,687
can't beat a stray like me.

719
00:56:02,928 --> 00:56:04,013
Kim Hoseung!

720
00:56:08,104 --> 00:56:11,361
Hoseung. Stay awake. Breathe.

721
00:56:13,866 --> 00:56:16,538
-A scar…
-Don't talk. It's okay.

722
00:56:17,206 --> 00:56:18,500
Jang Yeongsil, call 911!

723
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:19,586
Yes, sir.

724
00:56:20,672 --> 00:56:22,884
Hoseung, wake up.

725
00:56:23,594 --> 00:56:26,182
You're okay. Breathe. Hoseung!

726
00:56:33,488 --> 00:56:34,490
Over here!

727
00:56:34,574 --> 00:56:36,411
Stop right there!

728
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:38,582
Right there! Hey!
