EPISODE 2

3
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:46,856
Mr. Woo Chaewoon?

4
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,233
That's me.

5
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:49,984
This way, please.

6
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,519
RESTRICTED AREA

7
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,317
VR ROOM

8
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,613
Your suit and gloves.

9
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,574
Wear these goggles too.

10
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,800
All right. Let's begin.

11
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,200
Why did he stop? He can keep attacking
instead of waiting for it to load.

12
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,078
Is he waiting
for the other guy on purpose?

13
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,963
Oh.

14
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,339
Thank goodness.

15
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,508
I thought the program froze
because it's old.

16
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,885
You're lucky
to at least have the old version.

17
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,762
Our team can't get any work done.

18
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,846
All our files are locked.

19
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,599
Nothing is showing up.

20
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,810
I need to see
their oxygen saturation levels.

21
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:32,647
But isn't it obvious
that they're low on oxygen?

22
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,533
Only shoot the red targets.

23
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,004
Look behind you.

24
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,938
BLOOD FREE

25
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,195
No need to get up.

26
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,835
On San, research director
and Research Team Two leader.

27
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,087
He founded BF alongside Yun Jayu.

28
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,882
But when BF struggled in the beginning,
he went into the medical field

29
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,093
and was a medical examiner
for three years.

30
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,762
What did you do
at the Naval Intelligence Command?

31
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,057
I was on the Vessel and Aircraft
Info-communications Support Team.

32
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,269
Then you moved to the Recon Team.

33
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,187
He avoids media appearances at all costs

34
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,899
and has never attended a BF event
despite being the research director.

35
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,735
You received prolonged RIMPAC training
in the US.

36
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,279
It's like the Navy SEALs, right?

37
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,989
I didn't receive training.

38
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,367
I participated in RIMPAC.

39
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,244
You left the military last year.

40
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,707
With your background, you could've had
a stable career as a lifelong officer.

41
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,877
And you could've had a stable career
as a medical examiner.

42
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,884
If you checked my background,
you must've checked Ms. Yun's too.

43
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,678
Would I be escorting her?

44
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,555
Why did you leave the Sanghwa Group?

45
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,516
I'm sure escorting the chairman paid well.

46
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,019
Fortunately, Chairman Park
doesn't need my protection.

47
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,605
No one is after him.

48
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,356
Ms. Yun is the one

49
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,358
who needs close protection.

50
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,531
In 2023, she was targeted during her visit

51
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,909
to the production facility
in North America.

52
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,453
The suspect, likely a hit man,
was shot dead on the spot.

53
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,873
In 2024, an extremist targeted her
during a Greenpeace meeting.

54
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,335
These are just some
of the well-known incidents.

55
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,259
Thank you for today.

56
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,179
-Are we done?
-You may go home.

57
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,140
-I have a question.
-What is it?

58
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,476
How much is the salary?

59
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,396
Sorry?

60
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,981
Am I not allowed to ask?

61
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,237
How much did Sanghwa pay you?

62
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,322
Isn't that written on that paper?

63
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,199
Does that mean I shouldn't ask?

64
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,076
We don't ask about
our employees' former wages though.

65
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,285
Yet you just did.

66
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,500
Your working hours will be irregular.

67
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,126
That won't be an issue.

68
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,878
You'll get paid at least the same amount.

69
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,922
We can talk further if you pass.

70
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,549
Understood.

71
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,884
Thank you.

72
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,070
CONTROL ROOM

73
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,738
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

74
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,339
No one on my team accessed
the external network during working hours.

75
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,423
Same with my team.

76
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,301
We only used the internal network
per the security rules.

77
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,385
My team too.

78
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,720
And the ransomware?

79
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,264
I'm afraid that both
the Security Team and I

80
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,432
have yet to fix the issue.

81
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,434
We're still working on it.

82
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,519
Should we stay shut down for a bit longer?

83
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,565
Rumors will spread once the employees
turn on their computers on Monday.

84
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,942
Thank you, everyone.

85
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,070
-Bye.
-Wait, Ms. Yun.

86
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,781
The bodyguard candidate just left.

87
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,782
Okay.

88
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,202
He's very competent but blunt.

89
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,580
He'll be a man of few words but stubborn

90
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,749
and loyal but not obedient.

91
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,459
Did you interview yourself?

92
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,087
What's important
is that his background checks out.

93
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,090
I'm sure Sanghwa did
a thorough background check

94
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,549
for their chairman.

95
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,761
What's most crucial for you
is whether or not

96
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,304
he's trustworthy.

97
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:21,806
That's what I'm saying.

98
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,224
I'll keep that in mind.

99
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,521
I have bad news

100
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,273
and slightly less bad news.

101
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,901
How much worse can things get?

102
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,153
You should visit Prime Minister Seonu Jae.

103
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,030
He wants to see you
regarding the culture fluid rumors.

104
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,616
Are you free this afternoon?

105
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,244
He says that's the only time he's free.

106
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,247
Should I let him down easy?

107
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,124
"I'm truly sorry,

108
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,001
but Ms. Yun isn't available today."

109
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,504
I can say that.

110
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,424
Tell him I'm free and that I'll go to him.

111
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,718
And the less bad news?

112
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,929
I'm sorry, but that was it.

113
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,224
And this is the bad news.

114
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:18,362
Don't get in our way.
We'll kill anyone who does.

115
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,740
BF will pay for threatening our business.

116
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,909
Whoever brings us Yun Jayu's head
will get three million USD.

117
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,953
We're warning you, Yun Jayu.

118
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,081
Ignore us, and this is what you'll get.

119
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,466
They're a South American gang
called Bosque Archi.

120
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,761
They put a price on your head.

121
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,722
They're originally a drug cartel.

122
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,974
But they also set jungles on fire,
exploit the locals,

123
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,435
and operate a huge tropical farm.

124
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,063
It's about the food you said
you'd culture in the next six months.

125
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,316
So South America is a no-go.

126
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,526
This is no time for jokes.

127
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,028
These bastards…

128
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,739
I'd get it if they were Korean farmers.

129
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,658
But why are these scumbags throwing a fit?

130
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,744
Because I threatened a primary industry.

131
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,332
I was always prepared for this.

132
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,588
If you're okay, I'm glad.

133
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,382
I'm not.

134
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,511
Seeing it now, I'm scared.

135
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,638
I'm terrified.

136
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,392
Ms. Yun.

137
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,980
One of the bodyguard candidates
we interviewed today used to be a cyclist.

138
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,274
His thighs were…

139
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,027
You won't believe it,
but they were this thick.

140
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,446
He even subdued a mugger on the street.

141
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,283
-That's nice.
-The man Mr. On just mentioned

142
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,869
is also super strong.

143
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,456
I'm not sure about him.

144
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,541
Do you not like him?

145
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,501
Then should we disqualify him?

146
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,381
How far has he gotten?

147
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,149
Mansik.

148
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,447
Mansik?

149
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,043
Your hands.

150
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,384
Is the test not over yet?

151
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,012
Is it an actual fight this time?

152
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,223
What kind of name is "Mansik"?
So tacky. Don't you think?

153
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,359
Let him go.

154
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:45,945
The same goes for you.

155
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,830
You must get paid generously for a soldier

156
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,957
to send her to a foreign school.

157
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,251
Who sent you?

158
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,211
Yun Jayu of BF.

159
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,754
Bring her to us.

160
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,922
That's all we want.

161
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,341
We're not going to harm her,

162
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,593
so you don't have to feel guilty about it.

163
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,346
We just have a few questions for her.

164
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,866
Look for her yourself.

165
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,827
Your kid goes to an expensive school.

166
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,752
If you're not up for it,

167
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,337
just let us know

168
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,215
when and whereâ€¦

169
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,010
Yun Jayu will be alone.

170
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:38,974
Money.

171
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,059
Your family's safety.

172
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,352
Shouldn't you have both?

173
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:06,001
Wait. Calm down.

174
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,214
Open the door. She'll explain everything.

175
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,799
That's all I know.

176
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,276
Mr. Woo, I'd like you to come with me.

177
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:34,947
I was rooting for you.

178
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,326
I thought you were the perfect candidate.

179
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,329
Does that mean I'm not?

180
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,666
I'm not sure. I don't have the final say.

181
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,459
But you should be alert.

182
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,462
Ms. Yun has gained another enemy.

183
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:52,756
Who is it?

184
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,092
They're stupid druggies.

185
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,474
Illegal research!

186
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,311
Condemn the murderer Yun Jayu!

187
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,526
Cultured meat should be thrown away!

188
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,921
Good luck.

189
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,607
We know each other's names,
but we haven't said hello yet.

190
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,484
My family is not cultured meat.

191
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,987
Please don't experiment with them.

192
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,405
I was verifying, not experimenting.

193
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,163
Please step away from the window.

194
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,706
May I close these?

195
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,380
You need the verification
because you don't know whom to trust.

196
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,092
Because your bodyguard
could be your biggest threat.

197
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,180
The same goes for bodyguards.

198
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,140
We show the highest levels of efficiency

199
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,059
when we develop trust with our client.

200
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,227
And…

201
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,687
you should stay away from windows.

202
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,529
Mr. Woo.

203
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,035
Yes, ma'am.

204
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,915
I'd like you to be someone we need.

205
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,126
And luckily, you came at the right time.

206
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,131
Coincidentally or not,

207
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,885
you oddly seem to possess
all the skills that we need.

208
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:06,556
I considered asking how you could have
all the experience that we needed.

209
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,685
But if you really had an ulterior motive,

210
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,688
you would've already prepared
your answers thoroughly.

211
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:18,360
May I ask you
what kind of experience I have?

212
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:24,074
You happened to be present
at the time of the stockbreeder's death.

213
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,410
And you just happen to be

214
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,911
a bodyguard.

215
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,039
Plus, your former job as a soldier.

216
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,294
I was on my way back from the event
at the time of the incident.

217
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,214
The event?

218
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,383
Correct.

219
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,552
You were at our presentation?

220
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,513
I went there willingly,
so that's not a coincidence.

221
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,557
And escorting clients

222
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,269
is just my job.
I don't know what else to say.

223
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,186
However,

224
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,940
I didn't know you'd remember
my former military duties.

225
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,444
But it was in your résumé.

226
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,822
What exactly are you talking about?

227
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:04,990
OCTOBER 2020
NAVAL INTELLIGENCE COMMAND

228
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,283
Naval Intelligence Command.

229
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:07,993
What about it?

230
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:09,786
Is that an issue?

231
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,596
You know CitizenX, right?

232
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,974
They attacked when you were serving.

233
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,934
Correct.

234
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,354
-And? Did you resolve it?
-I'm afraid that's classified.

235
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,564
Did you decrypt the ransomware
or pay them?

236
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:38,982
That's classified information.

237
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,651
You couldn't decrypt it.

238
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,279
Or catch them.

239
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,281
No one in history

240
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,034
has caught the culprits behind ransomware.

241
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,079
-Not even one?
-Not even one.

242
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,668
How much are they demanding?

243
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,102
Here it is, sir.

244
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:29,908
Hypothetically speaking,

245
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,828
would they decrypt it if we paid them?

246
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,206
We'd suffer a greater loss
if they only took the money.

247
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:42,087
That's unlikely
if they want to continue doing this.

248
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,589
If word gets out
that they broke their promise,

249
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,716
no one would pay them again.

250
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,177
What'll happen if we pay them?

251
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:54,641
They'll unlock the files. But I'm sure
that's not what you were asking.

252
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,101
Is there no way of catching them?

253
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:07,070
If the culprits are extremely greedy…

254
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,822
Then?

255
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,117
Your only chance

256
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,619
is when they exchange the Bitcoin.

257
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:19,207
Let's say there's a record of someone
withdrawing 80 billion won.

258
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,710
Then you can track them down.

259
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,421
I would exchange it bit by bit.

260
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,882
I'd take my time,
go to every exchange that exists,

261
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,884
and withdraw tiny amounts.

262
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,844
That's often the case.

263
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,637
Or they make withdrawals simultaneously.

264
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,559
In any case, I need to pay…

265
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,937
if I want to catch them.

266
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,898
Yes, and then wait and see what happens.

267
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,943
I'd rather throw cash on the streets
than pay these bastards.

268
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,035
Yes, Ms. Yun?

269
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,119
Let's…

270
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,206
pay the ransom.

271
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,458
Are you serious?

272
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,375
Yes.

273
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,316
How shitty.

274
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,276
Forget it.

275
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:29,861
I'm done.

276
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,951
Kudos to you, smart-asses.

277
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,749
I sent the Bitcoin.

278
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,591
The files are unlocked.

279
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,555
You need to report this now.

280
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,223
You must.

281
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,060
Even a conglomerate like yours
can't monitor all the exchanges.

282
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:05,063
A governmental authority needs
to open an international investigation.

283
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,942
People will think
the rumors are true if we report this.

284
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:12,654
If they hear about this right after
the rumors about our culture fluid…

285
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,907
Plus, it was our lab
with classified files that got hacked.

286
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,784
No one has caught these hackers

287
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,786
because the victims
swept it under the rug.

288
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,080
And that's exactly
what these hackers want.

289
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,252
People will believe the rumors
and think our secret got leaked.

290
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,336
That'll be the conclusion.

291
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,592
Ma'am, you have
an appointment in 40 minutes.

292
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,597
-Where's your car?
-Yeongsil, get the car ready.

293
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,724
Yes, ma'am. I'll bring out the car.

294
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,405
Hello, my name is Kim Hoseung.

295
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,490
Hello.

296
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,581
I'll be the driver, obviously.

297
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,300
All set to go.

298
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,679
It's going to rain a lot
starting this evening.

299
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,180
I'll drive safely.

300
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,449
Jeez, they're still at it?

301
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,993
Aren't they cold?

302
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:27,831
Why don't you feed them, ma'am?

303
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,666
Hey.

304
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,668
They'd be reluctant to bad-mouth you

305
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,920
if you gave them something to eat.

306
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,067
THE FILES ARE UNLOCKED

307
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,700
Mr. On, the deceased victim
who jumped off the overpass

308
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,535
is resting at B-3.

309
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:15,587
MS. YUN HAS SENT
THE CONDOLENCE MONEY

310
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,812
WISHING YOU HEAVENLY BLESSINGS
AND ETERNAL HAPPINESS

311
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,572
He never caused problems
with anyone in his life.

312
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:45,283
He was always busy looking after his cows.

313
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:51,164
I pity my poor brother!

314
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,919
Some of his bones remained.

315
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,047
They weren't fully cremated.

316
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,383
So they had to grind them!

317
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,221
CHIEF RESEARCHER HONG SAEIP

318
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,139
- He couldn't die in peace.
- Hello?

319
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,016
Mr. On, can you talk right now?

320
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,018
-Well…
-Where are you right now?

321
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,563
I'm at…
I'm sorry, but I'll have to call you back.

322
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,986
He did nothing wrong.

323
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,370
All he ever did was work hard.

324
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,792
My poor brother…

325
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,268
It's you, right?

326
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,271
Previously, you and I…

327
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,233
Right?

328
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,485
-Right.
-Right?

329
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,696
I knew it.

330
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,367
We got into a big company, you know?

331
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,161
I guess major companies
hand these out for free.

332
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,456
I guess this is our ID card.

333
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,378
I need an ID card with a blue lanyard.

334
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,883
I wanted to have an iced Americano
with that hanging from my neck.

335
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,095
What's your name again?

336
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,014
Woo Chaewoon.

337
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,891
I'm Kim Hoseung.

338
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,726
How old are you?

339
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,646
-How old am I?
-Can I call you "sir"?

340
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,398
You look much older than me.

341
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,442
-I do?
-Am I wrong?

342
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,613
Oh, I apologize.

343
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,365
-Let's focus.
-Yes, sir.

344
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,761
Ms. Yun. BF plays a part

345
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,556
in us developing trust
with foreign countries.

346
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,852
Tainting your company's reputation
will also taint our country's.

347
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,522
"The culture fluid rumors aren't true.
I'll give you scientific proof."

348
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,442
I was expecting this kind
of answer from you today, but…

349
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,819
You got hacked?

350
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,696
And you already paid the ransom?

351
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,991
-Yes.
-Then it's done.

352
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,034
It's over.

353
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,495
Sir.

354
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:38,206
Our lab has the core technology
that helped us dominate

355
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,249
the cultured meat market.

356
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,168
It's wishful thinking to believe

357
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,586
that the hackers only locked the files

358
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,672
and didn't make any copies.

359
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,466
What if they already copied
and sold the technology?

360
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,051
You got hacked two days ago.

361
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,636
All the more reason to catch them.

362
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,013
We need to find out
what information leaked where.

363
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,600
Then why haven't you reported this
if it was that important?

364
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,061
I would've done so if we could catch them.

365
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,648
But in reality, we can't even catch
scammers who reveal their voices.

366
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:07,860
Sir.

367
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:12,448
Cryptocurrency leaves a trace
as soon as an exchange is made.

368
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,742
I just need your help
in finding out who withdrew it

369
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,453
or is planning to do so.

370
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,124
The culture fluid rumors

371
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,167
are true, aren't they?

372
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,628
That's why you couldn't report this.

373
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,464
Not at all.

374
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,466
Then are the rumors
about your illegal research true?

375
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,223
Imagine what the public would've thought
if even you

376
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,434
are assuming such things.

377
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,229
How would they have reacted

378
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,190
if I'd disclosed the hacking incident?

379
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,488
You said BF's credibility
affects that of this country's.

380
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,159
I'm only here

381
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,120
to protect that credibility.

382
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,582
Because I knew you were different.

383
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,294
Let's get our facts straight.

384
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,007
You're only here
because you need me to assert my power

385
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,385
while keeping your company's name
out of the public eye.

386
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,765
No one has ever caught
the ransomware culprits.

387
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,684
I'd like you to become

388
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,353
the first politician to do so.

389
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:45,958
Look.

390
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,960
How about we do this?

391
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:51,714
I'm listening.

392
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,810
I'm sorry.
Ms. Yun is unavailable right now.

393
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,896
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

394
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,404
There have been many accidents
due to the rain today.

395
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:19,158
Thankfully, she had a witness
and was saved just in time.

396
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,243
There was a witness?

397
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,120
How did her vehicle slip?

398
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,288
The witness didn't see that.

399
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,333
They just spotted her vehicle
before it went completely underwater.

400
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:28,835
I see.

401
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,641
- Let's go to the Seoul office.
- Yes, ma'am.

402
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,312
We're in a pickle thanks to your company.

403
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,732
BF is raking in money,
but people want compensation from us.

404
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,984
So…

405
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,610
First,

406
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:58,197
I'd like your company
to donate money to a primary industry.

407
00:35:58,906 --> 00:35:59,824
As for the amount…

408
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,745
You generously paid
80 billion won to those thieves.

409
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,249
So it won't be an issue to give
the same amount to the people, right?

410
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,543
As a donation to the government.

411
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,671
And the second condition?

412
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,007
Second.

413
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,678
Give the public proof
that your culture fluid is safe.

414
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,849
I'll give proof
that our cultured meat is safe.

415
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,691
So you refuse to disclose
your culture fluid's ingredients?

416
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,484
The ingredients and their combinations

417
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,987
are the core of this industry
and are top secret.

418
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,741
It'd be suicide to disclose them
just to overcome this hurdle.

419
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,534
Everyone would duplicate it.

420
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,957
Then should the people
continue to tremble in fear?

421
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,877
You didn't
single-handedly monopolize the market.

422
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,130
"We don't kill animals
or emit carbon dioxide."

423
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,091
You owe this much to those
who trusted and consumed your meat.

424
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,303
If our culture fluid were full of germs,
our meat that eats the fluid

425
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,846
would be teeming with germs too.

426
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,350
They are already analyzing the meat.

427
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:11,771
As for the donation,

428
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,398
I'll do as you say.

429
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:19,153
Now, will Interpol
keep an eye on the exchanges?

430
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,451
I'll make sure they do.

431
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:31,040
"The first prime minister
to catch the ransomware hackers."

432
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,920
I wouldn't mind that title either.

433
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,679
That sly bastard.

434
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,397
Hello?

435
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,773
You called.

436
00:37:58,693 --> 00:37:59,694
Which hospital?

437
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,030
-Who?
-Ms. Hong got into a car accident.

438
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:07,118
The sleet on the road likely made her
crash into the water while speeding.

439
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,746
Yes, her vehicle went underwater
at 5:00 p.m.

440
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,165
Why did this have to happen today?

441
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,209
Which hospital?

442
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,671
She's unconscious?

443
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,299
She wasn't underwater for long.
She should wake up soon.

444
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,634
- How long was she underwater?
- I'm not sure.

445
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,886
They can't get the car out until tomorrow.

446
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,514
We'll find out what happened
once we check the dashcam.

447
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,224
Okay.

448
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,560
-Call me if anything happens.
-Okay.

449
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,972
BANISH BF!

450
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,371
-I'll park the car and come up.
-You may go home.

451
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,706
-I'll escort you to--
-See you on Monday.

452
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,765
First, it was our lab's system.

453
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,184
Now, a lab worker is injured.

454
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,314
Everything is revolving around the lab.

455
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,567
Does this mean the threatâ€¦

456
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,029
is coming from the inside?

457
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,451
Good work today.

458
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,882
"She's building a safe house
with state-of-the-art security.

459
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:30,094
She seems to be staying
at different hotels until it's complete."

460
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,638
That was wrong.

461
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,663
JUNHUI LOVED IT.
WHAT DID YOU DO YESTERDAY?

462
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,292
I'M WORKING.
I'LL TEXT YOU LATER.

463
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,115
- Not even one?
- Not even one.

464
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,010
The ransomware blocked
the crypto device and our security system.

465
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,345
We can't send classified info.

466
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:39,348
We'd be powerless
if North Korea attempted to hack us now.

467
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,766
Maybe they're behind this.

468
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:44,562
They want us to think it's CitizenX
when it's actually North Korea.

469
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:48,816
That's a possibility, but CitizenX
is an existing hacking organization.

470
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,651
We must prepare ourselves
in case it's them.

471
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,905
This was the file CitizenX sent in 2021

472
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,490
to an oil pipeline company.

473
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,993
The info, format, and font are identical

474
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,411
to the file we received.

475
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,205
We think CitizenX
is a Russian organization.

476
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,165
Russian? On what grounds?

477
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:09,795
It's not there.

478
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,339
DIRECTOR JEONG HAEDEUN

479
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,638
Is something going on?

480
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,974
Yes. I'm sorry. Were you sleeping?

481
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,270
What is it?

482
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,647
Mr. Woo is waiting on the first floor.

483
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,026
He doesn't have access.

484
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:35,237
But you see, I'm home right now.

485
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,241
All right.

486
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,375
Yeongsil,
open the first-floor security gate.

487
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:49,960
Yes, ma'am.

488
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,296
And give Woo Chaewoon my number.

489
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,014
I'm sorry to bother you.

490
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,475
I'm sure you're here for a reason.

491
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:09,188
CitizenX attacked an oil pipeline company
in 2021.

492
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,522
This is the file they sent.

493
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,150
It was never officially announced,

494
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,153
but an intelligence agency believes

495
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,864
that CitizenX is a Russian organization.

496
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:19,907
And the reason?

497
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,409
They made their first appearance
five years ago.

498
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,037
Their malware back then
had a Cyrillic letter in it.

499
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,164
They fixed that mistake. Howeverâ€¦

500
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,001
There are still traces of Russian.

501
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,629
All I see is English.

502
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,423
To be exact, it's the punctuation marks.

503
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:39,927
You can speak Russian?

504
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,387
I used a translator.

505
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,809
This is a list
of Russian and Korean symbols.

506
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,310
According to this paper,

507
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:51,313
the two countries share
16 punctuation marks.

508
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,481
Apart from these,

509
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,609
the symbols
that they use are very different.

510
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,949
These are quotation marks.

511
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,659
And only Russia uses them.

512
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,661
They often use this backslash too.

513
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:09,081
Other countries rarely use it
unless it's for coding.

514
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,582
Especially not
in the middle of a sentence.

515
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,254
Do you perhaps have a screenshot
of the hacked screen?

516
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,390
Here.

517
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,809
These single angle brackets.

518
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,561
Only Koreans use these.

519
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,897
And Russians rarely use these symbols.

520
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,816
But most of all,

521
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,652
there isn't a single symbol
that only Russia uses.

522
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,575
This looks very similar
to CitizenX's method,

523
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:45,993
but it's not them.

524
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:50,122
Someone is pretending to be them

525
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:51,957
to hide their identity.

526
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,379
No one on my team accessed
the external network during working hours.

527
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,424
We only used the internal network
per the security rules.

528
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,510
What if someone

529
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,514
hacked into our system
without pretending to be a hacker?

530
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,933
Would we have caught them right away?

531
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,019
If they hacked the system

532
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:14,605
without pretending to be CitizenX?

533
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:19,860
No, they would've still been untraceable.

534
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,403
They'd still be anonymous.

535
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:28,118
This individual went
out of their way to hide their identity?

536
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:32,706
Maybe it was someone close to you,
and that's why they needed a disguise.

537
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,375
Because they were so close

538
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,003
and didn't want to be suspected.

539
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:41,840
Someone I know.

540
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:45,969
Someone who knows me.

541
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:57,898
Yeongsil.

542
00:46:58,565 --> 00:46:59,483
Yes, ma'am.

543
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,653
Tell Mr. Seo
to come to the lab right away.

544
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,113
I'll call Mr. Seo.

545
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,259
There are 200 workers at the lab

546
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,679
and a total of almost 1,000 workers
who have access to the network.

547
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,558
Mr. Seo will be the first one to know

548
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,102
that I'm suspecting
someone in this company.

549
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:50,659
They happened to hack us
right when we presented our new product.

550
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,578
Do you think they knew
we'd be at the event

551
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,746
and the lab would be vacant?

552
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,749
Not everyone was at the event.

553
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:58,667
ON SAN

554
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,960
If it was Mr. On…

555
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:02,629
If it was him,

556
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,966
he would've done anything
to hide his identity.

557
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,343
But…

558
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,304
San isn't the only one.

559
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:14,141
Can we catch those bastards
who treated my culture fluid as trash?

560
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,059
They're all the same.

561
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,311
They said it was full of germs!

562
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,937
Then the news reported that!

563
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,690
- They're all the same.
- The closer, the more dangerous.

564
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,150
I devoted my entire life to this.

565
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:24,902
Was it all an act?

566
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,739
Did Professor Kim do it himself
and pretend like he was upset?

567
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:33,160
The sleet on the road likely made her
crash into the water while speeding.

568
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,328
At 5:00 p.m.

569
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,747
Why was she speeding at that hour?

570
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,749
Because she received the money?

571
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,253
In that case, the first person
who knew the money was being wired was…

572
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,588
I sent the Bitcoin.

573
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,633
Jeong Haedeun.

574
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,718
She has access to the lab's network

575
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,304
despite not working there.

576
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,272
Could it really be

577
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,483
one of them?

578
