1
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:43,921
BLOOD FREE

2
00:01:19,492 --> 00:01:21,245
EPISODE 8

3
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:28,176
You don't have to explain anything to them
since they're all bereaved families.

4
00:01:28,803 --> 00:01:30,472
I just thought it'd be nice

5
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:34,021
to have some people
you could talk to once a week.

6
00:01:37,486 --> 00:01:39,031
No.

7
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,125
You just came to mind when I heard

8
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:46,839
about that support group.

9
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:52,642
MURDEROUS COMPANY
BF

10
00:01:57,694 --> 00:01:58,696
Please help me.

11
00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:02,662
Let her go.

12
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,503
Let her go.

13
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,595
She can take that much.

14
00:02:11,805 --> 00:02:15,187
She's responsible
for Professor Kim's death,

15
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,690
as well as Mr. Kim's.

16
00:02:17,232 --> 00:02:20,363
I'm sure she knew the risks involved.

17
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:22,201
Give her what she deserves.

18
00:02:23,203 --> 00:02:25,875
She's already dragged down Professor Kim.

19
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,714
Let her go for your sake.
Don't even bother.

20
00:02:28,797 --> 00:02:32,137
No. You heard what he said.

21
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:35,978
He just admitted that Seonu Jae sent him.

22
00:02:36,062 --> 00:02:39,193
Tell them the truth.
It was you! Tell them!

23
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:40,863
Jang Yeongsil, strap her down!

24
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:49,213
Don't I deserve an explanation?

25
00:03:01,738 --> 00:03:02,907
Damn it.

26
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,124
Does that mean he's also…

27
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:11,758
You're doing that?

28
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:15,473
Only if Ms. Yun allows it.

29
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:19,941
Did Seonu Jae send you here?

30
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,279
It was my choice.

31
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:26,037
Were you just trying to bait her
by saying that, then?

32
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,542
Had I not already decided
to come and look into it,

33
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:32,049
I wouldn't have listened to anyone,
not even the prime minister.

34
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:33,886
Look into what?

35
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,522
Whether or not you were behind
the terrorist attack

36
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:42,444
at AZORAN in January of 2024.

37
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:48,916
Yeongsil, locate Woo Chaewoon.

38
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:53,550
You came to his rescue.
And much sooner than I expected.

39
00:03:55,095 --> 00:03:56,640
It was all a show!

40
00:03:57,474 --> 00:03:59,979
-You and Seonu Jae are trying to frame me!
-No.

41
00:04:00,063 --> 00:04:01,983
What did you tell him? What did you leak?

42
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:03,654
Nothing.

43
00:04:03,737 --> 00:04:05,866
And you suspected me of doing that.
You scumbag!

44
00:04:07,244 --> 00:04:08,371
You're the worst.

45
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,712
You're the worst kind of all.

46
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:19,602
I didn't know you back then.

47
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:24,403
I didn't know how much pain
you were dealing with

48
00:04:25,948 --> 00:04:27,660
or what your dream was.

49
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,507
It wasn't a coincidence
that we were both at AZORAN.

50
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:36,260
No.

51
00:04:37,304 --> 00:04:38,557
What about being my bodyguard?

52
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:40,895
Also not a coincidence.

53
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:46,322
What about when you came
to our event in the very beginning?

54
00:04:50,455 --> 00:04:51,708
And the ransomware?

55
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:59,014
That wasn't a coincidence either.

56
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:07,740
I don't know which one it is.

57
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:12,082
Whether the prime minister included me
in his ransomware scheme

58
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:16,382
or if he decided to use me
after finding out I was connected to it.

59
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:20,265
So he underhandedly requested information
but didn't explain why he needed it?

60
00:05:20,348 --> 00:05:21,893
I never gave him information.

61
00:05:21,977 --> 00:05:23,564
Of course you'd deny it.

62
00:05:23,647 --> 00:05:25,483
I have only one goal.

63
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:31,328
To find out if my men died at the hands
of our own people and not a foreign enemy.

64
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:34,627
But I couldn't find
any related information here.

65
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,715
There were no leads.

66
00:05:36,798 --> 00:05:38,092
You should've given him something.

67
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:42,184
If you did as Seonu Jae asked,
you would've been useful to him.

68
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:46,150
"Haedeun got caught. I'm all you have."
You could've had the upper hand.

69
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,665
Will you give me…

70
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:57,798
one last chance to be of use?

71
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:02,808
Let me catch Hoseung's killer.

72
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:07,484
Why bother asking for my permission?
You don't listen anyway.

73
00:06:08,654 --> 00:06:12,160
Because this is my final mission here.

74
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,960
I'm going back to the welfare center.

75
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,632
At least one person there
has to remember the killer.

76
00:06:18,715 --> 00:06:21,178
I'll tell you what I found out
once I come back.

77
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:22,389
Don't bother.

78
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:26,606
Also, don't bother resigning.
You're fired.

79
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,845
Jang Yeongsil.

80
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:46,103
Tell Ms. Jeong to pack up
all my belongings from Woo Chaewoon's--

81
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:48,024
Yes, ma'am?

82
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,924
This is what she's looking at right now.

83
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:03,847
The images are being sent
through brain waves.

84
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,855
And this is what comes to her mind
after seeing the images.

85
00:07:07,938 --> 00:07:10,401
What is she thinking about?
I don't understand.

86
00:07:11,403 --> 00:07:13,324
She's resisting psychologically.

87
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,539
That's why we're not getting much output.

88
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:19,461
God, she's obstinate.

89
00:07:19,545 --> 00:07:22,425
The photos of her victims are showing,
but she's still resisting.

90
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:27,978
The output images
are gradually getting clearer.

91
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,151
Is she becoming psychologically weaker?

92
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:34,491
Bullshit. I'm not getting weaker.

93
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,546
Should I cover her ears?

94
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,774
Are you okay?

95
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:52,820
Yes, I'm okay. Damn it.

96
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:56,326
What?

97
00:08:05,846 --> 00:08:10,146
It's him. The man who jumped
and fell on Ms. Yun's car.

98
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:15,364
Wasn't Haedeun there too?

99
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:18,120
She witnessed it up close.

100
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,168
All the blood we're showing her
is prompting her

101
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,380
to recall an image
she most closely associates with blood.

102
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:28,390
Ms. Yun, we're running an experiment.
Should we continue?

103
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:35,321
Jeong Haedeun.

104
00:08:35,404 --> 00:08:36,574
Careful. She bites.

105
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:39,037
You are torturing me.

106
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,248
I won't let this go quietly.

107
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:45,676
Report me if you think I'm a spy!
Call the police!

108
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,557
I already did. I reported you as missing.

109
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:52,063
An industrial spy
who infiltrated BF has run away.

110
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:55,529
My bodyguard got murdered while trying
to find her. The killer and the spy

111
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:58,367
both vanished.

112
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:02,292
DORSON will find you at all costs.

113
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:05,757
People will find out that
the disgusting Seonu family planted a spy

114
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:09,431
in someone else's company,
but they won't abandon you.

115
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,355
They will save you no matter what.

116
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:16,613
Dream on.

117
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:18,950
Things will never go
according to your plan.

118
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:23,960
As you already know,
this building is quite complex.

119
00:09:25,421 --> 00:09:26,591
And we have many freezers.

120
00:09:31,726 --> 00:09:35,441
Make sure she eats three times a day
until she confesses.

121
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:37,863
Shove the food down her throat
if you must.

122
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,409
Don't you even think about dying.

123
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:54,187
I don't see the other spy.
Did you let him go?

124
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,577
What if he intended to reveal
his connection to Seonu Jae all along?

125
00:10:01,661 --> 00:10:05,376
He and Haedeun could've plotted this
so at least one of them could go free.

126
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:11,012
He came here to find out
if I was behind the attack on AZORAN.

127
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:14,436
That's the most creative excuse ever.

128
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,070
But how can we believe him?
What if it's just a random excuse?

129
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:23,120
-Did you want to believe him?
-You think I did?

130
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:31,219
Can we control
the electronic chip in his ears?

131
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:34,769
What do you want to do with it?

132
00:10:35,562 --> 00:10:37,941
I'll tell you
if he turns out to be a spy

133
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:39,528
and we have to do something about it.

134
00:10:40,446 --> 00:10:42,074
Theoretically speaking,

135
00:10:42,158 --> 00:10:44,872
we can cause a vibration in his ears.

136
00:10:44,955 --> 00:10:48,880
We can cause a sharp pain
by affecting his inner ears.

137
00:10:48,963 --> 00:10:50,801
So the noise cancellation
won't work either.

138
00:10:53,723 --> 00:10:54,600
Hello.

139
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:55,560
Let's do that.

140
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:57,271
Get it ready.

141
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,363
-I'm sorry.
-About what?

142
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:03,450
I thought he was trustworthy.

143
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:07,543
After all,
I conducted his test and interview.

144
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:11,216
I promised to check for any side effects.

145
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:13,262
What?

146
00:11:14,932 --> 00:11:19,482
Jang Yeongsil, send Woo Chaewoon an alarm
as soon as BF's app turns off.

147
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:21,904
- Yes, ma'am.
-I trusted Ms. Jeong too.

148
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:32,008
The minister will arrive in five minutes.

149
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:38,521
"We the farmers have protected our crops
even in the face of heavy rain.

150
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:41,276
When our country was plagued
with foot-and-mouth disease…

151
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:42,529
SEONU JAE, PRIME MINISTER

152
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:44,533
…mad cow disease, and the avian influenza,

153
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:46,161
the government ordered a massacre.

154
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:49,167
And being uneducated, we obeyed them.

155
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,797
We thought it was providence.

156
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:57,099
But now,
a monster called BF roams our country.

157
00:11:57,893 --> 00:11:59,605
Providence is dead.

158
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,070
Has this hopeful world abandoned us?

159
00:12:04,113 --> 00:12:07,788
Or should I,
a useless farmer, abandon this world?"

160
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:13,758
The USDA expressed their concerns

161
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:17,264
about BF's monopoly
of the market this morning.

162
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:21,481
They threatened us and said BF
could create diplomatic issues.

163
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:24,989
BF no longer feels like a major company

164
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:27,159
that's focused on a shared interest.

165
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:30,667
I'm concerned about this farmer
who left behind this letter

166
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,086
before taking his own life.

167
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:39,643
This company is burning
an entire industry to the ground.

168
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:41,021
How long will we just

169
00:12:41,104 --> 00:12:43,651
sit and watch under the guise
of putting the economy first?

170
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:47,283
Actually,

171
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:52,126
I met with the CEO of BF
right after the culture fluid incident.

172
00:12:54,172 --> 00:12:57,512
Nothing could be worse than people
questioning your product's safety.

173
00:12:57,596 --> 00:12:59,348
Yet the CEO of BF,

174
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:01,771
who is an influential individual,

175
00:13:01,854 --> 00:13:04,860
was only focused on making a profit.

176
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:06,947
It made me reflect on myself.

177
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,957
"This is really one of our leading CEOs?
Was I also like her in the past?"

178
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:18,763
Sir.

179
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:22,938
Can we begin an investigation on BF?

180
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:26,069
Yes, sir.
We can open a case whenever you wish.

181
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:28,741
There are already
several cases pending against BF.

182
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:31,454
But if we carry out an investigation

183
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:34,377
when Ms. Yun has already been charged
with poisoning a man,

184
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,091
it might seem like the government is
endorsing the accusations.

185
00:13:37,174 --> 00:13:38,301
That's exactly it.

186
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:42,561
I don't think it's normal for a company
to be suspected of staging

187
00:13:42,644 --> 00:13:46,652
an attack on their CEO
or the death of a company executive.

188
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:49,783
This investigation must be
more than just showing

189
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:53,624
that we are trying too,
or that we don't side with a corporation.

190
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,918
We must be thorough.

191
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:58,843
That way, BF will correct themselves
and self-reflect.

192
00:13:59,553 --> 00:14:03,184
I need you leaders to help BF

193
00:14:03,268 --> 00:14:06,692
become a company that serves this country.

194
00:14:06,775 --> 00:14:09,155
The National Human Rights Commission,
Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy,

195
00:14:09,238 --> 00:14:11,200
Ministry of Agriculture,
Food and Rural Affairs, and the rest

196
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,286
must aid the prosecution.

197
00:14:13,873 --> 00:14:16,002
-Can you do that?
-Yes, sir.

198
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:27,024
BLOOD FREE

199
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,338
I'm from a nearby real estate agency.

200
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:42,096
What? Is she the new owner of this house?

201
00:14:42,722 --> 00:14:46,563
That young man should've told me
if the house was sold.

202
00:14:46,647 --> 00:14:48,943
He never gave me an update.

203
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:40,880
Is this house on the market?

204
00:15:40,963 --> 00:15:42,299
Why do you ask?

205
00:15:42,382 --> 00:15:44,178
I heard you talking
to the real estate agent.

206
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:49,523
I wasn't meaning to eavesdrop,
but I could hear you so well.

207
00:15:50,273 --> 00:15:51,944
Why? You want to move to an apartment?

208
00:15:52,027 --> 00:15:53,948
No, to pay
for my niece's studies abroad.

209
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:57,539
What? You're selling the house
to pay for her studies?

210
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,293
Where does she go to school? Harvard?

211
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:03,007
She's in elementary school.

212
00:16:03,091 --> 00:16:04,886
-She's still a kid.
-Yes.

213
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,684
Why are you footing the bill
instead of her dad?

214
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:12,317
Gosh, I'm in no position
to worry about others.

215
00:16:13,236 --> 00:16:18,037
I need to buy a house
before I can get married and have a kid.

216
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:19,331
Are you seeing anyone?

217
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:23,047
Do you seriously think this handsome face
and hot body is single?

218
00:16:23,924 --> 00:16:26,722
Geez, you're only 26 years old.

219
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:29,853
Even I'm still not married.

220
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:32,441
Why is that open?

221
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:36,282
Exactly. Ms. Yun.

222
00:16:36,365 --> 00:16:39,664
Have you ever heard of an uncle
who financially supports his niece?

223
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,629
This isn't my house.
My entire family used to live here.

224
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:46,553
Look. I know it's none of my business.

225
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:50,268
But what you're doing is meaningless.
She'll only be fluent in English

226
00:16:50,352 --> 00:16:53,233
and not give you anything in return.

227
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:55,403
You've been very nosy all day.

228
00:16:56,364 --> 00:16:57,617
Do as you wish.

229
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:02,794
You'd have to work like a dog
to get a house like this again.

230
00:17:09,557 --> 00:17:11,352
I've always wanted to study abroad.

231
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:14,275
You can go now.

232
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,575
My parents could only send one of us.

233
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:22,792
Ma'am, I can't believe there was a time
when you couldn't afford something.

234
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:27,384
All parents want to do
as much as they can for the children.

235
00:17:28,136 --> 00:17:29,514
I have no choice.

236
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:33,522
She has a dairy allergy.

237
00:17:34,106 --> 00:17:36,235
She can't have
any kind of milk whatsoever.

238
00:17:37,697 --> 00:17:41,913
That little girl was taken to the ER
countless times when she was here.

239
00:17:42,874 --> 00:17:45,796
Sellers would claim that their products
didn't contain any milk,

240
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,217
but her throat would swell up
and she couldn't breathe.

241
00:17:49,386 --> 00:17:51,725
Guess what those people said every time?

242
00:17:52,643 --> 00:17:54,396
"We didn't know it contained milk."

243
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,737
Some said we should feed her milk
to help her overcome her allergy.

244
00:17:58,321 --> 00:17:59,741
Is she being treated in the US?

245
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,285
It's incurable.

246
00:18:02,496 --> 00:18:06,003
What's interesting about the US is that
people there have all sorts of allergies.

247
00:18:06,922 --> 00:18:10,345
One of her classmates has a water allergy.

248
00:18:10,428 --> 00:18:11,890
Some do have that.

249
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:16,107
Your niece's parents
must be so devastated.

250
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:19,321
Her dad gave up on her.

251
00:18:21,242 --> 00:18:23,622
He said he couldn't support her.

252
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:27,714
He expressed his resentment toward me
before filing for divorce.

253
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:31,847
Why would he resent you?
It's not your fault she's allergic.

254
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,186
Because I told my sister to come.

255
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:39,278
I was training long-term in the US.

256
00:18:40,698 --> 00:18:44,873
She constantly called me in tears
after her daughter went to kindergarten.

257
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:48,547
Why did she cry
after her daughter went to kindergarten?

258
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,803
They had birthday parties every month,

259
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:53,766
and the kids would get cake.

260
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:57,147
Goodness. Your niece must've wanted some.

261
00:18:58,692 --> 00:19:00,069
She never eats cake.

262
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:04,579
Because she knows
how painful it is better than anyone.

263
00:19:05,748 --> 00:19:08,085
But her classmates were offended.

264
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:11,258
They were upset
that she didn't eat their cake.

265
00:19:12,553 --> 00:19:14,682
Then they started to bully her.

266
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:16,686
Geez, I hate bullies.

267
00:19:18,147 --> 00:19:20,528
It probably had to do with her race.

268
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:23,909
But she's never gone to the ER in the US.

269
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:34,847
Even if you had 100 kids,
I bet you could send them all abroad.

270
00:19:38,939 --> 00:19:41,695
What's wrong? Was that too many?

271
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:45,118
He was 26.

272
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:51,631
I wonder how his girlfriend is holding up.

273
00:20:22,442 --> 00:20:24,656
KIM HOSEUNG

274
00:20:35,594 --> 00:20:38,684
Did Ms. Jeong spill anything?

275
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:43,401
Does Ms. Yun look like a terrorist to you?

276
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:49,496
It's likely…

277
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,674
that Mr. Kim Singu was brainwashed
in a short amount of time.

278
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,859
-By the killer?
-Yes.

279
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:07,783
He never opened up
during the group meetings.

280
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:11,457
And he only attended
two or three times in total.

281
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,797
But this guy sat next to him every time

282
00:21:15,423 --> 00:21:18,012
and talked to him.

283
00:21:18,722 --> 00:21:23,189
There was a time when they skipped
a meeting and went to that café.

284
00:21:23,272 --> 00:21:26,863
He said the two never attended
any meetings after that day.

285
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:32,541
Professor Kim fell victim
to a heinous bastard.

286
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,881
How do you think he knew he could meet
Professor Kim at the welfare center?

287
00:21:37,258 --> 00:21:39,722
Haedeun must've been busy tipping him off.

288
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:46,193
He was heinous enough to stab someone

289
00:21:46,276 --> 00:21:48,573
and set an entire neighborhood on fire
instead of doing it

290
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:50,994
in a vacant lot. What a lunatic.

291
00:21:56,631 --> 00:21:58,300
If you find out anything,
you don't have to tell me, but--

292
00:21:58,384 --> 00:21:59,219
EULJUNG POLICE STATION

293
00:21:59,302 --> 00:22:00,806
Don't worry.

294
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:03,979
Right. Did you tell the police
that we have Haedeun?

295
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:06,024
No.

296
00:22:09,364 --> 00:22:11,493
How did they set up
so many explosives so quickly?

297
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:19,050
On a military base, at that.

298
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:22,933
Ms. Yun and the rest of us
once suspected that it could've been done

299
00:22:23,017 --> 00:22:25,564
by a professional hit man,
not some extremist.

300
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,364
All you did was talk about it?

301
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:34,247
What could we have done?

302
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,013
But she was a victim too.

303
00:23:49,732 --> 00:23:53,823
She looked familiar.

304
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,837
Did you find anything?

305
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:13,696
My God!

306
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,046
You could've given me a heads-up.

307
00:24:39,414 --> 00:24:40,249
What?

308
00:24:51,981 --> 00:24:55,112
Call me when you're done.
I won't stop until she talks.

309
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:06,426
You should eat.

310
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:22,041
No.

311
00:25:26,676 --> 00:25:29,974
Are they worth starving yourself for
in order to remain loyal?

312
00:25:30,934 --> 00:25:33,272
I don't want you to see this side of me.

313
00:25:34,942 --> 00:25:35,777
What?

314
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,405
Let someone else do it.

315
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:41,371
Not you.

316
00:25:44,795 --> 00:25:48,511
I'm not asking you to understand me.

317
00:25:49,972 --> 00:25:51,600
I've already been caught anyway.

318
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:58,030
But I'd like you of all people

319
00:25:59,867 --> 00:26:03,081
to only have good memories of me.
Please grant me this much.

320
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:13,895
Are you messing with me?

321
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,028
You won't trick me by suddenly acting
this way. What do you take me for?

322
00:26:18,111 --> 00:26:20,282
How would you know if it's sudden or not?

323
00:26:21,368 --> 00:26:24,833
You only set your eyes on Ms. Yun. You…

324
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:28,716
You never gave me a chance.

325
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:37,901
Ms. Jeong. You shouldn't have talked shit
to me a while ago if that were the case.

326
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,326
I swore I would hide my feelings
every time I came to work

327
00:26:42,953 --> 00:26:44,748
since I knew I couldn't have you.

328
00:26:45,457 --> 00:26:47,169
I guess I did a good job.

329
00:26:48,422 --> 00:26:51,512
Did you really not notice?

330
00:26:58,526 --> 00:27:01,281
Tell me the truth if you want me
to remember you in a positive way.

331
00:27:01,364 --> 00:27:05,623
What happened to Professor Kim?
Who and where is Hoseung's killer?

332
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:09,046
What did DORSON ask you to do,
and what information did you leak?

333
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,301
"A colleague of mine died.

334
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:15,894
He was murdered on the street.
How is that possible?"

335
00:27:15,977 --> 00:27:19,400
I told my friend that
because I was so distraught.

336
00:27:19,484 --> 00:27:21,697
Stop talking about this friend
we can't even trace--

337
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,285
It's driving me crazy too!
She was like a sister to me!

338
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:27,792
Mr. On, how could I have possibly known

339
00:27:27,876 --> 00:27:32,802
that her phone wasn't traceable?

340
00:27:34,973 --> 00:27:38,146
Mr. On, I…

341
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,359
That friend of yours…

342
00:27:42,697 --> 00:27:45,410
Fine. Tell me how you two met.

343
00:27:45,494 --> 00:27:48,333
Jesus. What am I saying?

344
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,045
It was at a swimming pool.

345
00:27:51,381 --> 00:27:52,717
We met at a pool.

346
00:27:53,678 --> 00:27:59,523
She approached me first
and treated me well.

347
00:28:08,456 --> 00:28:13,049
It's likely that Mr. Kim Singu
was brainwashed in a short amount of time.

348
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:15,470
We met at a pool.

349
00:28:17,517 --> 00:28:21,357
She approached me first.

350
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:23,988
This is just unbelievable.

351
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,672
-Hey, are you done?
-Yes.

352
00:28:33,381 --> 00:28:34,718
Are you going home?

353
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,639
Yes. See you tomorrow.

354
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:48,119
What about the images
Ms. Jeong was seeing?

355
00:28:49,748 --> 00:28:54,215
I'll turn it back on before I go.
I told you to tell me when you were done.

356
00:28:57,514 --> 00:28:59,225
Never mind. You should go.

357
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,637
What is it?

358
00:29:17,721 --> 00:29:20,935
You must think
I really don't know anything

359
00:29:21,018 --> 00:29:23,440
just because I'm staying quiet.

360
00:29:26,947 --> 00:29:28,743
What are you staying quiet about?

361
00:29:40,892 --> 00:29:42,269
You wanted to see if the traitor

362
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:44,482
was me.

363
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:47,321
You thought I was behind Hoseung's death.

364
00:29:47,404 --> 00:29:48,699
-It's not your fault--
-What?

365
00:29:51,955 --> 00:29:54,335
That's all the help I needed.
I'm sure you're busy.

366
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:02,226
Look. It's not like I don't understand.

367
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:05,733
Even I wondered how the killer

368
00:30:05,817 --> 00:30:07,779
found our bodyguards.

369
00:30:09,616 --> 00:30:11,703
But now that we found our mole,

370
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:16,630
don't I at least deserve
an apology from you?

371
00:30:17,422 --> 00:30:19,511
-Deserve?
-But instead,

372
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:24,604
you look at me as if
I'm a professional torturer.

373
00:30:27,234 --> 00:30:30,323
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

374
00:30:30,407 --> 00:30:31,702
When did I look at you that way?

375
00:30:32,452 --> 00:30:33,288
Just now.

376
00:30:33,371 --> 00:30:36,753
I was going to say
that the woman looked familiar.

377
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:41,972
Woman? What woman?

378
00:30:42,055 --> 00:30:43,976
The woman Ms. Jeong recalled.

379
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:46,439
The one she remembered
alongside the man who fell.

380
00:30:46,523 --> 00:30:48,652
She looked familiar, but I stopped talking

381
00:30:48,736 --> 00:30:50,781
because I couldn't remember.
And you suspected me?

382
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:55,290
Could it just be your insecurities?
No one accused you.

383
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:59,465
Maybe you already know
that you're torturing her.

384
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:02,220
That's why you feel guilty
when someone looks at you.

385
00:31:22,344 --> 00:31:25,935
He doesn't have the balls to confront
the person who gave the orders.

386
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:29,024
Everyone thinks I'm a pushover.

387
00:31:29,108 --> 00:31:30,820
Goddamn it.

388
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,739
-Jang Yeongsil.
-Yes, ma'am?

389
00:32:34,823 --> 00:32:36,701
Send a letter to the stockholders.

390
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:43,005
"We foresee a hostile M&A attempt
by outside forces.

391
00:32:43,089 --> 00:32:46,470
The company will issue stocks
that are relatively cheaper

392
00:32:46,555 --> 00:32:49,309
and allow the stockholders
to purchase them first.

393
00:32:49,393 --> 00:32:51,898
We're only doing this
to prevent illegal mergers

394
00:32:51,982 --> 00:32:55,113
resulting from short-term profit fixation
and market failure.

395
00:32:55,823 --> 00:32:57,284
We believe the outside forces

396
00:32:57,367 --> 00:33:00,541
will attempt to purchase
the cheap stocks in bulk.

397
00:33:01,292 --> 00:33:03,421
We urge our wise stockholders

398
00:33:03,505 --> 00:33:07,179
to join hands with us
and protect the company."

399
00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:13,065
Replace "urge" with "ask."

400
00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:14,611
Okay. I have revised it.

401
00:33:16,447 --> 00:33:17,365
"In addition…"

402
00:33:17,449 --> 00:33:20,915
Seonu Jae sent me here
so he could swallow BF whole.

403
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:26,801
Grab onto me before you lose everything
and regret it all.

404
00:33:28,597 --> 00:33:29,599
Jang Yeongsil.

405
00:33:29,682 --> 00:33:34,233
What's the difference
in the company values of DORSON and BF?

406
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:35,819
Based on the figures of 2025,

407
00:33:35,903 --> 00:33:38,992
DORSON's total market value
is 1.57 quadrillion.

408
00:33:39,076 --> 00:33:41,038
BF's is 260 trillion.

409
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,261
It's not even one fourth.

410
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:57,530
Ms. Jeong vehemently denies
any involvement.

411
00:33:57,613 --> 00:34:01,287
We'll only be accused
of keeping her hostage.

412
00:34:02,122 --> 00:34:05,587
Let's just hand her over to the cops
if we're not putting her in the freezer.

413
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:08,175
And what if she dies like Professor Kim?

414
00:34:11,098 --> 00:34:12,768
Freezer, it is.

415
00:34:12,852 --> 00:34:15,816
I don't expect her to admit
that she was working for DORSON.

416
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,862
But we need to find out who the killer is.

417
00:34:17,945 --> 00:34:19,866
Even if she admits to it,

418
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:22,955
how can we put up a fight
against Seonu Geun and the prime minister?

419
00:34:26,086 --> 00:34:27,464
This is your last chance.

420
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,094
This is my last chance.

421
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:56,731
Yes, ma'am. Mr. Yeo.

422
00:35:18,357 --> 00:35:20,319
Wouldn't there be more people in Haeundae?

423
00:35:20,403 --> 00:35:22,407
Especially at nighttime.

424
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,748
We already set everything up there.
We're in Nampo-dong now.

425
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:29,129
It won't be real-time.
They'll send us an edited version.

426
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:30,799
How about the other areas?

427
00:35:30,883 --> 00:35:32,761
Yes, we're ready too.

428
00:35:44,201 --> 00:35:47,290
Hello. I'm Yun Jayu, the CEO of BF.

429
00:35:47,373 --> 00:35:48,710
-Look at that.
-Gosh!

430
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:52,258
There's something I must tell you all
who live in this day and age.

431
00:35:52,342 --> 00:35:54,847
I apologize for the sudden appearance.

432
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:59,481
We at BF have been
conducting a secret project.

433
00:35:59,565 --> 00:36:00,692
Organoids.

434
00:36:01,569 --> 00:36:04,491
Simply put,
we've been culturing human organs.

435
00:36:04,575 --> 00:36:07,455
With our top-notch
cell culture technology,

436
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,504
we strived to copy human organs.
And as a result,

437
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:12,423
we were able to culture muscle fibers,

438
00:36:13,008 --> 00:36:18,102
osteocytes, blood,
hearts, livers, kidneys, lungs,

439
00:36:18,185 --> 00:36:20,774
- pancreases, stomachs, small intestines…
-Hey, look.

440
00:36:20,857 --> 00:36:22,820
…large intestines, and bladders.

441
00:36:22,903 --> 00:36:25,617
We successfully cultured all human organs

442
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:26,703
- except for the brain.
-No way.

443
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,418
However,
our project isn't perfect just yet.

444
00:36:30,501 --> 00:36:33,508
We need to run some clinical tests.

445
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:35,971
That's why I'd like to ask you for help.

446
00:36:37,348 --> 00:36:40,689
Those who have terminal cancer.

447
00:36:40,772 --> 00:36:43,737
Those who are suffering
from incurable diseases.

448
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:47,786
We are looking
for clinical test volunteers.

449
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,961
We will cover the entire cost of surgery.

450
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:56,303
We'll carry out a suitability test
on the volunteers.

451
00:36:56,386 --> 00:36:58,140
The first batch will consist
of 60 patients.

452
00:36:58,223 --> 00:37:01,355
The second and third batches
will consist of 150 patients.

453
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,989
I have a great deal of respect for BF

454
00:37:07,033 --> 00:37:08,536
for their wonderful achievement.

455
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:13,212
But I am enraged
as the prime minister of this country.

456
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,466
What gives Ms. Yun the right

457
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:20,727
to stir up the entire country
by using our people's health as bait?

458
00:37:22,355 --> 00:37:23,440
What you just witnessed

459
00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:25,737
is an advertisement.

460
00:37:26,572 --> 00:37:30,413
As the CEO,
she is merely advertising her products.

461
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:33,670
However, there is heartbreaking news
that I must share with you

462
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:35,882
prior to carrying out this project.

463
00:37:36,466 --> 00:37:41,519
Two years ago, our researchers carried out
a clinical test. However,

464
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,439
we failed.

465
00:37:43,523 --> 00:37:46,153
Even though
the patient had consented to it

466
00:37:46,236 --> 00:37:49,367
and the cancer cells had metastasized,

467
00:37:49,451 --> 00:37:53,626
we must not and can't
deny the fact that she passed away.

468
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:57,551
I would like to take responsibility
and promise you two things.

469
00:37:57,634 --> 00:37:59,095
I do not doubt it.

470
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:01,391
I believe our people are wise.

471
00:38:01,475 --> 00:38:04,147
BF will not get what they want.

472
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:09,867
I understand that her words
may have given some of you hope.

473
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,077
However,

474
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:14,627
the government will do their job.

475
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:19,052
We will absolutely not allow
a private company to make

476
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:22,058
this large-scale gamble
while putting lives at risk.

477
00:38:22,141 --> 00:38:24,270
First, I will take legal responsibility

478
00:38:24,354 --> 00:38:27,485
for carrying out medical treatment
outside a medical institution.

479
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:28,655
Second,

480
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:34,542
I volunteer to be the first test subject.

481
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:36,294
Are you insane?

482
00:38:36,378 --> 00:38:39,384
Were you aware of this? Mr. On.

483
00:38:39,467 --> 00:38:41,597
Mr. On, were you aware of this?

484
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:43,433
Did you guys agree on this?

485
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:44,352
Are you crazy?

486
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:45,605
Then…

487
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:49,070
I won't use people's desperation
for my project.

488
00:38:49,153 --> 00:38:50,322
So this is her own crazy idea.

489
00:38:51,032 --> 00:38:53,245
I will replace all my organs

490
00:38:53,328 --> 00:38:56,168
- with our cultured ones.
-My dear citizens whom I respect.

491
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,046
Please remember this.

492
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:02,764
You don't need to approve of her,
let alone respect her,

493
00:39:02,848 --> 00:39:07,064
just because she's sacrificing herself
to prove something.

494
00:39:08,818 --> 00:39:10,989
The entire procedure will be open to all.

495
00:39:11,072 --> 00:39:14,287
We will see if I suffer
from any complications,

496
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:17,669
infections, or rejections
over the next three months.

497
00:39:17,753 --> 00:39:18,588
Hi, honey.

498
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:21,217
We'll only select new test subjects
once that's been cleared.

499
00:39:21,301 --> 00:39:22,136
Is that true?

500
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,806
BF's cell culture technology is

501
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:27,313
currently the highest point possible
that modern humans can reach.

502
00:39:27,396 --> 00:39:31,154
The surgery will be carried out by AI
that is absolutely precise

503
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:34,703
and top-notch researchers who have been
working on culturing human organs

504
00:39:34,787 --> 00:39:38,418
- since the beginning of BF.
-Yun Jayu is advertising her products!

505
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:43,428
BF is advertising a product
that is far from being complete.

506
00:39:43,513 --> 00:39:45,432
This isn't a reckless attempt.

507
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,228
And that is only because

508
00:39:47,311 --> 00:39:51,862
many of you are desperate
to live in a world free of disease.

509
00:39:52,531 --> 00:39:55,829
I trust your courage and determination.

510
00:39:56,413 --> 00:39:58,584
I, alongside BF, a biotechnology company,

511
00:39:58,668 --> 00:40:02,091
will be waiting for those
who will join us in changing humanity.

512
00:40:02,174 --> 00:40:03,385
Ms. Yun.

513
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:09,773
If you still have an ounce of conscience
or good sense in you,

514
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:13,363
don't try to profit
from our citizens' lives.

515
00:40:13,447 --> 00:40:15,994
Instead, you should repent
and give your sincere apology

516
00:40:16,077 --> 00:40:21,171
to all the innocent lives
that fell victim to your company.

517
00:40:21,254 --> 00:40:23,634
You will be redirected
to voicemail after the beep…

518
00:40:23,718 --> 00:40:26,431
-Why isn't she picking up?
- Your call will be charged.

519
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:28,644
MS. YUN

520
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:32,401
Yun Jayu,
are you seriously out of your mind?

521
00:40:32,485 --> 00:40:34,907
What do you take us for?

522
00:40:35,617 --> 00:40:39,373
Hey, even someone whose organs
are completely damaged wouldn't do this.

523
00:40:39,457 --> 00:40:42,923
It's not like you're being forced
to fall off a building or something. I…

524
00:40:51,189 --> 00:40:53,151
All he ever did was work hard.

525
00:40:53,235 --> 00:40:55,615
Hold on. Jang Yeongsil.

526
00:40:55,698 --> 00:40:56,575
Yes, sir?

527
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:59,205
Find the name of the farm
owned by the man who jumped off

528
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,754
the Maesan Overpass on December 24, 2025.

529
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:05,467
Okay. I'm searching news articles.

530
00:41:05,552 --> 00:41:09,058
The name of the farm
is Yangju-ri Gwanghyang Husbandry.

531
00:41:10,227 --> 00:41:11,062
MS. YUN

532
00:41:20,707 --> 00:41:23,336
The prosecution was already notified

533
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,468
of BF's illegal surgery
and the patient's death.

534
00:41:26,552 --> 00:41:28,180
The fact that

535
00:41:28,263 --> 00:41:31,477
Ms. Yun mentioned this incident right now
shows that she knows

536
00:41:31,562 --> 00:41:36,279
she'll be interrogated soon
and is trying to save face

537
00:41:36,362 --> 00:41:39,035
by pretending to be
a conscientious individual.

538
00:41:39,786 --> 00:41:42,584
As you just heard,
the prosecution will be conducting

539
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,671
- an investigation on BF.
-Leave it running.

540
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:46,759
-Yes, ma'am.
-We will update you

541
00:41:46,842 --> 00:41:49,222
on any new announcements
made by the government.

542
00:41:49,305 --> 00:41:54,023
Let's see what the citizens thought
after hearing Yun Jayu's announcement.

543
00:41:54,106 --> 00:41:57,948
I was utterly shocked.
I wonder if she'll actually do it.

544
00:42:15,858 --> 00:42:17,529
Let me be your proof.

545
00:42:18,573 --> 00:42:21,286
What did you find out
after leaving to find the killer?

546
00:42:31,724 --> 00:42:33,978
"I was on the brink of death,
but BF saved me.

547
00:42:34,061 --> 00:42:36,107
What better proof
could there possibly be?"

548
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:38,320
Whom should I tell this to?

549
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:43,873
I'll tell them that I got stronger
and can hear much better now, so…

550
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:45,960
Don't go through with it.

551
00:42:49,216 --> 00:42:51,930
Why take a longer route
when there's a shortcut?

552
00:42:52,014 --> 00:42:53,893
There's no better solution than this.

553
00:43:02,201 --> 00:43:03,411
Why are you going this far?

554
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,002
Because I must subdue them.

555
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:10,008
There's no other reason.

556
00:43:10,092 --> 00:43:13,306
I've faced countless obstacles until now,
and I've overcome them all.

557
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:16,104
This one will be no different.

558
00:43:17,649 --> 00:43:19,276
I will show them

559
00:43:20,947 --> 00:43:22,032
that I can't be subdued.

560
00:43:22,116 --> 00:43:25,832
Was there ever a time
when you had to sacrifice your body?

561
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:29,004
Do you even want to live?

562
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,556
I'm doing this so I can live.

563
00:43:34,432 --> 00:43:35,392
And I will.

564
00:43:38,691 --> 00:43:39,776
I understand.

565
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:43,659
What do you understand?
Where are you going?

566
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,042
You won't need the best solution…

567
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:52,384
if the second-best one succeeds.

568
00:43:57,227 --> 00:43:58,480
What are you planning to do?

569
00:43:59,816 --> 00:44:02,864
I also have something I can't give up on.

570
00:44:03,824 --> 00:44:04,951
My mission…

571
00:44:06,955 --> 00:44:08,374
isn't over yet.

572
00:44:57,389 --> 00:44:59,853
It has been a while
since I've taken a night stroll.

573
00:45:00,771 --> 00:45:01,940
You know, don't you?

574
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:05,948
It's not just about
replacing the organs, is it?

575
00:45:07,034 --> 00:45:10,791
You can become lively again.
You must've seen it firsthand.

576
00:45:12,629 --> 00:45:16,177
You could've worn a prosthetic leg
if you wished to walk again.

577
00:45:19,224 --> 00:45:22,189
Captain Woo, be careful what you say.

578
00:45:23,274 --> 00:45:26,364
Did you tell your daughter?

579
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,746
You said it was a surprise visit,

580
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:34,589
but a visit from the head of state
couldn't have been spontaneous.

581
00:45:35,549 --> 00:45:38,889
You must've planned the visit
even before you boarded the plane.

582
00:45:40,475 --> 00:45:44,693
Did you tell your daughter about your plan
before boarding the plane?

583
00:45:46,112 --> 00:45:47,114
What if I did?

584
00:45:50,161 --> 00:45:51,330
I'd like to meet with her.

585
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:55,840
Why?

586
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:57,719
Ms. Yun wasn't behind the attack.

587
00:45:58,512 --> 00:46:00,390
So we should move on.

588
00:46:00,473 --> 00:46:04,566
Just like how we moved on
from Chairman Park to Ms. Yun.

589
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,116
You want to move on,

590
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:11,663
yet you want to see my daughter?

591
00:46:13,207 --> 00:46:14,376
To be precise,

592
00:46:15,796 --> 00:46:18,844
I'd like to meet Chairman Seonu's ex-wife.

593
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:26,902
Leave.

594
00:46:28,362 --> 00:46:29,364
Will you ask her yourself?

595
00:46:29,448 --> 00:46:32,037
Leave!

596
00:47:03,141 --> 00:47:04,561
CHAIRMAN OF DORSON AND HIS WIFE

597
00:47:39,463 --> 00:47:41,968
It's nice to meet you.
My name is Woo Chaewoon.

598
00:47:44,014 --> 00:47:46,268
I have something to tell you
regarding a request

599
00:47:46,352 --> 00:47:48,230
made by the prime minister.

600
00:47:55,286 --> 00:47:56,665
What is it?

601
00:48:10,776 --> 00:48:13,740
You'll request to go abroad
just to pay for your niece's studies?

602
00:48:14,617 --> 00:48:18,625
I'm also sick and tired of everyone
blaming each other for the ransomware.

603
00:48:19,418 --> 00:48:20,420
Look at you.

604
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:25,263
You must've heard about how beautiful
the women are in that country.

605
00:48:25,346 --> 00:48:26,599
You're a lunatic.

606
00:48:26,683 --> 00:48:29,647
You know what? I'll also go
and stop you from marrying one of them.

607
00:48:32,778 --> 00:48:33,864
You're coming too?

608
00:48:33,947 --> 00:48:37,621
They'll think all Korean men are ugly
if you're the only one they see.

609
00:48:37,705 --> 00:48:40,168
Don't tell me
you already did the interview.

610
00:49:04,926 --> 00:49:05,928
I will catch him…

611
00:49:09,393 --> 00:49:10,394
at all costs.

612
