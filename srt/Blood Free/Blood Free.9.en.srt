BLOOD FREE

2
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:51,477
Don't tell me you…

3
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:54,568
Come home this instant.

4
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,572
RECENT CALLS:
SON

5
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,552
It's nice to meet you.
My name is Woo Chaewoon.

6
00:01:10,307 --> 00:01:11,727
Can I help you?

7
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,396
I've been waiting for you.

8
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,947
I have something to tell you regarding
a request made by the prime minister.

9
00:01:18,574 --> 00:01:20,160
EPISODE 9

10
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,249
Your father probably only told you

11
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:27,049
that he was going to stop by a base
that used to be a battlefield.

12
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:33,061
And you tipped off your ex-husband.

13
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:39,365
I apologize. You neither tipped him off
nor confided in him.

14
00:01:39,448 --> 00:01:41,119
You just didn't think much of it.

15
00:01:42,705 --> 00:01:46,505
You were married for 40 years.
It was normal to talk about such things.

16
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:52,892
They were the two people you were
closest with. Your father and husband.

17
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:56,274
All you did was tell your husband,

18
00:01:56,357 --> 00:01:58,904
but dozens lost their lives as a result.

19
00:02:01,117 --> 00:02:05,333
You already assumed that it was his doing,

20
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:07,672
so you divorced him.

21
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:11,304
That's my conclusion so far.

22
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:14,978
Please tell me if I'm wrong.

23
00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:23,286
You're wrong about everything.

24
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,714
I lost a fellow soldier to that incident.

25
00:02:30,676 --> 00:02:31,678
Is that so?

26
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:35,018
I'm sorry to hear that.

27
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:38,567
I made a vow beside his lifeless body

28
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:44,286
that I would punish whoever was behind it.

29
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:47,877
If it really wasn't Chairman Seonu,

30
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:50,131
I beg you,

31
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:52,929
please tell me that I'm wrong.

32
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:56,979
Because I need to go

33
00:02:58,106 --> 00:02:59,441
and fulfill my promise.

34
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:16,309
My son didn't put you up to this, did he?

35
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:19,649
There's no way he would have.

36
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:24,491
You can check with him.

37
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:29,919
Did you send him here?
Did you really tell him about it?

38
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:31,757
Is that what he said?

39
00:03:32,842 --> 00:03:33,969
That I told him that?

40
00:03:34,053 --> 00:03:36,808
I only told you about it,
so if it wasn't you…

41
00:03:38,186 --> 00:03:39,898
I hope you talk it out with him.

42
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:42,069
"Talk it out with him"?

43
00:03:43,446 --> 00:03:45,534
What are you trying to get out of this?

44
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:49,751
I want you to find peace.

45
00:03:51,337 --> 00:03:53,257
I know you did it for me.

46
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:58,059
So tell him the truth for my sake.

47
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:01,817
-Jae.
-The ministers are waiting for me.

48
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,444
I'll call you back later.

49
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:14,341
Mother?

50
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:15,886
Don't turn it on.

51
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:24,153
What could it be this time?
What did my father do

52
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:27,367
for you to be this upset?

53
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:32,545
Did he find true love
instead of a fling this time around?

54
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:35,300
I'm going to kill him.

55
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,310
That'd be a waste.
You've put up with him for so long.

56
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:46,197
Mother.

57
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:48,493
Mom.

58
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:54,004
Did he hit you?

59
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:55,758
Did he?

60
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:05,820
I think it was your father.

61
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:10,036
I think he was behind it.

62
00:05:10,996 --> 00:05:12,165
What did he do?

63
00:05:14,754 --> 00:05:16,800
I wanted to divorce him…

64
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:17,885
Mom.

65
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:21,685
…and I was gathering proof.

66
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:29,951
I'm sorry. It's difficult to get
a good photo due to the tight security.

67
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:33,332
I wanted him to be flustered

68
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,796
and put him in a predicament for once.

69
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,633
It'd never be public though…

70
00:05:39,888 --> 00:05:41,516
since I'd be humiliated as well.

71
00:05:42,977 --> 00:05:45,148
But that man

72
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:48,614
never ceased to be brazen.

73
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,122
And that's what you saw on his phone?

74
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:55,460
When did you first see "TATP"?

75
00:05:56,295 --> 00:05:58,341
Was it before or after the attack?

76
00:05:58,424 --> 00:05:59,636
I can't remember.

77
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:01,305
Are you sure it was TATP?

78
00:06:01,388 --> 00:06:03,810
You are one crazy woman!

79
00:06:03,894 --> 00:06:05,856
How could you say that to me?

80
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,860
I get that you're shocked, but still.

81
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:10,365
How could you accuse me
of trying to kill your father?

82
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:14,414
I saw it. You can't fool me.

83
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:17,546
That's exactly why you're crazy.

84
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:19,466
Yes, I did look it up.

85
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,684
The media was talking about how
the explosives were made with TATP,

86
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:25,144
so I was curious.

87
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:27,357
My father-in-law was injured.

88
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,860
Should I not have cared

89
00:06:28,944 --> 00:06:31,407
about the explosives that hurt him?

90
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,791
You've always looked down on me.
Do you think I didn't check the date?

91
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:40,425
It happened before the attack.
Before my father was injured!

92
00:06:41,553 --> 00:06:46,353
Were you able to foresee the future?
Is that why you looked it up beforehand?

93
00:06:46,437 --> 00:06:47,648
Who looked down on you?

94
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:50,111
You're my wife. Why would I do that?

95
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:51,865
But you do!

96
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,121
You have no respect for me.

97
00:06:55,204 --> 00:06:58,920
That's why you never bothered
to hide your many affairs.

98
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:01,258
Hey, what chairman doesn't have affairs?

99
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:05,266
And none of the wives claim
that they're looked down on.

100
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:09,191
You're only insecure because you think
you deserve special treatment.

101
00:07:09,274 --> 00:07:11,195
Don't try to change the subject.

102
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:15,369
It was you.
You were behind the terrorist attack!

103
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:16,998
Exactly when was it?

104
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:20,547
Give me the exact date
you looked through my phone.

105
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:22,885
Give me proof.

106
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:24,221
I saw it!

107
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:26,100
Proof!

108
00:07:26,183 --> 00:07:31,068
He said that I had
gotten the dates wrong due to the shock.

109
00:07:32,112 --> 00:07:35,869
The more I listened to him,

110
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:38,332
the more he convinced me.

111
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:44,720
Now, I don't know
if I looked through his phone

112
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:49,229
before or after the terrorist attack.

113
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:15,574
Do you often check other people's phones?

114
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:20,082
No, I told you.
I was going to file for divorce.

115
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,504
So you did that even after the attack?

116
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:27,305
Your father had lost his legs,
but you were still

117
00:08:27,388 --> 00:08:28,725
gathering evidence for your divorce?

118
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,810
I--

119
00:08:34,444 --> 00:08:36,574
It's more convenient
to distort your memory.

120
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:39,454
If you checked his phone after the attack,

121
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:43,045
that means your ex-husband
didn't target your father

122
00:08:43,128 --> 00:08:45,091
and you didn't cover up for the culprit.

123
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:51,813
It was for your son.

124
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,610
You didn't want your son…

125
00:08:54,694 --> 00:08:55,737
You're busy.

126
00:08:55,821 --> 00:08:59,327
…to have a father
who took dozens of lives.

127
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:02,710
Did that make you feel better?

128
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:07,385
Will everything be okay
if I put this behind me?

129
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:19,117
TATP is often used for terrorist attacks.

130
00:09:19,744 --> 00:09:23,960
But most people
have never heard the term before,

131
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,633
except for two types of people.

132
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:31,058
Those who suppress terrorism
and those who cause it.

133
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:35,776
And you already know which side…

134
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,907
the chairman took.

135
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,962
Before.

136
00:09:47,256 --> 00:09:48,258
It was before

137
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:51,306
the terrorist attack.

138
00:10:16,273 --> 00:10:17,693
Are you almost here?

139
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:20,699
Where are you?

140
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:30,384
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:34,518
We should move on.

142
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:37,733
I'd like to meet Chairman Seonu's ex-wife.

143
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:40,864
Were you really…

144
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:44,162
So, you knew everything.

145
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:54,683
Father!

146
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,541
My son didn't cover up his father's sins.

147
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,878
He just refused to believe me.

148
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:13,428
You told him about what you saw
on his father's phone, didn't you?

149
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:16,853
But he didn't believe me.

150
00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:19,775
It's only natural since it was his father.

151
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:23,198
So Jae is innocent.

152
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:40,024
BLOOD FREE

153
00:12:02,151 --> 00:12:03,153
Who are you?

154
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:06,702
Hello, I'm…

155
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:12,881
My name is On San. I'm from BF.

156
00:12:15,804 --> 00:12:16,973
I'm sorry, but…

157
00:12:18,183 --> 00:12:21,064
What more do you want from us?
Should I jump off a building too?

158
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:24,195
Get lost.

159
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:36,344
I'm sorry. Please excuse me, but--

160
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:38,223
Even animals have a conscience.

161
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:42,273
You didn't even come when my brother died.
I'm going to call the police.

162
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:48,786
I did visit the funeral hall.

163
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,124
I'm not trying to pat myself on the back.

164
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:53,504
That's when I saw you.

165
00:12:54,464 --> 00:12:56,301
That's why I'm here.

166
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:03,106
One of our employees died.
He was murdered.

167
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:08,659
Uh, and we believe his killer knows you.

168
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:12,793
So what? Are you accusing me of murder?

169
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,045
No, that's not what I mean.

170
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:18,136
Do you perhaps know
a woman named Jeong Haedeun?

171
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,729
Here. Simply put, she was an accomplice.

172
00:13:22,813 --> 00:13:24,608
And I think she knows you.

173
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,490
Unbelievable.
Are you seriously accusing me?

174
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:32,916
We definitely don't think
you had anything to do with it.

175
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:35,170
Hold on. Then-- Here.

176
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,511
Do you recognize this man?

177
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,974
-They were both in on it.
-What?

178
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,395
You know him, don't you?

179
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,656
How does a BF employee know our pastor?

180
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:49,867
Pastor?

181
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:54,333
I see. So, that was his cover.

182
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,837
What do you mean?

183
00:13:56,421 --> 00:13:58,300
Can you reach him?

184
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,437
What do you mean, it was a cover?

185
00:14:05,355 --> 00:14:06,859
Because he's a murderer.

186
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:09,823
What nonsense is this?

187
00:14:09,907 --> 00:14:12,787
Can you reach him? I'm sure you couldn't
for the past two days.

188
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:16,419
Maybe he's busy.

189
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:18,214
He killed a man and fled.

190
00:14:18,716 --> 00:14:20,803
Ma'am, where does he live?

191
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:39,800
EULJUNG POLICE STATION
KIM DONGJIN

192
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:42,889
MYEONGSEON HOSPITAL

193
00:14:50,195 --> 00:14:51,197
Mother.

194
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:53,828
Hey, Jae.

195
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:54,913
How is he?

196
00:14:57,585 --> 00:14:59,338
I heard he was hospitalized last night.

197
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,054
Yes, he woke up later in the night.

198
00:15:04,056 --> 00:15:06,603
You should've called me
instead of dealing with this alone.

199
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:13,324
He doesn't know that you knew-- No.

200
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:17,709
He doesn't know that I told you.

201
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,005
And let's keep it that way.

202
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:39,920
How are you feeling?

203
00:15:40,963 --> 00:15:42,424
Did you eat?

204
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,263
You need to eat to recover.

205
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:55,743
Captain Woo.

206
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,837
-Should I call him?
-Yes.

207
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,537
What is that?

208
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:19,415
Painkillers.

209
00:16:26,345 --> 00:16:28,893
He suffered
from severe back pain all night.

210
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:31,105
Thank you.

211
00:16:37,827 --> 00:16:39,956
Right. Are you not busy?

212
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,543
I have some spare time.

213
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:56,197
Grandfather.

214
00:16:58,034 --> 00:16:59,036
Grandfather.

215
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,131
Why did you want to see Captain Woo?

216
00:17:06,342 --> 00:17:07,553
Is he here?

217
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:10,935
Bring him.

218
00:17:17,907 --> 00:17:18,909
Grandfather.

219
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:22,374
You have something to tell him, don't you?

220
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:26,675
-Forget it.
-I'll relay your message.

221
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:30,265
Forget it. Just…

222
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:39,826
Just sweep it under the rug, Captain Woo.

223
00:17:42,122 --> 00:17:44,043
To live is to suffer.

224
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,552
You should find peace too.

225
00:17:50,055 --> 00:17:54,814
The more you uncover,
the filthier it gets.

226
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:59,281
So just lay it all down.

227
00:18:01,035 --> 00:18:02,705
Don't you want revenge?

228
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:06,505
You finally found out who was behind it.

229
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:14,353
How would that boy feel

230
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:18,277
if he found out it was his father's doing?

231
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,912
Your grandson?

232
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,711
It must've been eating away

233
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:30,761
at his mother too.

234
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:38,777
I'll find peace once I die.

235
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:41,700
No.

236
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:45,624
You must take back what you deserve.

237
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,254
It was your lifelong goal,

238
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:50,926
but you had to step down
just because of your legs.

239
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,097
Not a single politician defended you.

240
00:18:53,181 --> 00:18:54,601
And you founded that party.

241
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:56,688
Grandfather.

242
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,694
Grandfather.

243
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:34,346
I'm sorry.

244
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,750
Are you leaving?

245
00:19:57,894 --> 00:19:58,895
Okay.

246
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:02,068
I'm afraid you can't visit him today.

247
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:05,366
Has it been restricted? By whom?

248
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,832
No one restricted it.
The inmate refuses to see you.

249
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:14,384
In that case…

250
00:20:22,317 --> 00:20:25,323
…could you give this to him?

251
00:20:45,864 --> 00:20:47,868
You were a victim too.

252
00:20:47,952 --> 00:20:51,710
You only learned of the terrorist attack
after the explosion occurred.

253
00:21:01,813 --> 00:21:03,190
No!

254
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:05,738
You only realized
after returning home that night

255
00:21:06,906 --> 00:21:08,325
that your family was in danger.

256
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:10,748
-Hands up!
-I'm the terrorist!

257
00:21:11,457 --> 00:21:13,837
You returned to the base before midnight

258
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,008
and turned yourself in.

259
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:18,805
"I'm the terrorist."

260
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:36,256
No, no, please don't. N-Not my fam--

261
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,676
I'm the terrorist!

262
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,348
"I'm the terrorist."

263
00:21:40,431 --> 00:21:41,810
"I'm proud of it."

264
00:21:41,893 --> 00:21:43,145
Please don't.

265
00:21:44,356 --> 00:21:46,276
You said you were proud.

266
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,030
No!

267
00:21:48,114 --> 00:21:52,080
You forced yourself to
say that even though you were terrified.

268
00:21:54,376 --> 00:21:57,465
The terrorists already knew
that the president was visiting.

269
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:02,225
And they targeted you
since you had access to the base.

270
00:22:03,185 --> 00:22:04,605
Was it someone you already knew?

271
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,322
A villager, perhaps?

272
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:16,880
That note.

273
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:20,804
You said you knew
who I should be afraid of.

274
00:22:22,098 --> 00:22:23,309
You don't, do you?

275
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:26,566
Why would you think I don't?

276
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:28,904
Because I think
the terrorist was a villager?

277
00:22:30,031 --> 00:22:31,784
But they're not the mastermind.

278
00:22:33,162 --> 00:22:34,790
Even you don't know

279
00:22:34,874 --> 00:22:37,504
who was behind it.

280
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,102
They wouldn't have revealed it
to a mere scapegoat.

281
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:49,987
Seonu Geun.

282
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,118
DORSON Group's owner.

283
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,838
You must know something about him,

284
00:22:58,922 --> 00:23:00,717
even if it's the first time
you've heard his name.

285
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:05,309
A lead that points to him or something
you overheard or witnessed. Anything.

286
00:23:08,107 --> 00:23:12,490
What if I could protect your family?

287
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:14,286
What if I could guarantee their safety?

288
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,668
Will you talk then?

289
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:27,186
My gut feelings tell me
this is our last chance.

290
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,692
You'll be behind bars forever,

291
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,529
and I'll be in my own prison.

292
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:45,264
He told me

293
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:49,230
to be even more tight-lipped
when I went to Korea.

294
00:23:49,314 --> 00:23:51,109
He said I couldn't break free from him.

295
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:53,615
"Him"?

296
00:23:56,286 --> 00:23:57,790
It was my cousin.

297
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:02,006
I accidentally told him
one time where our barracks were.

298
00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:05,639
It was over some drinks.

299
00:24:06,223 --> 00:24:07,350
He's my cousin, after all.

300
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,231
I told him where the barracks were.

301
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:13,362
The command center's location?

302
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:16,284
He said I wasn't safe in Korea either.

303
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:19,875
He said the most powerful individual
in Korea was behind it.

304
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:24,384
And that he was the wealthiest.

305
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,681
If I did as I was told,

306
00:24:27,181 --> 00:24:30,730
both my family and his
would live comfortably forever.

307
00:24:31,314 --> 00:24:32,901
So your cousin told you

308
00:24:32,985 --> 00:24:37,160
that the mastermind was Korean
and forced you to take all the blame?

309
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:50,896
I recorded our entire conversation.

310
00:24:50,979 --> 00:24:52,190
Do you understand?

311
00:24:55,947 --> 00:25:00,331
But I won't use this until you let me.

312
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:08,890
We'll meet again very soon.

313
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,574
VISITATION ROOM

314
00:25:34,984 --> 00:25:36,027
Hey.

315
00:25:36,111 --> 00:25:37,113
Hey.

316
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:41,956
Hey, wake up. You're not here to nap.

317
00:25:46,256 --> 00:25:47,341
Ms. Jeong.

318
00:25:59,032 --> 00:26:01,119
She has a pulse, but she's not breathing.

319
00:26:01,662 --> 00:26:03,916
Maybe she's faking it.

320
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,254
Yeongsil,
when did Jeong Haedeun stop breathing?

321
00:26:06,338 --> 00:26:09,469
It's been four minutes
and sixteen seconds since her last breath.

322
00:26:09,553 --> 00:26:10,847
Release her.

323
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:16,066
Jang Yeongsil, release her!

324
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,199
Jang Yeongsil, show me her vital signs!

325
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,129
Don't move. No!

326
00:26:29,551 --> 00:26:31,931
Don't come near. Don't follow me!

327
00:26:32,014 --> 00:26:34,603
I'll kill her. Don't follow me.

328
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:35,688
Don't follow me,

329
00:26:35,772 --> 00:26:37,859
or I'll fucking kill her!

330
00:26:38,653 --> 00:26:40,489
-You can't leave!
-That's bullshit.

331
00:26:40,573 --> 00:26:42,703
-The doors are all locked!
-Is that so?

332
00:26:42,786 --> 00:26:46,418
I'll just fucking kill her, then! Hey!

333
00:26:47,294 --> 00:26:49,173
You should know.

334
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:52,221
As a doctor, you know what'll happen
if I stab you here!

335
00:26:52,304 --> 00:26:54,016
Hey, open the door.

336
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,066
Do you think I won't do it?
Open the goddamn door!

337
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,864
Jang Yeongsil, open the security area.

338
00:27:11,635 --> 00:27:14,140
Open the door. Hurry up!

339
00:27:14,223 --> 00:27:15,392
Jang Yeongsil, open the door.

340
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:26,665
Step on it. Fucking step on it.

341
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:30,590
No! Stop!

342
00:27:30,673 --> 00:27:33,011
Stop! No, stop!

343
00:27:33,094 --> 00:27:34,472
Stop!

344
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:38,564
Jang Yeongsil! Lock the main gate!

345
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,753
Come with me.

346
00:27:53,301 --> 00:27:54,303
Wait here.

347
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,337
I'm in front of BF's Seoul office.

348
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:13,926
Reporters are here to question Ms. Yun

349
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,767
-regarding yesterday's announcement…
-BF hasn't made additional announcements.

350
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:20,439
They seem to have
fully explained their standpoint.

351
00:28:20,523 --> 00:28:22,986
-We believe…
-Her transplant surgery has

352
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:25,908
-set BF's open price at an all-time low.
-…Ms. Yun will soon start the experiment.

353
00:28:25,992 --> 00:28:28,748
People have high hopes
for the organ-transplant industry,

354
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:31,962
-which is deemed priceless.
-BF is a one-person company.

355
00:28:32,046 --> 00:28:34,760
On San, the research director
and second-in-command,

356
00:28:34,843 --> 00:28:37,348
has remained under the radar
unlike Ms. Yun.

357
00:28:37,431 --> 00:28:39,226
The transplant surgery won't happen.

358
00:28:39,728 --> 00:28:40,938
Who are you?

359
00:28:41,732 --> 00:28:43,736
I'm On San, the research director of BF.

360
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:45,280
-On San?
-The director?

361
00:28:45,364 --> 00:28:46,867
He's the director!

362
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,163
Please say something!

363
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:51,501
Will Yun go through
with this experiment?

364
00:28:51,585 --> 00:28:53,673
Why would she go that far?

365
00:28:53,756 --> 00:28:57,137
BF will not carry out Ms. Yun's surgery.

366
00:28:57,221 --> 00:28:58,808
So the announcement was a lie?

367
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:01,563
-Why the change of heart?
-Did you succeed in culturing organs?

368
00:29:01,647 --> 00:29:04,360
Yes, everything she announced is true.

369
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:07,742
BF has successfully cultured human organs.

370
00:29:07,826 --> 00:29:11,290
And we're currently running
top-notch AI technology that will aid

371
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:14,296
in the accuracy
and success rate of transplants.

372
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,846
Ms. Yun only volunteered
to be the first subject

373
00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:20,977
to save those who are terminally ill.

374
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,818
As for me,

375
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:28,701
I fully understand why
she made that decision.

376
00:29:28,784 --> 00:29:32,959
But I can't allow that
as her longtime friend and doctor.

377
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:36,466
Does that mean she made that
decision without consulting her staff?

378
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,598
No, that's not what I'm getting at.

379
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:41,810
I'm only against this experiment

380
00:29:41,894 --> 00:29:44,190
because I want to continue
working with her.

381
00:29:45,192 --> 00:29:47,781
Ever since she was 20 years old,
she has strived

382
00:29:47,864 --> 00:29:52,372
to create a world where humans
don't need to consume living creatures.

383
00:29:52,456 --> 00:29:55,546
And as a result, she made cultured meat.

384
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:59,136
As a scientist, I look forward to seeing

385
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,934
what other achievements she's capable of.

386
00:30:02,017 --> 00:30:05,232
She is an important figure
to our humanity and BF.

387
00:30:05,315 --> 00:30:07,236
That's why the experiment won't happen.

388
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:09,323
We won't do it.

389
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:20,680
MS. YUN: MISSED CALL

390
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:30,115
Tell them you're hiring
a new research director.

391
00:30:31,492 --> 00:30:32,912
You're trying to beat me to it.

392
00:30:32,996 --> 00:30:36,920
Tell them you fired me for not listening
and that the surgery will be postponed.

393
00:30:38,757 --> 00:30:40,928
I know why you're saying that.

394
00:30:41,012 --> 00:30:43,642
Making an empty promise
is better than risking your life.

395
00:30:45,813 --> 00:30:47,482
I guess I did something meaningful,

396
00:30:47,567 --> 00:30:50,238
seeing how you took action
when you always keep a low profile.

397
00:30:50,322 --> 00:30:51,825
I wasn't trying to take action.

398
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:53,411
I found out who the killer is.

399
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:55,498
The one who killed Hoseung?

400
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:58,129
His name is Ji Sunwon. He's 39.

401
00:30:58,212 --> 00:31:00,342
The police ran his fingerprints and--

402
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,469
And?

403
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:04,768
We even found his ID,
but it's a different face.

404
00:31:04,851 --> 00:31:06,563
Ms. Yun.

405
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:08,692
Jang Yeongsil, open the door.

406
00:31:08,776 --> 00:31:09,778
Yes, ma'am.

407
00:31:09,861 --> 00:31:12,825
He could've altered his face
but not his fingerprints.

408
00:31:13,786 --> 00:31:15,665
Where did you get his fingerprints?

409
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,129
Professor Kim wasn't the only one
who was brainwashed by him.

410
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:20,841
The man who landed on your car.

411
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:23,722
He approached him as a pastor.

412
00:31:23,806 --> 00:31:27,396
He won that man over
just like he did with Professor Kim.

413
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:30,110
Apparently, he said repeatedly
after winning the farmer's heart,

414
00:31:30,611 --> 00:31:32,280
"The government is hopeless.

415
00:31:32,364 --> 00:31:35,412
It's up to the farmers to stop Yun Jayu."

416
00:31:35,495 --> 00:31:38,752
"There's nothing I can do as a pastor,
so who will stop her?"

417
00:31:40,589 --> 00:31:41,800
That man pushed the farmer.

418
00:31:41,883 --> 00:31:44,764
The one who killed
Hoseung and Professor Kim.

419
00:31:47,436 --> 00:31:48,731
And DORSON was behind it.

420
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,820
Those bastards.

421
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:55,201
As well as AZORAN.

422
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,544
Seonu Geun organized the terrorist attack.

423
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:06,015
You impudent bastard!

424
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:10,524
What if they identify
and catch the guy first?

425
00:32:11,985 --> 00:32:15,576
BF identified him when you couldn't,

426
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:18,039
which you wouldn't have known either
had the police not told me.

427
00:32:18,122 --> 00:32:19,333
Still, you threw me under the bus!

428
00:32:20,586 --> 00:32:23,007
It was just an example.

429
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:27,809
The main point is that I had to check
the hotel's CCTV footage

430
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:30,230
to find out where that guy went
after leaving the building.

431
00:32:30,313 --> 00:32:32,735
So I needed a reason.

432
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:35,908
You have the final say.
Tell the police to get the footage.

433
00:32:36,618 --> 00:32:37,954
Should I do that instead then?

434
00:32:38,037 --> 00:32:39,624
"My father and I already know

435
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:43,089
what room in which hotel the killer
who murdered BF's bodyguard stayed in,

436
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:45,594
so please show us the footage."
Should I say that?

437
00:32:45,678 --> 00:32:48,432
How can they possibly disobey me?
Why must I ask for the footage

438
00:32:48,517 --> 00:32:50,896
on the pretext of finding out
if the cameras recorded my affair?

439
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,192
If you're not up for it,
then you're on your own.

440
00:32:54,153 --> 00:32:57,075
You should've already known
exactly what time and where

441
00:32:57,159 --> 00:32:59,831
that killer fled to
even before I asked you.

442
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:03,296
Does the prime minister want revenge?

443
00:33:04,298 --> 00:33:07,889
Did he need to make sure
before avenging his maternal grandfather

444
00:33:07,972 --> 00:33:09,349
since it was his father?

445
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:11,020
Is that why he kept an eye on me?

446
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:13,316
To see if I found any more proof?

447
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:16,781
If it turns out
that Seonu Geun is indeed guilty,

448
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:18,702
I will expose him at all costs.

449
00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:24,046
What if he tries
to kill you off for doing that?

450
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:28,931
Then he would've been long gone,
and it would be just us two here.

451
00:33:29,014 --> 00:33:31,853
The prime minister didn't stop me
from visiting the penitentiary.

452
00:33:32,354 --> 00:33:34,609
He knew I had spoken with his mother,

453
00:33:34,692 --> 00:33:38,074
so he would've had a good idea
where I'd be headed next.

454
00:33:39,827 --> 00:33:41,205
What bothers me the most is…

455
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:44,086
My son didn't put you up to this, did he?

456
00:33:45,673 --> 00:33:46,800
You can check with him.

457
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:52,352
She would've kept her mouth shut
had her son interfered.

458
00:33:52,435 --> 00:33:54,064
So why didn't he stop her?

459
00:33:54,147 --> 00:33:55,985
We may not be in the same boat,

460
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:59,575
but they must've also wanted
to know who was behind it.

461
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:05,253
That would make the most sense
as to why she opened up to you.

462
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:09,386
He looked up the explosive material
prior to the attack.

463
00:34:10,013 --> 00:34:12,475
That fact would put him
at a great disadvantage in court.

464
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:17,027
Seonu Jae isn't the type
to share information.

465
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,864
But did he even share anything?

466
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,287
He's not trying to frame someone.

467
00:34:24,082 --> 00:34:28,842
It feels like he wants the world to know
who the real terrorist is.

468
00:34:29,927 --> 00:34:32,600
How would he benefit
from revealing that it's his father?

469
00:34:32,683 --> 00:34:33,852
What about Jeong Haedeun?

470
00:34:35,021 --> 00:34:36,023
What did she say?

471
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,737
Why is she being quiet
at a time like this?

472
00:34:39,404 --> 00:34:40,741
She doesn't know everything.

473
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,969
It's unlike you to take someone's side.

474
00:34:51,053 --> 00:34:52,138
I'm not taking her side.

475
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:56,230
I'll take care of my people,
so focus on stopping that crazy woman.

476
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,029
She promised to operate on patients
pro bono after her surgery,

477
00:35:00,113 --> 00:35:01,281
but that would only be a few hundred.

478
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:05,666
If she succeeds,
she'll be opening an entirely new market.

479
00:35:05,749 --> 00:35:09,423
Even I can't predict
how much in demand it'll be.

480
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,343
It will change
the entire business industry.

481
00:35:11,427 --> 00:35:14,851
Can you imagine BF surpassing DORSON?

482
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:23,117
Is DORSON in a state
where you should be worried about that?

483
00:35:24,704 --> 00:35:27,041
It's not just about
the organ transplant business's growth.

484
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,555
Do you think people
will switch their worn-out cars

485
00:35:33,638 --> 00:35:35,391
or their aging organs first?

486
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:39,065
Nothing will come before new organs.

487
00:35:42,447 --> 00:35:43,700
What if…

488
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:47,123
…I brought you some samples?

489
00:35:50,547 --> 00:35:52,425
Then can DORSON make them too?

490
00:35:55,056 --> 00:35:58,688
What if I brought you all sorts

491
00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:02,070
of BF's cultured organs?

492
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:08,959
The only way to do that is to bring Jayu.

493
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:12,382
She said she'd replace all her organs.

494
00:36:12,465 --> 00:36:13,885
So if you brought her,

495
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:16,891
we'd have our hands on all the organs.

496
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,562
Is that your plan?

497
00:36:19,104 --> 00:36:20,691
If I do bring them…

498
00:36:25,534 --> 00:36:27,830
…will DORSON be able to make them too?

499
00:36:31,378 --> 00:36:32,422
We must.

500
00:36:33,382 --> 00:36:36,598
Those items will never get old.

501
00:36:45,281 --> 00:36:48,872
When was it decided that
you'd accompany Lee Mungyu on his trip?

502
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:53,047
About one week prior.

503
00:36:53,673 --> 00:36:54,717
That short of a notice?

504
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,347
When did Seonu Geun's ex-wife
look through his phone?

505
00:36:58,098 --> 00:37:02,524
She said it was
about two months before the trip.

506
00:37:03,818 --> 00:37:05,321
So, it happened before I was chosen.

507
00:37:05,906 --> 00:37:09,747
The Blue House suddenly invited me,
so I looked into it.

508
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:12,753
They were originally going
to take Chairman Kim Dongsik of Taeseong.

509
00:37:13,797 --> 00:37:16,552
-Who changed the plans?
-I wonder who it was.

510
00:37:16,636 --> 00:37:19,558
Apparently, he had found
a lump in his body.

511
00:37:21,646 --> 00:37:23,399
Could it have been DORSON again?

512
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:25,821
-I doubt it.
-Then why?

513
00:37:26,864 --> 00:37:28,492
It'd be a relief

514
00:37:29,537 --> 00:37:32,166
if the terrorist attack
wasn't targeted at you.

515
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,131
Why would Seonu Geun harm
his father-in-law

516
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:36,425
when it'd do him no good?

517
00:37:38,763 --> 00:37:40,642
That's not for us to find out.

518
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:42,855
We just need to find the connection.

519
00:37:43,523 --> 00:37:45,192
What happened at AZORAN was a massacre.

520
00:37:45,276 --> 00:37:47,196
And Hoseung was killed too.

521
00:37:47,948 --> 00:37:50,871
It's worth the fight if we can prove
that DORSON was behind it all.

522
00:37:51,748 --> 00:37:54,210
I can finally subdue Seonu Geun.

523
00:37:54,294 --> 00:37:58,887
The problem is that only we know
that DORSON is involved.

524
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,811
Mr. On, we need to prove
that DORSON planted Ms. Jeong here.

525
00:38:02,895 --> 00:38:05,984
We also need to prove
that Seonu Jae ordered her

526
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:08,615
to help Mr. Woo get hired.
And one more thing.

527
00:38:08,698 --> 00:38:10,744
We need proof
that it was Seonu Geun or his son

528
00:38:10,827 --> 00:38:12,790
who tipped off the killer
and helped him run away.

529
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:16,296
Make sure she provides this connection.

530
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:20,806
Seonu Geun's wife only lied out of spite,

531
00:38:20,889 --> 00:38:23,686
and Kir also lied about what he did.

532
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:26,901
-We must prove this isn't true--
-Hold on.

533
00:38:27,694 --> 00:38:29,782
Ms. Jeong was in a car crash.

534
00:38:30,366 --> 00:38:32,245
-But she was tied up--
-What do you mean?

535
00:38:33,706 --> 00:38:36,378
She tried to run away?
How did she free herself?

536
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:39,885
Okay. I'm on my way.

537
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:42,683
She hit the main gate
and is now hospitalized.

538
00:38:42,766 --> 00:38:43,768
How is she?

539
00:38:43,852 --> 00:38:46,148
They don't know yet. I'll call you.

540
00:38:59,884 --> 00:39:01,596
How much coffee have you had today?

541
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:02,764
Five cups.

542
00:39:05,812 --> 00:39:08,192
Kir's cousin was the one
who told him to take the fall

543
00:39:08,776 --> 00:39:12,241
and mentioned that the most powerful
and wealthiest Korean was behind it.

544
00:39:14,914 --> 00:39:16,416
We must find the cousin.

545
00:39:22,888 --> 00:39:26,812
We must track his flow of money.
But the problem is that

546
00:39:26,896 --> 00:39:29,735
this could all be
part of the prime minister's plan.

547
00:39:33,576 --> 00:39:36,289
We'll only know once we make our move.

548
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,628
Where is his cousin?

549
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:41,299
In Dubai with his family.

550
00:39:41,383 --> 00:39:44,556
Go get him. I'll inform the Dubai office.

551
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:51,027
I'll do that
as long as you keep one promise.

552
00:39:51,111 --> 00:39:54,325
Don't worry. I'll take care of Mansik.

553
00:39:54,409 --> 00:39:56,162
Please don't get the surgery

554
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:58,543
until I return.

555
00:40:04,387 --> 00:40:06,182
It'll take some time anyway.

556
00:40:06,266 --> 00:40:08,855
I'm in no hurry whatsoever.

557
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:11,484
-The medical team must prepare--
-I need your word.

558
00:40:15,535 --> 00:40:16,620
Go get ready.

559
00:40:16,704 --> 00:40:19,459
I'll tell them
to book the earliest flight.

560
00:40:28,352 --> 00:40:29,353
I give you my word.

561
00:40:31,441 --> 00:40:33,696
I'll wait until you come back.

562
00:41:03,923 --> 00:41:06,762
I didn't want them to know
that another incident happened at BF,

563
00:41:06,846 --> 00:41:09,560
so I told them it seemed like
a sudden unintended acceleration.

564
00:41:10,227 --> 00:41:12,148
I didn't mention BF at all.

565
00:41:12,732 --> 00:41:16,782
But I'd have to tell the police the truth.

566
00:41:17,366 --> 00:41:19,412
How about Ms. Hong? Is she okay?

567
00:41:20,707 --> 00:41:22,836
Yes. She was going to come here with me.

568
00:41:22,919 --> 00:41:24,965
But she said
the doctor would be suspicious

569
00:41:25,048 --> 00:41:27,303
once he saw her injury.

570
00:41:27,386 --> 00:41:29,975
So she chose not to come.

571
00:41:30,685 --> 00:41:33,733
I wasn't even gone for that long.

572
00:41:33,816 --> 00:41:35,862
How can I trust you with anything?

573
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:39,076
I'm sorry.

574
00:41:40,037 --> 00:41:44,505
I had no idea she had a weapon.

575
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:47,176
She had carved some plastic.

576
00:41:47,259 --> 00:41:49,430
Jeong Haedeun, that idiot.

577
00:41:50,015 --> 00:41:51,017
Plastic?

578
00:41:51,602 --> 00:41:53,480
Yes, a plastic spoon.

579
00:41:54,232 --> 00:41:56,236
When did she get her hands
on such a thing?

580
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,783
Mr. On, I…

581
00:42:01,287 --> 00:42:04,001
The doctor is more concerned

582
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,424
about her psychological injuries
than the physical ones.

583
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:13,478
Mr. On.

584
00:42:14,355 --> 00:42:19,448
Ms. Yun is already stressed as it is,
so could you let her down gently?

585
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,248
Sure. I'll do that.

586
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:26,212
Thank you.

587
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,694
Haedeun hasn't been home?

588
00:42:38,278 --> 00:42:39,656
Not even for a bit?

589
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,704
Keep watching.

590
00:42:45,752 --> 00:42:47,839
Did she run away?

591
00:42:49,216 --> 00:42:50,469
Or did she get caught?

592
00:43:40,528 --> 00:43:43,534
PUNISH YUN JAYU, THE MURDERER!

593
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,269
WOO CHAEWOON:
I'M LEAVING NOW

594
00:44:18,854 --> 00:44:20,566
Yeongsil, read the text.

595
00:44:21,944 --> 00:44:23,238
"I'm leaving now."

596
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:36,807
I'M LEAVING NOW

597
00:44:43,278 --> 00:44:45,156
SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT
BY YUN JAYU CAUSES A STIR

598
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,996
RESEARCH DIRECTOR STATES BF HAS
SUCCEEDED IN CULTURING ORGANS

599
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:52,296
PETITION TO PUNISH BF FOR
MOCKING INCURABLE PATIENTS

600
00:45:01,147 --> 00:45:04,236
Today, we're holding our first meeting
about the supplementary budget.

601
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,617
But none of you have commented on that.

602
00:45:07,451 --> 00:45:10,248
Here is my answer to your question.
Hmm--

603
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:14,340
I'm relieved that we could save
someone as precious as Ms. Yun.

604
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:17,555
Furthermore, I don't know
if the research director acted on his own

605
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:21,270
or if he had talked it through
with Ms. Yun.

606
00:45:21,354 --> 00:45:24,986
But I respect his decision
not to go through with something

607
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:28,702
that could greatly impact society.

608
00:45:28,786 --> 00:45:31,792
However, irrespective of their decision
regarding the surgery,

609
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:35,675
BF underwent an illegal project…

610
00:45:35,758 --> 00:45:38,179
-That's rich coming from you.
- …and must be investigated

611
00:45:38,262 --> 00:45:39,431
by the prosecution--

612
00:45:40,183 --> 00:45:42,062
You're much worse than I am.

613
00:45:42,772 --> 00:45:44,316
I have the right to order a search

614
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,445
and seizure for the illegal acts
committed by BF.

615
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:49,076
I'll confiscate all evidence
and related technology.

616
00:45:50,913 --> 00:45:54,128
Please don't get the surgery
until I return.

617
00:46:02,018 --> 00:46:03,564
Tell the PR manager to see me.

618
00:46:05,526 --> 00:46:07,112
Please give me your word.

619
00:46:11,621 --> 00:46:12,915
MR. SEO

620
00:46:14,209 --> 00:46:15,588
I'll be back.

621
00:46:15,671 --> 00:46:16,757
Okay.

622
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,888
We don't need to worry anymore.

623
00:46:19,971 --> 00:46:22,267
Ms. Yun made an announcement

624
00:46:23,771 --> 00:46:26,358
that she wants the best
organ-transplant doctors in the country.

625
00:46:26,442 --> 00:46:28,196
KIM JAEHWA
LEE DOYEONG

626
00:46:28,279 --> 00:46:30,158
Seeing how she mentioned
the exact number of doctors,

627
00:46:30,241 --> 00:46:32,120
she must've had this plan in place
for a long time.

628
00:46:32,204 --> 00:46:35,628
But the problem is this surgery has
created a heated debate among doctors.

629
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:37,130
HONG GISEON

630
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:39,969
The most notable doctors
are tenured professors.

631
00:46:40,053 --> 00:46:42,600
So who will risk the criticism
and agree to help?

632
00:46:43,184 --> 00:46:45,731
This will affect their social
and professional status if they fail.

633
00:46:45,815 --> 00:46:48,027
It'll be an absolute humiliation.

634
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:50,365
But if they succeed?

635
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,916
In that case,
they'll deserve the Nobel Prize.

636
00:46:54,999 --> 00:46:56,460
Still, who knew

637
00:46:56,545 --> 00:46:59,216
the Transplantation Society President
would come?

638
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:00,426
PARK SINYEONG

639
00:47:00,511 --> 00:47:03,600
Why don't you try to dissuade her?

640
00:47:03,684 --> 00:47:07,315
How would I do that?
She would never listen to me.

641
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:12,242
So will you just sit and watch?
Will you let her go through with it?

642
00:47:12,325 --> 00:47:15,123
Everything will be fine if we succeed.

643
00:47:15,206 --> 00:47:16,208
What?

644
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:19,507
This would be the best thing ever
if it turns out to be a success.

645
00:47:19,591 --> 00:47:23,389
It'll be a new achievement,
and we'll gain respect. I mean, what if?

646
00:47:23,472 --> 00:47:27,105
What if one of us got into an accident?
We would've done this anyway.

647
00:47:27,189 --> 00:47:29,109
That's a what-if.

648
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:31,363
Okay? Don't be ridiculous--

649
00:47:31,447 --> 00:47:32,909
Ms. Yun is calling for me.

650
00:47:35,998 --> 00:47:39,254
He's ecstatic about this.

651
00:47:54,661 --> 00:47:56,163
Ms. Hong escorted the doctors.

652
00:47:56,246 --> 00:47:57,917
We're ready, ma'am.

653
00:47:58,585 --> 00:47:59,921
Is Ms. Jeong still unconscious?

654
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:03,553
Yes, she hasn't woken up yet.

655
00:48:04,221 --> 00:48:08,145
But I have a hunch
that she's pretending to be asleep.

656
00:48:13,782 --> 00:48:16,370
Is there a way to fake her voice?

657
00:48:16,453 --> 00:48:19,669
By using the commands
she'd been giving to Jang Yeongsil?

658
00:48:20,796 --> 00:48:25,764
Are you asking if we can create her voice
using the data we have?

659
00:48:25,848 --> 00:48:30,481
Yes, so that she can say whatever we want.
As if she's having a conversation.

660
00:48:32,987 --> 00:48:35,199
What would you like her to say?

661
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:40,084
Goodbye.

662
00:48:44,342 --> 00:48:45,428
Goodbye.

663
00:48:49,562 --> 00:48:51,065
-Please see them out.
-Yes, sir.

664
00:48:52,233 --> 00:48:54,154
Yes, what is it?

665
00:48:56,826 --> 00:48:57,828
Who?

666
00:49:03,632 --> 00:49:04,675
He's not in Korea?

667
00:49:05,886 --> 00:49:07,055
Where is he headed?

668
00:49:13,693 --> 00:49:15,113
Okay.

669
00:49:19,747 --> 00:49:21,417
-Yes?
-We got in.

670
00:49:32,105 --> 00:49:36,029
A new firewall was put up
right away. But we did get in.

671
00:49:36,113 --> 00:49:38,242
-Did they make a move?
- No, they didn't.

672
00:49:38,325 --> 00:49:41,833
We were able to fool them
by disguising our system as theirs.

673
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,502
All right.

674
00:49:54,149 --> 00:49:55,234
Hello, sir.

675
00:49:55,318 --> 00:49:56,613
BF.

676
00:49:56,696 --> 00:49:59,577
Yes, sir. What should we do?

677
00:50:00,662 --> 00:50:04,044
Captain Woo isn't
in Korea right now. He's left for Dubai.

678
00:50:05,881 --> 00:50:07,342
Let's do a search and seizure.
