00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,121
Reach into my pocket.

10
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,372
What? Your…

11
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,041
Of your pants? Are you crazy?

12
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,292
My jacket.

Left side.

14
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,963
You better not move.

15
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,048
Do it.

16
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,594
I said left.

17
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,399
[broker] What is this?

18
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,654
Is this real?

19
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,703
His name's Kim Singu.
He arrived in Vietnam this morning.

20
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,831
He'll get a fake passport made there
if he hasn't already.

21
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,792
Just figure out
and tell me what his new identity is.

22
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,960
[scoffs]

23
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,130
Why would you ask us
to look for someone in Vietnam?

24
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,923
[sighs] You have connections there.

25
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,342
Local counterfeiters.
All brokers have them.

26
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,426
Brokers?

27
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:17,887
[sighs]

28
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,639
But this reward money…

29
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,683
This will barely cut it.

30
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,476
Don't be ridiculous.

31
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,566
You'll really give me 30 million?

32
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,277
I guess you're curious.
Get me the info and you'll find out.

33
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,450
[broker] Hey.

34
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,288
Call around.

00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,208

It's me. Let me talk to your boss.

I didn't know
you'd be working so close by.

42
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,639
I was sad thinking I wouldn't see you.
Seems like you're in greener pastures.

43
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:44,933
No, sir.

44
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,187
[Mungyu] Park Daeseong of Sanghwa Group.

45
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,695
I'm shocked those old-money chairmen

46
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,907
are finally taking photos
with new money like us.

47
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,661
It's about time they find us endearing.

[Mungyu] Han Giho of Tech Games.

-[groans]
-It was one of them.

Who are they greeting?

52
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,620
-Hello, Father.
-Mmm.

53
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,501
Are you here as my son
or the prime minister?

54
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,670
The latter, of course, Chairman Seonu.

55
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:59,173
-Is that so? It's an honor.
-[laughs]

56
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,633
Hello, sir.

57
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,220
[Giho] I heard a strange rumor
from a country down south.

58
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,765
About how your company

59
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,601
has been desperately searching
for someone.

60
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,482
And did we find them?

61
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,234
So it's true?

62
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,528
Do you have a minute?

63
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,157
Me?

64
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,742
Yes, you.

65
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:07,450
I've seen you at a few gatherings,
but never got to say hello

66
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,577
because of your entourage.

67
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,163
They're not my entourage.
They're just brownnosers.

68
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,375
Why did you want to see me?

69
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,169
To talk business of course. What else?

70
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,338
-Ms. Yun.
-Yes?

71
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,131
You're in a pickle, aren't you?

72
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,928
As you know,
there are always ups and downs.

73
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,596
Sell it to me.

74
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,393
-Sorry?
-Your company. BF.

75
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,478
How does 32 trillion won sound?

76
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,856
For the lab and cell culture technology.

77
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,275
You can keep the fashion division
and other subsidiaries.

78
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,988
Just hand over your HQ, laboratory
and the cell culture technology.

79
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,782
For 32 trillion won.

VIP WARD

81
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,895
Let me apologize to him. Please.

82
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,025
Let him in.

83
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,969
You were next to me

84
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,763
at AZORAN?

85
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,600
Yes, sir.

86
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,024
There were two officers who escorted me.

87
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:08,112
There was another officer next to me

88
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,239
besides you.

89
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,825
What happened to him?

90
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,829
He died for his country.

91
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,339
I didn't know he died.

92
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,259
No one told me.

93
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,889
We failed to protect you.

94
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,975
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

95
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,584
When did you tell those you were with
about the visit?

96
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,964
Were any of them aware of it beforehand?

97
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,842
-[Chairman Seonu] What did you say?
-[door opens]

98
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,761
Who said he could come in?

99
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,347
Who the hell let this bastard in?

100
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,559
I did. He came to apologize.

101
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,644
[breathes heavily]
Father, don't you know who he is?

102
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,855
He didn't even know
there were bombs on his own base.

103
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,692
Did you seriously go there
to encourage these idiots?

104
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,363
Where's your division commander?
Tell him to come here and kneel.

105
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,285
He's overseas looking into the attack.

106
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,245
How dare you look me in the eye?

107
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,455
[Seonu] Come on. That's enough.

108
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,001
Captain Woo, let go of him.

109
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,169
You should calm down too.

110
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,466
-He's an injured soldier.
-[panting]

111
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,928
You may be injured,
but our president is disabled now.

112
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,722
He'll never walk again because of you lot!

113
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,309
We're talking about our president!
My father-in-law!

114
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,397
[phone buzzes]

115
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,831
[Yun] Thirty-two trillion won.

116
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,417
With that money…

117
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,631
Everyone else has different perspectives
than the owner of a company.

118
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,008
They say the money you earn
belongs to the company.

119
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,718
We can't even spend it freely.

120
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,721
You should enjoy life
as a young, successful woman.

121
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,390
You should splurge and enjoy your life.

122
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,937
I've received quite a few M&A offers,

123
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,441
but I never imagined
you would make an offer.

124
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,652
So you've refused quite a few offers.

125
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,153
Up until now.

126
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,073
I'm sure you're well aware

127
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:01,285
that the cultured meat market
will soon become a feeding frenzy.

128
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,121
As technology evolves,
the release of similar products

129
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,040
will create cutthroat competition.

130
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,085
Ms. Yun,
that's exactly what I wanted to say.

131
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,962
Will you be able to last?

132
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,882
Total market domination
is definitely not easy.

133
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:15,966
That's right.

134
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,428
[inhales sharply]
I learned that when I was little.

135
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,306
This market will face an ice age

136
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,892
just like how
the home appliance market did.

137
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:28,938
But DORSON could withstand it
because it had many subsidiaries.

138
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,982
Will BF stay strong?
With just a few subsidiaries?

139
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,860
Who knows how long that period will last?
A decade? Or two?

140
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,032
Ms. Yun.

141
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:44,412
You must not allow
your market dominance to slip away.

142
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:50,084
You only refused all those offers
for this very day.

143
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,711
For me.

144
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,505
For this meeting.

145
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,894
It's true that this meeting is priceless.

146
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,440
But this isn't an easy decision.

147
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,694
I'm sure you'll need some time
to think about it.

148
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,654
There is time.

149
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,741
I have more

150
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,659
than enough time.

151
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,873
I'll visit you soon
and give you my answer.

152
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,348
[Jeong] You're leaving?

153
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,309
Why are you alone?

154
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,020
Mr. Woo had an emergency.

155
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,938
That's all he told me too.

156
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,024
Did he not tell you in advance, ma'am?

157
00:12:56,525 --> 00:13:00,154
[sighs] I apologize.
He won't leave again without your knowing.

158
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,911
[Chairman Seonu]
She said she had a lot of time.

159
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,455
Ms. Yun said
she had more than enough time.

160
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,748
[sighs]

161
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,459
She probably feels that way now.

162
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,045
She's still young.

163
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,050
The energy out there is low
without you there. Let's go.

164
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,347
I didn't know
you were still in touch with him.

165
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,016
-Who?
-He's that guy, right?

166
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,018
The one from the hospital.

167
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,770
You knew, didn't you?

168
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,940
Right. Of course, I did.

169
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,526
Why does he have to be
the one spying on Yun Jayu?

170
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,321
What's wrong?
I thought it was a great decision.

171
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,700
"Ms. Yun, I'm not just any bodyguard.

172
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,662
I was with you
when you were faced with immense danger."

173
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,082
And who made that great decision?

174
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,211
Your grandfather?

175
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,422
He used me to plant one of his men.

176
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,132
You liked the idea too.

177
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,969
You said we should plant
as many of our men as possible.

178
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,637
I thought it was your idea.

179
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,138
If it hadn't been for me,

180
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,808
Jayu wouldn't have hired
a former soldier as her bodyguard.

181
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,604
Grandpa didn't use you.
He just never got the chance to tell you.

182
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,982
I get that you're divorced,

183
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,860
but you should still visit
your ex-father-in-law from time to time.

184
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,570
[scoffs]

185
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,197
So tell me.
Did that geezer get anything out of her

186
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,782
after planting an informant?

187
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,121
I don't think his informant
has won Ms. Yun's trust just yet.

188
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,624
It's not an easy task.

189
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,378
Too bad he's not getting anything
from his source.

190
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,382
If he's of no use,
we can always find another use for him.

191
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,553
[door opens]

192
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,936
[Yun] Thirty-two trillion won.

193
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:00,566
I can stay out of the spotlight
and do whatever I want with that money.

194
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,152
I wouldn't need to worry

195
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,655
about producing results
or force myself to meet investors.

196
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,742
I could solely focus on my research.

197
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,162
But why did he make that offer?

198
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,289
He has everything already.

199
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,084
Why was he in a rush?

200
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,837
[Hoseung] I'm sorry, ma'am.

201
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,758
I'll make sure he never leaves
during work hours again.

202
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,427
I'll call and tell him
to come back immediately.

203
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,679
Right, him.

204
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,351
Is something going on with him?
He had cuts on his face.

205
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,395
I actually asked him
if he was beaten up by someone.

206
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:43,150
But just like me,
he's not the type to open up that easily.

207
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,362
He should've told me first before leaving.

208
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,821
I agree.

209
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,033
He can't even get into the building
without me.

210
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,827
-[sighs]
-He asks me to open the door for him

211
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,287
-all the time.
-Ah.

212
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,290
What's the matter?

213
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,168
It's nothing.

214
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,380
I'm going to the hospital.

215
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,340
[Yun] Why are you so excited to go?

216
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,218
It's not for me. It's for Ms. Hong.

217
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,302
She just woke up.

218
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,180
Mmm.

219
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,434
I'll tell her that you jumped for joy
when you heard the news.

220
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,104
Mr. On, what if…

221
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,856
If we could sell a part of our company,

222
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,902
do you think we could sell
just the cultured meat technology?

223
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,153
Only that?

224
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,864
Could we sell HQ or the lab

225
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,617
without the other party knowing
about the other facilities?

226
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,538
Whose this other party?

227
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,540
Seonu Geun of DORSON.

228
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,505
He'd soon suspect our intangible assets,
wouldn't he?

229
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,341
He'd suspect our tangible assets too.

230
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,676
It's DORSON after all.

231
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,555
Yet you're still tempted.

232
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,432
The conditions must be quite enticing.

233
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,599
[phone buzzes]

234
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,395
What is it? What's wrong?

235
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,524
-What are the conditions--
-[beeps]

236
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,109
Jeez.

237
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,408
WOO CHAEWOON

238
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,161
What is this?

239
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,164
Professor Kim flew to Cambodia
and got a Thai passport.

240
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,708
His new name is Somchai Tran.

241
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,335
He's not in Vietnam?

242
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,755
Hold on.

243
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,382
[phone rings]

244
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,300
Yes?

245
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,595
What?

246
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,805
W-Wait.

247
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:41,143
Professor Kim
went from Vietnam to Cambodia

248
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,687
and got a Thai passport?

249
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,980
[chuckles]

250
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,319
I'll report it right now.

251
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,988
[Woo] I'll be back soon.

252
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,407
[call ends]

253
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,121
How did he…

254
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,293
[Woo] I was lucky.

255
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:08,921
"Lucky"?

256
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,008
I was able to track him down
despite him crossing the border on land.

257
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,854
I synchronized it.

258
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,023
It will connect to our app
once you turn it on.

259
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,025
You mean Jang Yeongsil?

260
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,904
Well done today.

261
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,374
[Woo sighs]

262
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,263
Did I do something wrong?

263
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,726
Lie if you must,
but how was this purely luck?

264
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,357
You mean how I got his photo?

265
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,735
Why must I lie about it?

266
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,330
The man who appeared
at the nick of time during an accident

267
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,582
turned out to be a bodyguard.

268
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,666
Don't touch her!

269
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,626
[Yun] Right when I was looking for one.

270
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:34,923
Plus, he had been working elsewhere
but had just quit his job.

271
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:39,219
If not, I wouldn't have hired him,
since it would've felt like stealing.

272
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,181
Then I found out he'd experienced
the same hacking attack.

273
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,683
This is a list
of Russian and Korean symbols.

274
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,936
And our company had just been hacked.

275
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,355
On top of that,

276
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,442
he was at AZORAN with me too.

277
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,444
Then today…

278
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,285
How does my bodyguard
always have what I need?

279
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,540
When I saw that photo,

280
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,002
I was impressed that you had found him.

281
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,256
But when I was waiting for you,

282
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,426
I thought…

283
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,430
"How did he even get this photo?"

284
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,021
Why are you being quiet?

285
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,233
You should be upset

286
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,526
that I'm doubting you
instead of being grateful.

287
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,698
You should say that I'm demotivating you.

288
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,835
I guess I'm still lacking.

289
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,673
I failed at my job
if my client feels doubtful and unsure.

290
00:20:58,966 --> 00:20:59,967
It's time for you…

291
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,557
to make your final decision.

292
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:17,109
I was able to get his photo
because I was desperate to catch him.

293
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,196
It turned out CitizenX wasn't
behind the attack,

294
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:26,410
but I want to catch
anyone who spreads ransomware.

295
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,501
What was your rank
when the NIC was hacked?

296
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,171
-I was a captain.
-A captain?

297
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,634
-So you were held accountable.
-Correct.

298
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,137
Is that why you were dispatched?

299
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,097
I volunteered to go.

300
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,849
Because you wanted to work abroad?

301
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,394
[scoffs] No.

302
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,021
Then were you bored?

303
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,523
Of being in an intelligence unit?

304
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,192
[sighs] I went for the extra pay.

305
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,154
And I heard I could save up
since there's not much to spend on abroad.

306
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,241
Not bad.

307
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,368
I regret it.

308
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:14,082
But now,
I'm going to do something about it.

309
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,879
I talked with labor brokers.

310
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:22,674
I thought they'd know best
when it came to illegal migrants.

311
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,053
That was the only way I could help out.

312
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,477
Have the police found him yet?

313
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,147
[secretary] Sir, Kim Singu from BF
is headed to France.

314
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,400
-Who told you that?
-The bureau director.

315
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,651
Put me through.

316
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,118
[director] Based on a tip from BF,

317
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,871
we tracked down
a 56-year-old male named Somchai Tran

318
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,623
who departed from Cambodia.

319
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,626
He'll arrive at Paris CDG in three hours

320
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,128
and will be arrested
by the airport police.

321
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,298
-[exclaims]
-[director] The French authorities

322
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,884
also issued an Interpol red notice
for him.

323
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:09,388
He will be immediately sent back to Korea,

324
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,099
and we'll have him arrested
by tomorrow morning.

325
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,225
SON: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

326
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,816
Why didn't you tell me?

327
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,110
I wasn't sure if I'd reap anything.

328
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,237
But the reward was 30 million.

329
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:26,655
It was my money.

330
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,741
Your money?

331
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,327
You should've asked for money
on the phone earlier.

332
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,122
How can I put it?

333
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,667
That would've looked uncool.

334
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,716
-Care to have some?
-Allow me.

335
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,552
Ms. Jeong will wire you the money.

336
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:52,639
Including the reward money
that you promised those in Vietnam.

337
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,266
That's okay.

338
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,643
But promise me this one thing.

339
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,856
That you won't work for another company
even if you leave BF.

340
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,442
-Sorry?
-Can you do that?

341
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,826
I'm afraid I can't do that.

342
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,551
I can't allow that.

343
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,852
That cut…

344
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,188
Did the brokers beat you up?

345
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,232
Those scary, lawless men?

346
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,194
[sighs] I wasn't beaten up.

347
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,071
We fought.

348
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,740
But…

349
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,117
[Yeongsil] Ma'am, you have a new message.

350
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,995
It's from the bureau director.

351
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,081
Jang Yeongsil, read it to me.

352
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:04,002
"I'm sorry, but Kim Singu died
on the flight to France.

353
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,046
Presumably from
an acute myocardial infarction.

354
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,548
I'll get back to you with more details."

355
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,885
If you'd like to send a reply,

356
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,721
please say, "Jang Yeongsil, send a reply."

357
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,678
[patient] I get that
he stole company money and ran away.

358
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,429
But do you really think
Yun Jayu killed him?

359
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,558
[visitor] Maybe she made up
the rumor about him stealing money.

360
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,017
KIM FROM BF
SUSPECTED OF BEING POISONED

361
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,978
[patient] How awful.

362
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:08,233
[reporter] How did Kim Singu die?
Was it really a myocardial infarction?

363
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,110
So you already know.

364
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:13,572
[reporter 2] You claimed that
you didn't know he was the blackmailer.

365
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,408
Some think it's odd
that you still paid the ransom.

366
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,118
What are your thoughts on that?

367
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:22,372
I think it'd be more odd
to pay the ransom if I knew who it was.

368
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,750
[reporter 3] What are your thoughts
on the rumor about you poisoning him?

369
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,002
[Yun] I don't know.

370
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,130
I think poisoning someone on a plane

371
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,967
only happens in movies.

372
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,137
[reporters clamoring]

373
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,768
Damn it.

374
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:50,025
The autopsy showed
no traces of toxic substances.

375
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,736
-His coronary arteries were blocked--
-[beeps]

376
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,195
SEONU GEUN

377
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,156
It wouldn't have hurt to leave a trace.

378
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,370
[line rings]

379
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,624
The deceased was an incredible scientist.

380
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,083
He was the best!

381
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:12,088
Yun Jayu poisoned him
and disguised it as a heart attack.

382
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,006
Why?

383
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:16,843
Because he was the one
who reported the contamination!

384
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,261
[protesters cheering]

385
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,972
[protest leader]
The late Kim Singu came clean

386
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:24,684
and said that the culture fluid
was full of germs!

387
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:28,021
So she turned him into
a good-for-nothing blackmailer

388
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,858
and killed him off!

389
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:35,695
Therefore, that murderer needs…

390
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,863
EXPEL BF

391
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,615
…to be punished!

392
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,533
[protesters clamoring]

393
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:45,080
[protest leader] We want Yun Jayu out!

394
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,040
[Jeong]
Ma'am, don't come to the Seoul office.

395
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:47,957
DIRECTOR JEONG HAEDEUN

396
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,167
You can't come here.

397
00:27:58,802 --> 00:27:59,803
Take me to HQ.

398
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:03,473
I'm sorry, but is there another option?

399
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,893
If you're talking about my house,
it's under construction.

400
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,479
No, ma'am. I should have told you sooner.

401
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:15,151
These protesters will initially target
HQ and the Seoul office to find you.

402
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,822
It's easy to guess
that you'd be at one or the other.

403
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,865
After the hacking incident,

404
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:25,078
you shouldn't have set foot
in your lab, HQ or the Seoul office.

405
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,623
I shouldn't have gone to work
because of some South American gang?

406
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,000
We're living in a global era.
They could come here…

407
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,962
in the blink of an eye.

408
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,802
Tell Ms. Jeong to look for a hotel.

409
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,142
[sighs]

410
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,102
Would that be an issue too?

411
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,020
No, ma'am.

412
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,022
[sighs]

413
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,109
[sighs] It would be impossible
to go unnoticed at a hotel.

414
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,193
[line rings]

415
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:27,098
[Jeong] I couldn't find one
with an entire floor that's vacant.

416
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,977
But Agora Hotel will see how many rooms
they can empty around the suite.

417
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,437
So just hang tight for a bit.

418
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,857
But we've been driving around
for 30 minutes already.

419
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,402
[Jeong] Most hotels are fully booked
around this time. I'll let you know.

420
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,405
-[call ends]
-[sighs] Take me to HQ.

421
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,074
Let's just go.

422
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,286
[Hoseung] Yes, ma'am.

423
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,249
Damn it. Why did they have to protest
on New Year's Eve?

424
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,799
Ma'am, please bear with it
for just one day.

425
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,676
-[buttons beeping]
-[Hoseung] Where are we going?

426
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,305
-To this address.
-[navigation] Starting route guidance.

427
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,307
-[sighs]
-[Hoseung] Sungmun-dong?

428
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,309
What's there?

429
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:15,230
-[doorbell ringing]
-[meows]

430
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,110
[door opens]

431
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,138
[vehicle approaches]

432
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,763
[Woo] You can stay here.

433
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,205
[door opens, closes]

434
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,349
[sighs]

435
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:05,274
There are only three access points.
Over this wall here…

436
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:10,154
and the walls between the houses.

437
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,824
You can't see the inner wall from here.

438
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,409
We'll have to watch from the yard.

439
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,954
Then I'll patrol first.

440
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,331
We'll have to take turns anyway.

441
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,416
Okay.

442
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,809
[meows]

443
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,522
[meowing]

444
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,614
[Yun] What's your name?

445
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,496
[door opens, closes]

446
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,624
Excuse me.

447
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,463
It's your house.

448
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,301
May I come in?

449
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,137
Well…

450
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,765
it's your room.

451
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,935
We'll take turns patrolling.
You can sleep.

452
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,020
[cat meows]

453
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,023
What? You little rascal.

454
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:28,649
What's wrong?

455
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,363
How could you do this, Mansik?
You never greet me when I come home.

456
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,241
[Mansik meowing]

457
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,911
[Yun] Do you not like your owner?

458
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,370
Don't answer that.

459
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,581
-[meowing continues]
-[chuckles]

460
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,795
[Woo sighs]

461
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,881
[Yun] He's sulking

462
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:57,220
because his name doesn't suit
his handsome looks.

463
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,556
My mother named him.

464
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,893
-[water running]
-It's a better name than yours.

465
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,770
He'll live a long life.

466
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,232
He was a stray.

467
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,192
She named him that
so he'd grow big and strong.

468
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,652
He was tiny at first.

469
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,781
Mansik must have been
the strongest name she could think of.

470
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,492
But he hides whenever he sees men.

471
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,494
He never comes out to greet me.

472
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,206
[Yun] Did someone hurt you on the street?

473
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,129
You have a beautiful house.

474
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,755
This house?

475
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,509
I grew up here, so I've never noticed.

476
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,804
Am I at your parents' place?

477
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,097
Then did your family--

478
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,932
No, they're in the US.

479
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:47,311
My sister is there,
and my mother recently joined her.

480
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,233
She's living with her daughter.

481
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,278
It must be uncomfortable…

482
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,031
But didn't you already know all that?

483
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,033
I thought you did a background check.

484
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,871
I don't memorize every line
of my employees' résumés.

485
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,622
There are thousands.

486
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,629
-[sighs]
-[Mansik meows]

487
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,678
He's melting in your hands.

488
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,098
I owe you for this.

489
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,102
Are you okay?

490
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,359
[Yun] It must have been upsetting.

491
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,531
I suspected you of being close
with Lee Mungyu, who you barely know,

492
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,076
and your motives for joining BF.

493
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:49,790
Then I nitpicked over the fact that
you knew a few people from AZORAN.

494
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,960
Though you regret your time there.

495
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,298
I asked if you were okay, not me.

496
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,720
You should be more upset.

497
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,226
Yesterday, I was a murderer
who killed a stockbreeder.

498
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,103
And today, I was accused
of poisoning someone.

499
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,689
What's the difference?

500
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,067
The former was a tragedy.

501
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,986
An inevitable consequence
of a changing world.

502
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:22,573
It's true that you sped up that process.

503
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,660
But you didn't kill Kim.
It's a misunderstanding and slander.

504
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:30,998
So what if I'm upset about
being slandered and misunderstood?

505
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,085
What comes next?

506
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,464
You deny the charges
and explain yourself if you're innocent.

507
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:46,472
And after that, I can't do anything else
that'll make me suspicious.

508
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,059
But I don't plan to do that.

509
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,146
I have no intention of stopping.

510
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:03,656
I think you and I are destined
to suspect each other.

511
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,410
Because it seems like you're insinuating

512
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:12,331
that I may be guilty
since I don't look too upset.

513
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,627
I know you had
nothing to do with his death.

514
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,755
-[Jeong] Is she here right now?
-[Hoseung] Yes.

515
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,382
[Jeong panting]

516
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,842
[Hoseung] Jeez, this is heavy.

517
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,306
[Yun] Wait. Give me a minute.

518
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,813
[Jeong sighs]

519
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,274
Ah, ma'am, why is this so heavy?
What's inside?

520
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,151
We'll open them inside.

521
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,323
Come in.

522
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:49,910
[door closes]

523
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,711
I see. It's a real house.

524
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,386
For her protection if needed.

525
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,265
-Are they loaded?
-No.

526
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,684
[clicks]

527
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,483
You can disassemble it.

528
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,110
Have you used one before?

529
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,909
-Are these bulletproof?
-As long as it's not point-blank.

530
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,953
We're dealing with more lunatics now.

531
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,748
It wasn't easy getting the permits.
Always keep them with you.

532
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,832
Yes.

533
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,752
[Jeong] I'll do my best
to hire more bodyguards soon.

534
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:44,090
They can stay at the house next door,
so stay here if you want.

535
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:48,010
Next door? What about the residents there?

536
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,513
They moved out immediately
when I offered ten million a week.

537
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,681
-I borrowed the entire house.
-[chuckles]

538
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,558
Can I pay the same price for this place?

539
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,352
-I--
-I'll leave tomorrow.

540
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,561
Are you uncomfortable?

541
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:02,149
Ah, what about
just until after New Year's?

542
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,318
All the hotels are teeming with people.

543
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,612
Would that be okay?

544
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:08,906
Sure.

545
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,203
Good night.

546
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:20,376
[door opens, closes]

547
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,504
When is Ms. Hong returning to work again?

548
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,090
[Jeong] She'll return after the New Year.

549
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,968
-Tell her to come see me when she does.
-Yes, ma'am.

550
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,761
[clicks tongue] It's cozy.

551
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,223
Should I spend the night here as well?

552
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,475
-No.
-Good night.

00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,046
[Yun] Give me a minute.

556
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,217
You know I had
nothing to do with his death?

557
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,803
Then what are you unsure about?

558
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,975
Did you kill someone?

559
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,397
Was it his family member?
His wife who battled cancer?

560
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,903
Tell Ms. Jeong to come in.

561
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:33,782
I doubt you would murder someone
for personal reasons.

562
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,619
But what about for your business?

563
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,163
Could that be possible?

564
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,247
Tell Ms. Jeong…

565
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,833
to come in.

566
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,637
[Woo] "Her younger sibling succumbed
to a degenerative brain disease.

00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,514
She doesn't speak to her family.

568
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:00,476
She severed ties with her family
after undergoing two crises.

569
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:05,022
The first was when she incurred
a huge debt in BF's early days.

570
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:08,192
The second crisis was when her mother
committed financial fraud in 2022

571
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,027
after BF successfully went public.

572
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:16,158
Two years later, Yun Jayu announced that
she'd stop paying off her family's debt."

He earned more than just her trust.

00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,742
-[dance music playing]
-Was he told to seduce her?

580
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,453
I didn't know soldiers were her type.

581
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,665
Still, how could she go to her own
bodyguard's place? How demeaning.

582
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,041
What did your grandfather say?

583
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:10,379
Chaewoon must have reported back to him
after luring Jayu to his home.

584
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,173
The bell-ringing ceremony's just finished.

585
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,259
I didn't even get to speak with him.

586
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,219
Call me as soon as you do.

587
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,097
I'll call him tomorrow. It's late.

588
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,224
This is why your upbringing matters.

589
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,518
I can't believe
she's sleeping at his place.

590
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,603
She has no morals.

591
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,606
-Those stupid nouveau riche.
-[sighs] Wishing you the best this year.

592
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:32,026
I've gotten enough greetings already.
I just need one more thing.

593
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,486
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

[siren blaring]

595
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,541
[Seonu] Ms. Yun refused my father's offer.

596
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,962
He's done making M&A offers now.

597
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,715
[Mungyu] BF is like a child to that woman.

598
00:43:55,674 --> 00:44:00,679
But no child can be more valuable
than your own life.

599
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,097
She will give up.

600
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:06,185
I'm certain that it's in there.

601
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,647
They're just keeping it well-hidden.

602
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:14,068
[Seonu] Grandfather,
did Captain Woo report back to you?

603
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,409
Thank you.

[ad reader]
What makes the BF sensor suit unique

607
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,811
is its special fabric and structure.

608
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,562
Is that entertaining for you?

609
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,564
[ad reader continues]

610
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,816
It's an ad.

611
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,360
Ads need to be entertaining too.

612
00:44:56,902 --> 00:45:00,280
-But that is pretty much a manual.
-[chuckles]

613
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,991
Explaining the functions is important…

614
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:07,162
-[phone buzzing]
-But we'll go with the second one.

615
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,583
Hello, Prime Minister.

616
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,337
Am I free? Right now…

617
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,799
I understand.

618
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,845
It's okay. I'm in my car anyway.

619
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,348
Goodbye.

620
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,770
Does he want to see you?

621
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:35,524
Being called out of the blue
has never been favorable for me.

622
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:36,650
Uh--

623
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,155
He didn't mention me, so you can go alone.

624
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,908
-Let's go.
-[Hoseung] Yes, ma'am.

625
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,531
[Seonu] Ah, Ms. Yun.

626
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:27,868
[Yun] Is something the matter?

627
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,745
[Seonu]
I'm sorry, but I need to go somewhere.

628
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,246
Where?

629
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,957
A police station's armory
has been ransacked.

630
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,961
I'm sorry.

631
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,507
I need to go and decide
whether the president needs to come too.

632
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,008
It's okay. You should hurry.

633
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:44,676
I was the one who asked you to come.

634
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,846
-This is rude of me.
-You don't need to explain.

635
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,181
You should go.

00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,776
[Seo] You're done already?

638
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:04,738
[Yun] Yeongsil, search for
"armory raid at a police station today."

639
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,448
Did you get a list?

640
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:11,453
Eight handguns, five hunting rifles,
150 live shells,

641
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:14,039
two magazine rifles, four radios,

642
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,542
three grenades.

643
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,710
Grenades?

644
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,214
The prime minister will be there in 30.

645
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,181
Here. An article was just posted.

646
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,766
But it's breaking news.

647
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,561
It says, "Large quantities stolen
from police station's armory."

648
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:39,439
They must be some brazen scumbags
to rob an armory.
