1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,480
I want Yukiya to live a good look forward too.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,920
(Yukiya) They destroy them in order to live properly.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,660
{Erika: Now, both in name and reality

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,560
I became everything to the Ise family.

5
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,010
(Masayuki) Let it melt. you can't.

6
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,040
(Masayuki) Who is it in the first place? you. No outsiders can enter.

7
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,330
(Masayuki) You're not an outsider! You cannot pass it through.

8
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,150
(Masayuki) That's all you can say. Please go home.

9
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,270
(Masayuki) That's all you can say.

10
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:30,620
It's lively from the morning... Even though outsiders are not allowed to enter.

11
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,440
(Masayuki) Hey!

12
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,530
(Masayuki) That's why...

13
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,530
wife….

14
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,740
What did you say just now?

15
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,630
yeah? Not that. How to call it now.

16
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,300
Hey.

17
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,600
I should have been the master here, right?

18
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,160
(Masayuki) Who do you think I am?

19
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,480
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,170
(Masayuki) Stop it... Wow!

21
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,050
Well, that's fine. It's noisy outside so do something.

22
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,050
I got it.

23
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,600
(Masayuki) Erika! ! It's me! I'm back!

24
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:37,490
(Classic Music)

25
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,680
Let go! Hey!

26
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,710
It's... Uh... Uh...

27
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,730
Please go home.

28
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,280
That's why... I am the owner of the Ise family.

29
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,820
Ise Masayuki. He's the eldest son of this family! !

30
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,860
This house and this land are all mine!

31
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,220
Ugh...

32
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,070
Hmm! (Masayuki) It hurts... you...

33
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,590
What is it?! you! this….

34
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,940
Take care! !

35
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:13,020
(Classic Music)

36
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,570
Can you let me have a loud noise? Ei is going to wake up.

37
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,920
Don't sniff! !

38
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,960
Erika! Hey, elegant! Hmm...

39
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,150
Hey... Let it go!

40
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,500
(Masayuki) Let it go! Hey!

41
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,240
(Essay's cry)

42
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,260
(Classic Music)

43
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,260
(Essay's cry)

44
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
《Erika》

45
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,340
"you…"

46
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,420
(Shutter sound)

47
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,940
"What do you want? 》

48
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,940
(Shutter sound)

49
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,470
"Since you came, the Ise family has been suffering from disasters."

50
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,820
"The mastermind behind murdering his father...?"

51
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
"You were probably aiming to be the chairman from the beginning, right?"

52
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,770
Kyoko: I have no intention of giving away the Ise family to you.

53
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,810
This house belongs to Masa.

54
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,500
Huh?

55
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,200
Even though he jumped over to us

56
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,390
When Masa-kun is having a hard time

57
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,390
What is the chairman... what is the inauguration ceremony?

58
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:15,830
Mom, calm down. What happened all of a sudden?

59
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,830
For now... this is the best thing to do.

60
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,420
Speaking of which, it sounds good.

61
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,510
When you come to our house using ego as an excuse

62
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,200
He had a bad look.

63
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,740
It seemed like no one noticed

64
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,740
It's obvious to me.

65
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,000
It's the best day.

66
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's best to know nothing.

67
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,070
What is it?

68
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,490
You seem to be misunderstood something

69
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:10,210
Marriage to the Ise family means becoming a member of this family.

70
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:17,210
Even if it's a crippling and cold prison.

71
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:25,150
It is your job to fulfill the chairman's wife.

72
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,980
Poor person.

73
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:43,540
Is it the era? Or is it really skilled?

74
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,540
destiny?

75
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,830
For me, this is a very interesting place

76
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,860
mother.

77
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:05,760
It's like a magical castle that will make your dreams come true.

78
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,450
Huh?

79
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,660
Even in a prison that is uneasy and cold for you

80
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:17,660
A paradise full of hope for me.

81
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:26,470
Well, it's not exactly what I said

82
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,170
Masa-kun isn't exactly what your mother said.

83
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,170
Why did you end up with something like this?

84
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,100
good? This isn't your paradise.

85
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,960
Don't say anything stupid!

86
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:47,680
This is Masa's house.

87
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,680
This is our family's home.

88
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:02,330
I can... do what I can do if it's for that child.

89
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,190
For those of you who only consider your child as a gift

90
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,190
I don't know though.

91
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,440
I haven't regretted at all

92
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:29,600
"I'm sorry... Misunderstanding that ties for love"

93
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,790
Mom...

94
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,000
"It was a poor life, right?"

95
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,200
Mom!

96
00:09:38,200 --> 00:10:15,900
～

97
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,940
This time, it's the case of my husband Masayuki.

98
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,470
Since I became chairman

99
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,010
We have received a variety of comments on social media.

100
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:33,240
He's worried about my encouraging words and my health

101
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,240
I also have words. Thank you very much.

102
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:55,470
However, there are some critical content.

103
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:00,510
A title that is too heavy for me

104
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:05,730
I think your criticism is reasonable.

105
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:14,730
However, there are things that are simply unacceptable.

106
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:27,110
I think I approached the Ise family in order to want to be the chairman.

107
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,110
That's what it is.

108
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:41,920
That's the only thing I'll make a loud voice

109
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,990
I want to say it's not.

110
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:53,210
I just keep repeating stalker-like behavior

111
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:56,740
To Masayuki, who saved her from her ex-husband...

112
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,440
Huh?

113
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,130
I just want to repay you.

114
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,820
"What, seriously?" "That's insane."

115
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,850
"Erika-san, are you okay?" "Stalkers are too scary."

116
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,540
"That's a lie, I didn't know." "Ise Masayuki Points Up."

117
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:17,620
About Masayuki, who protected me from harassment by my ex-husband

118
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:23,620
This time I want to help...

119
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,930
What drives me now

120
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,310
love! That's all!

121
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:52,800
～

122
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,690
delicious. delicious. It's tasty.

123
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:02,400
Yuki-bro says it's tasty.

124
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,120
Yuki-bro, what's wrong? yeah?

125
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,810
Do you have stomach pain?

126
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,350
Yes, it's okay.

127
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,040
Sorry Yukiya.

128
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,230
I've run out of mayonnaise

129
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,230
Can I buy it for you?

130
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,030
I'll go shopping a little.

131
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:35,030
Take care. (Children) Come!

132
00:13:48,250 --> 00:14:53,990
～

133
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,990
Why are you in your life?

134
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,900
(Masayuki) Will he kill him?

135
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,900
(Masayuki) He's probably here to kill him.

136
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,960
Don't come!

137
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,500
It's unbelievable even if it's been abandoned.

138
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,520
a?

139
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Is this the end of the Ise family's eldest son?

140
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,290
Don't be kidding. Will you be defeated by something?

141
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,330
I don't need you anymore.

142
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,330
It's almost like he's dead.

143
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,490
(Masayuki) Even if you go, we won't meet.

144
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:56,450
(Masayuki) I guess your purpose is Erika anyway, right?

145
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,810
I agree.

146
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:05,880
That's my... final revenge.

147
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,880
Hehe...

148
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:21,040
It's like stupid, we.

149
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,040
They were both fooled by that woman.

150
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,120
He's all about his dad.

151
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,380
Ah, yes.

152
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:57,320
You, what's better about that girl?

153
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,600
Because I could

154
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,810
I had a heir, so we joined him.

155
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,810
If not, it's just a play.

156
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,050
I shouldn't have done anything to my wife.

157
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:25,010
But, that's yours

158
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:30,730
That face when he was faced with divorce papers was a masterpiece.

159
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:38,730
Ahahaha! Hahaha!

160
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:51,270
～

161
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:57,820
It's fine now, it doesn't matter.

162
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:02,820
You're not worthy of grudge.

163
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,610
Hey.

164
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,540
What do you want from Erika?

165
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,600
To be brought to hell.

166
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,680
With me.

167
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:54,230
So, in the end, Erika belongs to you.

168
00:18:54,230 --> 00:19:11,570
～

169
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,570
(Crow's cry)

170
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,290
(Crow's cry)

171
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,060
(Crow's cry)

172
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,370
(Crow's cry)

173
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:36,420
～

174
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:41,420
Until the end... sorry.

175
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,820
Boy... I am...

176
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,580
Fuyu-san.

177
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,760
Thank you so far.

178
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:34,560
～

179
00:21:36,410 --> 00:22:03,480
～

180
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:11,560
(The sound of heartbeat)

181
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,560
I thought it would come.

182
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,810
It's really persistent.

183
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,810
It's a waste to try to snatch me up.

184
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,900
Isn't it Yukiya anyway?

185
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,900
feel ill.

186
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,620
What are you planning?

187
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,510
Did you save your brother?

188
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,080
Don't be kidding.

189
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,080
Ha... but that's not the case.

190
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,970
How many times do you say don't interfere with my happiness?

191
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Is this what makes you happy?

192
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,770
What is this?

193
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,770
ah.

194
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,970
It's like this. Stupid.

195
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,860
Can't you stop?

196
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,310
Don't touch it again.

197
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:30,680
Even though I don't know how hard I've had.

198
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,680
A struggle?

199
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,950
Even if you trample someone's life, you can live a luxurious life

200
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,950
Is doing it a happiness for you?

201
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,660
You don't care about people in order to live an elegant life?

202
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,900
what? Sermon?

203
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:19,780
Everyone isn't. Anytime.

204
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:26,730
There is where there is

205
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,770
It's not where there isn't.

206
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,300
If so, just take it.

207
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,670
That's how I came.

208
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:41,670
All of them... I've used them.

209
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,110
That's crazy.

210
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,460
There's no way it's allowed.

211
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,460
I haven't said I'd forgive you though.

212
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:59,030
That's not what I want.

213
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,280
You're lonely.

214
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,900
Yeah.

215
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,900
Of course, right? so what?

216
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,990
Even Yukiya has taken revenge on her loneliness.

217
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:34,050
Otherwise, you won't be able to move forward.

218
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,290
What's the difference?

219
00:25:39,290 --> 00:26:06,240
～

220
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:16,240
Or... will you kill me and die too?

221
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:40,400
～

222
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:48,660
I wanted to... take a look back.

223
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,660
All of the fate.

224
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:07,130
Because no one will save you.

225
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,780
You'll be happy too

226
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,780
Don't forget about me.

227
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:39,490
Let me just say it simply.

228
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:45,490
If I could do that, I would have been happy for a long time.

229
00:27:54,810 --> 00:28:01,880
I'm looking for it forever.

230
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,880
In my memory.

231
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:14,600
There's one thing I can say.

232
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,410
Erika...

233
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,480
When he laughed at me.

234
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,380
That...

235
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:46,670
I still remember it many times now.

236
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:50,670
Even if you want to forget it, you can't.

237
00:28:53,910 --> 00:29:02,910
At that time, I was always happy.

238
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:17,450
I'm lonely.

239
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,580
What was that time?

240
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,580
What was that smile?

241
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,640
He told me I liked it.

242
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:54,770
Because... otherwise it wouldn't have started.

243
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,460
You became the person who pleased me.

244
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,460
Otherwise, they wouldn't like me.

245
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:20,270
What logic is it?

246
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:31,380
Because it's just one time my life. So what can I do?

247
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,380
You've just been fooled by your own will, right?

248
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:51,530
Well, maybe that's true.

249
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:59,940
I would have never come near if I had known.

250
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,210
but….

251
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:19,360
For me back then...

252
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,360
You were everything.

253
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:43,070
Goodbye.

254
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,380
(The sound of the door opening)

255
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,420
(The sound of the door closing)

256
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:53,130
～

257
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,130
Let's play together.

258
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,890
I don't need this.

259
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,590
yeah?

260
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,280
I'm hungry

261
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:41,950
～

262
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,970
Be happy.

263
00:33:43,970 --> 00:34:19,970
～

264
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:30,760
I'm still learning a lot

265
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,310
Herb cultivation It's been a dream forever, so every day is fun.

266
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,330
That's right.

267
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:41,330
I'll bring it to Daho's house next time. thank you.

268
00:34:53,670 --> 00:35:02,750
Hanaho-san The other day... I'm really sorry.

269
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,750
He said this with my mind in mind...

270
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:11,840
I don't care.

271
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,880
Yukiya-kun is just a little bit now

272
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,250
If you're feeling more enjoyable

273
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,250
That's fine. I'm happy too.

274
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,360
～

275
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,050
(The sound of the bell)

276
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:51,920
～

277
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,940
Wait a minute. Do you eat a lot?

278
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,960
Good job! here you are! wait a minute.

279
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,480
Do you guys give it a go? It should be saying.

280
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,670
Okay! Yes.

281
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,530
yes. That's it.

282
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,550
I'll get it. Yes.

283
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,920
Good, good, good. Eat the vegetables properly too.

284
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,920
Put it on top and take care of it...

285
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:22,050
Hey, we became friends in the park. Wow, hello.

286
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,050
Hello.

287
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,680
You did well. Yeah!

288
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,310
Master.

289
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:50,310
Mom is now!

290
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:56,020
welcome home. I'll give this.

291
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,170
thank you.

292
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:46,400
～

293
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,900
～
