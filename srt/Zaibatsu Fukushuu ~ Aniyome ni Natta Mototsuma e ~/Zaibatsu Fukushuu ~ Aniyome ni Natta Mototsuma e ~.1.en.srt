00:00:03,570 --> 00:01:19,570
～

2
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,840
good morning. Ah Yukiya Good morning.

3
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,930
thank you. That's amazing.

4
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,620
Did you know that a new bakery has been opened in front of the station?

5
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,980
It's been featured in a lot of places though.

6
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,670
Wow. (Entrance chime)

7
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,360
Yes.

8
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,730
sorry. This is an authentic coffee sekke.

9
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,730
i am coming.

10
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,450
He seems busy lately, but are you sleeping properly?

11
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,490
Yes, right... There's no breaks.

12
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:32,360
Don't overdo it.

13
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,710
thank you.

14
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:39,710
Well, I have to work hard until the press conference on the 1st.

15
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,780
A day...

16
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,700
I know. There's no way I'll forget it.

17
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,230
What's the best present? Is it decided?

18
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,750
Hmm, yes.

19
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,120
But what about it? Huh?

20
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,990
No, from the brand that we made rings together

21
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,180
New designs have been released. Yeah.

22
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,700
It's a different atmosphere

23
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,750
I was thinking it would be nice if I could change it to suit my clothes.

24
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,630
ring? It's totally fine.

25
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,170
Well, I didn't think this guy's lifespan was one year though.

26
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,200
No, no, I wasn't saying that.

27
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,200
Use both!

28
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,750
10 more days? I'm looking forward to it.

29
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,260
From Ise Masayuki

30
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,260
Here is an explanation of the new business.

31
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:57,210
Um, the press conference is finally coming 10 days later.

32
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,750
We, the Ise Group, will celebrate its 150th anniversary next year.

33
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:07,810
We are the first private company to launch Japan's space travel service.

34
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,180
This project is definitely

35
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,880
It will attract attention from all over the world.

36
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,900
Four!

37
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,900
(applause)

38
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,160
Well, then on this project

39
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,360
We will explain the business contents of each company.

40
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Good luck.

41
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,070
Ugh ugh ugh.

42
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,500
Wow, what! Was you there too?

43
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,210
ah. I brought it to you today because I had a little load.

44
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,080
Hey, don't drop it?

45
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,460
That's heavier than your life.

46
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,460
That's wrong.

47
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,190
(laughter)

48
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,380
Ah, dad.

49
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:11,380
"They are my family."

50
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,460
{Chairman of the Ise Group, one of Japan's leading companies

51
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,460
Ise Seiichiro is my father

52
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,900
《At the core of the Ise Group

53
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,900
Ise Masayuki, the president of Ise Bussan, is his older brother...

54
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,200
"He serves as president of iSE InterFashion Co., Ltd.

55
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Ise Satoshi is a cousin

56
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,250
{And I'll protect the Ise group.

57
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,250
I work for them

58
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,030
"That's because it's a pretext..."

59
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,110
Seiichiro: Let him clean up the butt.

60
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,650
(Satoshi) He is destined to live behind the scenes for the rest of his life.

61
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,650
(Masayuki) I think the sweeping suits me

62
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,050
{But no matter what you say...}

63
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,340
Oh, it's rare.

64
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,700
mother….

65
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:23,770
what happened? I mean to go home.

66
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,470
Don't take your computer out of the house until the press conference is over.

67
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,340
My brother. Ah, that's right.

68
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:35,050
Well then. Wait a minute.

69
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,750
Hmm...

70
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,750
He probably called out because he had something to do.

71
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,510
Just now, he's a former employee of iSE InterFashion.

72
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:52,400
An anonymous account posted a complaint.

73
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,430
Huh? Huh? It's not.

74
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,950
Delete it quickly.

75
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,950
Even when it comes to big things, I don't know, pay thief.

76
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,390
yes.

77
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,980
"I am due to the power harassment of Ise Satoshi, president of iSE InterFashion.

78
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,850
I've become depressed.

79
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,730
The company's response after that was the worst, and instead of guaranteed, I was fired.

80
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,420
Please help.

81
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,420
Please contact me if anyone is in the same situation as me."

82
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,090
(knock)

83
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,650
Thank you for your hard work, why not give tea?

84
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,190
Hanaho. Good luck.

85
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:19,080
Sorry, did you get in the way? Ah, no, sorry always.

86
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,080
It's fine, it's just boring.

87
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,520
Have you been busy lately?

88
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,570
Masayuki is exhausted every day, even though there will be a press conference soon.

89
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,790
That's right. I've been hit hard again recently.

90
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,150
What a sorry thing.

91
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:45,150
Ah, no, sorry, I said something unnecessary.

92
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,450
Is Hanaho okay?

93
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,470
Huh?

94
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:02,350
I thought something had been said again. Ah...

95
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,910
That's amazing, Yukiya-kun.

96
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,620
Well... But there's nothing I can do about it.

97
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,160
I can't... it's my fault.

98
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,680
That's not the case.

99
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,730
Please stop thinking like that.

100
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,730
Yukiya is kind.

101
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,160
If the press conference is over successfully

102
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,890
I think Masayuki will listen to his story seriously too.

103
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,890
Thank you very much.

104
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:52,850
Don't hold Yukiya too much into it.

105
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:58,070
It's not good to think about doing something on your own.

106
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,770
Tell me anything.

107
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,770
Yeah.

108
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,980
Are you okay? Are you not injured?

109
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,190
sorry! No, not at all.

110
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,040
Clothes...

111
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,040
It's fine, it'll come off if you wash it.

112
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,640
I didn't cry, great.

113
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,160
Sorry, thank you very much.

114
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,870
home.

115
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,560
Sorry to my brother?

116
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,580
sorry.

117
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,580
Yes, I'm glad I wasn't injured.

118
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,180
So, excuse me.

119
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,380
bye bye. bye bye.

120
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,240
(Kuna) Well, mom. (Kotoko) Yes.

121
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,110
I learned a new song. What! Let me listen and let me listen!

122
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:13,500
"Sparkling glittering"

123
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:24,110
(Two people) "I want you to have a sparkly glittering or something."

124
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:33,200
"Blink and look at everyone."

125
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:41,200
"Sparkling, you're not..."

126
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,200
Sorry.

127
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,220
Uuuuh, it's like Yukiya.

128
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,220
If you put it on overnight it will fall off.

129
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
thank you. Yes.

130
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,990
It's a bit... difficult to do.

131
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,990
Because I'm doing this now.

132
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,380
sorry. That's fine.

133
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,170
no…. yeah?

134
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,760
Please leave this like this until tomorrow.

135
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,280
Take a leisurely bath.

136
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,990
I'm sleeping first, good night.

137
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,990
good night.

138
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:53,530
～

139
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Welcome to visit.

140
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Boy Good morning. good morning.

141
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,950
thank you.

142
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,350
(knock)

143
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,350
please.

144
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,570
a….

145
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:50,170
Thank you for your hard work. thank you.

146
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,170
What about Hanaho today?

147
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:03,630
I went for a consultation. Ah...

148
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,630
So, um... It's just one more week.

149
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,210
Don't think you're going to stop it.

150
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:25,280
I've endured it for this day. It's the perfect time.

151
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:34,110
Fuyu-san.

152
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:43,530
The sweeping process has accumulated enough information to rot.

153
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:50,530
I'll definitely make it a success.

154
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,220
Is it really reborn?

155
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,260
Are you okay.

156
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,260
No matter what, you'll succeed.

157
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,440
Yuki-nii! Oh.

158
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,130
(Everyone) Yuki-nii! long time no see.

159
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,820
long time no see! What were you doing today?

160
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,180
Today we all jumped rope together. You jumped 20 times isn't it?

161
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,700
That's amazing. That's amazing. You Sakura

162
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,730
I've now been able to say 8th. Oh that much?

163
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,600
Hey, let's play quickly. Play! I'll play, okay?

164
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,290
Look at the train! Okay, let's play together.

165
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,290
Hey, let's draw!

166
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,840
It's tasty.

167
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,100
Are there any things you don't like? Yes... I guess it's in this one.

168
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,350
that…. yes.

169
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:32,400
Sorry all of a sudden, can you take a photo?

170
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,440
picture? Yes of course.

171
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,440
thank you.

172
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,700
It's kind of good, it reminds me of it.

173
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:02,200
I got rice!

174
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,900
Look, there's Kato's pork soup too. It's hot, take care.

175
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,900
How many do you eat? Me, eat both

176
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,840
Hey, hey.

177
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,520
Refill.

178
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,900
A secondhand? Was it tasty? It was delicious. Okay.

179
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,420
I also have a secondhand. Maybe I can go for about 100 more drinks...

180
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,460
Can you get 100 drinks? I have 1,000 drinks.

181
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,310
Today's fried chicken is super tasty.

182
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,310
delicious? Chikuzenni is the best...

183
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,380
If anyone else wants it, tell me. So I want it.

184
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,270
I went.

185
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:04,990
Yeah. I've been left to the point recently.

186
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,010
If it calms down next week

187
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,010
I feel like I can go again though.

188
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,790
what happened?

189
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:24,350
Ugh, I think Yukiya is amazing.

190
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,720
I can't do it. Huh?

191
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,090
No, that's it.

192
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:35,970
I feel like I want to prioritize my own life.

193
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:40,680
I just want to do it myself too.

194
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,680
Hmm.

195
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,290
Before I knew it, I wanted to be happy one day

196
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,820
Have you ever talked to me?

197
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,520
Yeah.

198
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,740
I don't know what happened to Erika in the past.

199
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:08,460
If you don't want to talk, you don't have to talk.

200
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:14,180
But it's the same for me too, right?

201
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,060
I want to be happy one day.

202
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:25,060
After finishing everything, we'll have two of us...

203
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,780
I agree.

204
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,480
Yeah.

205
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,200
That's right, it's my life.

206
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,390
Yeah.

207
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,260
I hope I'm happy.

208
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,260
of course.

209
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,000
thank you.

210
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,020
Yukiya is really kind.

211
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,020
I think so. That's right.

212
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:15,570
If that's the case, it's mother's blood.

213
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,300
(Hanaho) You'll come in the bath. Yeah.

214
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:16,740
That Masayuki.

215
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,090
Huh?

216
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:25,160
I'm today, that... on the scheduled date

217
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,880
If you like, I hope you get up.

218
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,900
please.

219
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,900
There are a few things being said, and I'm at my limit.

220
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,530
You know what I'm in now?

221
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:48,550
What...

222
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,570
I'm tired.

223
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,600
I'm doing everything about the space business.

224
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,980
You should know, though? That's what the president's wife does.

225
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,980
Ah...

226
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,580
If you can't rest at home, where should you go.

227
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,140
It's almost here, Mom.

228
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,390
(Masayuki) There's only 6 days left until the press conference.

229
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:39,500
Apparently they've also received requests for interviews from the New York Times and Reuters.

230
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,680
Ah.

231
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,370
If this business succeeds

232
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:47,580
The Ise Zaibatsu is one of the world's top class.

233
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,430
I guess so.

234
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:53,980
(Coughing voice)

235
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,350
Are you okay? It's nothing big.

236
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,350
(Coughing voice)

237
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,630
I guess it's better to have surgery after all.

238
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,150
What will you do in the meantime?

239
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:14,680
That's what I did... Don't worry.

240
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:20,080
My regret is that there is no heir.

241
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,080
I asked.

242
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,950
It's okay. I don't want to worry about my dad.

243
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:54,920
～

244
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:03,670
(English)

245
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:06,360
Everyone, what are your plans for the future?

246
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,560
There's a French restaurant I want to take with me.

247
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,250
Are you going? please….

248
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,110
Everyone, are you going?

249
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,130
Which clothes are you using for the next poster?

250
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:18,820
It will be here. Ah?

251
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,180
No, I can move this one, I can't see it!

252
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,040
Yes, I'm sorry. I can't use it.

253
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:41,040
～

254
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:49,790
Acquisition? Yeah.

255
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,160
There's a big company called the Ise Group.

256
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:57,040
He ended up protecting his mother's factory.

257
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,040
Hmm, you're so kind.

258
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,790
Yukiya... Yeah?

259
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,480
Instead

260
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,020
My mother has to leave this factory.

261
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,230
why? Isn't this your mother's factory?

262
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,760
Hmm...

263
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,800
It might be a bit difficult for Yukiya though.

264
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,330
There's no choice.

265
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:31,220
To protect this factory with everyone who worked here.

266
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:35,930
So what will happen to your mother?

267
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:41,930
That's right, what should I do?

268
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:52,940
It's okay, it'll be fine.

269
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,800
If Yukiya looks like that

270
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Even my mother would almost cry.

271
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,900
It's okay, isn't it.

272
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,920
Ah, no, I'll go... Mom!

273
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,940
dangerous! Because it's dangerous! Mom! Mom!

274
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,790
Go back! Go back! Mom!

275
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,980
It's dangerous, it's dangerous... Mom!

276
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,000
It's no good! Mom!

277
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,690
Don't go, it's no good... Mom!

278
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,710
Mom! It's no good!

279
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:25,710
Mom Mom... That's no good...

280
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,760
He is the child of the former president of Matsushima Electric.

281
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,320
I had to take him in because I had no relatives.

282
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,190
Wait, what about mom?

283
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:54,380
Give me back my mom.

284
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,930
Take care! Who are you talking to? ?

285
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,780
Your mother is

286
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,000
He was using his master for money.

287
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
For years, many years!

288
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,440
Who are you thinking about without knowing your position? ?

289
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,650
It's your mother who's the wrong person!

290
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,010
A terrible woman.

291
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,700
Are you going to do anything for money?

292
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,230
It's an accident that you were born into this world.

293
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,420
accident!

294
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,620
Hey, accident, accident...

295
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,620
Damn it! You

296
00:31:52,970 --> 00:32:00,710
"This is evidence of the numerous fraudulent transactions that the Ise Group has been carrying out so far.

297
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:05,760
I have endured this for a long time.

298
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,120
Although it is called a sweeping

299
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,120
I've worked for them

300
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,200
"Tomorrow will finish everything"

301
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:32,800
Then there were two of us...

302
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,990
(The sound of the cup cracking)

303
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:14,320
(Vibrator sound)

304
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,300
hello.

305
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,900
Hanaho! Excuse me.

306
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,470
Why, why, how come this...

307
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:39,470
Brother. Brother, where is it?

308
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,580
Erika.

309
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,580
Erika... Yukiya.

310
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:55,850
Um, me...

311
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,850
I'm pregnant.

312
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,270
A child with Masayuki.

313
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:18,750
I know that it's a bad thing.

314
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,780
But I'm sorry.

315
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:27,780
This was the only way to make me happy.

316
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:36,190
I... I'm a really terrible person.

317
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:43,600
I couldn't contain my feelings, so I also did Yukiya's.

318
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:52,190
I've also hurt my sister.

319
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:05,380
But that's why I never thought I would do something like this.

320
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,380
I want to point it out.

321
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,170
sorry.

322
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:23,560
Sorry, what have you been saying for a while now?

323
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,750
picture?

324
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,600
I have no idea at all though.

325
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,600
yes? It's still the words though.

326
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:41,070
I only ask for one thing.

327
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,070
Separate from me.

328
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:51,620
Please divorce me.

329
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,390
What does that mean?

330
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:05,100
If you don't break up, I'll tell your dad.

331
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:15,540
What you're plotting.

332
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,230
(footsteps)

333
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,890
Everything was erased.

334
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:55,650
There's no way you could destroy the Ise family, right?

335
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:00,650
My Ise family.

336
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,930
Shut up and disappear.

337
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:11,930
For my happy life.

338
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,270
Dad.

339
00:37:25,270 --> 00:38:06,010
～

340
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:10,390
"I will never forgive you.

341
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:15,390
No matter how many years I'll take, I'll get revenge.
