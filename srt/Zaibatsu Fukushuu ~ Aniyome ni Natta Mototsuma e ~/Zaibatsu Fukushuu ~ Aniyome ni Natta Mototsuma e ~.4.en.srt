1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,840
Ise Kyoko is erased from that house.

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,600
Is it gone?

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,800
(Fuyu) No matter how many times I searched for that envelope, I couldn't find it.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:49,800
～

5
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,030
This is...

6
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,070
I was thinking of giving away a fountain pen to your father's desk.

7
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,260
What does it mean?

8
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,950
I don't know but

9
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,810
Something is about to snatch your mother

10
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,830
I can't think of it.

11
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,830
I guess Seiichiro wasn't watching.

12
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,270
Haa It can't be used.

13
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,140
So what do you think this guy said?

14
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,840
"Be careful of you."

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,190
sorry.

16
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:33,740
I'm jealous because I'm close to you.

17
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,100
It's not.

18
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,970
I'm really worried about your mother...

19
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,330
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,870
What you're worried about is the Ise group, right?

21
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,580
I don't care about me though.

22
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,270
That's what I'm planning...

23
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,980
Well, I'm sorry that the group is being affected by rumors.

24
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,860
Please wait a minute.

26
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,060
Why am I fooling Kyoko?

27
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,930
I understand how the president feels uneasy.

28
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:13,640
But I don't sell Kyoko-san or anything.

29
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,680
Kyoko is for me

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,680
He is such a benefactor that I can't thank you enough.

31
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,080
that's why….

32
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,350
This time I did something rude because I was so quick to dust.

33
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,350
very sorry.

34
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,440
I'll handle this for myself.

35
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,650
Don't worry about the rest.

36
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,510
I asked.

37
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,210
It's complicated when you involve Seiichiro.

38
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,560
Don't do anything unnecessary.

39
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,260
Yes, I'll handle it properly.

40
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,130
Before dinner, I was invited to something like this

41
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,480
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,350
Have fun.

43
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,880
thank you.

44
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:35,880
～

45
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,140
No, I was surprised when I received an email.

46
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,010
That's right, isn't it? That sudden thing

47
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,210
I'm sorry if it's rude... Yes.

48
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,060
Ise-san, can't you?

49
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,590
It has nothing to do with that Ise group, right?

50
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,290
Haha, Ah, did you get it?

51
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,820
Yes, it's my son.

52
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,170
What... is it true? ?

53
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,700
My son has a lot of stuff...

54
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,250
He welcomed me, who became an orphan, by chance

55
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,770
I am so grateful to my adoptive parents for raising me.

56
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,960
I see.

57
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,990
With that background, I started the Dahho family.

58
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,190
Then I found Marble's homepage

59
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,190
I was surprised when I saw the photo.

60
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,090
I think you're making a great effort

61
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,800
I would like to have a relaxed conversation again.

62
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,650
I'm glad you said that.

63
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,010
The efforts of the Dashou family are truly

64
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,530
It's in sync with our philosophy

65
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:44,580
That kind of person is the son of the Ise family... I'm so happy.

66
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,600
I feel like I've met a comrade.

67
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,460
This is the place.

68
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,990
Those who understand the position of managers

69
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,180
Because it wasn't there very often. That's right!

70
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,710
In fact, it's difficult just to continue.

71
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,410
Really. What is it like Ise-san doing about that?

72
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,940
Ah, I'm sorry.

73
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,320
For money... No, that's not the case.

74
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,680
Even after I entered society, I couldn't rely on my parents.

75
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,050
I'm mainly running a Ponzi scheme.

76
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,420
I spend the money I work every month. Is that so?

77
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,790
That's amazing, he has high aspirations.

78
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,990
But isn't it difficult? That's it.

79
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,010
It's difficult.

80
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,370
I've been doing it myself for a long time

81
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,560
There's no snake.

82
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,420
What is Satake-san doing about that?

83
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:39,130
Ah, me... Please wait a minute.

84
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,830
Do you know this kind of thing?

85
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,860
Meet Kyoko at the presentation.

86
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,720
Ah, I know, I know.

87
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,590
Even if I say I know, I'm really not good at things like this

88
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,300
I've never participated. Is that so? It's surprising.

89
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,330
I just couldn't have the courage to go alone...

90
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,030
Oh, then let's join together next time.

91
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:06,400
Is it true? No, I'm sorry.

92
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,400
It's ridiculous, and there must be Kyoko there too.

93
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,650
Ah, but Satake-san. yes.

94
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,500
This is what my mother said

95
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,210
Could you keep it a secret?

96
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,900
I'm worried.

97
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,590
If I knew I was in financial trouble

98
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,630
My mother isn't still.

99
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,630
Because I've been really loved.

100
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,350
(Seiichiro) "Happy Birthday Happy Birthday"

101
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,890
"Happy Birthday to You"

102
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,890
Congratulations. thank you.

103
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,030
happy! Looks tasty.

104
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:29,400
Mom is a present. Wow, thank you!

105
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:36,970
When did you buy it? happy.

106
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,970
Congratulations….

107
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,720
Fuyu-san's cake can you cut it for three people?

108
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,570
picture?

109
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,440
I'm tired of the party every day

110
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,130
I want to spend my time without my family getting in.

111
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:58,850
(Fuyu) Is it for three people? (Kyoko) That's good, isn't it? you.

112
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,400
You should do what you like. That's it.

113
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Please for 3 people

114
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,150
To balance childcare and work

115
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,530
What do you think? Of course, balancing childcare and work

116
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,570
It's never easy. I still cry at night

117
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,430
I was woken up every hour.

118
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,970
I'm already sleep-deprived every day.

119
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,830
It's cute, but

120
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,030
But I don't have time at all for myself.

121
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,560
Moreover, in such a responsible position

122
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,270
I was quite worried about getting it.

123
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,310
I cannot accept this with a feeling of misunderstanding.

124
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:06,700
But in the words of Ise Seiichiro, father of the Ise group

125
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,570
This is how I accepted it in an encouragement.

126
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,280
That's a very wonderful idea. thank you.

127
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,280
thank you. yes.

128
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,840
Please take a look. The article is about Erika.

129
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,430
That's amazing.

130
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:35,660
I wonder if Erika could talk about supporting her on the Marble homepage.

131
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,200
There are quite a few people around me who admire Erika.

132
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,060
From Kyoko's

133
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,250
Something like asking Erika to ask her out

134
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,440
Can't you do it?

135
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,960
Oh no, it's not good.

136
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,490
I wish I could have consulted you.

137
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,190
Thanks to Erika, we and Kyoko

138
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,550
This is how I can do it now.

139
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,550
I don't like it.

140
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,480
I wonder.

141
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,340
She says this in front of people

142
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:16,570
It's not at home anymore. Almost neglected childcare.

143
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,280
Well, even if she abandons it, I'll be there too.

144
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,280
There are also helpers so there's nothing wrong with that.

145
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:34,580
But I wonder what it would be like to admire her...

146
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,580
Your friends don't even see people either.

147
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,010
Ah, but at all a comment?

148
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,210
If you want it, I'll ask for it, right?

149
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:52,760
I guess it's not going to turn down that kind of thing.

150
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,630
But that's not about Satoru-kun

151
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,010
If her true appearance becomes known to the world

152
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:05,220
Isn't Marble's survival at risk?

153
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,580
A charity organization

154
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:13,310
If you knew that it was like a neglecting child care and that it was hanging out.

155
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,310
I agree.

156
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,240
Reo-kun. yes.

157
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,620
You're all leaders, right?

158
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,800
yes.

159
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,690
Article like this: You shouldn't trust me just because you've seen it all.

160
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,550
sorry….

161
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,420
But when I met in the CEO's office the other day

162
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,420
Erika is a sincere person.

163
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,830
Reo-kun.

164
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:54,880
Can I come to my usual room for a moment?

165
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,930
I'll talk about the future.

166
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:05,930
For two. There's something I want to talk about seriously.

167
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,290
About the complex to be built at the space hotel this time

168
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,480
I hope I can talk.

169
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,500
We have compiled the materials, so we will hand them out later.

170
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,520
thank you.

171
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,700
Then Takahashi, I'll just sort it out one more time.

172
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,700
I got it.

173
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,880
What's wrong? No, nothing.

174
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Let's go.

175
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,530
Kina-chan.

176
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,530
Yuki-nii! !

177
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,120
Hey!

178
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,310
What about Kina-chan, mom?

179
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,500
Work! Um, suddenly

180
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,690
There was someone who was feeling sick.

181
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,390
So I decided to go instead.

182
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:24,450
When you're in trouble, you both are there. I agree.

183
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,640
So, Kina-chan, what about dinner today?

184
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,000
There's a chin. I see.

185
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,710
But I'm alone until late.

186
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,240
I'll try contacting my mom.

187
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,930
If you like, will you go to the Daho family with Yuki-nii brother?

188
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,290
Yes, go! OK!

189
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,290
So let's make a call. Yeah!

190
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,190
Ah, are you Moshi Kina's mom?

191
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,640
Good luck. please.

192
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,330
thank you. yes.

193
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,510
Are you all there? Yeah!

194
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,380
Okay. Let's put our hands together.

195
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,410
(Everyone will be served.

196
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,590
Looks tasty.

197
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:52,160
～

198
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,160
Hey, why?

199
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,090
Kyoko-san, that's not true.

200
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,620
What's the difference?

201
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,330
You said it would make me happy, right?

202
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:13,030
That's... I said that though.

203
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,030
So why?

204
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,140
Is it not possible for me at all?

205
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,330
That's not what it is...

206
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:31,330
That's fine. That there was a day like this.

207
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,170
What is it... Erika-san, Erika-san.

208
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:48,050
What's better about that girl? That's how it is...

209
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,240
I'm to you

210
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,120
How much do you think you're giving? yeah? 100 million?

211
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,140
If I wasn't there

212
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,140
Isn't this a number that you've never had a connection with?

213
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,060
You're a benefactor, right?

214
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:17,340
You can't thank them enough, right?

215
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:23,230
I want to take this project seriously.

216
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,440
Kyoko-san also agreed with that, right?

217
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,140
Yes, of course.

218
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,160
Being proud of as an investor

219
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,160
You said that, right?

220
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,550
What are you saying something sweet?

221
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,430
Are you serious, right?

222
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,830
If you want to be a full-fledged person

223
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,370
Please entertain me.

224
00:17:53,370 --> 00:18:29,370
～

225
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:50,770
～

226
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,970
(The sound of sliding door opening)

227
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,330
Sorry I'm late. No no, not at all.

228
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:02,330
Thank you for your hard work, you've become a good girl.

229
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,650
Sorry, I've become so attached to you...

230
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,330
Now I'm always at home

231
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,330
Yuki-brother You say Yuki-brother.

232
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:27,120
I think this child is happy because he doesn't know his father.

233
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,150
is that so.

234
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,010
I always feel lonely because of me

235
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:38,730
Because it's Kina... That's what it is...

236
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,920
Is your work irregular?

237
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,620
It's an izakaya, but I've only just started it

238
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,970
I don't know what it is.

239
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,660
It was also in the news the other day

240
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,530
Do you know about the power harassment president of iSE InterFashion?

241
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,570
Eh, huh...

242
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,270
I was working at the Shibuya store over there.

243
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,130
Well, it's a contract.

244
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,990
The president has become a woman, right?

245
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,540
I'm almost fired because I'm paying for retirement benefits.

246
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,260
The previous president... That's right

247
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,940
Well, it's exactly as I imagined

248
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,650
He was the kind of person who would let me work if I kept quiet and listened to what I was saying.

249
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,830
For the current one...

250
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,530
It openly calls for balancing child-rearing

251
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,050
The reality is the exact opposite.

252
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,580
It's because when you have children it's difficult

253
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,580
It appears that single parents are being fired first.

254
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,490
Ah, sorry, this is the story.

255
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,860
Ah...

256
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,910
I feel like I'm guilty about this child...

257
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,760
You'll also be experiencing this kind of thing

258
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,140
I'm starting to think that I'm not good at everything...

259
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,850
Sorry I couldn't tell anyone forever.

260
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,380
home.

261
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,400
Mom.

262
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,940
Kina-chan, please keep me waiting.

263
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,300
That's good...

264
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,300
good morning.

265
00:21:34,720 --> 00:22:02,670
～

266
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:07,390
"Kyoko-san, I was shaken by something suddenly today

267
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:11,920
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

268
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,460
I'm grateful to Kyoko

269
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,980
I respect it.

270
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,350
This feeling doesn't change anything.

271
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:25,730
I hope to continue building good relationships in the future.

272
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:31,790
I look forward to seeing you at the weekend party.

273
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,650
We look forward to your continued support.

274
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,650
Satake Reiyo”.

275
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,920
Thank you for your cooperation today.

276
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,920
thank you.

277
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,660
What's wrong? Ah, no...

278
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:57,390
Um... Actually, it's my mother's birthday next week.

279
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:02,100
Can you give me this watch as a present from Satake?

280
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,960
Huh?

281
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,820
If I give something expensive like this, I'll give you a gift.

282
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,680
They don't hesitate to accept it.

283
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,710
As you said before

284
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,080
If Satake is grateful to her mother

285
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,620
I think it will also be a small repayment.

286
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,650
I think it'll be happy...

287
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,700
For Marble, it's good to be in a good mood for her mother.

288
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,700
It's important, isn't it?

289
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,630
Hahaha... Lie. Lie.

290
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:44,520
That's a joke, and this is my request.

291
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,210
I want to see my mother's happy face.

292
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,210
Thank you for your cooperation.

293
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,470
got it.

294
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:08,470
～

295
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,330
Kyoko-san.

296
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:20,380
Reo-kun. I'm sorry the other day.

297
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,380
Yeah.

298
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,940
Mom, it's been a while.

299
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,730
I met him by chance the other day.

300
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,750
Hearing the story of the Daho family, hit it off

301
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,450
Yukiya also said he is looking for a partner to meet investors.

302
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,650
So, the two of us discussed the philosophy of each organization.

303
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,680
I was talking about how I think and the direction I aim for

304
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,680
They're very similar, so...

305
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:01,290
I'll hear that next week is your birthday.

306
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:05,330
From Reo to me?

307
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,020
yes.

308
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,020
Can I open it? Of course.

309
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,120
thank you.

310
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,260
Thank you for being able to attend such a meeting.

311
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,130
I will do my best to participate again. please.

312

～

313
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,720
"Happy Birthday to You"

314
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Thank you. (applause)

315
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,150
happy! Thank you very much!

316
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,350
Good, it looks tasty.

317
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,370
(Kyoko) Looks tasty. (Masayuki) What? mother

318
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,890
How old have you become? (Kyoko) I don't know.

319
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,930
(Masayuki) I don't know... (Kyoko) I haven't counted it.

320
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:09,310
I will be on a trip with Seiichiro from next week.

321
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:14,520
(Masayuki) Yes, have fun. Mom, we had wine.

322
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,040
congratulations. If you like it

323
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,910
It's fine though. (Kyoko) Thank you very much!

324
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,950
I wonder if I'll take it to a trip. (Seiichiro) That's right.

325
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,140
(Kyoko) Can I open it? (Masayuki) Of course.

326
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,330
That's a bit surprising. It's amazing, isn't it?

327
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:32,690
That's a good thing too. thank you.

328
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,560
Ah, it's a bit rude to someone at work. Excuse me.

329
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:43,560
(Vibrator sound)

330
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,330
hello?

331
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:58,290
～

332
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:03,840
What is it? I'm celebrating my mother's birthday.

333
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:33,840
～

334
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,770
"Ise Masayuki.

335
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:11,640
Your mother, Ise Kyoko, is

336
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,840
Up until now, the Ise family has used its large assets.

337
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,890
The total amount is over 2 billion under the guise of investment

338
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:24,270
It has been poured into the miserable temper for infidelity.

339
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:28,980
If you doubt this is true or not,

340
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:37,400
"Please go to Room 1608 at the Royal Pines Hotel on December 5th."

341
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,430
Dad, please tell me a word from Dad already.

342
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:44,310
It would be the worst if something like this was left out by a weekly magazine again.

343
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:49,310
It makes me embarrassed to call myself a member of the Ise family.

344
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:20,660
～

345
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:25,660
Happy birthday to Kyoko once again.

346
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,830
happy.

347
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:41,210
Also, I'm really sorry about this the other day.

348
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:45,250
That's fine as long as you understand it.

349
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,450
We look forward to your continued support.

350
00:29:48,450 --> 00:30:34,240
～

351
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,240
Isn't this the best entertainment?

352
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,850
What are you doing?

353
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:11,060
You... why are you here?

354
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,330
Who are you?

355
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,690
This person is my wife though.

356
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:25,240
At least until just now.

357
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Um... Suddenly to this child. Kyoko-san! ?

358
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,490
Shameful.

359
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:43,260
That me was threatened. a?

360
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,260
I'm sorry!

361
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:56,890
I was suddenly attacked by that girl! noisy.

362
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,750
That doesn't matter.

363
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:05,810
But for you, I'll never live again

364
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:08,810
I won't give you any money I can make freely.

365
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,040
I won't allow him to leave the house either.

366
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,810
I don't want it, I don't want it... noisy.

367
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,180
How good do you think you've felt up until now?

368
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:29,180
Are you still planning to shame the Ise family?

369
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,580
From the beginning, you have no freedom.

370
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,020
Be aware.

371
00:32:50,100 --> 00:33:09,780
～

372
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,990
Checkmate.

373
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:50,030
～

374
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:54,030
(footsteps)

375
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
Why are you here?

376
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:08,330
Was it your work that sent Seiichiro?

377
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,920
Something to say!

378
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,500
How do you feel?

379
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:33,460
The feeling of being pushed into the abyss.

380
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:37,000
Being abandoned and made fun of

381
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
The feeling of being trampled down.

382
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,240
What is it?

383
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,110
Me...

384
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:52,110
I'm not going to forgive you for the rest of my life.

385
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,570
Take the mother's stab.

386
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:07,570
I'll destroy you guys no more.

387
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,520
I'm going to tell Seiichiro.

388
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,230
You know what will happen?

389
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,750
why?

390
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,610
Why do you guys?

391
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:25,810
Do I have to be faced with this kind of thing?

392
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:30,810
Originally, it was all your mother's fault.

393
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,390
teeth?

394
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:48,040
What caused my mother to suffer...

395
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,040
It's you guys!

396
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:59,650
what goes around comes around.

397
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,650
It's rust that's coming out of your body.

398
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:23,730
Thank you for entertaining me.

399
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:26,730
mother.

400
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,800
It was the best entertainment.

401
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,530
(The sound of the door closing)

402
00:36:37,530 --> 00:37:37,130
～

403
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:41,130
This is a letter from Erika.

404
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:07,100

00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,300
