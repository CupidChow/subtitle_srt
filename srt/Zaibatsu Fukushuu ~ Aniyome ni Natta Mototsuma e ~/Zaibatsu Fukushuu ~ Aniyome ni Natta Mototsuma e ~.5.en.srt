1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,370
Mom, it's been a while. I met him by chance the other day.

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,190
We hit it off after hearing about the Dagaho family...

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,560
I heard that next week is my birthday... thank you.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,930
Isn't this the best entertainment?

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,460
How do you feel?

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,480
Shameful.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,510
The feeling of being pushed into the abyss...

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,380
I have no intention of forgiving you all forever.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,380
Avenge your mother. I'll destroy you guys all the time.

10
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,590
Mama, what did you do?

11
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,620
A bit... my appetite...

12
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,830
I don't need dinner. Have it in your room...

13
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,360
You said you didn't need it!

14
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,360
I got it.

15
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,560
Dad...

16
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,610
Isn't it okay now?

17
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,490
You said it, please do something.

18
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,490
Because... it could even be photographed in a weekly magazine...

19
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,490
So that's good, isn't it?

20
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,290
He protected the Ise family.

21
00:02:33,290 --> 00:03:19,290
～

22
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,280
president….

23
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
I wonder if he's definitely him.

24
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,840
Find out more.

25
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,840
If you know anything, let me know right away. got it.

26
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:32,420
～

27
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,610
good morning. good morning.

28
00:05:35,610 --> 00:06:12,820
～

29
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,680
I thought these people were family

30
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,730
I've never been, and eventually I'll cut ties with the Ise family.

31
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,270
I want to live together with you.

32
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,480
If you don't break up, I'll tell my father-in-law.

33
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,480
What you're plotting...

34
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:43,280
Everything was erased.

35
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,150
There's no way you could destroy the Ise family.

36
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,180
My Ise family!

37
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,050
Shut up and disappear!

38
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,760
For my happy life

39
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:23,760
～

40
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:56,690
(Telephone ringing)

41
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:33,730
～

42
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,730
"Did you think you didn't have a backup? 》

43
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,640
See you later.

44
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,700
Mercer. Masak.

45
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,560
Hmm. Hmm, yes.

46
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,770
The weather is nice again today.

47
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,980
Shall we go for a walk with mom?

48
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,700
Hey Mercer.

49
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,250
Mercer... huh...

50
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,250
Mercer.

51
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:59,630
～

52
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,110
Entertainment?

53
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,410
Thank you for entertaining me.

54
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,410
mother.

55
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,320
It was the best entertainment

56
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:37,320
～

57
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,650
Hanaho.

58
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:51,540
I've been a little flapping lately...

59
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,540
Sorry I couldn't come very often.

60
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,740
you know what….

61
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,120
I'm now...

62
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,820
He is taking revenge on the Ise family.

63
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:50,460
～

64
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:56,180
Please wait.

65
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:00,180
I'll definitely make it a success.

66
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:13,860
I'm going to accept it... I'll be able to let you go.

67
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:28,860
～

68
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:51,830
Mother brought tea.

69
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:26,900
～

70
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,940
Hello. yes.

71
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,940
Hello.

72
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,760
delicious? Yeah.

73
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,960
Is everyone delicious too? Yes it's tasty.

74
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,650
What do you all like? A fried egg... salad.

75
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,690
Have you ever added natto to omelette? there is!

76
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:01,230
It's tasty. I'll eat bread and some more.

77
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,250
Do you eat bread? Yeah!

78
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,950
The bread is also delicious.

79
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,820
Yuki-brother Reo-kun See you tomorrow.

80
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,530
bye bye. thank you very much.

81
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,530
be careful.

82
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:22,070
bye bye! see you tomorrow. bye bye. Yes, then.

83
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,020
Wow... It's really good at the Koho family.

84
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,060
Just as I imagined. is that so.

85
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,060
I really wanted to create a space like this too...

86
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,500
Marble is...

87
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,540
It's been disbanded.

88
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,560
I wonder what to explain...

89
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,560
It's become a bit of a hassle...

90
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,670
In the end, Kyoko ends up leaving her...

91
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:04,540
Marble can no longer continue.

92
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,580
I see. but….

93
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,580
My ideal was already here.

94
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:19,310
The Daho family... Could you join us?

95
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,790
It's always bad...

96
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,660
He's relying solely on Nobuo...

97
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,860
This is the one who's been helped.

98
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,860
The other reporter... what happened?

99
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,460
Right... Please take a look at the situation for a while

100
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,460
If your attitude doesn't change, you can do whatever you like.

101
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,740
It's helpful... If it's noisy, I'll transfer more.

102
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,280
Seriously.

103
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,280
Stop... stop. (Coughing)

104
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,750
(knock)

105
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,990
there was.

106
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,990
This is in the clock.

107
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,260
Yes! Go!

108
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,440
nice!

109
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
So let's add up.

110
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,360
The other day's incident... I think it's strange after all.

111
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,730
My secretary is now taking action too

112
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,600
I should do some more research on this one too.

113
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,460
Why did this guy approach my mother?

114
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,650
Is there another mastermind?

115
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:34,370
I guess they're probably just looking for money anyway, but I have to crush it early.

116
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:38,580
It would be a waste if something unnecessary was done any more.

117
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,580
Yes... Actually, from me too...

118
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:50,180
This is what happened right after Satoshi's incident...

119
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,230
This arrived the day after that day...

120
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,230
What is this...

121
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:04,670
This is the watch that my mother gave to Marble's Satake Reo.

122
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:09,380
A GPS and a wiretap were found inside.

123
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,380
What's for...

124
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,970
Revenge on us...

125
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,840
revenge? Yes.

126
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,220
That's why I had a connection with my mother.

127
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,220
Someone used Satake Reo.

128
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,500
I made this watch come as a present to my mother...

129
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,530
Ise Yukiya.

130
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,530
(Masayuki) What?

131
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,450
All of the attacks so far are Yukiya's

132
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,480
I'm sure you think it's something that's going on.

133
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:59,050
Yukiya hates us, the Ise family.

134
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,750
What are you talking about... that guy who has no relatives

135
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,600
It was us who took it over!

136
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,640
How hard has it been since that came to my house?

137
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,640
So, leave it alone?

138
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:17,400
Once this happens, I have no choice but to admit it.

139
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,940
We have no choice but to take the lead.

140
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:29,010
Yukiya has always had a grudge against the Ise family, who oppressed him.

141
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:34,010
I vowed that I'll get revenge one day...

142
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:43,320
I don't think that person will quit.

143
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,320
Until the other three faces were crushed.

144
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,780
What caused my mother to suffer...

145
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,780
It's you guys!

146
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:11,100
Father, please!

147
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,630
Before that happens...

148
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,630
Please erase Ise Yukiya.

149
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:43,430
～

150
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,290
(Yukiya/Saori) "Smile-glittering"

151
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,840
"I want you."

152
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,550
To protect this factory with everyone who worked here.

153
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,570
dangerous! Mom!

154
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,590
No no! Mom!

155
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:26,590
～

156
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,530
Is me okay too?

157
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,530
Ah.

158
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,140
that…. Erika-san

159
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,170
There's no need to worry.

160
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:03,170
Yukiya can't do anything anyway.

161
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,740
Are you not planning to deal with it?

162
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,840
Yukiya has been around since we met

163
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,050
My father always said he couldn't forgive me.

164
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,050
You more than anyone else in the Ise family...

165
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,970
I don't know what I'll do if it continues like this.

166
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:35,550
I'm worried about my father.

167
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,550
Erika... yes.

168
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,930
It's not that you thrust your head in.

169
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:51,830
But it's just like this... Doesn't matter to you?

170
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:02,650
Yukiya definitely hates me too.

171
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:07,650
Because I abandoned him. I don't know.

172
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:16,620
This is the issue of the Ise family.

173
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,620
Stay quiet.

174
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,690
Excuse me.

175
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:44,220
(Fuyu) I haven't heard everything but...

176
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,770
(Fuyu) Erika seems to be starting to feel suspicious

177
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,960
Talk to your master...

178
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,660
Understood, thank you.

179
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,700
No... um... so botch, it's just crazy...

180
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,700
Finally... it's begun.

181
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,650
If you absolutely don't want to be found out

182
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,650
I won't send you any photos from the beginning.

183
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:21,260
Just be scared to your heart's content.

184
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:28,260
When... how will my face be crushed?

185
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,880
Oh... Ah, just as it is!

186
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,070
Let's go and get it!

187
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,940
(Masayuki) Sorry Nobuo-san.

188
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,460
No no no... Please contact me

189
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,320
I was looking forward to coming today.

190
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,860
I wonder if I'll meet Erika... Masa-kun is

191
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,210
Ever since I was born. Yes.

192
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,060
Thank you for your busy schedule.

193
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,250
No no, what... Masa-kun, what? Have you grown bigger?

194
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,270
fine? Yes, thanks.

195
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,960
Ah, yes... good, good, good.

196
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,310
Next time, please let me come and play with you.

197
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,310
please. Hahaha...

198
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,180
So... what's wrong? Today we're together and we've had something to do with it...

199
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:56,620
(Vibrator sound)

200
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:04,290
(Seiichiro) I have no idea about your intentions.

201
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,290
Who do you think you're dealing with?

202
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,180
If your life is a shame, stop it.

203
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
I won't stop.

204
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,500
I've come this far with the determination to stab me wrong.

205
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:37,740
It's impossible to forgive you in the rest of your life.

206
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:45,540
"Glittering"

207
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,390
What...

208
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:52,940
"Glittering"

209
00:27:52,940 --> 00:28:12,810
～

210
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:16,850
Where is it now... Yukiya...

211
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,870
Ah... uh...

212
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,870
(Fuyu) Master, are you okay? ? (The sound of a call being cut off)

213
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,590
Fuyu-san...

214
00:28:35,870 --> 00:29:03,150
～

215
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:06,180
It was bad. no.

216
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:49,250
～

217
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,450
Boy...

218
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,330
(Fuyu) Boy!

219
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:04,330
What happened at this time...

220
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,580
Where were you this evening?

221
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,960
Huh? With whom... where were you?

222
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,490
Umm...

223
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:21,370
He left a little with his master's attendant.

224
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:25,400
You forgot the pendant, right?

225
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,420
I'm sorry.

226
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:31,470
While cleaning the attic... On purpose... right?

227
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,490
No way!

228
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,680
I purposely left the pendant in the attic.

229
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,710
If I could look at it, I could make excuses like I am now.

230
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:43,080
That's what I'm planning... So, can you tell me?

231
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,630
Where were you with him today? it is….

232
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,630
Why... were you in that town?

233
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,600
I don't understand.

234
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
I don't know anything.

235
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,320
Really?

236
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,320
yes.

237
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:15,740
Isn't it hiding something?

238
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,740
yes….

239
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,640
I see...

240
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:33,360
Well... that's right.

241
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:42,340
You can't say anything anyway...

242
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:48,340
After all... because they are servants of the Ise family.

243
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,630
You may not betray me.

244
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:58,630
Maybe they won't bully them.

245
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,350
but….

246
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,620
Not on your side.

247
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:23,580
～

248
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:29,140
Since I lost my mother... I was a child too

249
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,170
I think it's true that I was looking for it.

250
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:37,170
Someone who will take your mother's place.

251
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:45,310
For me back then...

252
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:49,310
That was nothing but you could think of it.

253
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:59,550
I was the one who didn't notice until this age...

254
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:08,140
I wonder what... Maybe it was because they had the lid on.

255
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:19,770
I didn't want to notice.

256
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:31,600
You have ever...

257
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,660
He never risked his life to protect me.

258
00:33:37,660 --> 00:34:13,660
～

259
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:23,450
(Reo) Yukiya. Ah... What?

260
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:27,150
What's up? Ah, no...

261
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,510
I was dazed, but...

262
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,370
Yes... nothing.

263
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,370
So that's good.

264
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,260
thank you.

265
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,080
Yukiya-san, this is OK.

266
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,270
Is there anything you can help?

267
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,460
This one seems to be over, so it's fine.

268
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,650
Thank you for your hard work.

269
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:36,340
Thank you for your hard work.

270
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,710
Yukiya-san, will you have time after this?

271
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,920
Huh? Something... I'll change

272
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,950
I wanted to talk slowly about what will happen next...

273
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:50,320
Ah... That's good.

274
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,500
I had never gone out drinking either.

275
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,200
Yes! I found a good shop across the street

276
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,390
So what do you think? Yeah.

277
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:01,390
So I'll just check the door lock. yes.

278
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:27,350
Huh? I might have been confused.

279
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,350
Ah, absolutely... sorry.

280
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,970
Ise Yukiya 9:19 PM on suspicion of violating the Act on Protection of Specific Secrets

281
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,970
I'll arrest him. teeth?

282
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,180
Huh? Hey!

283
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,600
It's your own fault.

284
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:21,400
It was Yukiya who used me first...

285
00:37:21,400 --> 00:38:11,900
～
