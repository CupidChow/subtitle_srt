1
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:08,720
I'm pregnant. A child with Masayuki.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,940
Shut up and disappear. For my happy life.

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,940
"I was constantly being fooled"

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,020
"I will never forgive everyone"

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,460
"Goshi-kun really doesn't change."

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,480
That's what you're saying!

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,190
What is this... Who is it? Come out!

8
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,210
Hey!

9
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,210
Cheers to the two pathetic.

10
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,140
What is this?

11
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,760
Even so, Satoru's armpits are also sweet.

12
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,460
Wasn't someone fucking you?

13
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,160
It seems he hated him.

14
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,010
That's what it means...

15
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,060
Hey, how long are you standing still? That's an eyelash.

16
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,080
sorry.

17
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:41,310
Slowly! Just stop it.

18
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,830
Hey.

19
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:48,220
There is no dinner for the underdog.

20
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,220
Right.

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,920
I'll never forgive you.

22
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,020
In the end

23
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,220
Only Erika was cheering for me.

24
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,220
That's what I'm planning...

25
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,010
The whole family is an apology press conference

26
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,010
How embarrassing I was.

27
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,710
Kyoko said exactly.

28
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,910
You smeared the Ise family.

29
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,910
Go out.

30
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,680
(Satoshi) Ah... ah...

31
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,230
sorry. Please forgive me, Uncle!

32
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,590
uncle!

33
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,970
Keep that clean too. It's unpleasant.

34
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,970
(Fuyu) Yes.

35
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,580
"As expected, mom.

36
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,780
You've always had a bad personality.

37
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,480
The only weapon is that man's wife

38
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,010
I've been at that position.

39
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,050
I was adopted by the Ise family and treated me as a nuisance.

40
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,580
I've trampled on it many times

41
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,270
it hurts….

42
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,300
You! Ah, it's not possible.

43
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,300
help me.

44
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,250
Kyoko

45
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,250
"Just because he's his wife."

46
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:23,090
"That's why mom.

47
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,090
The way to erase you is very simple.

48
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,860
What should I take?

49
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,860
Because it's extremely easy to understand

54
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,310
Masa-kun, have a snack.

55
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,350
Thank you for your hard work. Looks tasty.

56
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,350
here you are. I'll enjoy having this.

57
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,680
Yeah! delicious? good.

58
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,680
I wonder if this was made because my cute child would please me.

59
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,930
Here it is!

60
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,930
Please don't touch Masa-kun's snack with dirty hands.

61
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,820
Your mother is the most dirty person in the world.

62
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,750
What is that face?

63
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,750
You're the same.

64
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,000
Because my mother died

65
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,030
You think you're a poor girl, right?

66
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,900
Whether it's adopted or what

67
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:28,780
I will not leave you at least a single yen of the Ise family's assets.

68
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,800
Of course, right?

69
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,800
I'm grateful that you'll be fed.

70
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,700
Stop those eyes.

71
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,280
You're me, in my word

72
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,280
It's easy to kick him out of this house.

73
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,360
I'm not like your mother

74
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,360
He is Seiichiro's real wife

75
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:33,260
～

76
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:43,260
(Vibrator sound)

77
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,760
If you find a security hole, take action immediately.

78
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,620
I don't have time to go home.

79
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,330
If something like that happens again, my image would be the worst.

80
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,550
Do your job by thinking it's all about your own responsibility.

81
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,550
(Employees) Yes.

82
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,020
Is it okay to see something like this?

83
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,020
The only one who comes here is Yukiya Botchan.

84
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:54,030
I'll come back again. Excuse me.

85
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,170
Unusually, the master

86
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,040
He told me to go and see Hanaho-sama

87
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,250
It's been a while since I was able to come.

88
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,250
Did something happen?

89
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,320
I think it's just that I'm afraid.

90
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,180
After something like Goshi Bocchan

91
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,210
It's interesting and prying into the inside of the Ise family

92
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,410
There is also movement in the media.

93
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,770
If you can go back to Hanaho-sama

94
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,770
I wonder if they think it's troublesome.

95
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,590
Yukiya bocchan.

96
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:51,140
After that incident, the IT systems department of the Ise Group also

97
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,350
We patrol the internet 24 hours a day.

98
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,350
It's only a matter of time before we get discovered.

99
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,450
What does it mean?

100
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,640
Do you mean backing down here?

101
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,670
home. but….

102
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,030
I'm just

103
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:17,030
I'm worried about Yukiya Botchan.

104
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,470
Yeah.

105
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,470
Sorry I know.

106
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,590
But...

107
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,590
Do you think I'll lose?

108
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,830
I've been enduring it for 25 years.

109
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,450
Fuyu-san. yes.

110
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,530
Ever since then

111
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,570
I have only you.

112
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,570
Yes, I know.

113
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,660
I don't betray the little ones.

114
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,660
Instead, please don't do it.

115
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,970
Oh, going out?

116
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,490
mother.

117
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,190
Yes. About the future of iSE InterFashion

118
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,380
Apparently your father has a talk.

119
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,070
yes.

120
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,070
Is your mother now too?

121
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,660
Yes, there's a bit of dinner.

122
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,660
With the children who invested. is that so.

123
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:18,280
I told Seiichiro that it'll be a little late tonight.

124
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,460
got it.

125
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,660
I've asked Fuyu about Miyabi.

126
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,660
Are you going to be that late too?

127
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,410
You'll just have to talk a little with Seiichiro, right?

128
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,280
Because your mother is late

129
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Father said we should do it outside too.

130
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,880
something.

131
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,410
You have to be careful.

132
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,410
Because it seems like I love it.

133
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,480
Don't think you can get anything.

134
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,380
yes….

135
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,250
I had heard in advance that there were three people today.

136
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,940
Was it okay to have two people?

137
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,130
yes. I got it.

138
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll call you again when it's time

139
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,190
I hope you will wait here.

140
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,380
Satake Satake Is the graph here correct? Are you okay?

141
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,400
Yes, it's okay. good.

142
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:43,460
Don't you get excited about school amusement parks? You do it, right?

143
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,500
I think I could make you feel that way.

144
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,190
That's all!

145
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:54,570
I'm sure I'll be able to succeed, so I really want you to invest in me!

146
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,570
I won't let you regret it. thank you!

147
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,320
thank you.

148
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
thank you very much!

149
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,320
Hey, do you guys feel that way?

150
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,010
Just listening to it makes me tired.

151
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,540
I said I hate macho people.

152
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,080
sorry. There will be a break next time.

153
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,080
yes.

154
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,810
Please try the next person.

155
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Excuse me.

156
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,910
Excuse me.

157
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,290
Excuse me.

158
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,990
So it's for the younger generation who will be taking on the future.

159
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,020
The government's services are not being properly handled

160
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,380
I think there are pitfalls.

161
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,410
Maybe it's family circumstances or not getting used to school

162
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,430
Some people have been triggered by resignation

163
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,290
There are various cases, but that's what you'll get to know.

164
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,150
The proportion of people who fall out of society

165
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:46,520
The most common is in the early 20s, followed by the late 20s

166
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,880
It continues in my late teens.

167
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,410
We at Marble have these pitfalls

168
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,430
I want to block each one.

169
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,290
Individuals and society are in a solid mix

170
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,320
At the same time, we aim to create a society where we never lose individual colors

171
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,190
I want to support isolated young people and their families.

172
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:07,730
This is how young people can walk in peace

173
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,730
I want to build it firmly. That's how I think so.

174
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,820
That's amazing.

175
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:26,050
Please support me.

176
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,480
(Three people) Thank you!

177
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,360
It is to support young people like you

178
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,240
It was also my wish as an investor.

179
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,600
This is... yes

180
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,150
As an investor, he seems to be saying something weird

181
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:54,700
I'm not thinking about making a profit at all.

182
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,570
For me, investment

183
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,570
Investing in your own purpose in life.

184
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,160
By supporting you

185
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,160
I'm sure I'll be truly satisfied.

186
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,600
that's why

187
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,640
Please don't disappoint me.

188
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,660
yes!

189
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,360
(3 people) Thank you very much!

190
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,240
I'd like to talk about the future right away

191
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,290
Representative... This is Satake. My name is Satake Reo.

192
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,830
Reo-kun. Can I leave a little bit?

193
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,830
yes!

194
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,960
Reo: That's kind of good. nostalgic

195
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,580
Reo-kun.

196
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,650
Hmm.

197
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,230
It was helpful. Thanks to Erika.

198
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,930
That's it... More than achievements

199
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:47,820
It's an age where image is important.

200
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,030
Anyway, who is it done?

201
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,880
Yes.

202
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,420
I can't believe we're being threatened by this.

203
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,110
I agree.

204
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,110
I asked you to improve your image? yes.

205
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,700
But I'm not a company president...

206
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,240
Hahaha I'm not expecting it.

207
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,450
You're an interfashion advertiser, right?

208
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,470
A poster girl.

209
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,990
Erika is

210
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,200
That's fine as long as you smile.

211
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,220
That's the best.

212
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,220
The practical aspects will be done here, so there's nothing to worry about.

213
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,660
thank you.

214
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,660
Sorry, I'll go to the restroom a little. Yeah.

215
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,210
Fuyu-san. yes.

216
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,210
May I ask you to see it? yes.

217
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,480
thank you. home.

218
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,590
what happened?

219
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,620
It's still like a dream.

220
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,310
It was a company that I started out with a groping hush.

221
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,340
I had a spirit of hitting and breaking it

222
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,720
I've never been able to meet anyone who can help me.

223
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,580
That's why I met Ise-sama like this.

224
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,940
It looks like a miracle.

225
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,300
Wait a minute, stop saying Ise-sama.

226
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,330
It's strict. Kyoko-san is fine.

227
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,360
picture? No no no. It's fine It's fine.

228
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,060
For those who have become a relationship like this

229
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,420
That's what I've been called for before.

230
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,420
Is that so? That's right.

231
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,170
Well, it's a good opportunity

232
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:41,380
One thing for you, as a manager, I will continue to do it from now on

233
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,410
I'll teach you the important things.

234
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,260
yes.

235
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,260
Be an entertainer.

236
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,530
Whatever business it deals with, it means running a company.

237
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:00,400
You are all good business owners.

238
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,260
If you want to be a top manager

239
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,960
However, it's not good to just slap Noh writing seriously.

240
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,980
Something not interesting.

241
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,850
sorry. Yes, that's fine.

242
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:14,380
I can feel Reo's sincere feelings

243
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,230
I think it was good.

244
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,260
But what I want to say is

245
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,260
That alone doesn't work.

246
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,380
I want you to enjoy this more.

247
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,070
I want you to be excited.

248
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,070
It's not strict.

249
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,970
You seem to know nothing about the world yet.

250
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,250
If you want to be a top manager

251
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:57,470
First of all, please make me excited.

252
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,470
The story begins then.

253
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,790
Ah, it's about to leave. Turn the car.

254
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,810
(Fuyu) I'm insane.

255
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:18,510
What about Kyoko? I haven't been home yet.

256
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:21,510
What are you doing until this time?

257
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,800
(Shutter sound)

258
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:42,090
So why is it at this time?

259
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:46,800
About Masa, he left him alone and his mother was too unaware of his self.

260
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,330
About your father and future business plans

261
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,520
Get excited.

262
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,220
You can't cut it off from me, right?

263
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:01,440
I also want to become a great president like Masayuki.

264
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,980
Don't do it with interfashion.

265
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,980
I am the president of Ise Bussan.

266
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,390
sorry.

267
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:18,280
The world is currently paying attention to the work I'm involved in.

268
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,810
You know? Yes.

269
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:25,350
The weight of responsibility is different from that of other managers.

270
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,350
It's not just a parent to do it.

271
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,450
It's already enough.

272
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,450
Erika is my wife, right?

273
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,360
I know.

274
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,890
Special seats are envious of everyone.

275
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,890
You've finally become happy.

276
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,610
happy.

277
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,320
The question is who and how to use it?

278
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,110
By exhausting Ise Seiichiro's affection

279
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,110
Ise Kyoko...

280
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,570
《Erase from that house》

281
00:26:37,570 --> 00:27:04,570
～

282
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:17,600
(humming)

283
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,620
That's wonderful.

284
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,310
what? Sudden.

285
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:25,350
Sorry I could hear you hear a happy voice.

286
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,200
Hey.

287
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,240
Do you think this or this is better?

288
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,780
I think both suit your mother.

289
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,980
This clothing silhouette is lovely.

290
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,670
Gray is trending this year

291
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:44,370
I think this is the best place to eat with younger people.

292
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:49,420
So maybe I'll go this way as the president says.

293
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,270
I'm sorry.

294
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,960
copper? Try starting work.

295
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,150
Not at all yet.

296
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:58,680
Ah, you said Seiichiro, right?

297
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,720
I'm glad that you've made you the president.

298
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,240
Well, now

299
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,120
You're the best.

300
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,120
Well, please do your best. yes.

301
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,730
mother.

302
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,630
I'd like to ask you something that's not true, but...

303
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:31,670
Are you worried about people you've been friends with lately?

304
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,360
what?

305
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,080
Since Satoshi had happened, I've been strangely concerned about people's eyes.

306
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,110
Father is approaching new people

307
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:46,320
Be careful. What weird are you talking about?

308
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,530
I guess Satoshi-kun was because he had grudges with others, right?

309
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:53,060
It's not good to do things that make people grudge.

310
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,580
Seeds sown by myself.

311
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,270
Poor thing, but there's nothing I can do about it.

312
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,460
I agree.

313
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,150
It's on SNS now

314
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,010
What do you mean to the Ise family?

315
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:07,880
Just a bored person. Former idol or something

316
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,880
If you have an affair, you'll jump straight ahead.

317
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,300
surely.

318
00:29:45,080 --> 00:31:19,350
～

319
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,350
Checkmate.

320
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:27,760
Your hands are too honest.

321
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,300
You have to confuse me more.

322
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,330
Kyoko-san, you're strong.

323
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,040
Chess cannot be performed by someone with a kind heart.

324
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:43,590
Apparently it's a French proverb.

325
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:47,460
You have to take on the challenge with the intention of defeating your opponent's ego.

326
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,460
I'm going to lose, right? Marble King.

327
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:03,450
Yuki-nii Curry is delicious. delicious?

328
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:06,480
good. Eat a lot. Yeah.

329
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,510
yes. thank you.

330
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,510
The rest is fine.

331
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,430
Ah.

332
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:21,310
sorry. It's fine, it'll come off if you wash it

333
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,170
The other day.

334
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:27,170
We met again.

335
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,590
what happened? sorry.

336
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,290
It smells nice. Ah.

337
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:40,290
Dinner If you don't have time, stop by.

338
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:47,020
But... um...

339
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,250
I don't have it now.

340
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:56,160
Come on, go home.

341
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,870
No no! I don't want to eat dinner by myself.

342
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:04,400
Kina-chan. That mom.

343
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,930
If that's the case, don't worry.

344
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,930
Rather, we have it for such occasions.

345
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,440
I understand. Excuse me.

346
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,900
(Vibrator sound)

347
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,760
hello.

348
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,790
(Masayuki) Ah, sorry, sorry. Still working?

349
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:03,330
Yeah. I don't think it's that late today.

350
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:06,870
That's fine, but don't you have a fountain pen in the president's office?

351
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,890
fountain pen? Yeah.

352
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,080
It's something I borrowed from my dad

353
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,940
I feel like I lent it to someone.

354
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,630
I think it was Satoshi.

355
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:20,160
He's because he doesn't have to be too close to that kind of thing.

356
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:25,210
Ah, is this? Golden wood grain...

357
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,900
Ah, that's right!

358
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:31,430
That's because it was from a long-established German brand and my dad liked it.

359
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,460
If you lose it, you'll be killed.

360
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,650
It was dangerous. Thank you to me.

361
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,350
Thank you, that was helpful.

362
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:42,380
So maybe I should just put it on my father's desk.

363
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,380
Yes, please. Yes.

364
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:35,920
Welcome back. Ah, I'm tired.

365
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,290
Thank you for your hard work. Would you like to have dinner right away?

366
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,650
That's right. What about your mother and elegance?

367
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,510
We're taking a bath together now

368
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,200
I think it's just right. Also?

369
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,730
That's what happens when I'm away

370
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,920
It seems I'm not doing anything.

371
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,790
We'll prepare dinner.

372
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,790
Hmm...

373
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,610
Is it gone?

374
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:31,300
(Fuyu) I'm sorry.

375
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,010
It's true that I put it with your master's mail.

376
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:40,230
I haven't heard anything this morning so I went to check it out just in case

377
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:45,610
I don't seem to have seen the mail yet

378
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:50,610
No matter how much I searched for that envelope, I couldn't find it...

379
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:01,070
I took you there. Yeah.

380
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:07,840
My name is Satake from Marble, and I was contacted by.

381
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,840
Welcome to come.

382
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,130
I will contact you again.

383
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:44,360
～

384
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,210
(Reo) I don't sell Kyoko-san or anything.

385
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,400
Because I've been really loved.

386
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,260
(Reo) Thanks to Erika... (Kyoko) He has no eye on people, right?

387
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,450
(Masayuki) He was celebrating his mother's birthday.

388
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,970
(Kyoko) Isn't this the best entertainment?

389
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,000
I'll handle it for me. Be aware.

390
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,030
(Reo) I want to seriously work on this project.

391
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,720
To get my mother in good spirits

392
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,750
That's important to Marble.

393
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:10,450
Mom, it's been a while.

394
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:14,840
"I have no intention of forgiving you guys forever.

395
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:20,840
I'll destroy you guys no more.'
