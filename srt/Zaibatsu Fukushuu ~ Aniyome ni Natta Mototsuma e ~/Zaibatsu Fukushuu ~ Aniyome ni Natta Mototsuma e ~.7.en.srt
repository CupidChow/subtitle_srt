1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,510
"I promise I won't revenge again,

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,850
Please let me out of here."

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:12,160
This is definitely a lie. I agree with Masayuki too.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,660
No. 31 is released.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,100
"When I think about it, I'll put this injustice into the world

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,120
Take revenge on the Ise family

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,840
I was planning to be happy together with Erika.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,200
But it's

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,200
All you have to do is accept reality.

10
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,000
Eh, we at the Ise Group

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,040
We have been in business for 150 years.

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,080
To all over the world who are involved with our group

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,610
We would like to express our sincere gratitude.

14
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,670
The Ise Group will be on January 23rd, 2025.

15
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,710
We will be holding a 150th anniversary ceremony.

16
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,930
As the master of the Ise family, as the head of a large company

17
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,800
He seems to be doing that alone

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,330
He was a cold-hearted and insulting person.

19
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,510
You were born into this world

20
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,540
It's an accident. Accident Accident Accident Accident.

21
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,910
Damn it

22
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,630
Even if you get dirty with your hands, you will still stay in that position

23
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:39,530
He must have always looked down on people and manipulated them.

24
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:46,600
Ise Seiichiro A devil living in the darkness.

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Because of you, my mother...

26
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,410
I'll push you down into the abyss.

27
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,300
What are you thinking?

28
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,850
It's obviously a lie that you regret it.

29
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,550
Is that really something that person has to do nothing?

30
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,740
Not enough to make a fuss.

31
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,940
Two of us at an important time

32
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,640
Don't do anything you like without my permission.

33
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
but. You're persistent.

34
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,750
got it. If your father says that.

35
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,750
This is about dealing with it once something happens.

36
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,900
I don't understand it a bit.

37
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,430
Reflection is only up to the words.

38
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,430
Why do we have to say that?

39
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,160
Hey, are you listening? I know.

40
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,760
I don't know what Hanaho is like at this rate.

41
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,760
I know, I'm shut up. (Baby's cry)

42
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,200
It's not. a?

43
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:39,660
I want you to be good.

44
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,660
As the eldest son of this family, Masa's father.

45
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Father has already begun to get bored, right?

46
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,930
If things continue like this, we will not be able to protect the Ise family.

47
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:11,810
We must do something about the Ise family, which is absolutist father.

48
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,810
Ah.

49
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,720
It's exciting. If their skills are successful, it's the first in the world.

50
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,750
Hmm...

51
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,100
That's no good.

52
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,310
Huh? (Seiichiro) The estimate is too sloppy.

53
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,020
No, it's only natural that it's not yet precedent worldwide, and it's difficult to come up with a budget.

54
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,890
That's why you should be careful. Even if I say that...

55
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,920
Ah... a bit...

56
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,610
Be able to judge for yourself that much.

57
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,800
If you keep doing this

58
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,800
One day, the Ise group will be tilted because of you.

59
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:30,030
～

60
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,560
That's right...

61
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,090
So, as soon as I thought the negotiations had been completed, it stopped.

62
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,280
I don't understand the meaning.

63
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,980
Haa...Thank you for your hard work.

64
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,010
(Masayuki) Even though we've been having a good relationship with each other up until now,

65
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,530
My dad has made other transactions with us.

66
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,720
I don't know what will happen in the future...

67
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,420
Haa... That's terrible.

68
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,420
It's the worst, it's the worst.

69
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,720
Well... shouldn't you just let me say it as you please?

70
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:34,720
～

71
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,090
ah.

72
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,300
So if that's what happens next, then Nobuo-kun

73
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,300
If Masayuki contacts me directly, it would be helpful if I could get some information.

74
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,730
(Seiichiro) That's bad.

75
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,440
He is in a place where he is too visible.

76
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,800
Because that always backfires...

77
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,010
If things continue like this, we can't leave the successor to him.

78
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,390
(Seiichiro) Ah... isn't it?

79
00:09:46,390 --> 00:10:28,140
～

80
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,840
Saori: I've made dinner! You've got some meals.

81
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,380
Come on! Wow!

82
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,900
Look. There's Kato's pork soup too.

83
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,760
It's hot, take care.

84
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,940
Both. Do you eat either?

85
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,960
I want to eat both. Do you want to eat either?

86
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,960
I want to eat it but I probably can't. I probably can't eat it.

87
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,350
delicious. delicious? good.

88
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:01,420
When I grow up I'll become like a mother

89
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,870
{Mom...}

90
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,260
{Sorry}

91
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,380
{In the end, I was...}

92
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,610
"I've become this kind of person"

93
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,200
It arrived here. Ou.

94
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,650
I see. Yeah.

95
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:59,650
Ah, this timeline is also nice. Yes, it's easy to understand.

96
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,390
That's good. Shall we smile a little more?

97
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,280
Ah, that's good. (Shutter sound)

98
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,200
Please pull your chin a little.

99
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,850
The smile you just said is really good. Let's go with another one.

100
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,850
That's good!

101
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,560
(knock)

102
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,410
yes.

103
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,610
President: Sorry. what up?

104
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,610
Your mother is... you're there. teeth?

105
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,240
Ah, Masa-kun. Sorry when you're busy.

106
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,440
There's something I really want to talk about.

107
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,440
Huh? what?

108
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,210
Erika... Huh?

109
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,410
You should be careful about Erika.

110
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,600
Hmm, what's wrong? Suddenly.

111
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,980
That girl is going to eat us all. Huh?

112
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,670
I thought she was a vulgar woman from the beginning

113
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,880
I never thought it would have been this far. What are you talking about?

114
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,910
I wish I'd noticed it sooner.

115
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:31,450
She was originally a woman who married something like that.

116
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,470
Stop it!

117
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,660
Doesn't matter, does it?

118
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:40,210
Erika has long since been my wife and Masa's mother.

119
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,560
That's why.

120
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,270
We have an incredible thing to want a heir

121
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,630
Maybe I'd invited him in.

122
00:13:48,630 --> 00:14:00,750
～

123
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,750
(Masayuki) Mother.

124
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,640
You're not decent anymore.

125
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,090
Erika is the only person I understand.

126
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:45,090
～

127
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:18,350
～

128
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,350
Thank you. Thank you very much.

129
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:36,370
(Vibrator sound)

130
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,720
What?

131
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,090
Thank you so much for letting me go.

132
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:46,130
I'm grateful to be free.

133
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:50,130
Unlike you, I have nothing to lose.

134
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,730
Is it different?

135
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,260
For me, who was taken away by the Ise family

136
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,290
There's nothing to lose anymore.

137
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,990
Hey, what do you want to say?

138
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,030
The ingredients are all there.

139
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,890
Even since 2010, when you became chairman

140
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,890
The Ise Group's fraud has exceeded 100.

141
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,480
It was difficult, wasn't it?

142
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,370
It is important to continue protecting the group as the head of a large company that has been in business for 150 years.

143
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,080
I'm sure I told you not to imitate something stupid.

144
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:37,300
That's not to say that anything is okay.

145
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,500
I wonder what will happen to the Ise group if this is revealed

146
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Even a monkey can understand.

147
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,380
What are you going to do?

148
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:54,590
Don't panic, it's okay. The party is about to begin, right?

149
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:04,030
I hope today's ceremony will be very exciting.

150
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:15,290
(The sound of a call being cut off)

151
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,710
thank you.

152
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,250
Congratulations today. Thank you for today.

153
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,250
thank you.

154
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,120
What is this? It says that fraud and evil.

155
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,520
what happened? Well...

156
00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:07,040
～

157
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,060
Huh?

158
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,920
"He specializes in dealing overseas and exports a number of opium."

159
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,780
"Ise Kisuke dodges the secret agreement..."

160
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,780
"After political corruption, Ise Bussan merges."

161
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,100
(Seiichiro) "What we've done so far is

162
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,970
Everything was wrong.

163
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:40,030
"We will abolish the family management that the Ise Group has been doing for many years."

164
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:46,260
What is this... It's definitely that person...

165
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,800
We have to stop the media and reporters. Today's ceremony has been cancelled.

166
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,490
Ah... respond immediately. I got it.

167
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,180
Tell your father not to leave the room. yes.

168
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,180
No, it's fine. I'll do that.

169
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,930
There was a typo and I will collect it.

170
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,790
Sorry, thank you very much.

171
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,660
Thank you, sorry.

172
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:21,450
～

173
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,320
Was it canceled?

174
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
You saved your life.

175
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,730
What are you going to do...

176
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,430
That's why I said that.

177
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,430
Don't let him go wild.

178
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,870
What are you going to do? This is the circulating!

179
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:07,240
If such a big lie spreads

180
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,780
The Ise Group is over.

181
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,140
Hey!

182
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,010
but…. But what is it?

183
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,710
I'm ok because I'll cover it up?

184
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,750
yeah? That idea is old.

185
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,440
SNS is just a moment!

186
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,300
different. What is it?

187
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,340
It's not.

188
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,340
Huh?

189
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:45,120
There's a lie to what's written here...

190
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,120
Dad...

191
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,370
What happened?

192
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,190
In the end, you...

193
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,240
I will live with my weaknesses held by him for the rest of my life.

194
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,320
Don't be kidding...

195
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,230
Don't be kidding!

196
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:44,470
I'm sorry... that's how life is.

197
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,110
Do whatever you want.

198
00:21:51,110 --> 00:22:03,400
～

199
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,400
(Vibrator sound)

200
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,890
There's something I'd like to ask you before you get punished.

201
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,310
Why were you in that town that day?

202
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:01,200
I heard the chime and immediately understood it.

203
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,140
Until you take him in

204
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,640
I grew up in that town.

205
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:22,150
forever….

206
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,150
I thought I had to talk someday.

207
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:38,310
I still remember it clearly today.

208
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,840
While raising you

209
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:47,060
He was working hard in the factory.

210
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,930
Huh?

211
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:54,810
What are you talking about?

212
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,810
You know what you know about your mother.

213
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:07,550
How have you been protecting this forever?

214
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,530
Anyone was fine for you.

215
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:21,530
Anyone who listens to what they are convenient for.

216
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:29,670
He must have immersed himself in other people's weaknesses to satisfy his own pleasure.

217
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:37,670
Can you understand the feelings of people who can't resist you?

218
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:50,370
To Saori...

219
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:54,240
I've never met him by handing him money.

220
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,790
Huh?

221
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,790
That wasn't the relationship.

222
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:29,600
I want to meet every night

223
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,600
I still think about it.

224
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:46,840
She was my only light...

225
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:57,540
I met him in an astronomical club at a university.

226
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:05,540
Saori gave me a ray of light into my life.

227
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,850
Only when you're with her

228
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:16,900
I have been forgotten that I am a member of the Ise family.

229
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:23,900
How many times have you really wanted to be with us?

230
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,450
Kyoko was all about her outlook.

231
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:44,450
He started harassing Matsushima Electric...

232
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,520
Saori told me.

233
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:58,310
Let's stop meeting again.

234
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:03,310
If it's money, I'll do something about it. different.

235
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:12,280
Don't think that money can solve anything.

236
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:18,280
This relationship was wrong from the beginning

237
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:35,110
It's all my responsibility.

238
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:44,210
Because I couldn't forget Saori...

239
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:57,900
In the end, Matsushima Electric's management suddenly leaps due to the harassment that occurred at the time.

240
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,940
Seven years later

241
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,940
It ended up going bankrupt.

242
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:15,410
(Saori/Yukiya) "Slimy glittery glittery"

243
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:19,800
"I want you."

244
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:30,800
"Blink and look at everyone."

245
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,450
Yukiya. Yeah?

246
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:42,180
Even if this factory becomes the Ise Group

247
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,210
The time and memories I spent here

248
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,210
It's something that will stay in your heart forever.

249
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:57,430
All the passion and soul poured into this place will not disappear.

250
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,180
So it's okay

251
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,970
(Seiichiro) I heard that Matsushima Electric will go bankrupt

252
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:14,170
That's all I want to stop

253
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,170
He has called for acquiring it.

254
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:26,120
But Kyoko couldn't have allowed that.

255
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:31,510
Well then...

256
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:36,050
My mother was fired...

257
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:40,050
The condition was for us to acquire Matsushima Electric.

258
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:46,150
So...

259
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,030
You adopted me with guilt.

260
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:54,030
I've tried to do everything I can.

261
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,640
Don't be fooled!

262
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,510
For me, memories of that house are hell.

263
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:09,550
Ah...

264
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:13,550
I feel sorry.

265
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:19,820
Every time I see you, Saori's shadow crosses

266
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,190
It was not accepted.

267
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,550
Without knowing how to treat me

268
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:31,780
I couldn't pull behind.

269
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,780
Yukiya...

270
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,170
Yukiya.

271
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,720
So you could just apologize?

272
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,650
I have no obligation to forgive you.

273
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,680
I know...

274
00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:00,680
I'll continue to be punished until I die.

275
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,450
That's what I'm planning to do.

276
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,810
So do this to you...

277
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:13,810
No matter what you say, I don't intend to forgive you.

278
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,430
I'm sure.

279
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,800
After all, you're a devil.

280
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:30,800
A devil who cannot think of someone as someone as he is.

281
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,430
That guy's excuse

282
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:42,430
I feel pathetic when I came to hear this.

283
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,260
Also...

284
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,260
Don't glorify it.

285
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,330
My mom always said that.

286
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:04,030
Don't be obsessed with money.

287
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:08,230
For such poor people

288
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:11,230
Because there's nothing attractive about it.

289
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,530
(The sound of the door closing)

290
00:33:34,610 --> 00:34:04,740
～

291
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,440
"Mom...

292
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:14,440
I was always lonely

293
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,720
"Why suicide...

294
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,720
I should have run away together

295
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:28,140
"I don't need any money.

296
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,820
With my mother,

297
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,360
If you live a peaceful life

298
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,710
That's all...》

299
00:34:35,710 --> 00:35:02,710
～

300
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,070
So dad is

301
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,070
It's no longer useful.

302
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,780
It's a sheer shell.

303
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,680
Maybe it's better to make it easier.

304
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,540
About your father.

305
00:35:42,540 --> 00:36:32,040
～

306
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,040
(Entrance chime)

307
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,320
(Entrance chime)

308
00:36:53,590 --> 00:37:27,100
～

309
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,300
(Entrance chime)

310
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:38,880
～

311
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,400
Hanaho.

312
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,610
Yukiya-kun, help me.

313
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,630
(Sound)

314
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:56,830
～
