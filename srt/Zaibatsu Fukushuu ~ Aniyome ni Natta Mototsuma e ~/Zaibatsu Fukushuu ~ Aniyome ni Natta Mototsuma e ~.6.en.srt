1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,890
I can't forgive you in my lifetime.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,750
what happened? Today we had two of us and we had a change...

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:12,450
Ise Yukiya 9:19 PM on suspicion of violating the Act on Protection of Specific Secrets

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,480
I'll arrest him. It's your own fault.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:37,880
～

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,250
Yukiya-kun It's been a while.

7
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,940
Do you remember the man?

8
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,480
It was the last time I met

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,480
Is it Masa's wedding? Seven years ago.

10
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,730
Here... yeah? Aoyama Police Station.

11
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,360
Don't look like that.

12
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,060
It's okay I'm here

13
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,760
If there's nothing, I can get it out right away.

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,630
There's no way there will be.

15
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,630
What is it?

16
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,730
surely….

17
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:34,730
Yukiya-kun has always been good at computers.

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,500
Sei-chan said that too.

19
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
You have talent in that area.

20
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:52,230
And I'm sure I was there with Sei last year...

21
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:03,230
Even though it was a revenge for quitting, national secrets were overkill.

22
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,230
State secret?

23
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,490
It makes a bit of a meaning...

24
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,010
Even the man is sad.

25
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,730
The youngest son of the Ise family is a dangerous person who threatens the nation.

26
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,920
Please take care.

27
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,800
In short, you should never touch someone

28
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,800
That means he made me angry.

29
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,240
You know what you know, don't you?

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Because he's a good adult.

31
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,260
As expected of Nobuo, the next Prime Minister.

32
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,460
That's true.

33
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,330
This big brother is stupid.

34
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:11,570
You're a member of the Ise family.

35
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:22,020
～

36
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,020
Go in.

37
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,250
It's breakfast.

38
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,530
Take it.

39
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,890
Eat quickly.

40
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,890
Is it unwell somewhere?

41
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,840
Oh, I drink it a lot.

42
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,370
German powdered milk is my first time, but it seems like I liked it.

43
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,400
Right.

44
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,600
What about your dad today?

45
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,310
I haven't seen that since this morning...

46
00:05:48,310 --> 00:06:03,970
～

47
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:16,970
(Vibrator sound)

48
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,860
(knock)

49
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,230
yes.

50
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,230
Excuse me. Excuse me.

51
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,740
what happened?

52
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:54,470
I received a call from Ise Certification Center this morning.

53
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,470
Apparently Hanaho has woken up.

54
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,080
Found while trying to escape from the facility

55
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,460
Apparently it was tough, it was rampaging.

56
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,000
Hanaho, please calm down.

57
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,350
It's okay to take it easy. It's okay.

58
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,870
It's okay.

59
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,870
It's okay Hanaho. Hanaho-san, what happened?

60
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,110
Apparently he said he was almost killed.

61
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,900
To you guys.

62
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:54,070
～

63
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,070
Answer!

64
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,260
I haven't done anything.

65
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,320
Masayuki finds Hanaho lying down...

66
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,790
I can't think of anything but suicide.

67
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:37,790
It's impossible for us to try and kill you.

68
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,900
Is that so?

69
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,900
yes.

70
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
What do you think?

71
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:05,610
Hanaho is now...

72
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,300
I'm getting him to sleep.

73
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,300
What I'm hearing is the truth and false statements of Hanaho.

74
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,230
Masayuki.

75
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,780
We are...

76
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
I haven't done anything.

77
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,300
Understood.

78
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:51,920
No matter what she says in the future, she won't be shaken.

79
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,270
Is it okay?

80
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,810
No matter what happens

81
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,810
Don't overturn those words.

82
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,370
yes.

83
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,080
yes.

84
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,020
That's bad, it's over now.

85
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,710
home. I'll put it on.

86
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,750
Yes, thank you.

87
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,440
Hey.

88
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Do you know?

89
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:39,860
～

90
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,180
Haa haa haa...

91
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:11,980
"I want you to have a sparkly glittering or something."

92
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:21,560
(Two) "Blink and look at everyone."

93
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:31,560
(Two people) "I want you to have a sparkly glittering or something."

94
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,060
Yukiya. Yeah?

95
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,940
Even if this factory becomes the Ise Group

96
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,480
The time and memories I spent here

97
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,020
It's something that will stay in your heart forever.

98
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,020
So... it's okay

99
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:34,810
～

100
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,500
Hanaho-sama.

101
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:47,430
～

102
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,130
You may not betray me.

103
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,660
Maybe they won't bully them.

104
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,880
But... I'm not on my side.

105
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,420
After all, he is a servant of the Ise family.

106
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:36,580
～

107
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,580
It's a meal, open it.

108
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,460
It's fixed, open it.

109
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,290
How long are you planning to not eat it?

110
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,290
Eat carefully.

111
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,200
I've transferred it. Check it out.

112
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,650
thank you.

113
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:38,370
But it was helpful. Please help me.

114
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,390
Of course.

115
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,080
I've been helping Erika before.

116
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,800
And to Ise Yukiya

117
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,670
I just feel betrayed.

118
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,670
Thank you for letting me know the truth.

119
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,270
You're having a hard time with you.

120
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:06,270
He brings the members to make their dreams come true.

121
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,210
You can't live without money.

122
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,240
yes.

123
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,130
I don't trust people who don't care about money.

124
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,990
Does that mean you can survive even if you're feeling dazed?

125
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,990
I got irritated when I saw something like that.

126
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,080
So somehow I'll do this

127
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,080
I'm rooting for Satake, who is trying to rebuild his team.

128
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,180
I think I was hit with a terrible incident.

129
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:47,390
But don't blame yourself.

130
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,390
It's because he's the guy who used someone else's dreams.

131
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,940
yes.

132
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,180
I hope I'll learn more about this incident...

133
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,910
Can you help me if there's anything else?

134
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,930
Yeah.

135
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,780
thank you.

136
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,780
Of course, we'll add rewards.

137
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,350
Me...

138
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,620
I trust Erika.

139
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,640
Huh?

140
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,490
Give me work

141
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,490
They promise you a reward that's worth it.

142
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,050
thank you.

143
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,340
(footsteps)

144
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,710
(footsteps)

145
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,710
No. 31: It's a meeting.

146
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:13,370
(Open the lock)

147
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
(knock)

148
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Sit down.

149
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,140
It's kind of cold here.

150
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,900
What are you planning?

151
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,590
Nothing to do

152
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,280
Yukiya was the one who betrayed him first, right?

153
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,640
Huh?

154
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,990
If you're quiet as a member of the Ise family

155
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,990
I didn't have to do this either.

156
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,780
feel ill.

157
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,780
Why are you so obsessed with us?

158
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,890
Forget about this

159
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,420
I wish I could live my life quickly.

160
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,420
Because it doesn't matter anymore.

161
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,040
what.

162
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,410
but….

163
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:55,110
Once, they were married.

164
00:19:55,110 --> 00:20:03,030
Hahaha... That's right.

165
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:10,780
I'm grateful that you let me enter the Ise family.

166
00:20:10,780 --> 00:21:03,970
～

167
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,500
sorry.

168
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,520
My name is Ise Yukiya.

169
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,220
He was from the Ise family.

170
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,420
Would you like to talk a little more together?

171
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:20,810
Please go out with me

172
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,840
My only purpose is.

173
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,880
The reason I was to become a member of the Ise family.

174
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,900
But...

175
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,430
I thought these people were family

176
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:39,430
It's never been, and eventually I'll cut ties with the Ise family...

177
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,530
I want to live together with you

178
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:54,300
If you swear you won't do revenge again

179
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,300
You can ask your father to let him go.

180
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:03,570
If you can't do that, why don't you stay there forever?

181
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,570
In exchange for your pride.

182
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,850
Erika is...

183
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,790
Did you really want it?

184
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:30,510
How to live like this, take down the lives of others

185
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,510
This is how I clung to the Ise family.

186
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,910
of course.

187
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:47,670
I'm with Masayuki

188
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,380
I've been able to do it for a lot of things as a president.

189
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,420
I'm the one who's given me the challenge

190
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:59,420
Right now, every day is very fulfilling.

191
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,200
You and I were different from when we lived in that small house.

192
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:24,950
So... don't interfere with my happiness anymore.

193
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,910
I don't want you to get involved.

194
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,020
So why...

195
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,390
Huh?

196
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:47,270
So why did you come?

197
00:23:47,270 --> 00:24:15,270
～

198
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:41,140
～

199
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,170
It's tasty.

200
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:48,170
It's tasty. It's tasty.

201
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,650
Cute clothes. Thank you new

202
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:03,200
I bought it. Is that so? Ah, that's a rabbit.

203
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,720
Fluffy and cute.

204
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,910
Sato (sound of knocking on the door)

205
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,770
Please give me the money back.

206
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,960
I also have a loan today.

207
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,650
Please give me 3 million back!

208
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,650
Open it! Hey!

209
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,760
That's bad, always. It's good, it's good.

210
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,130
I've also heard about Hanaho.

211
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,000
If something happens, it will help you. thank you.

212
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,040
Taku Masayuki has always been like this. Ah, ok, ok.

213
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,910
I'm a friend with Sei, so when I'm in trouble, we'll both be there.

214
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:01,620
It helps.

215
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,810
What are you going to do over there?

216
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:07,000
That Aoyama Police Station.

217
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,220
Anything like that kind of harassment.

218
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,220
Isn't he rooted in what his wife was being taken away?

219
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,860
what happened? He said he's off for a while.

220
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,400
What? Why? I wonder why?

221
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,930
Has Yuki-bro caught a cold?

222
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:37,930
Right. Kina: I'm worried.

223
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,530
That's right, shall I come again tomorrow?

224
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,550
Yeah! It's sure to be okay.

225
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:49,080
Yeah! Yeah.

226
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,110
Ah, Juna-chan. Ah, Juna-chan.

227
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,110
What were you doing now?

228
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,110
Ah, I was home. Ah... Yes, welcome back.

229
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:11,110
I'm home.

230
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,860
work?

231
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,860
Yes, a bit. Yeah.

232
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,450
Were you busy today?

233
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,800
I don't think so.

234
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Yeah….

235
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:37,910
Have you heard anything since then? No, especially.

236
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:42,910
What about your father? I only met this morning.

237
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,540
Is it okay?

238
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,240
What?

239
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,780
No... us.

240
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,780
Isn't it okay?

241
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,020
If something happens, you have to make that kind of face.

242
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,960
Are you still twitching?

243
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,320
I'm not ready, what if I'm ready?

244
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,200
When I was moving around, Masayuki was always at home

245
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,910
It makes me depressed to think that he was thinking about it.

246
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:32,620
What is it? I went to a meeting today.

247
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,500
Yukiya's. Why did you go to him?

248
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Stop it. It's not a regret.

249
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,390
He told me not to get involved again.

250
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,860
Be firm.

251
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,390
You're the heir of the Ise family, right?

252
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:05,110
Can't you do anything without having to protect your father?

253
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:19,250
～

254
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,120
If you swear you won't take revenge again

255
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,800
To be released

256
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,800
You can ask your dad for it

257
00:29:52,080 --> 00:31:04,080
～

258
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,960
Master.

259
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:34,390
I'll add some hot drinks.

260
00:31:45,030 --> 00:32:07,920
～

261
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,920
please.

262
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,400
Anything can and anything you can do

263
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,590
I think it's not.

264
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:29,590
I don't want to see anyone who is more unhappy.

265
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:41,020
I'm sure that person will be the saddest.

266
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:51,490
I'm sorry for making too many imitations.

267
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:19,980
～

268
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,670
(Masayuki) Erika.

269
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:44,230
～

270
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,230
Huh?

271
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,810
What are you doing?

272
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:56,350
what? What... Huh?

273
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,710
Why do you stop it?

274
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:03,750
This is... If you find it when Miyabi grows up

275
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,450
You feel bad, right?

276
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:13,010
What... what? Something's wrong?

277
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,010
No, it's not a problem...

278
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,980
What do you want to do when you pull out something like this?

279
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,980
feel ill.

280
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,870
What...

281
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,850
"Everyone in the Ise family

282
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,550
I write this letter in hopes that it will arrive safely.

283
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:52,410
This time, I'll be thinking about my own inconsiderate ideas

284
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:55,440
I harassed the Ise family members

285
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,460
I'm really sorry.

286
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,650
I am deeply regretting it.

287
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:04,190
I promise I won't get revenge again

288
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,880
Please let me out of here.

289
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,730
Please me..."

290
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,920
It's fine now.

291
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,780
This is definitely a lie.

292
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,780
Getting on track.

293
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:23,210
I agree with Masayuki too.

294
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,210
Excuse me.

295
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
Number 31.

296
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,930
Released.

297
00:35:44,930 --> 00:36:36,450
～

298
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:39,450
Well then...

299
00:36:51,260 --> 00:37:14,320
～

300
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,850
There's no way you could destroy the Ise family.

301
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,870
My Ise family...

302
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,900
Would you like to cut ties with the Ise family now?

303
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,770
Why are you so obsessed with us?

304
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,950
(Masayuki) It is very much that you were born into this world

305
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,140
It's an accident

306
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:40,250
～

307
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,110
dangerous! Because it's dangerous! Mom!

308
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:45,460
No, it's dangerous... Mom!

309
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,850
What about your mother? Give me back my mom. (Seiichiro) Leave.

310
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,540
Yukiya can't do anything anyway.

311
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,540
Be aware

312
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,930
Me...

313
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:10,190
I won't forgive you forever.
