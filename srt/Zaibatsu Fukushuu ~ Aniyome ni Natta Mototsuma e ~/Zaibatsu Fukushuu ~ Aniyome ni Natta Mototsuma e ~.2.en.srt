1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:08,520
I'm pregnant with Masayuki.

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,700
What have you been saying since before?

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,730
Please divorce me.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,730
"I'll take revenge no matter how many years it takes."

5
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,500
Thanks to Erika, I finally managed to become a heir.

6
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,530
That's great.

7
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,910
As the Ise family, we would like to celebrate this grandly.

8
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,280
Of course, it's about men and women

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,300
It wasn't easy to do.

10
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,190
Of course, I have no intention of ignoring Hanaho-san.

11
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,190
We plan to provide one of Japan's leading medical facilities.

12
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,800
All you have to do is accept reality.

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,330
My own selfishness and the prosperity of the Ise family

14
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,190
Which do you think is more important?

15
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:19,060
Although he is not a member of the original family.

16
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,080
I'm just as Masa-kun said.

17
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,080
How long will you stay quiet? It's irritated.

18
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:36,900
(cry)

19
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,130
I don't really want to say this.

20
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,830
Since we got married

21
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,030
That's gone completely.

22
00:01:49,030 --> 00:02:00,460
However, I wanted a child so I consulted Masayuki.

23
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,460
Masayuki listened to me with kindness.

24
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,260
I don't have to cry anymore.

25
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,640
You already have a child in your belly of the Ise family.

26
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,200
That's right. Erika and Masayuki-san

27
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,230
Congratulations.

28
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:31,950
(Asami) Congratulations. thank you.

29
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,820
(Seiichiro) Yukiya.

30
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,700
Would you like to cut ties with the Ise family now?

31
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,250
Now that's how it is, that's the best option.

32
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:50,130
For the Ise family and for Erika

33
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,130
You're signing this divorce papers.

34
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,120
a?

35
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:38,120
～

36
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,580
(Chicken of a Little Bird)

37
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,030
Damn it!

38
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,890
Yes, yes... You're good friends, really.

39
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,920
They're still the busty couple. Oh, that's it.

40
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,770
Nobuo is already drunk...

41
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,460
Ah, I mean I still love alcohol.

42
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,480
This is the only thing I can enjoy.

43
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,670
Hello Nobuo. Oh, young man.

44
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,670
Nobuo-san, Wee!

45
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,590
Wow, no no... Sorry Nobuo.

46
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:50,700
(Speaking)

47
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,700
Did you drink it? this.

48
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,460
sorry.

49
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,920
Oh, that's not it. Oh...

50
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,120
Week Week. Hey Ayami Ayami...

51
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,120
What's it's been a while since I last visited. Are you doing well?

52
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,700
But I listened to a new song. Ah...

53
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,700
I also heard Ayami, which was really good.

54
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,620
Are you alone? What...

55
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,620
Well...

56
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:42,730
Maybe you're not good at this kind of thing?

57
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,100
If anything... It's the same.

58
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,810
I was also informed to the office and automatically.

59
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,810
But I'm not used to it so I can't calm down.

60
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,890
Ah, sorry all of a sudden.

61
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:04,100
My name is Sato Erika, a model.

62
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,120
Even if you say a model

63
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,990
I just started it as an extension of my apparel work

64
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,990
I feel a little reluctant...

65
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:21,230
Can I ask your name?

66
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,000
My name is Ise Yukiya.

67
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,200
He was from the Ise family.

68
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,570
I don't know anything...

69
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,280
Sorry, I was so familiar with it...

70
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,970
The world you live in is different.

71
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,000
That's what it is... (Clashing sound)

72
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Ah...

73
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,900
Ah, sorry, did you take it?

74
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,420
Ah, it's fine, just a little bit.

75
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,610
very sorry.

76
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,630
Please let me know if you need cleaning.

77
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,650
No, it's really okay.

78
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,840
but….

79
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,190
So, something to apologize...

80
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,910
Hehe...

81
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:13,800
You're so kind, Yukiya.

82
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,510
That's how it is... So that's right...

83
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,730
Would you like to talk a little more together?

84
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,430
What... Apologies or something like that

85
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:32,430
Please come and join us a little more.

86
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:47,300
～

87
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,300
Yes it's tasty.

88
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,880
It's tasty.

89
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
Yeah.

90
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,200
Look, this is also wonderful.

91
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,390
Good color. Hey. It looks good.

92
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,390
Does it suit you?

93
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,150
It definitely feels good to get on that boat.

94
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,840
I agree

95
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:40,330
～

96
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:46,900
"I'd like Erika to be there

97
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,900
That's all there is...

98
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:08,390
Please go out with me.

99
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,330
happy

100
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,590
《I didn't need anything》

101
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:47,590
～

102
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:13,100
～

103
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:37,170
Hey.

104
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,170
what happened?

105
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:56,020
Erika fell in love with me

106
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,020
Is it because I'm from the Ise family?

107
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,750
picture?

108
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,200
Why do you say that?

109
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,730
The last name doesn't matter.

110
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:21,730
I just love Yukiya.

111
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,380
sorry.

112
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,750
Never again...

113
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:41,980
Don't say that again.

114
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,980
Yeah.

115
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:05,890
Erika is a special person to me.

116
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:09,250
i love you.

117
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,120
Yeah.

118
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:19,120
So there's something I want to talk about properly

119
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,250
{And so I

120
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:31,810
I told her everything about my upbringing.

121
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,870
I mean, I am an adopted child of that family.

122
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:42,760
That there was no place in the house.

123
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:51,170
That they hate all of them.

124
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,870
So I'm going to say those people

125
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,410
I've never thought I was a family

126
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:05,990
Eventually, I'll cut ties with the Ise family

127
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:12,550
I want to live together with you.

128
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,550
Will you still be with me?

129
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,090
It must have been tough.

130
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,090
Thank you for talking.

131
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,740
I want to be happy.

132
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,630
I forget about the painful past

133
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:59,190
I can't believe it was all gone

134
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:04,400
I want to be happy

135
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:10,400
"Those words and all of the time so far..."

136
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:24,440
It was all lies

137
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:34,360
～

138
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,560
Shut up and disappear!

139
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,760
For my happy life

140
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:50,760
～

141
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,990
Haa...

142
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:18,570
"I was... being fooled"

143
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,320
Hey!

144
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,320
Hey, no sweep!

145
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:03,420
Hey, what are you doing here?

146
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,970
Ah, are you stalking because you miss Erika?

147
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:12,010
Hmm! It's nice for people who are bored to live freely!

148
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,540
What... ah? What is it?!

149
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,230
Give it a go. Ugh!

150
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,930
It hurts...

151
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,790
Hey!

152
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:26,480
Hey, no sweep.

153
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,180
Hey!

154
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,030
Oh!

155
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:36,250
Hahaha... Hahaha!

156
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,790
Isn't he a bucca? Rumor.

157
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:45,680
Ah... That's right, that's what suits you.

158
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,730
That's how I looked up from below with grudges

159
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:56,460
It must be your role!

160
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,660
hey hey!

161
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:04,710
It's all me because you're gone!

162
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:10,250
Because of you, you're gone!

163
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,780
Isn't that strange?

164
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,140
Hey, scum!

165
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,680
Hey hey, you're the scumbag, hey!

166
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:24,400
Hahaha! Hey!

167
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,600
You!

168
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,960
What is this? Hey.

169
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,320
Hey!

170
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,320
Hahaha!

171
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,810
Nice to meet you, this is Ise Erika.

172
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,010
Enjoy fashion to the fullest even during maternity periods

173
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:03,730
This time we will be creating a lookbook for iSE Interfashion.

174
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,260
I am I, Erika Ise, the creative director.

175
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,620
I will be in charge of it.

176
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,170
Eh, I'm currently 10 months pregnant

177
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:18,880
While I feel joyful every day, I also feel anxious.

178
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,590
It's just my first time, but I hope that the CEO, Satoshi, will give us the strength to you.

179
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:28,470
You can wear it in your own way at any time while borrowing

180
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,000
I'd like to aim for one book.

181
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,030
Please take a look.

182
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:45,300
～

183
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,670
(Seiichiro) Satoru. (Satoshi) Yes.

184
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:53,050
When will the new brand be released?

185
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:58,440
It's next weekend so it's the 16th. Hmm.

186
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,480
It seems like our group will be over again soon.

187
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,850
Do you know?

188
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,030
Of course, uncle.

189
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:11,060
All the teams from the previous time were already fired.

190
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,250
That's a reasonable decision.

191
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,120
This time, we are made up of the most powerful personnel of our company.

192
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,000
I think it's definitely not. That's obvious.

193
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
yes.

194
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:30,550
"I sympathize with you, Satoshi-kun"

195
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,300
"but…"

196
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,990
Two: Kanpai!

197
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,540
Oh! hit!

198
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,910
The floor isn't wet.

199
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,450
sorry. But Yukiya is

200
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,160
I shared it because I wanted to drink orange juice.

201
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,030
(Kyoko) Do it in moderation?

202
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,050
"You're the person

203
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,050
Compared to the sin I've done so far...

204
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,650
{This is what it is...}

205
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,370
"It's just insignificant"

206
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,840
Yes, that's good. Yes, OK!

207
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,200
Yes I'll go yes.

208
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,220
Please let me know if it's cold or hot.

209
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,410
I'll go yes.

210
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,100
Ah, that smile is so cute.

211
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,120
I'll give you another one Yes.

212
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,150
The smile was amazing!

213
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:49,360
He also got along well with the photographer and was very good.

214
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,360
(Satoshi) Hey Kumaki. yes.

215
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:59,800
There were some different colours in this outfit, right?

216
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,500
Yes, light gray and floral white.

217
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,700
it is?

218
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,740
Today, model Kara doesn't have a schedule

219
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:15,960
The different colors will be taken at a different studio.

220
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:24,960
Ha ha ha ha...

221
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,430
Ah?

222
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,960
That's what I gave to the materials I previously...

223
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,320
Don't look!

224
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,180
That's not too boring, this one! sorry.

225
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,210
Hey, it's pointless to wear a model.

226
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,240
What are you paying for?

227
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,260
sorry….

228
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,800
hey hey. Yes Yes.

229
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,340
If this brand dies then it's your fault, right?

230
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,530
I'm listening! ? yes.

231
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,570
Hey, I was asking if you were listening!

232
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,600
Hey! Hey!

233
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:08,320
Have you heard it? Hey! Hey! Hey!

234
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,320
Are you asking if you're listening...

235
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,650
You should go to sleep now. Looking? this.

236
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,650
Satoshi sent me the photo data for today.

237
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,240
It's already 1 o'clock? Isn't work fine tomorrow?

238
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,460
I've been feeling excited for a long time. It's hard to sleep.

239
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,460
Ah, yes.

240
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480
Sorry.

241
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,710
I'm happy.

242
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,710
It felt like I had finally begun walking on my own feet.

243
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,130
Yeah.

244
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:26,890
Erika is doing her best. thank you.

245
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,490
Ah, I kicked it.

246
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,520
Huh?

247
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,910
Seriously? Hehe.

248
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:44,950
There are so many things I'm looking forward to.

249
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:49,330
Yes, that's right.

250
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:54,330
So I'll go to sleep now today. Yeah.

251
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
Hehehehehehehehe.

252
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:20,300
Hmm, it's kind of dark.

253
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,000
Would you like to brighten the colour a little?

254
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,860
It's a bit harsh, the play is.

255
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,390
There was more she laughing.

256
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:33,090
Eh, uh...

257
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:37,470
Oh, right? Is Kara laughing?

258
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,670
So that's right, that's annoying!

259
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,860
sorry…. Haa...

260
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,900
But then, the CEO has already been confirmed before.

261
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:51,440
"This is too casual, so I'd like something a little cooler."

262
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,470
So, the data that the president has just been designated

263
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,680
I've replaced it but...

264
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:02,220
Ah? What...

265
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,220
That's what you said, right? last time.

266
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,130
What? Is that so?

267
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:20,910
Don't say it.

268
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:24,100
I haven't said that... I haven't said that.

269
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,630
When did I say that! ?

270
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:30,170
That's how it was last time... Don't tell me!

271
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,200
He says he wants to see him laughing!

272
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,380
Is this the attitude of someone who stands above?

273
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,070
Don't make any excuses and get it ready quickly!

274
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:40,610
"Satoshi-kun really doesn't change.

275
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:48,180
People who are weaker than they are always violent.

276
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:53,180
People like you should have disappeared quickly...

277
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,260
"It's for the sake of the world"

278
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,640
You did it.

279
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,690
Thanks to Satoshi. No no...

280
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,120
Well, yes. Hehe.

281
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,640
Are you feeling well?

282
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,330
Yes.

283
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:36,390
I wanted to see this view with my own eyes.

284
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,080
I'm glad it was in time.

285
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,460
If we put our hands together, we can aim for higher.

286
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,820
With Erika, the world is not a dream.

287
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,530
I'm sure that's right now.

288
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,550
happy.

289
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,400
(laughter)

290
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,400
(Everyone) What?

291
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,950
What... Huh?

292
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,020
Huh?

293
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,760
(laughter)

294
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,440
Don't look, that's it!

295
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,640
That's not too boring, this one!

296
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,010
That's how it was last time... I want to see you laughing

297
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,030
You're saying it!

298
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,050
Don't make any cluttered excuses, just prepare them quickly!

299
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,070
Can't use it!

300
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,930
What is this...

301
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:34,930
No, it was good, really the best.

302
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,680
(Satoshi) Hey Kumaki. yes

303
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:48,780
Hey hey, I'm asking if you're listening!

304
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:53,660
hey hey! Have you heard it? Hey!

305
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,690
hey hey!

306
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:05,940
～

307
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,940
I'm tired. Thank you for your hard work.

308
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:13,020
Have you heard it? Hey! ?

309
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,540
hey hey!

310
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,560
What does that mean?

311
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,250
Isn't the president that person?

312
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,450
Seriously? I felt like buying it all at once.

313
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,470
I was a fan of Satoru.

314
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,470
Hey!

315
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,350
I hate that kind of person the most.

316
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,750
It's impossible to hit something.

317
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,290
No, I've already hit someone...

318
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:43,660
What's going on? Here it is! ? Satoru-san...

319
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,700
Hey, whose work is it? ? Come out!

320
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,890
Hey, is it Kumaki? Is it Mamiya?

321
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,930
Oh hey!

322
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,790
Hey, what are you doing, what's going on? ?

323
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,310
(Satoshi) Remove it soon! (Kotoko) Sorry!

324
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:04,030
Hey, what are you returning him? Buy him! Hey!

325
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:07,730
This is the true identity of Ise Satoshi.

326
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,580
(Satoshi) Don't be fooled!

327
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,600
What are you doing, what's going on? ?

328
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,630
Turn it off quickly! sorry!

329
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,650
Turn it off quickly!

330
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,850
Hey! Hey! sorry….

331
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,880
Hey! Uh... uh!

332
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,090
Ugh, ah! K-it won't disappear!

333
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,780
What is this remote control! ? Hey! Hey!

334
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,780
Cheers to the two pathetic.

335
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,140
They put shame on the Ise group.

336
00:32:48,140 --> 00:33:27,190
～

337
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:30,220
Call Masayuki. I'll take action right away.

338
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,220
yes.

339
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,810
Twitch.

340
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,810
Who's work done?

341
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:48,700
(Masayuki) We are very sorry.

342
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,980
(Masayuki) Eh, Ise Satoshi has acquired it

343
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,500
Unjust attitude towards our employees

344
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,540
It is never allowed.

345
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,750
This time, none of us

346
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,270
I couldn't grasp this matter

347
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:12,270
We deeply apologize.

348
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,560
Also iSE Inter Fashion

349
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,760
For customers who have loved it

350
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,950
It gives you uncomfortable feelings

351
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,950
I'm sorry.

352
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,930
just….

353
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:44,960
(Masayuki) To be honest, I feel like I've been betrayed...

354
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,170
I'm full of frustration.

355
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,190
sorry!

356
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,220
Is it true that you didn't understand?

357
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,250
There are also voices saying that they have been covering up whistleblowers.

358
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,110
Huh? Also, the source of this leak

359
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,130
There are also reports that they are employees.

360
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:04,840
Could you also ask about this?

361
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,530
Umm...

362
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:12,910
Such matters are currently under investigation...

363
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,430
About the fact that power harassment was a common occurrence

364
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,620
Please tell me more in detail.

365
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,800
It's a matter of pouring beer on an employee who made a mistake

366
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,820
Is it a fact? sorry.

367
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,010
