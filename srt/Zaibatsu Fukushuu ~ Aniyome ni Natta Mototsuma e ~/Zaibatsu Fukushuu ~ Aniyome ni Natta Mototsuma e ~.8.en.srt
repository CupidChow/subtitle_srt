1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,610
Chairman of Ise Group, one of Japan's largest companies

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,800
Ise Seiichiro two days ago

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,320
It turns out he had died.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,690
It is believed to have died of illness.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,550
Ise Group's chairman is the president of Ise Bussan.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,750
Ise Masayuki has been appointed.

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,110
He is also the vice-president of iSE InterFashion.

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,980
It is said that his wife, Erika, has been appointed.

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,680
There is a lot of hope from the business community.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,870
Also, many of the market members

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,870
We expect the stock prices and exchange rates will also have a major impact.

12
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,060
(Lock unlock sound)

13
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:03,340
Eh, I'm really sorry about my father Seiichiro.

14
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:09,060
As the chairman of the Ise Group and above all as a father

15
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:16,800
I have always admired Seiichiro.

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,340
This Ise Group will become one of the world's leading companies

17
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,890
This time, I will be the dream of my father.

18
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:30,440
I would like to become a new chairman.

19
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:36,160
This is Ise Erika, who has been appointed vice-president this time.

20
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,040
From now on, we will work hard on the Ise Group with the chairman.

21
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,570
I would like to support you.

22
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:49,130
What our previous generation worked hard to make it a milestone year of its founding 150 years

23
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,170
I was looking closely with the chairman.

24
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,860
inherited the feelings of those previous generations

25
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,860
We want to create a new history.

26
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Can you ask a question?

27
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,600
During his lifetime, Seiichiro was

28
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,310
It appears that he has expressed his intention to abolish family management.

29
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,330
The two of you inaugurated

30
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,330
How do you think you are accepting it?

31
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,260
My husband and I, my wife and my predecessor

32
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:42,490
We always had a variety of conversations while eating together.

33
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,350
Among them, Masayuki will be the first to do so this year.

34
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,390
There is also talk of recommending it to the chairman.

35
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,940
The previous generation will become the chairman of the most successful Masayuki.

36
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,940
I think I was looking forward to it.

37
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,240
What's that guy for?

38
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,930
Are you okay.

39
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,930
I'll take responsibility for dealing with it.

40
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,850
Maybe about your dad...

41
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,850
First, calm down.

42
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,620
He was laughing.

43
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:14,350
Let's forget. It's the day I've left the ground.

44
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,560
It was a relief that Erika was there.

45
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,560
There's no one else in the way.

46
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,060
Yukiya-kun, help me

47
00:05:52,390 --> 00:06:17,470
～

48
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,680
You may not betray me.

49
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,380
But... I'm not on my side

50
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:41,550
～

51
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,910
An unknown death?

52
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:56,360
～

53
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,070
Don't know the cause of death?

54
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,780
Hmm...

55
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:35,250
～

56
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,770
Huh?

57
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:49,770
～

58
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,770
Tampering?

59
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,310
(Masayuki) Fuyu-san.

60
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,180
(Fuyu) Ah, little boy. What did you do?

61
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:24,250
I've got a little talk with my dad so I'll give it to you.

62
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,250
(Fuyu) I understand.

63
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,210
I can't believe it...

64
00:08:37,210 --> 00:10:15,210
～

65
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,540
Masayuki: Welcome to Yukiya-kun, head to the Ise family!

66
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,540
Yeeee!

67
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,480
a little bit! The floor isn't wet!

68
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Do it moderately. Yes

69
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:27,050
(The sound of the clock bell)

70
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,350
what up?

71
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,540
elegant?

72
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,560
Yes, I think it's not.

73
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Masayuki-san, sleeping. Yeah.

74
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,800
Ah, that's good.

75
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,820
a little bit!

76
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,860
Please don't touch Masa-kun's snack with dirty hands!

77
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,240
Your mother is the dirtyest person in the world!

78
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,240
(Sound)

79
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,150
Fuyu-san?

80
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:27,100
～

81
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:34,100
She was the only light...

82
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,710
(Sound)

83
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:56,220
～

84
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,220
who?

85
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,000
Erika.

86
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:35,960
～

87
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,990
(Masayuki) What's up?

88
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,190
I'm a little thirsty.

89
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,550
If it's water, here.

90
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,550
it was. Maybe I was sleepy.

91
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,140
Something happened?

92
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:58,180
Yes, I just had a scary dream.

93
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,380
Did you wake him up? sorry.

94
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,380
That's fine though.

95
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,520
A quiet night.

96
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:43,520
～

97
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,010
(Door opening and closing sound)

98
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,770
good morning.

99
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,370
Did you wake me up?

100
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,940
Did you sleep?

101
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:08,990
Ah... Are you feeling hungry?

102
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,830
delicious.

103
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,860
good.

104
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,560
There's also a refill, so please.

105
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,560
thank you.

106
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,660
(Vibrator sound)

107
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,080
Again.

108
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:56,170
No, the article about Brother and Erika is about the Ise Group...

109
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,370
(sound of dropping the spoon)

110
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,370
sorry.

111
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,110
OK?

112
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:43,140
～

113
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,850
Hanaho.

114
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,850
There's a place I want to take you with me.

115
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,450
Masayuki has arrived on the chairman board.

116
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,980
yes? I guess I've finally got my turn

117
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,020
I'm feeling motivated. now?

118
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,210
A little more tuna.

119
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,210
wall.

120
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,960
Are you calling me?

121
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,660
Um, the other day I bought some delicious gelato that I had on TV.

122
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,660
I've got it.

123
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,060
Yamashita's portion and secretaries' portion

124
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,080
Can you buy it together?

125
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,100
Everyone is doing their best too.

126
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,120
Thank you for your consideration.

127
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,000
Please don't worry about us and ask us anything.

128
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,850
These guys eat whatever they like.

129
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:42,570
But I have to continue to work hard.

130
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,570
Is that so?

131
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,160
(Kuna) Yuki-bro! Oh.

132
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,160
Yuki-brother Yuki-brother!

133
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,900
Hello. Hello.

134
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,250
Who is that lady?

135
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,610
This is hi? Hello.

136
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:23,310
Hello. Hello.

137
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:27,010
That person is Yuki's older sister.

138
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,370
Hello. I'm walking around flowers.

139
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,560
What's your name?

140
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,560
It's Juna-chan.

141
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:42,270
Yuki-nii Let's continue from yesterday. My sister came too.

142
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:51,890
Wow! good. He's good.

143
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,490
Okay.

144
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,380
(Children) Bye!

145
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,380
see you!

146
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,810
Thank you for your hard work.

147
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,170
That was amazing.

148
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,530
But that's good.

149
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:22,070
face. Huh?

150
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,610
I think I've finally returned.

151
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,960
Sorry for worrying.

152
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,330
I've said it over and over again.

153
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,540
So, can you help me clean up?

154
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,730
Haa.

155
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,090
So please have a table.

156
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,090
Understood.

157
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,270
Yukiya-kun.

158
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,320
Thanks to Yukiya-kun, I didn't die.

159
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,600
That's such a big deal.

160
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,650
Looking back at it now, I'm pretty close.

161
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,650
So I'm really grateful. thank you.

162
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,610
it is….

163
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,610
About brother?

164
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,830
There's no need to force yourself to talk.

165
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:52,380
But if Hanaho can't forgive him...

166
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:05,710
If you want to get revenge, you can be a source of strength.

167
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:29,270
Was Yukiya-kun made this?

168
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:39,430
My mother used to do something similar in the factory.

169
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:44,430
It was a kind of warm place.

170
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,880
A warm place.

171
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,880
I feel like I understand something.

172
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:04,150
Yukiya-kun.

173
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,600
I want you to stop revenge.

174
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,460
Huh?

175
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,000
I might not be able to forgive it for now.

176
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,390
I'm sure there were a lot of hardships at that house.

177
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,930
It's about Erika...

178
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:35,830
But I don't think revenge is a different thing.

179
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:43,920
I'm still scared of Masayuki.

180
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,800
It's just merely remembering...

181
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,840
I hate myself like this.

182
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,860
So why...

183
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,230
Get revenge

184
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,260
What's ahead?

185
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:08,260
Whatever is there, take revenge, and...

186
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:14,510
There's something for Yukiya-kun.

187
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:25,150
I don't think revenge is the only thing that comes to life.

188
00:24:25,150 --> 00:25:10,950
～

189
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:18,190
"What's the end of revenge you've never thought of before..."

190
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:47,150
～

191
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,150
For me...

192
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:58,890
There's no further than that.

193
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:38,690
～

194
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,050
I'm thinking of sorting out my belongings.

195
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,940
wife….

196
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,940
It's too late now...

197
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:02,190
I read something like this

198
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,380
I don't know about that person...

199
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,920
That's what it is...

200
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,450
I can't say that either.

201
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:15,150
I have to protect this house...

202
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,150
From him.

203
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:45,620
～

204
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,990
Okay... So let's start tidying up on the desk soon.

205
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:53,360
(Children) Yes! I'll clean up this.

206
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,390
Yeah.

207
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:59,600
Hey... Will Reo come today?

208
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,970
Reo... I'm busy with work right now.

209
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,990
Let's cheer you on and wait. Yeah!

210
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:32,260
～

211
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,260
what happened?

212
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,960
Don't say that your conscience is aching...

213
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,920
I... there was a mother's incident, so I was there to Reo.

214
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,920
Instead of asking for it, I gave it as a reward...

215
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:01,990
I thought I was in trouble... Even if I get back to you now...

216
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:11,820
At that time, I was talking about the company... and Yukiya.

217
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:18,220
I don't know what to do about it all...

218
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,590
That's why I was saved so much...

219
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:27,980
It's thanks to Erika that she is still marbled.

220
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,520
But looking at Yukiya...

221
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,550
What was I desperate for?

222
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,550
I don't know...

223
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,300
It's no wonder that it's said to be sweet

224
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,300
I came to return it.

225
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,400
yes….

226
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,870
I'm... what's in the world

227
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:10,870
I think money will solve everything.

228
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:19,770
Ideas and dreams are meaningless if you don't have money.

229
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:38,630
Without money... you can't be happy.

230
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,580
I know.

231
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,680
So wouldn't it be fine?

232
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,040
That's the conclusion you came up with in mind, right?

233
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,900
but….

234
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:04,900
You will surely regret it.

235
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:12,310
I've never had a hard time with money so I can say that.

236
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:19,540
Once you get it, you'll get obsessed with it.

237
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,850
Do your best.

238
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,100
Excuse me.

239
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:52,100
～

240
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,600
(knock)

241
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
Yes.

242
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,660
yes.

243
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,280
I think this is my duty

244
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:35,350
I'm well aware that it's brazen

245
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,350
We will hand it over.

246
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,830
(Seiichiro) "Yukiya Before this

247
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:18,570
There was one thing that I couldn't tell.

248
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:25,300
You might say it's late now

249
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:32,530
I've become scared to talk to you when I was being harsh.

250
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:37,420
I'm sorry.

251
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:42,300
I might not be able to say it in front of me again

252
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,180
I decided to tell it in a letter.

253
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:51,390
That day, that fire day..."

254
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,750
Mom! Mom!

255
00:33:54,750 --> 00:34:20,520
～

256
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,730
I got rice! cooked rice!

257
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:29,730
When I grow up I'll become like a mother

258
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:42,340
(Seiichiro) "Me and Saori were seen by people who should not be seen."

259
00:34:54,690 --> 00:35:00,090
(Seiichiro) "Disappointment and disappointment spread across my son's face.

260
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,960
I could see that clearly."

261
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,810
Saori: Follow me. but….

262
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,840
Please, please go home already.

263
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:19,270
(Seiichiro) "That day I broke my son.

264
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:25,000
It's not like redemption, but..."

265
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:40,150
～

266
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:44,850
(Seiichiro) "What I could have done back then

267
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:50,850
To protect Masayuki. All it was to protect the Ise family."

268
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:11,890
My mother wasn't suicide...

269
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:25,590
My brother... My brother.

270
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,290
(Seiichiro) "I'm not going to tell you to forgive me.

271
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:30,650
He doesn't even say he understands it.

272
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:35,880
I just wanted to protect it.

273
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:41,760
It's all me who's the wrong one.

274
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,990
I am responsible for Masayuki's sins.

275
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:53,550
I don't mind if you hate me as much as you want."

276
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:57,550
Wow!

277
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:22,660
～

278
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,870
Wow!

279
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:42,540
～

280
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:47,080
"I killed my mother and took my wife.

281
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:52,080
The man who took everything out of my life

282
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,060
"I don't care what happens now.

283
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:05,600
Defeating Ise Masayuki.

284
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,600
I won't forgive you! 》
