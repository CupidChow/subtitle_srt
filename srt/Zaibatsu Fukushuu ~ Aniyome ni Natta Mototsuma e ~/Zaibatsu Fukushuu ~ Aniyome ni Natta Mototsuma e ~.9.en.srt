1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,590
My mother wasn't suicide.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,970
(Seiichiro) I am responsible for Masayuki's sins.

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,010
I killed my mother and took my wife.

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:20,060
The man who took everything from my life.

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,060
Defeating Ise Masayuki.

6
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,420
(3 people) Oh!

7
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,270
No, that's fun. Oh oh...

8
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,140
As expected, it's hard to believe it's the first time Masayuki-san.

9
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,840
No, I'm absolutely not.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,020
How did you do it?

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,560
No, I just have to aim for it and pull it all the way through.

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,100
When the chairman says it, it's kind of like a management philosophy.

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,300
(Masayuki) Wow, I wonder if it comes out strangely.

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,300
Haha, that's fun haha.

15
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,210
Once this has come into the world, the Ise family is over.

16
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,990
We have to do something

17
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:40,200
～

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:02:17,910
～

19
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,910
《Brother…》

20
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,700
"There's nowhere else to rest your mind.

21
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,560
You should be scared.

22
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,560
Welcome to real hell

23
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,790
For when the Ise Group's performance is affected

24
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,990
The space-related business that the previous generation was working on

25
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,990
I'm thinking of selling the whole company.

26
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,740
Nowadays, American companies are interested

27
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,120
It is expected to recover most of the investment.

28
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,670
It may be temporary, but it would be a risk hedge.

29
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,040
In the end, it's up to Masayuki's decision.

30
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,560
What do you think?

31
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,590
If you're thinking that much. Right.

32
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,620
When the previous generation dies

33
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,640
I was wondering what would happen for a while

34
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,670
I feel relieved that the Vice President is here.

35
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,520
Speaking with the Vice President

36
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,050
It's like he's arguing with his predecessor.

37
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,410
Right. (laughter)

38
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,770
The Ise Group is also safe.

39
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,290
I'm desperate every day

40
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,470
I'm glad you said that.

41
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,470
I'm sure I have no choice but to repay my Father this way.

42
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,920
chairman!

43
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,450
chairman! chairman!

44
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,980
chairman! Chairman, come back!

45
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,830
chairman!

46
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,020
chairman! chairman!

47
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,730
chairman! chairman!

48
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:20,400
～

49
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,400
What should I do about this...

50
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,710
Takahashi!

51
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,610
Hey Takahashi!

52
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,970
Takahashi!

53
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,970
(Sound)

54
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,860
What is it you?

55
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,580
Anyway, why are you here?

56
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,320
It's just right.

57
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,320
It's dirty and I don't want to touch it.

58
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,220
I heard everything from my dad.

59
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,770
Huh?

60
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,660
Why did you set it on fire...

61
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,550
Why did you kill him?

62
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,820
No, I don't know because I don't know.

63
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,540
Well, your mother is suicide, right?

64
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,420
It's irrelevant, me.

65
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,420
Because it doesn't matter!

66
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,040
Ah! It hurts.

67
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,040
You should take it easy. It must have been a long time ago.

68
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,960
Should I apologize? Hmm? So do you feel satisfied?

69
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,860
There's no proof that I did it.

70
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:30,970
Yeah, Yeah... sorry.

71
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,420
For example... if that's it?

72
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,120
As if I was doing it

73
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,650
It was 25 years ago, right?

74
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,360
It's been a long time since the statute of limitations.

75
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,380
Is it okay?

76
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,580
I'm also a victim.

77
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,610
What's bad

78
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:01,610
It's your dad and your mother.

79
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,450
It's creepy.

80
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,450
Was it lit?

81
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,010
Of course! !

82
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,610
I understand. Understood... What?

83
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,700
I'll make you an officer.

84
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,390
What?

85
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,390
So calm down.

86
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,290
I'll kill you.

87
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:01,270
(Takahashi) Chairman! Which one is it? chairman!

88
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,980
chairman! chairman!

89
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:11,980
Masayuki-san? Masayuki-san.

90
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,410
Hahahaha...

91
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:27,200
You'll be caught again and go to prison.

92
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,910
Ahaha...

93
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:38,910
Hahahaha...

94
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,960
chairman! chairman! chairman….

95
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,840
What happened? OK? chairman….

96
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:15,340
～

97
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,710
yeah. yeah.

98
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,410
I'll go... Hold on for a moment.

99
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,430
I'm here. yes.

100
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:27,430
We are sorry. When I took my eyes off.

101
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,380
Excuse me.

102
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,330
That's insane, he's.

103
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,530
What about the report?

104
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,400
Well, isn't that the problem?

105
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Those eyes...

106
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,950
It wasn't the eyes of someone who could understand the conversation.

107
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,530
I have to do it before it gets done.

108
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,450
I have to do something about it.

109
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,640
(Kyoko) Masa-kun! ? (The sound of the door opening)

110
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,170
Where did you get hurt? Are you okay? It's okay already.

111
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:24,360
Because I'll take good care of you.

112
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,550
I have to protect it. Because it's okay.

113
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,550
Shall we stand it up? Mother will take the place...

114
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,120
I don't have that qualifying for you. Mom...

115
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,010
What were you doing to make Masa-kun go through this situation?

116
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,700
It seems like you're misunderstood

117
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,730
The work of the Ise Group is not your role.

118
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,750
As Masa's wife

119
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,450
It's your role to be solid.

120
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,490
I don't know unless I say that.

121
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,340
Mom, just take it easy.

122
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,530
Mom, I'm sorry.

123
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,530
It was because of my carelessness. I'll be careful after that.

124
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,280
welcome home.

125
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,810
I was awake.

126
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,810
I can't sleep for a while.

127
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,030
You can even put warm things in it.

128
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Where were you going?

129
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Yukiya-kun.

130
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,970
It's fine anywhere, isn't it?

131
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,820
(Hanaho) That's right.

132
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,690
Where and what to do...

133
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,060
It has nothing to do with Hanaho.

134
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,060
(Hanabou) It doesn't matter!

135
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:15,310
I'm grateful to Yukiya.

136
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,000
(Hanaho) It's not like yesterday or today.

137
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,360
For a long time...

138
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,740
He always helped me out at that house.

139
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,590
that's why….

140
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,590
I hope you stop doing anything dangerous.

141
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,020
Why?

142
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,020
It's more difficult to say don't grudge.

143
00:13:52,170 --> 00:14:00,590
I've been thinking about it since I woke up.

144
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,590
I wonder why it turned out like this.

145
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:13,220
I'm sure it's due to accumulation of misunderstandings and misunderstandings

146
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:19,220
I'm sure it's not what's worse.

147
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:35,550
Is that serious?

148
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,180
It's fine now.

149
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,180
Because I'm alive now.

150
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:55,810
And now I've finally managed to free myself from that house.

151
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:01,370
The more time passes, the stronger the feelings become.

152
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,370
I don't want to get involved anymore.

153
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:12,140
I'd lie if I told you I didn't hate you

154
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:18,140
But I'm glad it turned out like this.

155
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:27,460
I'm thinking about moving on to a new life right now.

156
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,650
that's why….

157
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:35,650
I want Yukiya to live a good look forward too.

158
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:50,520
I'm in order to live properly

159
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,520
I'm going to destroy them.

160
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:03,080
Otherwise, I won't be able to move forward.

161
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:35,470
～

162
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:45,730
When his wife gives him milk, Masa looks happy.

163
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:50,270
Does Fuyu see that? yes.

164
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,270
His smile is completely different.

165
00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:00,370
It's about Erika. Also?

166
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,390
Just be careful.

167
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,580
It just seems like they're trying to take over us.

168
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,950
Will you take over it? Because

169
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:15,020
Can you believe that the person who sat there is a vice president?

170
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:20,230
Maybe they're aiming for it someday? There.

171
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,930
There were a lot of things that said to stop.

172
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,930
But when did all this happen?

173
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:36,230
All this and this was after that person came?

174
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,430
But why is it Erika's fault?

175
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,800
Everything that's been done up until now is his fault.

176
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,800
I think Erika is connected to him.

177
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,250
Seriously? I even hire detectives.

178
00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:00,130
Relax a little. Masa-kun, don't be fooled.

179
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:05,130
I think it was his savings that he married Masa.

180
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:14,440
The eyes of a poor god who are similar.

181
00:18:14,440 --> 00:19:06,970
～

182
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,010
It's been a while. I came to talk a little.

183
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,220
Suddenly, what?

184
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,750
Hey Aiba. This from the other day

185
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:23,750
Nobuo is the one who's in trouble if he's released into the world.

186
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,540
What are the requirements?

187
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,220
Who told me about this?

188
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,080
It's good about me and this is good

189
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,790
Nobuo is being forced to do it.

190
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:18,180
It's a very important time, but it's tough.

191
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,380
What on earth do you want to do?

192
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,380
I'll let you free me from the Ise family.

193
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:33,340
I don't care what you've done to me.

194
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:39,230
I would be fine as long as I can get revenge on them.

195
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:50,340
～

196
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:58,250
(laughter)

197
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,130
No, it was rude and bad.

198
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,990
It'll be your strength.

199
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:22,320
～

200
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,010
What does that mean! ?

201
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:29,220
No, you. I've never been an apologetic attitude since before.

202
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,920
sorry. What! ?

203
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,780
No, look at this.

204
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,140
No, what have you heard, "No this"?

205
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,010
why…. Sorry!

206
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,040
What? Why? What... Sorry!

207
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,570
Why are you angry? Have you heard it?

208
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,570
(Satoshi) Ah! a?

209
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,130
(Vibrator sound)

210
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,670
yes.

211
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,530
Yes, I understand.

212
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:19,530
Thank you for your hard work to keep an eye on the situation after this.

213
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,950
I wish I could just be quiet.

214
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,520
Masa-kun, say it's a lie!

215
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,240
That woman... she was incited by that woman.

216
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:20,840
(Ringtone)

217
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:27,400
hello? My mother found out.

218
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:33,130
Of course I said I don't know about my dad

219
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,130
I didn't believe it.

220
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,230
It'll be okay.

221
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:47,230
Let's talk to your mother tomorrow morning.

222
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:01,240
I never thought I could not use this much.

223
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,240
Thank you so far.

224
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:53,430
～

225
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,630
As the north winds get stronger, in northern parts of Fukuoka and other areas

226
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:02,190
It looks like it's going to be a chilly day. There is a possibility of showers in Okinawa

227
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:08,080
there is. When going out, you can rest assured that you have a folding umbrella.

228
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,800
The cold continues today, so please stay warm.

229
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,170
This is the weather all over the country.

230
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:23,390
Breaking news: It owns many companies such as trading companies and apparel companies under its umbrella.

231
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:27,610
Ise Masayuki, chairman of Ise Group, one of Japan's leading companies, is suspected

232
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:32,320
He was arrested. Father and former chairman

233
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,700
There are allegedly been murdered by Ise Seiichiro.

234
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,900
The Metropolitan Police Department is looking at how the company operates.

235
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,760
I believe there was a conflict between the two

236
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,460
This means they are investigating their motivations in detail.

237
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,460
Ise has denied the charges.

238
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,980
I will never forgive you, I will never forgive you, I will never forgive you...

239
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:18,440
There were a lot of reporters gathering in front of the house...

240
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,310
I guess that's what happens, are there any expected questions?

241
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,660
We have it available.

242
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,350
Which shoes do you choose?

243
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,710
Here. What about the news?

244
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:31,240
Earlier, I'll summarize the main things such as television and newspapers.

245
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,270
I shared it on the Vice President's tablet.

246
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,290
thank you.

247
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,810
I'll take a look at it for a while so can you leave me alone?

248
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,840
We'll hold a press conference in front of our house at 9am 40 minutes later.

249
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,200
I understand.

250
00:26:43,200 --> 00:27:11,990
～

251
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,990
Erika...

252
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:23,600
Erika-san, maybe it's my fault...

253
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,490
Have you researched Seiichiro?

254
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,850
That's to Masa...

255
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,870
mother….

256
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:37,740
I wasn't planning on doing this.

257
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:55,740
～

258
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:02,490
Mother this...

259
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:06,490
This arrived this morning...

260
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:14,550
This may also be all Yukiya's work.

261
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,470
She is her husband and chairman of the Ise Group.

262
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,490
About Ise Masayuki

263
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,030
I apologize for the huge inconvenience to you all

264
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,030
I'm very sorry.

265
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,630
I'm surprised at the suddenness.

266
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:53,670
I believe in the chairman

267
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,030
If this is true, then

268
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,890
It's not something that's allowed.

269
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,600
I'm looking for the truth to be revealed as soon as possible...

270
00:29:03,600 --> 00:30:05,720
～

271
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,570
Landlord, this is...

272
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:13,460
～

273
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,990
this…. We asked about the Ise family.

274
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,990
It's here. The Ise family...

275
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:25,410
We came to the Ise family's request.

276
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:47,410
～

277
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,440
I'll enjoy having this.

278
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:31,260
delicious. good.

279
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,410
Reo-kun.

280
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:46,790
Could Marble help us here?

281
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:50,330
That said, I only had three months of funding

282
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:54,330
I'll have to do something in the meantime.

283
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,260
thanks so much.

284
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:05,820
What I would say thank you to Yukiya

285
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,820
I haven't done anything.

286
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,700
Yukiya is...

287
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,820
The fact that no one abandoned me was there

288
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,820
It's Yukiya.

289
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:33,760
And here for Yukiya

290
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,800
Of course it's an important place

291
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,800
That's not all.

292
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:50,430
For Kina and everyone else too

293
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,430
It's an irreplaceable place.

294
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:09,790
So, can you please work hard together?

295
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:40,090
～

296
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:45,470
Um, I'm pregnant.

297
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,820
A child with Masayuki.

298
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,680
There's no way you could destroy the Ise family, right?

299
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:53,680
Shut up and disappear. For my happy life.

300
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,150
Since we got married

301
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,670
That's gone completely.

302
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,860
feel ill. Why are you so obsessed with us?

303
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,880
You and I were living in that small house, it was different.

304
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,880
Maybe you're not good at this kind of thing?

305
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,000
I want to be happy.

306
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,860
I forget about the painful past

307
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:28,400
I can't believe it was all that

308
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,420
I want to be happy

309
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,420
Yukiya.

310
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,800
OK? Ah...

311
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:44,870
sorry. home.

312
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:31,880
～

313
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,880
I... I did it.

314
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,980
That child is innocent.

315
00:36:42,980 --> 00:37:08,910
～

316
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,910
Mom...

317
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:20,020
(Kyoko) The one who killed Ise Seiichiro...

318
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,020
Mom!

319
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,420
(Kyoko) It's me.

320
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:36,010
"Now, both in name and reality...

321
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:40,050
I became everything to the Ise family.

322
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,910
(Shutter sound)

323
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,930
Please look at the middle as well.

324
00:37:44,930 --> 00:38:02,440
～

325
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,790
～
