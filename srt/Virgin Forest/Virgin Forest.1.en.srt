1
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:52,362
According to a study published in 2015,
15 billion trees are being cut each year.

2
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:55,324
This means that since
the beginning of human civilization,

3
00:01:55,604 --> 00:01:59,651
only 46 percent of
the trees remain worldwide.

4
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,389
In the past five decades,

5
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:05,542
we’ve seen and felt
the effects of deforestation

6
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:07,650
in different parts of the Philippines.

7
00:02:07,675 --> 00:02:11,924
Putting us in the list of countries

8
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:15,284
with serious forest
degradation in Southeast Asia.

9
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:20,123
Hon, look at that.

10
00:02:20,148 --> 00:02:24,920
- I have a deadline with my Lumad story.
- It’s just interesting. I’m sorry.

11
00:03:26,324 --> 00:03:27,541
Clear!

12
00:03:58,963 --> 00:04:00,506
Whew!

13
00:04:00,652 --> 00:04:02,059
Attaboy!

14
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:03,418
Roger, keep your eye on that one.
Do your job right.

15
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:09,737
Are our people in the woods doing okay?
Is Minda treating our workers right?

16
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,837
They’re doing fine, Mayor.

17
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,228
Hon, I’m in the mayor’s office right now.

18
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:42,867
I’m sorry hon,
but did you see my article on the headline?

19
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:47,120
I’ve read it, see?

20
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:48,815
It’s impressive.

21
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,134
Powerful.

22
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:52,374
I’m so proud of you, congratulations.

23
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,608
Thank you.

24
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:55,714
How are the kids?

25
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,488
Come here!

26
00:05:58,329 --> 00:05:59,843
Hi Daddy!

27
00:06:01,046 --> 00:06:03,673
Well, I’ll be going to the forest.

28
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,784
There’s no signal there,
I won’t be able to call you.

29
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:09,421
Daddy, you’ll show me the flower?

30
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:13,913
Of course, I’ll take pictures
of the biggest flower in the world.

31
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:18,212
Once I’m done…

32
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:22,741
The moment I get a signal,
I promise I’ll send you pictures.

33
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,355
Okay? I love you.

34
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:33,100
- Alright, then.
- Bye, please take care.

35
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,337
- Bye, hon!
- Goodbye.

36
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:40,174
Alright, I’ll call you when this is over.

37
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,321
Mr. Francis, the mayor
can talk to you now.

38
00:06:45,346 --> 00:06:46,353
Thank you.

39
00:06:50,982 --> 00:06:53,526
- Francis Imperial.
- Sir!

40
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,122
Congratulations.

41
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:56,457
Very nice to meet you, sir.

42
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:57,734
Same here.

43
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:03,949
I’ve seen your work,
you’re a great photojournalist.

44
00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:05,467
We have a project,

45
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:12,454
and I’m commissioning you
so you can promote our province.

46
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,377
- Sure!
- You want to see what it’s about?

47
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:18,907
I’m excited about it.

48
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:20,173
This is the Rafflesia.

49
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:26,988
You know, this is one of a kind.

50
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:30,308
And it’s the biggest flower in the world.

51
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,578
I’ve also done research
on it before I came here.

52
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:34,603
Good, good!

53
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:40,793
So let’s push through with the project.
By the way, this is Roger.

54
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:46,366
He’ll accompany you when
you go to the mountains.

55
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:51,189
Believe me, he knows
every path and trail there.

56
00:07:52,246 --> 00:07:59,211
Here’s some money for your needs.

57
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:01,190
Our budget, Mayor.
Thank you.

58
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:06,903
- Thank you, Mayor.
- Thank you, too.

59
00:08:06,928 --> 00:08:09,096
- We’ll go ahead.
- Alright.

60
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,540
- Are you ready?
- Let's go.

61
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:16,647
- Do your best, okay?
- Of course. Thank you, Mayor.

62
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,930
Can we go to my house first,
I just need to drop off something?

63
00:08:33,955 --> 00:08:35,290
No problem. Let’s go!

64
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,418
Thank you.

65
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,500
How do you know Mayor?

66
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:05,736
Well, the Mayor’s office
called my publishing company.

67
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:07,430
I flew here immediately.

68
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:17,515
You have giant trees here.
You really protect your forests?

69
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,751
Yes, no one’s allowed
to cut trees here.

70
00:09:37,797 --> 00:09:39,396
I’ll be quick, boss.

71
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:49,364
Where’s Mom?

72
00:09:53,377 --> 00:09:55,045
You’re angry, I think.

73
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:57,405
- Yes, I have a reason to be angry.
- Your son’s here.

74
00:09:57,576 --> 00:09:59,332
Dad, Mom.

75
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,019
Your father’s wound is not healing.

76
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:05,813
Dad, it looks drier now.

77
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:09,316
- Hey!
- Look how cranky he is!

78
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:10,444
You’re so heavy handed.

79
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:12,970
No, because you're in pain.

80
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:16,874
Calm down, Mom.
You keep arguing with Dad.

81
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,535
Your mom is such a nag.

82
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,187
Grandma.

83
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:25,177
- Thank you, grandson.
- Have you eaten?

84
00:10:25,202 --> 00:10:29,331
This is for you.
For expenses.

85
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:34,325
Manage it well.
Don’t spend it all at once.

86
00:10:34,663 --> 00:10:38,391
You take care of everything.
I’ll just go somewhere.

87
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:49,465
Does your son even have
something to eat in the house?

88
00:11:11,931 --> 00:11:14,809
- Dad, mom.
- Where are you off to now?

89
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:16,961
I’ll go on a trip,
but I’ll be back soon.

90
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:19,155
Wait, Roger!

91
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:23,933
It's good that you're here.

92
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,292
Aunt.

93
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:29,949
- How are you?
- Not so good.

94
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:33,384
Take this.

95
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,656
- Here's your money.
- Thank you so much Roger.

96
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:43,060
Look how happy she is
because she has money again.

97
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,672
You take care of my grandkids.

98
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:57,675
Yes, aunt.
Don’t worry about them.

99
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,202
- Thank you.
- Return as soon as you can.

100
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:01,854
Yes, Mom.

101
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:04,701
Hey! Roger!

102
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:06,728
Where is my daughter?

103
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,394
What?

104
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:11,589
- This guy’s crazy!
- What did you do with my daughter?

105
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:16,769
- You son of a bitch!
- I don’t know what you’re talking about.

106
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,021
- What happened?
- My son is innocent.

107
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:33,466
- That’s not my problem!
- You know what happened to her!

108
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:35,605
I don’t know what
you’re talking about!

109
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,905
Bastard! Where's my daughter?

110
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:47,708
Francis, I will show you
what they’re doing to me.

111
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:52,796
Enough of that!

112
00:12:52,821 --> 00:12:56,687
- You’ll be punished one day!
- This isn’t your turf!

113
00:12:56,733 --> 00:13:00,112
That’s you and your wife’s problem,
don’t drag me into it!

114
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:02,406
Where did you take her?

115
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:03,657
I know nothing about that!

116
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:07,453
- I think he’s gone bonkers!
- Fuck you!

117
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:09,647
You try to blame me
for your daughter’s actions.

118
00:13:09,782 --> 00:13:12,326
You fuck, you took her!

119
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:31,003
What was that about?

120
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:35,272
That’s nothing, don’t worry about it.
He's crazy.

121
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:38,009
I don’t even know
what he’s accusing me of.

122
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:45,654
The people there, they’re all your family?

123
00:13:45,943 --> 00:13:49,446
Yes. The people living in
that compound are all my relatives.

124
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:51,824
You’re the eldest?

125
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:53,998
Yes.

126
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,361
I have three siblings.

127
00:13:57,153 --> 00:13:58,488
Are they still in school?

128
00:13:59,975 --> 00:14:03,979
Our parents can't afford
to send us to school.

129
00:14:06,317 --> 00:14:13,073
I have to find ways for
my family to get by every day.

130
00:14:13,098 --> 00:14:16,101
My family rely on me
to put food on the table.

131
00:14:26,752 --> 00:14:31,590
May I ask how long have
you been doing this job?

132
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,957
- My work?
- Yes.

133
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:37,609
I’ve been doing this my whole life.

134
00:14:37,634 --> 00:14:39,062
It used to be a hobby.

135
00:14:41,618 --> 00:14:45,330
But I started to get paid
for what I do.

136
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:48,520
I met my wife through this job.

137
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:50,080
Awesome.

138
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:56,045
Do you have kids, boss?

139
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,673
I have two. Both girls.

140
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:30,574
Francis, help us.

141
00:17:31,895 --> 00:17:33,522
Save us.

142
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:41,085
Help us, Francis.

143
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:43,936
Francis, save us.

144
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:49,635
Save us.

145
00:17:51,128 --> 00:17:52,838
I’m sorry, boss.

146
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,245
We’ll have to park here because
the truck can’t go further in the woods.

147
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,148
We’ll get off here?

148
00:18:03,403 --> 00:18:04,446
Let’s go.

149
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:10,422
The women in my dream,
messed with my mind.

150
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:12,111
What women?

151
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:14,952
Don’t tell me you
have another girl?

152
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:16,537
No.

153
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:23,878
Let’s go.
Just follow me.

154
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:45,020
The view is nice there.
I’m sure you'd like to take pictures.

155
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:01,957
Roger wait,
I’ll just take photos.

156
00:22:48,004 --> 00:22:49,727
Are you getting tired?

157
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:43,802
You silly thing, I know you miss me!

158
00:24:43,827 --> 00:24:45,848
- Gina.
- What?

159
00:24:45,934 --> 00:24:48,111
- Hey, come here!
- I don’t like you!

160
00:24:48,136 --> 00:24:52,616
- Come!
- No!

161
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:56,603
- Come here!
- Help!

162
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,004
- We’ll just play a game!
- Let go of me!

163
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,009
Be quiet!

164
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,720
- Let go of me!
- Stop shouting!

165
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,205
- No!
- It'll be quick.

166
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:19,309
- We will just play!
- Please, no!

167
00:25:48,926 --> 00:25:50,365
Fuck.

168
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:56,888
- Help!
- Gina!

169
00:25:56,913 --> 00:26:01,167
- Help me!
- Fuck you, come back here!

170
00:26:06,028 --> 00:26:10,552
- Come here, you bitch!
- Help me!

171
00:26:13,263 --> 00:26:18,129
Gina, we will just play here.

172
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:28,976
Come here, you bitch!

173
00:26:30,653 --> 00:26:32,157
Gina!

174
00:27:35,757 --> 00:27:37,697
Roger, what's that?

175
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:40,433
Maybe just some hunter. Let's move.

176
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,918
Roger!

177
00:27:49,943 --> 00:27:55,782
- Roger, please help me!
- Go away, you crazy bitch!

178
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,309
You stink, bitch!

179
00:27:59,661 --> 00:28:01,621
What the fuck’s that about?

180
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:03,665
Hey, Roger.

181
00:28:04,728 --> 00:28:06,980
See what you did to your girl?

182
00:28:07,074 --> 00:28:08,826
She’s wandering everywhere.

183
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:12,595
She's not my girl.
You don't know what you're saying.

184
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:14,300
Let’s go, boss.

185
00:28:22,446 --> 00:28:24,698
Roger, what was that?

186
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,872
That girl, she just went batshit crazy.

187
00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:29,983
That guy, he’s a hunter.

188
00:28:32,402 --> 00:28:35,405
That girl is always wandering
here in the forest.

189
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:41,149
- That guy shouldn't even be hunting here.
- I see.

190
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:21,025
Whatever happens, you won’t leave me?

191
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,469
I won’t abandon you.

192
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:26,288
You promise to look
after me even at work?

193
00:29:26,313 --> 00:29:29,316
Besides you'll like working there.

194
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:35,376
We’ll cook Pinakbet.
I washed them already.

195
00:31:35,508 --> 00:31:37,219
Okay, just put it over there.

196
00:31:37,244 --> 00:31:39,412
Make sure you do your job well, okay?

197
00:31:39,437 --> 00:31:45,610
- Don't let me down.
- Of course, just visit me often.

198
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:47,526
Of course, I'll visit you.

199
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:53,519
- Madam Minda!
- Hey, Roger.

200
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,028
- That looks delicious.
- We are cooking Pinakbet.

201
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,507
This is Gina. The one
I’ve been telling you about.

202
00:32:06,532 --> 00:32:07,557
Hello!

203
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:19,299
- How old are you, dear?
- Seventeen, ma’am, turning eighteen soon.

204
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,871
You’re still young,
and you’re pretty.

205
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:29,112
Come, Roger.

206
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,710
Here.

207
00:32:46,992 --> 00:32:48,452
Thank you.

208
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,096
Gina, I must go now.

209
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:56,332
- Madam Minda, please take care of her.
- Alright.

210
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:58,834
Work hard.

211
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,924
Roger, don't leave me,
I’ll come with you.

212
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,534
Don't be stupid.
You’re here already.

213
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:09,313
Attend to your job.

214
00:33:09,338 --> 00:33:11,048
Go on, Roger.
You can leave now.

215
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:13,659
It’ll be dark soon.
Take care, okay?

216
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:16,644
- Be safe.
- Goodbye.

217
00:33:18,878 --> 00:33:20,588
Do you know how to cook?

218
00:33:20,613 --> 00:33:23,199
- Yes.
- That’s Pinakbet, okay?

219
00:33:23,844 --> 00:33:25,804
Just cut the string beans.

220
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:29,232
After that, chop this one.
Put it here, when you’re done.

221
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:35,079
Put it here.

222
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:13,070
Whatever happens, you won’t abandon me?

223
00:36:13,095 --> 00:36:19,560
I promise, I will never leave you.

224
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:32,885
Just take a bath, you’ll be fine.

225
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,279
I was like you once.

226
00:38:32,557 --> 00:38:33,564
Boss.

227
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,589
Let’s stop here for a while.

228
00:38:37,654 --> 00:38:39,175
I’m also tired walking.

229
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:48,017
Maybe we can rest here tonight.

230
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:49,710
- Here?
- Yes.

231
00:38:50,055 --> 00:38:51,265
Okay.

232
00:40:06,405 --> 00:40:09,949
Here are your clothes, leave now!

233
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,643
You’re useless!

234
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:16,455
You stink so bad!

235
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,943
Take a bath! You stink!
How will men want you?

236
00:40:20,968 --> 00:40:23,744
Go away now!

237
00:40:26,234 --> 00:40:28,945
Go! Take all your stuff!

238
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:31,287
You're disgusting!
Take a bath!

239
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:41,033
- You’re useless!
- I have nowhere to go.

240
00:40:45,801 --> 00:40:47,970
Let go of me!
I'm going to kill you!

241
00:40:48,525 --> 00:40:50,848
You traitor, you abandoned me!

242
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,434
You turned your back on me!

243
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,273
Fuck you, why won't you
won’t leave us alone?

244
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:02,067
- Roger, don't!
- Fuck you!

245
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:05,362
- Idiot!
- Asshole!

246
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:07,865
- I'll kill you!
- I will stab you!

247
00:41:08,741 --> 00:41:11,577
- You won’t you leave us alone? Go away!
- I hope you die!

248
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:14,063
- I hope you die!
- Sorry about that.

249
00:41:14,804 --> 00:41:16,430
She’s raving mad.

250
00:41:16,689 --> 00:41:18,196
Lucky you stopped her.

251
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:21,174
Fuck it, man,
what’s really happening here?

252
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:24,044
Don’t mind it, boss,
she’s just insane.

253
00:41:25,431 --> 00:41:27,683
- What?
- She’s crazy.

254
00:41:29,178 --> 00:41:30,805
Fuck that.

255
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:34,016
Let’s rest now.
I’m really sorry.

256
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:35,291
Thank you.

257
00:41:38,186 --> 00:41:41,898
You stopped her just in time.

258
00:41:43,874 --> 00:41:48,337
- Are you sure she's not coming back?
- I'm okay here, don't worry about me.

259
00:41:48,486 --> 00:41:52,682
- You can sleep here.
- I’m alright, go ahead.

260
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:54,814
Sleep here.

261
00:41:58,897 --> 00:42:00,107
Thank you.

262
00:42:02,054 --> 00:42:03,596
Are you sure?

263
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:28,625
Francis, save us.

264
00:46:14,046 --> 00:46:20,802
Francis, help us.

265
00:46:31,104 --> 00:46:33,065
Save us.

266
00:46:44,409 --> 00:46:45,869
Help us.

267
00:46:46,662 --> 00:46:52,960
Francis, please save us.

268
00:46:58,465 --> 00:47:03,804
Francis, please help us.

269
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:05,828
Roger?

270
00:48:06,325 --> 00:48:08,660
Roger!

271
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:10,513
Boss?

272
00:48:11,774 --> 00:48:13,985
Was this here last night?

273
00:48:25,177 --> 00:48:28,764
I don’t know, boss.
This wasn’t here last night.

274
00:48:28,961 --> 00:48:31,004
We had a bonfire there, right?

275
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,788
Any idea where we are?

276
00:48:40,843 --> 00:48:41,928
No.

277
00:48:43,245 --> 00:48:46,995
- I think this place is enchanted.
- Oh, fuck it.

278
00:48:50,448 --> 00:48:53,451
- I don’t know.
- What’s happening here?

279
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:57,334
- Are you getting us lost on purpose?
- No.

280
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,837
We both slept in the tent.
I know nothing about this.

281
00:49:09,485 --> 00:49:10,711
What do we do now?

282
00:49:11,556 --> 00:49:14,393
Let’s leave,
we are being toyed with.

283
00:49:37,214 --> 00:49:38,883
Oh fuck.

284
00:49:40,087 --> 00:49:41,505
Boss!

285
00:49:51,638 --> 00:49:53,557
He’s the guy yesterday?

286
00:49:53,682 --> 00:49:57,519
Maybe a hunter’s stray bullet got him.

287
00:50:00,268 --> 00:50:02,854
Let’s go,
let’s just keep going.

288
00:50:04,526 --> 00:50:06,570
Just like that?

289
00:50:07,851 --> 00:50:09,603
Are we still far?

290
00:50:09,677 --> 00:50:11,887
Let’s just go home!

291
00:50:12,078 --> 00:50:16,477
You want turn back when
we've already come this far.

292
00:50:19,861 --> 00:50:22,447
Come on, let’s keep going!

293
00:50:26,071 --> 00:50:27,328
Hurry up!

294
00:50:37,923 --> 00:50:39,047
Look at that.

295
00:50:39,344 --> 00:50:42,365
- This is awesome.
- Great, isn’t it?

296
00:50:52,824 --> 00:50:55,410
- I think I’ve seen this place before.
- Where?

297
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:57,972
I thought you haven’t been here before.

298
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:02,250
- You want to go for a swim?
- Sure.

299
00:51:16,984 --> 00:51:18,985
It’s beautiful!

300
00:51:37,467 --> 00:51:38,885
It’s deep here.

301
00:51:53,055 --> 00:51:57,806
Is it still far?
How many hours until we get there?

302
00:52:00,523 --> 00:52:02,442
We should be close to it by now.

303
00:52:02,467 --> 00:52:06,387
If we hadn't taken our time,
we would have been there already.

304
00:52:09,497 --> 00:52:10,915
Are you sure you know the way?

305
00:52:17,241 --> 00:52:20,577
Yes, I know the way.
Don't worry.

306
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:44,978
Clear!

307
00:52:47,008 --> 00:52:48,134
Attaboy!

308
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:37,739
Why are there cows here?

309
00:53:38,073 --> 00:53:39,491
Where did they come from?

310
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:45,455
Those are just wild cows.

311
00:53:45,588 --> 00:53:48,333
Sometimes they’ll just appear before you.

312
00:53:49,117 --> 00:53:50,743
What's that sound?

313
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:58,291
- What?
- Don't you hear it?

314
00:53:58,669 --> 00:54:01,463
Don't mind them.
Let's just go.

315
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,324
- I’ll just take photos of it.
- What?

316
00:54:05,085 --> 00:54:06,092
Come on.

317
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:09,120
I thought your forest was protected,
why are there loggers here?

318
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:13,191
They're not illegal,
they are just trimming the branches.

319
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,069
Let’s go.

320
00:54:16,094 --> 00:54:18,555
- I'm still taking pictures.
- It's getting late.

321
00:54:18,751 --> 00:54:19,877
Who are you?

322
00:54:20,734 --> 00:54:22,444
Go away!

323
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,013
- Come on.
- Hey!

324
00:54:27,038 --> 00:54:29,708
- What are you doing?
- He’s with me!

325
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:31,525
Why did you bring
someone here with a camera?

326
00:54:31,549 --> 00:54:32,944
He’s taking pictures.

327
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,355
- Let's go.
- I’ll delete it.

328
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:39,217
- Want me to blow your brains out?
- I’ll delete it now.

329
00:54:39,665 --> 00:54:41,209
Let’s go.

330
00:54:42,286 --> 00:54:43,705
We’ll get off track.

331
00:54:47,532 --> 00:54:49,534
It’s just Roger.

332
00:55:00,488 --> 00:55:02,451
Roger, do you really know
where we are going?

333
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:04,711
Why?

334
00:55:05,188 --> 00:55:06,294
What’s the matter?

335
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:11,958
If you don’t know, just tell me.

336
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:16,149
Let’s not waste time
because I'm getting delayed here.

337
00:55:18,104 --> 00:55:19,525
We’ve been here two days,

338
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,069
and you told me
there are no loggers

339
00:55:22,094 --> 00:55:24,494
and suddenly one points a gun at me!

340
00:55:24,557 --> 00:55:26,476
Why are there loggers?

341
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:29,259
You’re obviously messing
with me now, Roger.

342
00:55:31,086 --> 00:55:32,713
How?

343
00:55:33,124 --> 00:55:35,918
I almost got shot
and you expect me to be okay?

344
00:55:35,943 --> 00:55:41,574
- I know that guy, he won't shoot.
- We've been walking all day.

345
00:55:57,735 --> 00:55:59,153
What now!

346
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:02,467
Tell it to me straight!
Fuck it!

347
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:39,433
What the hell, Angela’s missing.

348
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:41,818
You saw nothing?

349
00:56:42,246 --> 00:56:45,291
You like morenas? You like mestizas?
What do you like?

350
00:57:10,782 --> 00:57:12,451
Damn it, Roger.

351
00:57:16,071 --> 00:57:19,867
We’ve been walking for hours.

352
00:57:19,892 --> 00:57:21,894
We’re getting near.

353
00:57:23,605 --> 00:57:28,443
I think… we took the wrong trail earlier.

354
00:57:29,164 --> 00:57:32,584
Looks like we’re lost.
I think we’ve gone off-track.

355
00:57:32,758 --> 00:57:33,849
Are you serious?

356
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:39,013
Let’s just keep walking, follow me.

357
00:57:42,999 --> 00:57:44,125
Fuck, Roger.

358
00:57:47,158 --> 00:57:48,699
Can you still go on?

359
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:54,154
- We’ll get there. Don't worry.
- We’re going in circles, fuck it.

360
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:56,414
We're almost there. Stop nagging.

361
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,616
How’s it going, Madam?

362
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:33,117
John, I need your help.

363
00:58:33,365 --> 00:58:38,581
- You’re stressed again.
- Angela disappeared, find her.

364
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:42,518
- That’s alright, she got nowhere to go.
- Help me find her.

365
00:58:42,543 --> 00:58:47,090
- She can’t go far.
- But you better find her now.

366
00:58:47,115 --> 00:58:51,536
- Hurry up, let’s find Angela.
- She must be nearby.

367
00:58:57,613 --> 00:59:00,866
You'll be punished for this.

368
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:05,149
You’ll answer to me
if she’s not found!

369
00:59:07,151 --> 00:59:09,153
What!

370
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:18,121
Fuck that bitch.

371
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:23,418
- Hurry up.
- Damn it.

372
00:59:23,443 --> 00:59:25,069
Don’t worry about it.

373
00:59:27,204 --> 00:59:28,789
It’s nearly evening.

374
00:59:29,055 --> 00:59:32,809
She got nowhere to go.

375
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,813
- Help me, Roger!
- You dumbass.

376
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:11,149
- Have pity on me!
- Does Madam Minda know you’re here?

377
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:15,255
- You promised us a decent job.
- I didn't.

378
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,407
Roger, what’s happening?

379
01:00:17,432 --> 01:00:19,282
- It’s nothing, really…
- Sir, help us!

380
01:00:19,307 --> 01:00:22,910
- What’s happening?
- My sister.

381
01:00:22,935 --> 01:00:26,581
- My sister is still there. Please help me.
- Where?

382
01:00:26,606 --> 01:00:29,982
- Don’t interfere with this.
- Roger, what’s happening now?

383
01:00:30,007 --> 01:00:32,153
- This is my problem.
- Fuck!

384
01:00:32,178 --> 01:00:39,894
Do you want to die?
What if we both get in trouble?

385
01:00:40,535 --> 01:00:43,097
You bitch!
Why are you running away?

386
01:00:43,122 --> 01:00:47,293
- Stay out of this!
- Roger, hey!

387
01:00:47,318 --> 01:00:50,655
- What's happening?
- This is none of your business!

388
01:00:55,301 --> 01:01:01,724
- We’re supposed to find the flower, right?
- Go there by yourself!

389
01:01:05,587 --> 01:01:06,964
Roger!

390
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,857
Hurry up, move!

391
01:01:10,441 --> 01:01:12,985
You fool.
Hurry, stand up!

392
01:01:15,321 --> 01:01:17,657
I’ll split your head.

393
01:01:19,408 --> 01:01:22,829
Roger! Wait for me!

394
01:01:27,581 --> 01:01:30,209
You’re tough, aren’t you?

395
01:01:32,046 --> 01:01:37,135
Why are you trying to escape?
Are you planning something?

396
01:01:52,834 --> 01:02:00,925
Don’t worry, Minda, she will turn up.

397
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,952
She’s a pain in the ass!

398
01:02:25,145 --> 01:02:26,772
Hurry up!

399
01:02:27,427 --> 01:02:28,636
Madam Minda.

400
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:36,085
You fucking bitch!

401
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:40,615
Good thing Roger found you!

402
01:02:40,731 --> 01:02:43,451
They looked for you everywhere!

403
01:02:44,603 --> 01:02:49,608
Lucky you’ve been found!

404
01:02:50,416 --> 01:02:54,754
You gave me a big headache!

405
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:59,233
Told you she’ll be back, right?

406
01:02:59,258 --> 01:03:04,472
Wait. And who’s this guy?

407
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,475
That’s Francis.

408
01:03:08,344 --> 01:03:11,056
I told him not to follow me.
He works for the mayor.

409
01:03:11,215 --> 01:03:15,416
He's supposed to take photos
of a flower. A flower, right?

410
01:03:15,441 --> 01:03:17,610
- Yes.
- Says he’s a photographer.

411
01:03:17,635 --> 01:03:19,637
What flower? A photographer?

412
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:21,197
I’ve seen him before.

413
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:23,991
You’re the one who took
pictures of us earlier.

414
01:03:24,201 --> 01:03:27,912
But I deleted it.
Right, Roger?

415
01:03:30,271 --> 01:03:36,849
- You’re making me furious. Go inside!
- Have pity, please!

416
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:37,920
Francis.

417
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:45,763
- Please no!
- Go inside! Stay there!

418
01:03:49,533 --> 01:03:51,577
You can't be here.

419
01:03:51,602 --> 01:03:53,412
How am I supposed to go back?

420
01:03:53,437 --> 01:03:56,052
I don’t know, that's not my problem.

421
01:03:56,187 --> 01:04:04,185
I told you to go back.
Go on find the flowers on your own!

422
01:04:04,728 --> 01:04:06,897
What are we going to do with him?

423
01:04:06,922 --> 01:04:11,810
Let’s just lock him up with Angela.

424
01:04:11,835 --> 01:04:13,036
- Do it!
- Roger!

425
01:04:13,068 --> 01:04:17,753
- That’s not my problem anymore.
- Talk to the mayor first!

426
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:21,507
Your friend, Roger.

427
01:04:21,532 --> 01:04:22,800
Francis?

428
01:04:23,672 --> 01:04:25,404
Come here!
He’s calling you.

429
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:35,435
Call the mayor, please.

430
01:04:38,067 --> 01:04:39,318
Stay there.

431
01:04:44,211 --> 01:04:45,420
Enzo!

432
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:47,258
Enzo!

433
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:48,458
Hurry!

434
01:04:48,483 --> 01:04:49,442
What is it?

435
01:04:49,467 --> 01:04:52,208
Make sure you guard these two.

436
01:04:52,592 --> 01:04:55,318
Keep your eyes on them.

437
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:58,019
They musn’t escape.
Call your friend.

438
01:04:58,044 --> 01:05:02,089
Raven. Let’s guard these two.

439
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:21,817
What do we do?
I have a bad feeling about this.

440
01:05:21,942 --> 01:05:27,771
You know we'll be in trouble
when the Mayor finds out.

441
01:05:28,802 --> 01:05:34,683
This man knows nothing now,
but what if he finds out?

442
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:41,921
- It’s his fault.
- Roger!

443
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:46,217
Get rid of him tomorrow.

444
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:48,177
I’ll take care of it.

445
01:05:49,443 --> 01:05:51,070
I’ll go now.

446
01:05:53,676 --> 01:05:56,805
Roger. Do something about it.

447
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:00,701
I know when my instincts
are telling me something.

448
01:06:12,661 --> 01:06:20,424
- Why is he here?
- I didn't invite him here.

449
01:06:20,449 --> 01:06:22,284
You should have stopped him.

450
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:24,478
He’s persistent.

451
01:06:24,503 --> 01:06:26,714
He said the mayor
commissioned him for a job.

452
01:07:44,629 --> 01:07:49,301
Okay, Oscar.
You got a bottle of beer.

453
01:07:50,508 --> 01:07:52,310
You’ll pay one hundred.

454
01:08:09,303 --> 01:08:12,723
Son of a bitch,
you keep hitting it and yet…

455
01:08:12,748 --> 01:08:14,791
We can pay half for now, Minda.

456
01:08:15,316 --> 01:08:17,360
Alright, how much is this half
you’re ready to pay?

457
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:18,428
You’re the one who the most...

458
01:08:18,453 --> 01:08:20,580
Three hundred fifty, half.

459
01:08:20,916 --> 01:08:24,002
That’s equivalent to how many hits?

460
01:08:55,864 --> 01:09:00,703
Here, give this to my mother
when you go home.

461
01:09:01,245 --> 01:09:06,959
- How much is this? Five thousand?
- Yes, don't spend it.

462
01:09:06,984 --> 01:09:09,372
Okay, I’ll take care of it.

463
01:09:36,822 --> 01:09:40,075
I was just commissioned
to take pictures.

464
01:09:43,764 --> 01:09:47,893
What the hell happened?
What are you doing here?

465
01:09:54,855 --> 01:09:59,276
Roger brought me
and my sister to this place.

466
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:18,364
Sis, I’m nervous.

467
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:20,992
What are you worried about?

468
01:10:22,352 --> 01:10:26,314
Don’t worry, I won’t abandon you, alright?

469
01:10:26,678 --> 01:10:29,305
Besides, I’ll be with you.

470
01:10:46,684 --> 01:10:51,458
My grandma trusted him
so I believed him.

471
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:57,336
It’s all about clearcutting.
We have to do any more selective cutting.

472
01:10:57,361 --> 01:10:59,505
What are you doing?
Make sure everything is on track.

473
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:02,007
- I don't want to get delayed.
- Cheers, man. You got this, right?

474
01:11:02,032 --> 01:11:03,450
Make sure all our deliveries are on time.

475
01:11:03,475 --> 01:11:06,687
Hey, I’ll call you back, Roger’s here.

476
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:13,669
- Hey Roger.
- The new girls, they’re here.

477
01:11:14,253 --> 01:11:16,232
Good morning!

478
01:11:16,445 --> 01:11:20,574
This is Angela and Karla.

479
01:11:20,599 --> 01:11:22,476
- Hello!
- This is Boss John.

480
01:11:23,097 --> 01:11:26,685
- How are you two doing?
- We’re okay.

481
01:11:30,487 --> 01:11:32,246
Sir, if I may ask,

482
01:11:32,271 --> 01:11:34,605
is this the area
we’re supposed to clean?

483
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:38,761
You’ll clean all of it.

484
01:11:41,245 --> 01:11:44,158
Wait here, I’ll just get something inside.

485
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:47,703
They’re all nice, don’t you worry.

486
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:52,416
These are the friends of my boss,
they’ll be here with you.

487
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:59,398
See that? You’ll clean that part.
You here, okay?

488
01:11:59,423 --> 01:12:02,217
Work hard, don’t embarrass me
for bringing you here, okay?

489
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,361
Roger.

490
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:05,730
Yes, boss?

491
01:12:07,806 --> 01:12:09,433
They’re okay.

492
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:13,755
Thanks, boss.
You take care of them.

493
01:12:14,603 --> 01:12:17,777
Roger said they were kind,

494
01:12:17,802 --> 01:12:22,495
I didn’t know
they’d abuse us here.

495
01:13:21,713 --> 01:13:25,175
It’s fine, she’s enjoying it.

496
01:13:48,539 --> 01:13:50,374
Don't feel bad about this.

497
01:13:56,341 --> 01:13:58,343
Please help us.

498
01:13:59,493 --> 01:14:01,231
I'm begging you.

499
01:14:04,076 --> 01:14:06,934
My sister needs help.

500
01:14:55,015 --> 01:14:58,018
When will you set me free?

501
01:15:04,942 --> 01:15:07,778
When will you let me go?

502
01:15:09,321 --> 01:15:11,823
You don’t like it here?

503
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:16,536
Don’t be like your sister.

504
01:15:18,163 --> 01:15:21,959
She ran away, but got caught.

505
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:30,550
Let me see.

506
01:15:33,574 --> 01:15:35,576
She needs me.

507
01:15:37,516 --> 01:15:40,268
I should be with her.

508
01:15:42,712 --> 01:15:47,049
I don’t know what to do.

509
01:15:47,734 --> 01:15:50,362
How can I help you?

510
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:37,047
Sis, I’m nervous.

511
01:19:37,619 --> 01:19:39,425
I won’t leave you, alright?

512
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:42,320
Besides, I’ll be there with you.

513
01:21:34,461 --> 01:21:35,486
Here!

514
01:22:00,778 --> 01:22:02,780
Careful, they might hear us.

515
01:22:45,505 --> 01:22:47,925
Let’s go get my sister.

516
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:49,337
Okay.

517
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:11,177
That’s the path to your sister!

518
01:24:48,775 --> 01:24:50,193
Hurry.

519
01:25:02,747 --> 01:25:04,541
Run, quick!

520
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:40,368
Karla.

521
01:25:41,869 --> 01:25:44,497
Karla, I’m thirsty.

522
01:25:47,822 --> 01:25:49,824
Karla!

523
01:26:07,812 --> 01:26:09,814
- Karla’s missing.
- What?

524
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:12,793
- What did you say?
- Karla’s missing.

525
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:15,503
What happened… Karla?

526
01:26:15,528 --> 01:26:17,530
Greg. Karla’s gone.

527
01:26:17,931 --> 01:26:21,451
How could she leave
when her sister’s here?

528
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:24,064
Her sister’s here…

529
01:26:24,368 --> 01:26:28,391
No, she’s gone too!

530
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:30,001
Enzo!

531
01:26:31,336 --> 01:26:32,462
Enzo!

532
01:26:32,628 --> 01:26:35,422
Roger! Come here!

533
01:26:37,197 --> 01:26:38,865
Roger! Hurry!

534
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:39,891
What is it?

535
01:26:39,916 --> 01:26:44,921
Find the sisters,
or we’ll be in deep shit!

536
01:26:44,946 --> 01:26:46,837
Fuck it, hurry up!

537
01:26:47,212 --> 01:26:48,839
They can’t have gone far!

538
01:26:49,129 --> 01:26:50,478
Angela!

539
01:26:52,148 --> 01:26:56,837
Roger, look for them.
They can't go that far.

540
01:26:57,390 --> 01:26:59,225
Fuck them!

541
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,914
When I find them I’m gonna kill them!

542
01:27:10,906 --> 01:27:12,967
Where did they go...

543
01:27:14,386 --> 01:27:16,137
Roger!

544
01:27:16,162 --> 01:27:17,023
This way, boss!

545
01:27:17,048 --> 01:27:18,132
She’s there?

546
01:27:35,094 --> 01:27:36,251
Run faster!

547
01:27:36,666 --> 01:27:38,084
Karla!

548
01:27:41,937 --> 01:27:43,522
Angela!

549
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:48,621
They’re there!

550
01:27:50,928 --> 01:27:53,514
Let’s go there, quick!

551
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:30,496
Run this way!

552
01:28:32,701 --> 01:28:33,827
Come!

553
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:50,742
There they are.

554
01:28:50,767 --> 01:28:51,434
Angela!

555
01:29:06,073 --> 01:29:08,075
They’re right there!

556
01:29:08,395 --> 01:29:09,802
Hurry!

557
01:29:25,635 --> 01:29:28,803
Run!

558
01:29:31,259 --> 01:29:34,054
Karla! Angela!

559
01:29:41,568 --> 01:29:43,236
This way!

560
01:29:52,476 --> 01:29:54,145
This way!

561
01:30:11,097 --> 01:30:12,014
There!

562
01:30:19,385 --> 01:30:21,054
Karla!

563
01:30:23,839 --> 01:30:27,964
- Karla!
- Go, run!

564
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:30,366
Karla!

565
01:30:30,867 --> 01:30:32,869
Run as fast as you can.

566
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:41,752
Keep running!

567
01:30:50,303 --> 01:30:53,681
Help!

568
01:31:06,444 --> 01:31:08,321
Let's go.

569
01:31:09,947 --> 01:31:11,365
Shit.

570
01:31:25,212 --> 01:31:27,340
- It’s okay.
- No.

571
01:31:28,466 --> 01:31:31,344
I’m so afraid of snakes, man.

572
01:31:36,684 --> 01:31:37,769
Greg.

573
01:31:40,006 --> 01:31:41,966
- Steady, man.
- Stop, don’t move!

574
01:31:41,991 --> 01:31:43,247
I’m gonna shoot it.

575
01:31:45,732 --> 01:31:47,401
I can do this.

576
01:31:57,137 --> 01:32:00,766
- Greg, don’t.
- Just trust me. I got this.

577
01:32:01,624 --> 01:32:04,001
Stop, I’ll shoot it!

578
01:32:55,428 --> 01:32:57,805
Wait.

579
01:33:14,321 --> 01:33:17,950
Karla! Wake up!

580
01:33:21,933 --> 01:33:23,926
Karla!

581
01:33:24,794 --> 01:33:26,709
Wake up!

582
01:33:31,213 --> 01:33:32,631
Wake up!

583
01:33:51,567 --> 01:33:55,677
Karla! Don’t leave me!

584
01:34:07,917 --> 01:34:09,877
I don’t want to!

585
01:34:16,759 --> 01:34:18,177
Karla!

586
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:40,562
Sir, what can you say about
the dead women found in the forest?

587
01:37:40,587 --> 01:37:42,047
Ma’am, do you know who they are?

588
01:37:42,072 --> 01:37:46,076
What can you say about it?

589
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:53,809
The dead bodies, is that confirmed?

590
01:37:54,948 --> 01:37:56,366
Ma’am! Sir!

591
01:38:01,025 --> 01:38:03,110
Let's go.

592
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:09,710
Just a bit sir,
what can you say about it?

593
01:38:33,265 --> 01:38:37,936
- Boss he’s here, you can talk to him now.
- Alright.

594
01:38:43,924 --> 01:38:48,845
Tina. Tell them I’ll talk
to them later, okay?

595
01:38:48,870 --> 01:38:49,954
Yes, sir.

596
01:38:52,376 --> 01:38:54,733
Ma’am, can we move
to the session hall first?

597
01:38:54,757 --> 01:38:56,555
Mayor will talk to us there.

598
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:58,354
Mayor will talk to you now.

599
01:39:09,752 --> 01:39:10,815
Welcome back.

600
01:39:11,384 --> 01:39:13,386
Were you able to take
photos of the flowers?

601
01:39:14,807 --> 01:39:16,225
Yes, mayor.

602
01:39:16,392 --> 01:39:17,309
And...

603
01:39:20,814 --> 01:39:22,650
And other things too.

604
01:39:30,114 --> 01:39:33,659
Just do what I asked you to do.

605
01:39:35,064 --> 01:39:38,984
Or else there will be consequences.

606
01:40:19,371 --> 01:40:20,789
Grandma, why?

607
01:40:25,836 --> 01:40:27,671
What do you mean?

608
01:40:28,251 --> 01:40:30,712
Why did you do that to us?

609
01:40:33,264 --> 01:40:36,351
What do you want to do now?

610
01:40:36,951 --> 01:40:39,996
What will our future be?

611
01:40:43,326 --> 01:40:51,042
If you weren’t such an idiot,
your sister would still be alive.

612
01:40:51,067 --> 01:40:53,319
What’s so bad about that place?

613
01:40:53,344 --> 01:40:56,889
You had food there,
we have food here.

614
01:40:56,914 --> 01:41:00,495
You want something more.

615
01:41:04,875 --> 01:41:06,752
What am I going to do?!

616
01:41:07,047 --> 01:41:10,425
Did you even bother
to consider our feelings?

617
01:41:10,450 --> 01:41:15,932
Do you know what happened to us there?
And now she's gone!

618
01:41:16,219 --> 01:41:19,722
We have no food?
I could always plant vegetables.

619
01:41:20,541 --> 01:41:25,922
I can also work in Manila.
Why did you do this?

620
01:41:26,276 --> 01:41:27,714
Fool!

621
01:41:30,011 --> 01:41:35,308
Your sister died
because of your stupidity!

622
01:41:35,333 --> 01:41:39,581
You would also become a whore in Manila.

623
01:41:40,827 --> 01:41:41,828
Idiot.

624
01:41:41,995 --> 01:41:42,996
Fool.

625
01:42:03,362 --> 01:42:06,199
How are you feeling?

626
01:42:08,939 --> 01:42:12,818
It’s the wound.
It will be amputated.

627
01:42:13,776 --> 01:42:17,447
- Grandma, have you seen my bolo?
- No.

628
01:42:19,324 --> 01:42:20,742
Where is it?

629
01:42:23,769 --> 01:42:25,687
Be strong.

630
01:42:28,674 --> 01:42:30,011
Mom, just have this washed.

631
01:42:30,393 --> 01:42:35,141
Son, your father has a very high fever.

632
01:42:38,990 --> 01:42:42,910
- Let’s take him to the hospital, Mom.
- Where will we get the money?

633
01:42:44,872 --> 01:42:47,083
Where will we get the money?

634
01:42:51,322 --> 01:42:55,743
Mom, I’ll find a way.
We’ll take Dad to a hospital.

635
01:42:57,411 --> 01:42:59,705
- When?
- Just wait, Mom.

636
01:42:59,730 --> 01:43:03,358
- Where are you going?
- I’m just looking for my bolo.

637
01:43:03,861 --> 01:43:05,005
Roger!

638
01:43:06,847 --> 01:43:08,028
Wait, Mom.

639
01:43:59,417 --> 01:44:00,417
Roger?

640
01:44:02,721 --> 01:44:03,721
Roger!

641
01:44:07,463 --> 01:44:09,217
Roger!

642
01:44:09,242 --> 01:44:13,413
Roger, my son!
Who the fuck are you?

643
01:44:13,438 --> 01:44:14,898
Help!

644
01:44:14,923 --> 01:44:17,509
Please help us!

645
01:44:35,919 --> 01:44:38,839
Francis, we must let
the world know about this.

646
01:44:43,416 --> 01:44:44,584
I’m afraid.

647
01:44:45,858 --> 01:44:47,276
What about our children?

648
01:44:54,447 --> 01:44:56,449
Francis, don’t be afraid.

649
01:44:57,816 --> 01:45:02,362
Our company's legal team will protect us.

650
01:45:08,548 --> 01:45:12,176
There’s a safehouse
we can go to anytime.

651
01:45:13,246 --> 01:45:14,721
We can move there temporarily.

652
01:45:15,417 --> 01:45:18,837
We must make this public.
Look at those!

653
01:45:26,011 --> 01:45:27,429
Francis...

654
01:45:30,682 --> 01:45:35,437
Don’t be afraid. I’m here.
Your family’s here for you.

655
01:45:36,771 --> 01:45:39,357
I have always believed in you.

656
01:45:40,736 --> 01:45:45,949
I believe that you’re the same Francis,
the same brave man that I know.

657
01:45:49,284 --> 01:45:51,703
We can get through this.

658
01:46:33,221 --> 01:46:38,934
The joint forces of the DILG
and the local police

659
01:46:38,959 --> 01:46:42,187
arrested Mayor Peter Balano
of Dolores, Bukidnon

660
01:46:42,212 --> 01:46:44,330
and his accomplices.

661
01:46:44,355 --> 01:46:46,025
He is facing multiple charges

662
01:46:46,050 --> 01:46:49,494
thru the office of the Ombudsman
in accordance with Republic Act 3701

663
01:46:49,519 --> 01:46:51,396
or Anti-Illegal Logging Act,

664
01:46:51,501 --> 01:46:55,534
RA 9208 or Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act,

665
01:46:55,559 --> 01:47:00,508
RA 3019 or Anti-Graft
and Corrupt Practices Act.
