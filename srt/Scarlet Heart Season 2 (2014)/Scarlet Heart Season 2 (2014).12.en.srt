2
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:42,980
<i>[Episode 12]</i>

3
00:01:46,434 --> 00:01:48,118
What are you doing?

4
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,083
Who told you to take away the furniture?

5
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,951
Boss asked us to disassemble.

6
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,925
Sihan, you called the moving company?

7
00:02:02,283 --> 00:02:05,100
Yes, what's the matter?

8
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,667
Z&X isn't bankrupt yet.

9
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:10,159
Why are you doing this?

10
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,392
Mr. Jiang just called.

11
00:02:12,392 --> 00:02:14,167
He said he's withdrawing his investment.

12
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:15,834
Sihan.

13
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:18,392
No need to comfort me.

14
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:21,134
The results came back saying it was our problem.

15
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:22,999
We can't blame anyone.

16
00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:24,726
This is not your fault.

17
00:02:24,726 --> 00:02:28,142
All the samples delivered to us that morning were all problematic.

18
00:02:28,142 --> 00:02:30,350
But the stock we have had no problems.

19
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,642
What does that prove?

20
00:02:31,642 --> 00:02:33,709
Someone is messing with us.

21
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:34,851
This is not your fault.

22
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:36,850
Don't blame yourself.

23
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:41,600
Results are everything in business.

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,542
Nobody will listen to your excuses.

25
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:53,626
Why aren't you answering?

26
00:02:53,626 --> 00:02:54,834
They're all from reporters.

27
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:56,809
Why answer?

28
00:02:58,918 --> 00:03:00,809
I'm the person in charge of Z&X.

29
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:03,309
You can speak to me.

30
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:04,892
What did you say?

31
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:07,684
A cosmetic company called Jiao Yue

32
00:03:07,684 --> 00:03:09,967
is willing to invest two hundred million dollars in our company.

33
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:16,834
These are Z&X's financial statements for its business in England.

34
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:18,200
Please have a look.

35
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,876
I don't need this.

36
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:22,099
Before deciding to invest in your company,

37
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:25,099
we already carried out a thorough investigation.

38
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:28,434
This contract was prepared based on the conditions we have agreed to.

39
00:03:28,434 --> 00:03:30,434
If Mr. Kang has no other objection,

40
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:32,375
please sign the contract.

41
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:41,934
I would like to clarify something before signing.

42
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:43,099
Please.

43
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:46,417
Z&X is rapidly expanding locally.

44
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:49,250
But there are many competitors in the market.

45
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,642
In just this month alone,

46
00:03:50,642 --> 00:03:53,309
we fought in close quarters with a strong opponent.

47
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:55,267
We've put up a bad show.

48
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:57,018
Because of this

49
00:03:57,018 --> 00:04:01,100
we're forced to offer up the brand of Z&X.

50
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,100
And you're telling me this because?

51
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,100
Honestly, I can't guarantee

52
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,325
whether we or not we can defeat the strong opponent after we cooperate.

53
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:11,325
So I hope before you sign the contract

54
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:14,050
you will take into consideration the risks.

55
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:16,684
Mr. Kang is truly honest.

56
00:04:16,684 --> 00:04:20,892
Aren't you worried about affecting our cooperation?

57
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:25,684
I'm very appreciative of your confidence in us.

58
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:27,767
I think it's important

59
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,076
to be honest with our business partners.

60
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:33,309
I'm just Jiao Yue's negotiator.

61
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:36,225
Management makes the decisions.

62
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:39,851
I believe they will take all into consideration.

63
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:41,976
Our chairman will be present today as well.

64
00:04:41,976 --> 00:04:43,976
If you have any doubts,

65
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:46,859
you can ask him before signing the contract.

66
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:09,059
- Happy to work with you.
- Happy to work with you.

67
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:11,183
Chairman.

68
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:14,059
Sorry, I was stuck in traffic.

69
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:15,726
It's a pity I couldn't witness the historical moment

70
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:19,100
in which our companies become one family.

71
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,018
Don't get it wrong.

72
00:05:21,018 --> 00:05:25,517
Z&X is acquired by Jiao Yue, not Zhen Tian.

73
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:26,999
You didn't tell Mr. Kang?

74
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:28,392
Mr. Kang, I forgot to tell you.

75
00:05:28,392 --> 00:05:32,400
Jiao Yue is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zhen Tian Group.

76
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:35,434
You may leave now.

77
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:36,751
Okay.

78
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:43,684
If Siyu and Donghai didn't inform me,

79
00:05:43,684 --> 00:05:46,209
I wouldn't even had known you were back in Beijing.

80
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:50,225
Sihan, all these years,

81
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,999
and you still can't forgive me?

82
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:57,475
You'd rather ask Donghai for help instead of me?

83
00:05:57,475 --> 00:06:00,183
Do you still think of me as your father?

84
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:03,350
Then do you still think of me as your son?

85
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,684
You sent me to study abroad in London all by myself

86
00:06:05,684 --> 00:06:08,642
to maintain your happy family.

87
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:10,834
I've explained to you.

88
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,876
Our family is complicated.

89
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:13,959
It was a difficult decision.

90
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,292
Great, I don't need you.

91
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,100
I've been alone for twenty years.

92
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,742
I always considered myself an orphan.

93
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:23,750
You're right.

94
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,892
I haven't been with you for twenty years.

95
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:28,684
But it doesn't mean that I'm not concerned about you.

96
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:32,642
I send you your tuition fee, cost of living, and graduation fees

97
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,417
on time and in full every time.

98
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:36,350
Besides that,

99
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,142
I sent two guards with you

100
00:06:38,142 --> 00:06:39,999
for the sake of your personal safety.

101
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,642
So that's your excuse?

102
00:06:43,642 --> 00:06:44,876
Listen.

103
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:46,542
What I needed wasn't money nor guards.

104
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:49,750
I just wanted a family.

105
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:52,434
You were my only family after my mom passed away.

106
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:54,667
But what have you given me?

107
00:06:58,492 --> 00:07:01,792
Can you give me a chance to make up for my mistakes?

108
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:05,417
I'm getting old.

109
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:08,225
I can't do much for you anymore.

110
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:11,142
I've taken great pains to meet with you

111
00:07:11,142 --> 00:07:14,000
to convince you to come back to Zhen Tian.

112
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:18,434
I wish to make up for

113
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:20,451
what I've owed you the past twenty years.

114
00:07:21,684 --> 00:07:24,375
Don't you think it's too late?

115
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,334
If you can't forgive me,

116
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:30,709
are you going to just watch the brand you built

117
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:33,799
get destroyed before your eyes?

118
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:37,642
Whether you like it or not,

119
00:07:37,642 --> 00:07:39,500
you're a Kang.

120
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,034
We Kangs are career-oriented.

121
00:07:42,034 --> 00:07:46,084
We don't let our emotions ruin our careers.

122
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:51,267
Chairman Kang, I'm sorry.

123
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:52,650
I have to disappoint you.

124
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,000
Let's go.

125
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:56,659
Sihan.

126
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:02,609
Do you know why I name the company Jiao Yue?

127
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:06,125
Jiao is your mother's name.

128
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,659
Her dying words

129
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:10,999
were wishing that her son Sihan

130
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:14,200
would become an excellent man when he grows up.

131
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:20,999
Then do you know why my company is named as Z&X?

132
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:24,309
Z is the first letter of my English name,

133
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:28,392
while X is the first letter of my mom's name.

134
00:08:28,392 --> 00:08:30,250
Z&X stands for my mother and I.

135
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,600
You're not a part of the equation!

136
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,225
I'll wait for you.

137
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:37,559
I'll wait for you to change your mind.

138
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,792
Why didn't you ever mention your father?

139
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,559
Don't you understand?

140
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,099
He is not my father.

141
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:52,667
Sihan, don't be stubborn.

142
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,167
Whether you like it or not,

143
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,834
fact is fact.

144
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,059
I won't surrender that easily.

145
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:59,592
Would it be better for you to bear all the responsibility on your own?

146
00:09:05,434 --> 00:09:09,350
Zhuo Yue, if you think I should return to Zhen Tian,

147
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,517
then we are no longer friends.

148
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:14,167
I've always looked up to your morals, your broad-mindedness, and your courage.

149
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:15,809
But now I realize

150
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:17,809
that you're actually very selfish.

151
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:20,083
Have you thought about the others?

152
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,684
<i>Acquire Z&X.</i>

153
00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:39,475
<i>When you're defeated,</i>

154
00:09:39,475 --> 00:09:41,575
<i>don't say I didn't warn you.</i>

155
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,851
<i>President Kang.</i>

156
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,559
<i>Bad news.</i>

157
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:48,851
<i>Our two stores caught fire in the night.</i>

158
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:52,684
<i>You have a very large platform at Zhen Tian Group.</i>

159
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:55,999
<i>The place that can let you succeed is in front of you.</i>

160
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:58,450
<i>But you don't want it</i>

161
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,142
<i>and insist on starting from nothing.</i>

162
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,876
<i>Why do that to yourself?</i>

163
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:04,334
<i>They found that it was induced</i>

164
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:06,934
<i>by the alcohol in our perfume warehouse.</i>

165
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:09,475
<i>There were no signs of human trail.</i>

166
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,709
<i>If Siyu and Donghai didn't inform me,</i>

167
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:13,792
<i>I wouldn't even had known you were back in Beijing.</i>

168
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,018
<i>I'm getting old.</i>

169
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:17,242
<i>I can't do much for you anymore.</i>

170
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,350
<i>I wish to make up for</i>

171
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,976
<i>what I've owed you the past twenty years.</i>

172
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:25,767
<i>I've always looked up to your morals, your broad-mindedness, and your courage.</i>

173
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,225
<i>But now I realize</i>

174
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:28,959
<i>that you're actually very selfish.</i>

175
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,375
<i>Have you thought about the others?</i>

176
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,876
What are you doing?

177
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:01,892
Isn't it obvious? I'm baking something.

178
00:11:01,892 --> 00:11:03,684
Do you think I'm frying dough sticks?

179
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,767
Let me do it.

180
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,434
No, I have to bake this cake myself.

181
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:10,951
Why?

182
00:11:12,642 --> 00:11:13,350
Because...

183
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,642
Because you're giving it to the person you like.

184
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:20,059
But you can't let Zhang Xiao eat charcoal.

185
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:22,600
How dare you look down upon your boss?

186
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,767
Let me tell you.

187
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,584
I followed the steps from the French original baking tips book.

188
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:30,334
Just wait and see.

189
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:33,751
It's done.

190
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,051
See, it worked.

191
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:51,851
Love is so great.

192
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:55,892
I can turn someone who is waited on hand and foot

193
00:11:55,892 --> 00:11:58,099
into a professional baker.

194
00:11:58,099 --> 00:12:01,100
Zhang Xiao is really lucky.

195
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,409
Don't be jealous.

196
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:04,225
Find a man for yourself.

197
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:07,142
Don't just keep sticking around in this kitchen.

198
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:09,475
Do you hate me that much?

199
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:13,642
I'm just kidding.

200
00:12:13,642 --> 00:12:15,626
How could I hate you?

201
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:17,167
You can carry gas tanks.

202
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:18,751
You have great culinary skills.

203
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:20,018
You're skilled in the arts of seizing and grappling,

204
00:12:20,018 --> 00:12:21,934
and you welcome guests with a smile.

205
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:23,934
Where will I find someone else like you?

206
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:26,267
Are you still not telling her this time?

207
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:28,283
It doesn't matter if she knows.

208
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:30,592
I just need to know.

209
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:39,459
<i>Why are you still not online?</i>

210
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,767
<i>Black Cat Detective.</i>

211
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:44,209
<i>Where did you go?</i>

212
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:45,642
Stop looking at it.

213
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:46,167
Give it back to me.

214
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:48,042
- Congratulations.
- Stop.

215
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:49,534
I know.

216
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:52,367
It's a free cake for the lucky table again.

217
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:54,475
The lucky table event has ended.

218
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:58,342
This time you're the restaurant's lucky 100th customer.

219
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:01,899
Really?

220
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:05,592
Won't your restaurant lose out on profit if you're giving out so much free stuff?

221
00:13:06,234 --> 00:13:08,475
The satisfaction of our customers is our best reward.

222
00:13:08,475 --> 00:13:10,584
Please enjoy your cake.

223
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:14,225
Show me your hand.

224
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:16,942
Tomorrow, I'm using it to buy a lottery ticket.

225
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:21,850
This is definitely fishy.

226
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:24,250
Why would it be?

227
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,475
It's free anyway, just eat it.

228
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:29,309
All you know is to eat.

229
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:33,442
Don't you think this restaurant's been a bit weird lately?

230
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,684
My cake, Jack's soup,

231
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,209
and your chicken curry.

232
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:44,350
Why haven't I noticed?

233
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,999
Who is the evil chef who did that to me?

234
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:51,267
He almost ruined my love for food.

235
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:56,492
So let's...

236
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:02,375
Let's catch him.

237
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,751
Let's go.

238
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:11,417
- Move.
- What's wrong?

239
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,100
Zhang Xiao. Quickly.

240
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,167
Go.

241
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,209
What a huge kitchen.

242
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:24,083
Cut the crap and find him.

243
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,350
There are so many chefs.

244
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,642
How am I supposed to know who the mysterious chef is?

245
00:14:27,642 --> 00:14:30,584
Stupid, ask them one by one.

246
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:33,325
Then I'll ask them one by one.

247
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:35,767
What should I do?

248
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:37,492
Follow me.

249
00:14:40,142 --> 00:14:40,976
- I don't know.
- Thank you.

250
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:42,559
Are you the mysterious chef?

251
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,892
No.

252
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:46,542
Hi, who makes the lucky cake?

253
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:48,199
I don't know.

254
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:49,834
Thank you.

255
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:54,076
Strange.

256
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:58,592
These chefs don't know about the lucky cake.

257
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:02,684
Is there a ghost?

258
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:04,767
Nonsense.

259
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:10,700
All ghosts will run away when they see you.

260
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,700
It's none of my business.

261
00:15:17,726 --> 00:15:18,918
Who's that?

262
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,767
<i>Are you free?</i>

263
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:22,976
<i>Let's meet in the cafe we met in last time.</i>

264
00:15:22,976 --> 00:15:24,959
<i>I want to talk to you.</i>

265
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,292
I have to go now.

266
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:28,250
Continue your search.

267
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,784
Remember to tell me when you find out.

268
00:15:29,784 --> 00:15:31,492
Bye.

269
00:15:31,492 --> 00:15:33,617
How am I supposed to find him without you?

270
00:15:56,183 --> 00:15:57,809
Are you okay?

271
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:01,709
Now I understand what chilly feels like.

272
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,500
Let's go get some sun. It's on me.

273
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,834
It's such a big bill.

274
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:06,667
It's on me.

275
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,059
Stop.

276
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:10,892
It's you.

277
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:12,259
Get him.

278
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,475
I've been sitting here for more than ten minutes.

279
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:46,934
Are you facing a dilemma?

280
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:53,918
Take a guess.

281
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:55,600
Me?

282
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,200
How would I know?

283
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:00,767
Then let me ask you.

284
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:04,367
Have you ever faced any tough dilemmas?

285
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:06,509
Me?

286
00:17:07,434 --> 00:17:09,534
Just three dilemmas.

287
00:17:10,142 --> 00:17:13,542
First, what to eat for breakfast.

288
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:15,999
Second, what to eat for lunch.

289
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:18,892
And third, what to eat for dinner.

290
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,183
Sometimes I really envy you.

291
00:17:24,183 --> 00:17:26,618
Simplicity is bliss.

292
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:37,034
Stop being mysterious, just tell me.

293
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,334
I have a question.

294
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:42,825
I'd like to get the answer from you.

295
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:50,834
For example,

296
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:55,183
one day you and your friends went for an exploration in a forest,

297
00:17:55,183 --> 00:17:58,434
and you unexpectedly fell into a trap.

298
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:01,225
This trap is gloomy and cold.

299
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:03,309
There is no food at all.

300
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:05,934
You're all dying from starvation.

301
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:09,375
At this moment, the hunter who dug the trap appeared.

302
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:13,718
He said that he could throw in a string to save everyone.

303
00:18:14,684 --> 00:18:16,950
But on one condition.

304
00:18:17,784 --> 00:18:19,325
What's the condition?

305
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:25,600
He wants you to marry him.

306
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:30,125
Then that depends on whether or not he's handsome.

307
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,850
He looks like that guy.

308
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:49,999
What's your answer?

309
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:54,392
I'll marry him.

310
00:18:54,392 --> 00:18:56,018
Why?

311
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:58,426
Don't you think you're at a disadvantage?

312
00:18:59,142 --> 00:19:04,851
My dad is a desert expedition guide.

313
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:06,851
He always tell me.

314
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:08,475
Even when there's a sandstorm,

315
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:10,809
he would never leave his team.

316
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:12,826
A guide who runs away

317
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:15,342
will be looked down on forever.

318
00:19:16,475 --> 00:19:20,392
Plus, the guide's responsibility is to protect his team members

319
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,534
and bring them to their destination.

320
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:33,100
If the hunter isn't handsome,

321
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,309
then he might be rich.

322
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,409
Why do you ask?

323
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:56,734
Did you give the cake to Zhang Xiao?

324
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:58,375
So what if I did?

325
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,434
Pretending to be nice.

326
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:03,018
I knew you were up to no good.

327
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:05,726
It's none of your business.

328
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:08,600
I don't think it's any of your concern.

329
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,325
None of my business?

330
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:12,892
If it's none of my business, then why did you mess with my curry chicken?

331
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:15,434
That dish is very expensive.

332
00:20:15,434 --> 00:20:18,059
Weren't you taught to appreciate what you have?

333
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,250
You're wasting food.

334
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:25,100
I just can't bear to see a stranger like you around Zhang Xiao.

335
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,892
That chicken curry is just a starter.

336
00:20:27,892 --> 00:20:29,559
If you don't learn your lesson,

337
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,018
you're in for another treat.

338
00:20:32,018 --> 00:20:33,876
You have guts.

339
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:35,959
How dare you mess with me?

340
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:37,942
- I'll...
- Don't move.

341
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,834
Let's use our words.

342
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:46,209
Let's not harm our friendship.

343
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:49,684
If my blood splatters onto this floor,

344
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:52,692
you might get fined by the sanitation bureau.

345
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:57,283
Listen here.

346
00:20:57,283 --> 00:21:00,242
If you tell anyone that Ling Dang and I are here,

347
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:03,709
you will end up just like this carrot.

348
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:05,334
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

349
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:07,167
I won't tell anyone.

350
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,626
I won't tell.

351
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:14,000
Thank you.

352
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:18,584
Oh my God.

353
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:34,026
Coming.

354
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:37,584
Aunt Rong, I'm Sihan.

355
00:21:37,584 --> 00:21:40,318
Sihan.

356
00:21:41,584 --> 00:21:43,667
Madam, Chairman Kang.

357
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:46,134
Look who's home.

358
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,626
Sihan.

359
00:21:56,626 --> 00:21:59,459
Aunt Lan, it's been a long time.

360
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:01,767
Zhentian.

361
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:03,726
I knew you'd come back.

362
00:22:03,726 --> 00:22:04,709
Have you eaten?

363
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:06,626
Aunt Rong, get dinner ready.

364
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:08,434
- Okay.
- It's fine.

365
00:22:08,434 --> 00:22:10,334
I'm leaving soon.

366
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:13,183
Sihan, have a seat first.

367
00:22:13,183 --> 00:22:14,392
Don't just stand there.

368
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:16,059
Aunt Rong, warm up some ginseng soup.

369
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:17,584
Okay.

370
00:22:20,742 --> 00:22:22,092
Sihan.

371
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:25,809
Your father has a lot to say to you.

372
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:27,392
You're finally back.

373
00:22:27,392 --> 00:22:29,851
He can finally feel at ease.

374
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:31,492
Siyu misses you so much.

375
00:22:31,492 --> 00:22:34,100
We all want you to move back home.

376
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:38,559
I'm here to discuss business with you.

377
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,767
What is it?

378
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:45,142
I've taken your advice into consideration.

379
00:22:45,142 --> 00:22:47,459
You're willing to come to Zhen Tian?

380
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,417
Yes.

381
00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:52,959
Sihan is joining Zhen Tian?

382
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:54,584
How great.

383
00:22:54,584 --> 00:22:56,892
But I have three conditions.

384
00:22:56,892 --> 00:22:57,934
Say it.

385
00:22:57,934 --> 00:22:58,851
One.

386
00:22:58,851 --> 00:23:01,417
After Z&X merges with Zhen Tian Group,

387
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:05,099
you cannot dismiss or demote the existing employees.

388
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:07,559
You cannot change Z&X's name.

389
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,534
No problem.

390
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:09,742
Two.

391
00:23:09,742 --> 00:23:15,100
Clarify to the media that the allergic reaction case has nothing to do with the quality of Z&X's products.

392
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,826
I would've done that anyway.

393
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:18,575
Three.

394
00:23:18,575 --> 00:23:21,642
I'm joining Zhen Tian for my career.

395
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:23,434
It has nothing to do with our family matters,

396
00:23:23,434 --> 00:23:26,318
and has nothing to do with whether or not I forgive an irresponsible father like you.

397
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,400
Sihan.

398
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,099
Don't blame your father for what he did twenty years ago.

399
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:36,199
It's all my fault.

400
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,876
Aunt Lan.

401
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,600
I'm talking about the future.

402
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,392
The past is the past.

403
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:49,325
No problem, I promise you.

404
00:23:49,325 --> 00:23:51,809
Thank you, Chairman. Bye.

405
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:54,200
Sihan.

406
00:23:55,325 --> 00:23:56,809
Since you are back,

407
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:58,767
just move back home.

408
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:01,892
We kept your room for you.

409
00:24:01,892 --> 00:24:04,225
Aunt Lan, don't you remember?

410
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:06,142
When I left this home,

411
00:24:06,142 --> 00:24:07,809
I was ten years old.

412
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:10,267
I'm 32 now.

413
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:14,276
I can't fit in that small room anymore.

414
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:20,367
Sihan.

415
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:21,542
Why did he leave?

416
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:23,167
You can go.

417
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:34,283
I wouldn't recognize him

418
00:24:34,283 --> 00:24:36,399
if I ran into him on the streets.

419
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:40,042
Don't take it personally.

420
00:24:41,575 --> 00:24:43,259
It's all my fault.

421
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:49,934
Memory is like a sponge.

422
00:24:49,934 --> 00:24:54,226
It absorbs easily, but is hard to squeeze out.

423
00:24:55,475 --> 00:24:57,125
Let's take it one step at a time.

424
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:05,517
Our topic of discussion for today is how to expand the company.

425
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:09,559
I think we should divide and conquer.

426
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:12,099
We should acquire small companies

427
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:14,584
with bright market prospects.

428
00:25:14,584 --> 00:25:17,600
Expanding is not our final goal.

429
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,809
We are going to integrate resources from these small companies

430
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:25,392
and operate according to their mode of business.

431
00:25:25,392 --> 00:25:28,100
This is the only way to build Zhen Tian Group

432
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,318
into an international commercial empire.

433
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,876
The youth should be feared.

434
00:25:38,876 --> 00:25:43,200
Hearing Director Yin's advice is equivalent to studying for ten years.

435
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,809
Lao Liu, do you feel like you're behind the times?

436
00:25:50,784 --> 00:25:54,009
Chairman, what do you think?

437
00:25:55,018 --> 00:25:57,225
He made great points.

438
00:25:57,225 --> 00:26:00,392
He's done thorough research.

439
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,800
Lao Liu.

440
00:26:03,267 --> 00:26:07,118
I'd like to introduce a young man to everyone.

441
00:26:16,918 --> 00:26:18,742
Directors,

442
00:26:18,742 --> 00:26:24,392
our group recently acquired a cosmetic brand called Z&X.

443
00:26:24,392 --> 00:26:28,309
He is the president of Z&X.

444
00:26:28,309 --> 00:26:30,684
Mr. Kang Sihan.

445
00:26:30,684 --> 00:26:32,059
Directors,

446
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,918
although Sihan is young,

447
00:26:33,918 --> 00:26:35,970
he has an impressive background.

448
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,010
He received his doctorate of biology

449
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:42,434
from the top university, Cambridge University in England.

450
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:47,350
Before returning to China, he held an important post at England's Virgin Cosmetics.

451
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:52,334
And he founded the perfume brand Z&X.

452
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:56,500
Recently, he's been developing new skin care products.

453
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,999
He is a promising young man.

454
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:02,559
Overseas returnees are great,

455
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,959
but he might not be able to get a footing here.

456
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,200
An overseas returnee?

457
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,125
Lao Wang,

458
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:15,030
what do you mean by that?

459
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,350
Right.

460
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:21,042
I forgot to tell you Sihan's identity.

461
00:27:21,042 --> 00:27:25,018
He is the only son of the chairman

462
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:28,459
and his first wife, Madam Xu Ruijiao.

463
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:32,209
A descent of the Kangs.

464
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:34,934
Lao Liu, you're really something.

465
00:27:34,934 --> 00:27:36,434
Enough.

466
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:38,809
The both of you aren't kids anymore.

467
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:42,492
Don't behave like children.

468
00:27:43,575 --> 00:27:44,959
Director Yin.

469
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:47,970
I agree with your suggestion

470
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,390
to divide and conquer.

471
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,559
Sihan is new to the company and has lots to learn.

472
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,642
I'll have him work under you.

473
00:27:56,642 --> 00:28:00,034
Please teach him the ropes.

474
00:28:00,784 --> 00:28:02,083
No problem.

475
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,183
Director Yin.

476
00:28:06,183 --> 00:28:08,309
We will work together in future.

477
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:10,099
Nice to meet you.

478
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:20,459
Kang Sihan.

479
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:26,517
Director Yin, what is it?

480
00:28:26,517 --> 00:28:30,409
I thought you would work things out with Z&X.

481
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:33,667
I didn't expect for it to get acquired by us in the end.

482
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,517
That's a question for you.

483
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:38,492
If you didn't drive Z&X to a wall,

484
00:28:38,492 --> 00:28:41,518
I would've never thought of such a great way to save myself.

485
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,392
Stop making excuses.

486
00:28:44,392 --> 00:28:46,976
You're seeking refuge from your father without any shame.

487
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,309
I think you're ready to cast your line.

488
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:51,851
I have no sense of shame?

489
00:28:51,851 --> 00:28:54,542
Then a stranger like you

490
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:56,559
is even more shameful than me.

491
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,350
What did you say?

492
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,642
Don't forget.

493
00:28:58,642 --> 00:29:02,259
Zhen Tian Group belongs to the Kangs, not the Yins.

494
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:06,834
What are you doing?

495
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,992
As the saying goes,

496
00:29:12,992 --> 00:29:16,584
unity is power.

497
00:29:16,584 --> 00:29:21,350
Everyone in the company is paying attention to the both of you.

498
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,183
You need to show solidarity.

499
00:29:23,183 --> 00:29:25,642
Don't put me to shame.

500
00:29:25,642 --> 00:29:29,625
I think you're the one who wants to put me to shame.

501
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,325
I know I put you through a lot.

502
00:29:33,325 --> 00:29:35,434
But I've told you many times.

503
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:40,059
Every decision I make is for the benefit of the company.

504
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:43,134
I hope you can understand.

505
00:29:44,976 --> 00:29:46,726
Tomorrow is the weekend.

506
00:29:46,726 --> 00:29:49,100
Your mom wants to invite you both to a meal.

507
00:29:50,142 --> 00:29:52,809
We don't get together often.

508
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:55,867
Bring your girlfriends if you have one.

509
00:29:55,867 --> 00:29:58,134
You're all grown up now.

510
00:30:26,434 --> 00:30:27,884
Director Yin.

511
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:33,600
I just saw Kang Sihan in front of the elevator.

512
00:30:35,742 --> 00:30:37,892
You will see him every day from now on.

513
00:30:37,892 --> 00:30:39,976
What do you mean?

514
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:42,009
He is my assistant now.

515
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:47,183
Was this all according to the chairman's plan?

516
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:49,559
Are you surprised?

517
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:50,909
A bit.

518
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:54,517
I figured it out a while ago.

519
00:30:54,517 --> 00:30:56,684
Then why did you still do it?

520
00:30:56,684 --> 00:30:58,667
Why not?

521
00:31:00,183 --> 00:31:04,099
I lose no matter what in this.

522
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:09,626
If I don't force Z&X to shut down, it means I'm incapable.

523
00:31:09,626 --> 00:31:12,451
It proves I can't beat Kang Sihan.

524
00:31:13,475 --> 00:31:17,892
If I force Z&X to shut down, then Zhen Tian will acquire it.

525
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:21,809
Then Kang Sihan will work for this company.

526
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:24,851
Two outcomes,

527
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:27,250
both unfavorable for me.

528
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,475
So I must defeat Kang Sihan.

529
00:31:30,475 --> 00:31:32,918
I must get him to work here

530
00:31:32,918 --> 00:31:34,999
so that I can continue to defeat him.

531
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:37,767
I want to prove to all

532
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:40,883
that whether it's business or personal,

533
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:46,000
I'm always better than him.

534
00:31:50,584 --> 00:31:53,334
Kang Zhentian suppressed Z&X

535
00:31:53,334 --> 00:31:56,834
so that Kang Sihan can end up at the company.

536
00:31:58,934 --> 00:32:02,359
So that was his plan all along.

537
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:05,417
This is bad.

538
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:08,225
Yes, according to current situation,

539
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:11,334
it's unfavorable for us.

540
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:15,059
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

541
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,334
Okay.

542
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:37,809
Who is it?

543
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:38,726
Room service.

544
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:40,059
Please come in.

545
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:44,659
Just take the money on the table.

546
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:46,534
Sir, it's not enough.

547
00:33:46,534 --> 00:33:47,325
What do you mean?

548
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,492
Fifty isn't enough for a plate of fruit salad?

549
00:33:49,492 --> 00:33:51,667
The fruit salad is a special dish.

550
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:56,059
Each plate comes with cheese, bacon, and a cocktail.

551
00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:59,467
It also comes with my brother's favorite tuna salad.

552
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:01,918
Siyu.

553
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:04,634
What are you doing?

554
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:14,034
Dad sent me here as a spy.

555
00:34:14,034 --> 00:34:15,200
Don't tell anyone.

556
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,992
You think you could be a spy?

557
00:34:17,992 --> 00:34:21,167
President Kang, I prepared some excellent cocktails for you.

558
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:23,199
Blue rose whisky.

559
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,976
Very appropriate for a Prince Charming like you.

560
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:27,900
If I didn't tell Dad about you,

561
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,751
I wouldn't even know where to find you.

562
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:31,334
How are you going to reward me?

563
00:34:31,334 --> 00:34:32,642
Reward?

564
00:34:32,642 --> 00:34:34,125
I should get even with you.

565
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:35,892
Come, have a seat.

566
00:34:35,892 --> 00:34:39,434
Because you told them I was back in Beijing,

567
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:42,125
you caused me many troubles.

568
00:34:44,425 --> 00:34:46,309
Fine, it's all my fault.

569
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:47,392
I'll drink as punishment.

570
00:34:47,392 --> 00:34:49,484
Stop, I'll drink with you.

571
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:53,684
Brother, how are you?

572
00:34:53,684 --> 00:34:55,267
Are you doing well over there?

573
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:56,475
It's fine.

574
00:34:56,475 --> 00:34:58,784
I thought you would be too used to the great life you had over there

575
00:34:58,784 --> 00:35:00,059
to adapt to life back home.

576
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:02,751
Do you think I'm debonair like you?

577
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:06,726
Life overseas isn't as easy as you might think.

578
00:35:06,726 --> 00:35:09,784
You always say that experience will shape out a person's character.

579
00:35:09,784 --> 00:35:13,292
You're more charming now.

580
00:35:13,292 --> 00:35:16,726
You're so glib.

581
00:35:16,726 --> 00:35:18,784
I feel so free now.

582
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,350
Before you came back,

583
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,684
Mom kept telling me to help out at the company.

584
00:35:22,684 --> 00:35:25,726
I'm free from that responsibility now that you're back.

585
00:35:30,018 --> 00:35:33,509
I didn't plan on working at Zhen Tian.

586
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,517
You're a member of the Kangs.

587
00:35:35,517 --> 00:35:37,167
You don't have a choice.

588
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,876
Come on, let's eat.

589
00:35:53,575 --> 00:35:55,851
Black Cat Detective, what are you doing here?

590
00:35:55,851 --> 00:35:57,951
I'm waiting for you.

591
00:35:57,951 --> 00:35:58,834
Waiting for me?

592
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:00,242
That's right.

593
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:04,784
Are you facing another dilemma?

594
00:36:04,784 --> 00:36:06,475
It's not a dilemma.

595
00:36:06,475 --> 00:36:07,767
Just family matters.

596
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:11,534
My father and stepmother invited me for dinner tomorrow.

597
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:13,142
I thought it was something bad.

598
00:36:13,142 --> 00:36:15,099
That's a good thing.

599
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:20,417
Aren't you a drifter?

600
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:22,934
I was a drifter.

601
00:36:22,934 --> 00:36:26,351
But I recently met up with my long-last father.

602
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,934
Turns out he lives in Beijing as well.

603
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:32,000
So now I'm no longer a drifter.

604
00:36:33,142 --> 00:36:34,892
What an intricate story.

605
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:38,109
What's more is that they asked me to bring my girlfriend.

606
00:36:38,934 --> 00:36:40,142
Then bring her.

607
00:36:40,142 --> 00:36:42,626
But I don't have a girlfriend.

608
00:36:42,626 --> 00:36:44,892
Then find a girlfriend.

609
00:36:44,892 --> 00:36:46,434
You can rent one too.

610
00:36:46,434 --> 00:36:47,684
There is a renting service online.

611
00:36:47,684 --> 00:36:49,999
I have to spend money if I rent one.

612
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,876
The girl in front of me will do.

613
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:54,709
She's also free of charge.

614
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:58,559
Why are you looking at me?

615
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,209
Your family matters have nothing to do with me.

616
00:37:02,209 --> 00:37:05,475
ZX, are you really gonna leave me hanging?

617
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:07,409
I'm not.

618
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:09,309
It depends on the situation.

619
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:13,534
In order to help you, me, a single woman,

620
00:37:13,534 --> 00:37:16,892
would have to pretend to be your girlfriend for your dad and stepmom.

621
00:37:16,892 --> 00:37:19,826
How am I supposed to live my life if this news spreads out?

622
00:37:19,826 --> 00:37:21,892
How am I going to marry with a tall, rich and handsome guy?

623
00:37:21,892 --> 00:37:24,050
Can you handle the consequences?

624
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,859
Fine.

625
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:29,809
I'll go by myself tomorrow then.

626
00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:32,976
I have no money, no car, no house, and no girlfriend anyways.

627
00:37:32,976 --> 00:37:35,225
They already look down on me.

628
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:39,500
It doesn't matter if they look down on me one more time.

629
00:37:42,225 --> 00:37:43,709
Wait.

630
00:37:53,992 --> 00:37:56,042
I pity you.

631
00:37:57,784 --> 00:38:00,792
I'll do it just this once.

632
00:38:12,684 --> 00:38:15,851
Don't worry, I'm here.

633
00:38:15,851 --> 00:38:17,951
Are you coming back early today?

634
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,584
Okay, see you tomorrow.

635
00:38:53,851 --> 00:38:56,534
Did your shoot in Korea go well?

636
00:38:58,534 --> 00:39:00,751
Why do you keep pestering me?

637
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:03,184
I heard that you moved.

638
00:39:03,934 --> 00:39:07,967
Why didn't you invite us to your new house?

639
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:11,018
I just wanted to move somewhere more quiet.

640
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:13,292
Did you need to move so far away?

641
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,475
It's inconvenient for Han Qing to visit you

642
00:39:16,475 --> 00:39:19,070
when he misses you.

643
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:21,542
I can stay wherever I like.

644
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:23,209
It's none of your business.

645
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:24,980
Honey.

646
00:39:25,842 --> 00:39:29,034
Seems like you haven't figured out the situation.

647
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,999
God brought us together again.

648
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:35,417
That means we're inseparable.

649
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:37,334
Your business is my business,

650
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:41,183
and my business is your business.

651
00:39:41,183 --> 00:39:43,059
What do you want?

652
00:39:43,784 --> 00:39:45,559
I'm busy.

653
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:47,359
I want...

654
00:39:48,826 --> 00:39:53,976
I want Yin Zheng to ruin Kang Sihan.

655
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:56,375
Yin Zheng is your nephew.

656
00:39:56,892 --> 00:39:58,584
Are you trying to ruin him?

657
00:39:58,584 --> 00:40:00,709
Yin Zheng's heart is filled with anger.

658
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:06,784
And you are the wood that can cause the fire to burn more furiously.

659
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:09,651
They argued all their lives.

660
00:40:09,651 --> 00:40:13,759
It won't be difficult to get them to go at each other.

661
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:17,876
Why do you hold such a deep grudge against the Kangs?

662
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:21,292
You don't have to know about my story.

663
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:21,892
But...

664
00:40:21,892 --> 00:40:24,042
Stop it.

665
00:40:25,892 --> 00:40:28,434
Just do your part.

666
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:31,780
Don't forget your role.

667
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:34,283
Who's that?

668
00:40:41,434 --> 00:40:42,900
Second Uncle.

669
00:40:44,784 --> 00:40:46,434
Second Uncle, it's me.

670
00:40:55,851 --> 00:40:57,609
Zheng'er, come in.

671
00:40:57,609 --> 00:40:59,976
- Second Uncle.
- Come in.

672
00:40:59,976 --> 00:41:01,000
I brought you something.

673
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,976
Have a seat.

674
00:41:03,726 --> 00:41:05,142
I've been busy recently,

675
00:41:05,142 --> 00:41:07,434
so I didn't have time to pay you a visit.

676
00:41:07,434 --> 00:41:09,242
You're busy with the company.

677
00:41:09,242 --> 00:41:12,059
Don't waste your time on me.

678
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:15,617
You're my only relative aside from my mom.

679
00:41:15,617 --> 00:41:17,918
I should visit you.

680
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,392
Your father died young.

681
00:41:21,392 --> 00:41:23,851
I should be taking care of you,

682
00:41:23,851 --> 00:41:26,600
but I'm useless.

683
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,434
I'm ashamed.

684
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:29,075
What are you talking about?

685
00:41:29,075 --> 00:41:31,617
If it weren't for you,

686
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:34,834
I would've had a harder time growing up with the Kangs.

687
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:37,167
I've told Kang Zhentian.

688
00:41:37,726 --> 00:41:39,600
You might not be his birth son,

689
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,142
but you're still his son.

690
00:41:42,142 --> 00:41:45,142
I told him to stop working against you.

691
00:41:45,142 --> 00:41:47,325
Why are you asking him for favors?

692
00:41:47,325 --> 00:41:50,034
He never treated me as his son.

693
00:41:50,684 --> 00:41:52,350
He has his guard up against me.

694
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,742
Recently,

695
00:41:53,742 --> 00:41:55,700
he got Kang Sihan to join the company.

696
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,042
He's obviously working against me.

697
00:41:57,042 --> 00:42:00,342
As long as you put more in the effort, you'll be stronger than him.

698
00:42:01,642 --> 00:42:03,142
But I heard

699
00:42:03,142 --> 00:42:06,392
that he cares about his son a lot.

700
00:42:06,392 --> 00:42:10,099
The assets that originally belonged to your father and I

701
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:14,334
may continue to be held by the Kangs.

702
00:42:14,334 --> 00:42:16,267
I'll make sure they fail.

703
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:20,926
Great, I'm relieved that you're confident.

704
00:42:21,434 --> 00:42:26,142
I hope I can see Zhen Tian Group change its name

705
00:42:26,142 --> 00:42:28,851
to Yin Group in my lifetime.

706
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:31,167
Second Uncle, don't worry.

707
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:35,634
I want Kang Zhentian to return everything he took from us.

708
00:42:36,792 --> 00:42:39,420
Okay.

709
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,125
I have to take this.

710
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,570
Hello?

711
00:42:47,475 --> 00:42:49,290
I'll be back soon.

712
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,600
Okay.

713
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:53,492
Second Uncle, I have another appointment with a client.

714
00:42:53,492 --> 00:42:54,492
I have to go now.

715
00:42:54,492 --> 00:42:55,659
Get along then.

716
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:56,350
Take care.

717
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,517
Okay.

718
00:42:57,517 --> 00:42:59,034
Wait.

719
00:43:01,225 --> 00:43:02,792
Don't just concentrate on your work.

720
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:04,976
Spend more time with your girlfriend.

721
00:43:04,976 --> 00:43:06,542
She is a nice girl.

722
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,659
Treat her well.

723
00:43:08,659 --> 00:43:10,099
I will.

724
00:43:10,726 --> 00:43:12,210
Go on.

725
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:23,042
You can come out now.

726
00:43:29,951 --> 00:43:32,767
Yin Zheng thinks of you as his closest relative.

727
00:43:32,767 --> 00:43:34,559
How do you have the heart to ruin him?

728
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:37,099
You're the one who can't bring yourself to do it.

729
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:38,976
Why are you siding with him?

730
00:43:38,976 --> 00:43:42,183
Are you falling in love with him?

731
00:43:42,183 --> 00:43:46,959
If you said you just wanted to make some money from Yin Zheng,

732
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:48,751
I would believe that.

733
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,767
Women like you

734
00:43:53,283 --> 00:43:56,142
can't possibly fall in love with any man.

735
00:43:56,142 --> 00:43:58,334
If I didn't rescue you,

736
00:43:58,934 --> 00:44:03,667
you would still be a drug dealer selling at a nightclub in Thailand.

737
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,400
Be smart.

738
00:44:09,976 --> 00:44:12,970
We take what we need respectively.

739
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,918
Love is a luxury.

740
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:20,040
Do you understand?

741
00:44:21,517 --> 00:44:22,434
Understood.

742
00:44:22,434 --> 00:44:24,434
Don't try to cheat me.

743
00:44:24,434 --> 00:44:27,867
Remember, you work for me.

744
00:44:27,867 --> 00:44:30,459
Get your job done.

745
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:34,475
I'll protect you.

746
00:44:34,475 --> 00:44:37,792
Otherwise, I'll make you suffer.
