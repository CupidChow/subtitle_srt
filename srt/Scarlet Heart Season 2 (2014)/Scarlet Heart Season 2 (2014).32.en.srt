<i>[Episode 32]</i>

3
00:01:44,427 --> 00:01:46,219
Wang Hao, are you sure it's here?

4
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:47,778
Yes.

5
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:52,659
Uncle.

6
00:01:53,678 --> 00:01:55,243
Zhang Xiao.

7
00:01:57,152 --> 00:01:58,694
Siyu.

8
00:01:58,694 --> 00:02:00,527
What are you doing here?

9
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,302
- Hi, Uncle.
- Hello.

10
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:04,319
Do you still remember me?

11
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,527
Of course.

12
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:09,019
You came to visit me in the hospital with Huang Li.

13
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:11,302
This is my good friend Wang Hao.

14
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:12,636
- Hello, Uncle.
- Hello.

15
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:13,819
Siyu.

16
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:15,752
What are you doing here?

17
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:23,010
My Second Brother has been kidnapped.

18
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,102
Sihan's been kidnapped?

19
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:28,694
How come?

20
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:30,594
He came to Ganlin on a business trip.

21
00:02:31,094 --> 00:02:33,259
And we lost touch with him.

22
00:02:34,344 --> 00:02:37,119
We didn't know he was kidnapped

23
00:02:38,135 --> 00:02:40,052
until the kidnappers called us.

24
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:41,552
Have you called the police?

25
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:43,260
They asked us not to call the police.

26
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,244
I'm worried something's going to happen to him.

27
00:02:50,277 --> 00:02:53,678
Then what are you doing here?

28
00:02:53,678 --> 00:02:57,469
We are looking for someone called Zhang Luotuo.

29
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,819
Me?

30
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,943
Uncle, you?

31
00:03:00,943 --> 00:03:02,110
I am Zhang Luotuo.

32
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,402
Uncle, can you bring us to Canglang Mountain?

33
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:07,678
No way, kid.

34
00:03:07,678 --> 00:03:10,427
If something happens, we're all stuck there.

35
00:03:10,427 --> 00:03:12,177
It's too dangerous.

36
00:03:12,177 --> 00:03:13,569
Dad.

37
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,759
I told you about Xinyi.

38
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,010
If it wasn't for me,

39
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:23,069
Xinyi would still be alive

40
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,427
and would've gotten married to Sihan.

41
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:28,444
Sihan would not have come here

42
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:30,469
and he wouldn't have gotten kidnapped.

43
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,552
This is all because of me.

44
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:39,043
Xinyi would hope for Sihan to be safe.

45
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:44,319
I won't stay here and wait.

46
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,552
So you're hoping I'd go?

47
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:50,194
I know the way. I can bring them.

48
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:52,760
No way.

49
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,469
Those kidnappers might be killers.

50
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:01,860
Uncle, I know it's dangerous.

51
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:04,511
But I promise you.

52
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,010
I will keep her safe.

53
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,719
Uncle, don't worry.

54
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,085
I have a lot of friends here.

55
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,111
We will protect her.

56
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:19,527
Fine.

57
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:21,736
I will go with you.

58
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:23,469
So you agreed?

59
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:28,344
Thank you, Dad.

60
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,286
Let's go.

61
00:04:31,286 --> 00:04:32,652
- Okay.
- Let's go.

62
00:04:51,411 --> 00:04:54,827
- I can't walk anymore.
- I can't either.

63
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,636
Let's take a break.

64
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:11,194
Drink some water.

65
00:05:17,302 --> 00:05:19,569
You're still injured.

66
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,511
If we keep going,

67
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:24,452
we'll run out of energy.

68
00:05:25,444 --> 00:05:29,190
We have to keep trying.

69
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,652
Here, have some.

70
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:55,094
There's a railway.

71
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:05,486
You found this place just from their description.

72
00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:08,759
You're awesome.

73
00:06:09,344 --> 00:06:11,177
There's hope for us.

74
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:15,094
Get up.

75
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,052
It's Boss' car.

76
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,227
Boss, help!

77
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:29,494
Boss!

78
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:30,685
Come back!

79
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:34,386
Boss, help us!

80
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:36,119
- Let's go.
- Boss.

81
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:38,511
Boss.

82
00:06:40,135 --> 00:06:42,094
What happened?

83
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:45,202
They kidnapped us.

84
00:06:45,202 --> 00:06:48,585
They ran away.

85
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,859
He saw my face.

86
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:56,235
We will die if he makes it out alive.

87
00:06:56,235 --> 00:06:57,694
What do we do?

88
00:06:58,527 --> 00:06:59,790
Get him!

89
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,536
- Get him!
- Don't run!

90
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:05,219
Don't run!

91
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:06,240
Stop!

92
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,452
Hurry.

93
00:07:07,452 --> 00:07:08,360
Don't run!

94
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,843
This way.

95
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:11,719
Stop!

96
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:14,494
- Stop!
- Don't run.

97
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:17,719
Don't run!

98
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:18,860
Stop!

99
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,094
Get them!

100
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:24,152
Stop!

101
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:37,069
- Where did they go?
- Wait.

102
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:40,077
How strange.

103
00:07:40,077 --> 00:07:42,302
Xiao Ma.

104
00:07:42,302 --> 00:07:45,340
I forgive you.

105
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,260
Come out.

106
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,286
Get them!

107
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:57,444
This way, go!

108
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:58,944
What's wrong?

109
00:08:01,386 --> 00:08:03,052
You should go.

110
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:08,943
We're getting out of here together.

111
00:08:08,943 --> 00:08:12,294
Or we'll die together.

112
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:16,260
Go.

113
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:27,002
Sihan.

114
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:31,452
Second Brother.

115
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:34,552
Siyu, help me.

116
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:35,843
Let's go.

117
00:08:35,843 --> 00:08:37,736
Be careful.

118
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,619
Come with me.

119
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:51,920
Come on.

120
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,290
- Come on.
- Let's go.

121
00:08:57,527 --> 00:08:59,502
Hurry up.

122
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,427
Stop!

123
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:06,452
What are you doing?

124
00:09:06,452 --> 00:09:07,827
Xiaoxiao.

125
00:09:08,652 --> 00:09:09,969
What are you doing?

126
00:09:09,969 --> 00:09:11,135
Don't come any closer.

127
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:13,102
Let her go.

128
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:14,602
What are you doing?

129
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:21,511
In just a second,

130
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:24,119
all these good looking people turn up.

131
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:25,511
What are you trying to do?

132
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:28,969
Is this a reenactment of the great escape?

133
00:09:42,094 --> 00:09:44,760
How can you do this to me?

134
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,169
I am good to you.

135
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,636
Go, run!

136
00:09:56,636 --> 00:09:58,759
I'll kill her right now.

137
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,027
Calm down.

138
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:02,785
Let her go and you'll still have a chance to escape.

139
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:06,135
Brother.

140
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:08,927
I like your words.

141
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:10,760
But you are wrong.

142
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,552
I am not the one who needs a chance.

143
00:10:13,552 --> 00:10:15,360
Understand?

144
00:10:16,843 --> 00:10:20,427
It's you.

145
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:26,019
If you don't give me the money,

146
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,286
I will kill her.

147
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:31,652
She belongs to you in the first place.

148
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:33,827
It's useless to keep her captive.

149
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:45,394
Kang Sihan.

150
00:10:47,344 --> 00:10:50,330
You really impressed me.

151
00:10:50,885 --> 00:10:53,919
I can't kill you.

152
00:10:54,678 --> 00:10:56,969
You're so lucky.

153
00:10:56,969 --> 00:11:00,302
I will listen to you.

154
00:11:00,302 --> 00:11:05,727
I will kill your savior in front of you.

155
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:08,386
Are you happy now?

156
00:11:13,344 --> 00:11:15,202
All together.

157
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,177
I'll say it one more time.

158
00:11:20,177 --> 00:11:23,260
Put down my money.

159
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,802
I will count to three.

160
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:29,552
One.

161
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:35,185
Two.

162
00:11:47,302 --> 00:11:49,386
Hurry.

163
00:11:49,386 --> 00:11:50,970
The police is here!

164
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,386
Stop!

165
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:54,094
- Run!
- Stop!

166
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:55,402
Stop!

167
00:11:56,636 --> 00:11:58,840
Don't move! Get down!

168
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:01,810
Don't move.

169
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,160
Handcuff him.

170
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,678
Get up.

171
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:33,402
Zhen Tian Group survived until today

172
00:12:33,402 --> 00:12:38,202
because of the help and support from the community.

173
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,320
Hello?

174
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,310
Chairman.

175
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,386
The venue is ready.

176
00:12:49,386 --> 00:12:51,527
But...

177
00:12:51,527 --> 00:12:53,069
What?

178
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,636
I received an email from a lawyer.

179
00:12:57,636 --> 00:13:02,859
The notice shows that Yin Zheng has received authorization from Yin Chenggui

180
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:07,135
and transferred all of Yin Chenggui's shares to himself.

181
00:13:07,135 --> 00:13:12,402
This means that Yin Zheng is now the largest shareholder.

182
00:13:12,402 --> 00:13:16,302
He holds 80% of the company's shares.

183
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:17,902
What?

184
00:13:17,902 --> 00:13:21,277
Chairman.

185
00:13:21,277 --> 00:13:23,027
Let's not talk about this right now.

186
00:13:23,027 --> 00:13:24,885
Where is Yin Chenggui?

187
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:29,302
It's confirmed that he's still in jail.

188
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:34,736
Do you want to cancel the conference?

189
00:13:34,736 --> 00:13:36,586
No.

190
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:39,352
Just stick to the plan.

191
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:57,652
Sorry.

192
00:13:57,652 --> 00:13:59,694
Excuse me.

193
00:13:59,694 --> 00:14:01,235
Thank you.

194
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,020
<i>[Siyu]</i>

195
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,102
Second Brother, who's this?

196
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:28,511
This is Ma Yinuo.

197
00:14:29,152 --> 00:14:31,194
She saved me.

198
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:34,027
Yinuo.

199
00:14:34,027 --> 00:14:36,060
Thank you for saving him.

200
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:39,580
You're welcome.

201
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,890
He saved my life actually.

202
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:49,819
Second Brother, you should actually thank Zhang Xiao and her father.

203
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:51,736
If not for them,

204
00:14:51,736 --> 00:14:53,652
I wouldn't have been able to find you.

205
00:14:57,736 --> 00:15:00,486
I was just curious about that.

206
00:15:00,486 --> 00:15:02,719
Why are you here?

207
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,202
Shouldn't you be lying in Yin Zheng's arms right now?

208
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:11,860
You know about that?

209
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:18,543
You grew up here, right?

210
00:15:24,943 --> 00:15:28,177
Is this your father?

211
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:30,936
Yes.

212
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:46,080
Yinuo.

213
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,390
We made it out alive.

214
00:16:04,578 --> 00:16:06,402
The conference will be held in ten minutes.

215
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:08,302
Please follow the rules.

216
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:09,678
Come.

217
00:16:12,902 --> 00:16:15,778
You are back. Where's Siyu?

218
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:18,319
Where is Sihan?

219
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:19,469
Chairman.

220
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:21,860
You didn't receive Siyu's message?

221
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,902
What happened?

222
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,927
Tell me, I can handle it.

223
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:33,694
Chairman, I'm so sorry.

224
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:37,836
We failed to negotiate with the kidnappers.

225
00:16:37,836 --> 00:16:39,010
I came back first.

226
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,152
Siyu is still there.

227
00:16:41,152 --> 00:16:46,559
I think he is wondering how to carry back his body.

228
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,260
Chairman.

229
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,269
My condolences, Chairman.

230
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:57,760
My phone.

231
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,552
I want to call Siyu.

232
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,743
Where is my phone?

233
00:17:00,743 --> 00:17:03,810
Chairman, they're all waiting for you.

234
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,527
The conference will be held soon.

235
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:27,719
Please follow the rules.

236
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:33,435
Okay.

237
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:40,594
Thank you for coming.

238
00:17:44,527 --> 00:17:47,727
Thank you for coming.

239
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:55,269
Thank you for coming.

240
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:14,810
Thank you for coming.

241
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:18,552
Since Zhen Tian Group was founded,

242
00:18:18,552 --> 00:18:20,143
we've been through many hardships

243
00:18:20,143 --> 00:18:24,910
and fought against many competitors.

244
00:18:25,802 --> 00:18:30,336
But we survived it all.

245
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:34,469
The crisis the company is facing now,

246
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:38,394
is nothing

247
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,235
compared to everything we've been through.

248
00:18:41,235 --> 00:18:44,427
Chairman.

249
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:46,010
This is not good.

250
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,885
If you don't have any new ideas,

251
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:51,402
the reporters will leave soon.

252
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:15,994
I have something to announce.

253
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:18,843
I believe that you all know

254
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:25,219
that our current crisis

255
00:19:26,802 --> 00:19:32,510
is due to my son Sihan's wedding.

256
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,302
He's been feeling very guilty.

257
00:19:39,302 --> 00:19:42,186
To help him feel better,

258
00:19:43,427 --> 00:19:45,394
I sent him...

259
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:54,102
I sent him on a business trip.

260
00:19:55,277 --> 00:20:00,719
But he has been kidnapped.

261
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:03,302
He's been kidnapped?

262
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,336
What happened?

263
00:20:06,336 --> 00:20:09,859
Tell us the details.

264
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:14,511
The kidnappers...

265
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:19,719
Asked us for a huge amount of money.

266
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:26,027
Although our company is now facing problems,

267
00:20:26,027 --> 00:20:31,843
we were still able to gather the money

268
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:34,519
and sent someone to rescue him.

269
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:38,402
But I didn't expect for my son...

270
00:20:43,027 --> 00:20:45,536
To still get killed in the end.

271
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,736
He's dead?

272
00:20:46,736 --> 00:20:48,786
He's dead.

273
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:53,185
He's dead.

274
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:56,902
Tell us.

275
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,802
I just received the news.

276
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:16,336
Although I am very sad,

277
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:21,460
I am still proud to have him as my son.

278
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:27,777
He's willing to take all the responsibilities for what he's done.

279
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:32,719
He is my son Kang Sihan.

280
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:39,869
He is the spirit of Zhen Tian Group.

281
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:44,636
This is the end of the conference.

282
00:21:45,277 --> 00:21:46,894
Thank you.

283
00:21:51,652 --> 00:21:54,678
When will you have his funeral?

284
00:21:54,678 --> 00:21:59,052
Next Monday is his birthday.

285
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:03,219
I hope to spend his last birthday with him.

286
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:08,759
Do you think this will influence the company's changes in the future?

287
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,335
Sorry.

288
00:22:11,652 --> 00:22:13,736
I feel a bit...

289
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:18,127
Dad, you're not feeling well.

290
00:22:18,678 --> 00:22:21,169
Let me handle the rest.

291
00:22:24,335 --> 00:22:25,680
Everyone.

292
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:31,200
Sihan's accident has caused Chairman great distress.

293
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,985
But he's still powering through the pain in his heart

294
00:22:34,985 --> 00:22:37,819
and the pain in his body to stand here and talk.

295
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:42,986
It is very difficult for him to continue.

296
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:47,660
I am proud to have him as my father.

297
00:22:58,052 --> 00:22:59,985
What are you doing?

298
00:22:59,985 --> 00:23:02,652
I want you to pass me your title.

299
00:23:03,552 --> 00:23:07,235
When did the Board of Directors make that decision?

300
00:23:07,235 --> 00:23:10,885
I own 80% of Zhen Tian Group's shares.

301
00:23:10,885 --> 00:23:13,302
I am the Board.

302
00:23:13,302 --> 00:23:20,869
How can you be so cruel to your father?

303
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:22,444
Really?

304
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,736
I've been waiting for this day for twenty years.

305
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:33,527
You will regret this.

306
00:23:35,927 --> 00:23:39,194
If you don't want this to be messier than it already is,

307
00:23:39,194 --> 00:23:42,235
and if you still want to save Zhen Tian,

308
00:23:42,235 --> 00:23:44,344
you have to work with me.

309
00:23:44,344 --> 00:23:49,311
The improvement of the situation is because of Sihan's death.

310
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:53,286
Don't waste it.

311
00:23:59,527 --> 00:24:01,627
Everyone.

312
00:24:01,627 --> 00:24:04,852
Chairman held on until now

313
00:24:04,852 --> 00:24:10,277
because this is the last time he'll give a speech.

314
00:24:10,277 --> 00:24:12,427
He is a proud person.

315
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:16,943
He hopes he can step down as glorious as when he came into office.

316
00:24:16,943 --> 00:24:21,719
So I would like to invite him to announce the Board's decision.

317
00:24:23,177 --> 00:24:24,760
What decision?

318
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,469
For the sake of Zhen Tian Group,

319
00:24:34,511 --> 00:24:36,790
you know what to do.

320
00:24:39,427 --> 00:24:40,702
Come.

321
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,769
I announce,

322
00:24:50,444 --> 00:24:53,636
because of my sickness,

323
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:56,219
from now on,

324
00:24:56,219 --> 00:24:59,536
I will pass my position to my eldest son

325
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,719
and let him become...

326
00:25:05,778 --> 00:25:10,802
Chairman of Zhen Tian Group.

327
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,478
Chairman.

328
00:25:14,478 --> 00:25:15,578
- Hurry.
- Sorry.

329
00:25:15,578 --> 00:25:16,869
Call an ambulance.

330
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:18,469
Be quiet.

331
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:20,802
Don't push.

332
00:25:20,802 --> 00:25:22,410
Chairman.

333
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,886
Wang Hao.

334
00:25:25,886 --> 00:25:28,486
Thank you for your help.

335
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:29,444
You're welcome.

336
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,010
It's good to be the hero and get rid of the enemy.

337
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,785
I should say thank you.

338
00:25:34,444 --> 00:25:35,277
The car is yours now.

339
00:25:35,277 --> 00:25:37,360
Call me if you need anything.

340
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,152
Take care.

341
00:25:39,152 --> 00:25:39,943
Bye, everyone.

342
00:25:39,943 --> 00:25:41,269
See you.

343
00:25:43,694 --> 00:25:45,252
Thank you.

344
00:25:46,235 --> 00:25:48,094
What's there to thank?

345
00:25:48,094 --> 00:25:50,443
You should say thank you to Siyu.

346
00:25:51,444 --> 00:25:52,636
Xiaoxiao.

347
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:54,802
This is what it means to be a busybody.

348
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:56,802
Let's go home.

349
00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:03,785
Come on, Second Brother. Get in the car.

350
00:26:03,785 --> 00:26:05,035
Come on.

351
00:26:06,027 --> 00:26:07,344
Let's go.

352
00:26:31,194 --> 00:26:33,694
You can stay here tonight.

353
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:36,860
It's getting dark now.

354
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,943
Thank you.

355
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:39,177
You should rest too.

356
00:26:39,177 --> 00:26:43,278
Just let Xiaoxiao know if you need anything.

357
00:26:46,027 --> 00:26:48,778
I'll turn the TV on for you.

358
00:26:48,778 --> 00:26:50,678
Get some rest.

359
00:26:55,511 --> 00:26:56,878
Yinuo.

360
00:26:56,878 --> 00:27:00,169
You can sleep with me tonight.

361
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:03,169
They'll have to sleep in the living room.

362
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:04,819
I'll get you some blankets.

363
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,627
Let me help you.

364
00:27:13,902 --> 00:27:15,594
Siyu.

365
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:19,086
Are you sure you want to sleep here tonight?

366
00:27:19,985 --> 00:27:21,486
Didn't you hear what Uncle said?

367
00:27:21,486 --> 00:27:23,919
It's too dark out.

368
00:27:24,794 --> 00:27:27,319
I'm leaving with Yinuo.

369
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:29,985
Second Brother, what are you doing?

370
00:27:29,985 --> 00:27:31,902
Can you stop it with that attitude?

371
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:34,127
What about it?

372
00:27:34,127 --> 00:27:36,778
She forced me to be like this.

373
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:39,344
I know she feels guilty.

374
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,127
Second Brother.

375
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:43,527
Regardless of who Zhang Xiao loves now,

376
00:27:43,527 --> 00:27:45,177
you were a couple before.

377
00:27:45,177 --> 00:27:47,302
Don't make it difficult for her.

378
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,852
We used to be a couple.

379
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:55,802
Yes.

380
00:27:57,277 --> 00:28:00,194
We were a couple.

381
00:28:00,194 --> 00:28:03,010
But don't forget that's in the past now.

382
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,427
Things are different now.

383
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:09,310
Brother.

384
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:13,569
I know you've been through a lot.

385
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:16,335
You must feel terrible.

386
00:28:16,335 --> 00:28:18,627
But I'm sure Zhang Xiao feels terrible too.

387
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:21,302
Just let her live her life peacefully here.

388
00:28:21,943 --> 00:28:23,719
Siyu.

389
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:27,611
I'm suffering more than she is.

390
00:28:27,611 --> 00:28:31,102
You can't even imagine what I've been through these days.

391
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:36,219
She got with Yin Zheng as soon as I left.

392
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:39,277
Do you think this is her fault or mine?

393
00:28:39,277 --> 00:28:41,486
Alright, calm down.

394
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,902
Before-

395
00:28:42,902 --> 00:28:45,069
I still don't understand.

396
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:46,402
She is ridiculous.

397
00:28:46,402 --> 00:28:48,094
She is ridiculous for getting with Yin Zheng.

398
00:28:48,094 --> 00:28:49,486
She is ridiculous for coming here.

399
00:28:49,486 --> 00:28:51,002
What does she want?

400
00:28:56,052 --> 00:29:01,644
I hope you can understand Sihan's situation.

401
00:29:03,652 --> 00:29:05,943
He just got saved.

402
00:29:05,943 --> 00:29:09,360
So he's not stable yet.

403
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,059
I know.

404
00:29:15,027 --> 00:29:17,952
The suffering and pain he's been through,

405
00:29:19,943 --> 00:29:22,219
I think others...

406
00:29:23,736 --> 00:29:26,259
Might find it hard to accept.

407
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:37,777
I think he trusts you.

408
00:29:39,985 --> 00:29:42,311
I hope you can spend time with him.

409
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,535
There's something...

410
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,360
I should tell you.

411
00:30:07,486 --> 00:30:09,060
Sorry.

412
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:13,519
No need to apologize.

413
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:21,010
Siyu, what's on your mind?

414
00:30:22,235 --> 00:30:23,943
I know.

415
00:30:23,943 --> 00:30:26,444
A lot has happened recently.

416
00:30:26,444 --> 00:30:28,311
I want to know.

417
00:30:36,469 --> 00:30:41,859
I saw the photos at the wedding on Big Brother's computer.

418
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:49,760
What are you talking about?

419
00:30:50,627 --> 00:30:55,402
Second Brother, he saved a copy of the photos while investigating the illegal company.

420
00:30:55,402 --> 00:30:57,444
I don't want there to be any misunderstandings between us.

421
00:30:57,444 --> 00:30:59,194
That's why I'm telling you this.

422
00:31:00,678 --> 00:31:03,010
In Yin Zheng's computer.

423
00:31:04,902 --> 00:31:07,360
He has the photos of me and Zhang Xiao?

424
00:31:08,652 --> 00:31:10,052
Yes.

425
00:31:11,344 --> 00:31:13,559
Second Brother, calm down.

426
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:20,760
I understand now.

427
00:31:23,569 --> 00:31:26,636
This is all a part of his plan.

428
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:30,527
He did this to me.

429
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:32,636
He killed Xinyi!

430
00:31:32,636 --> 00:31:36,320
Don't hit yourself.

431
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,460
Brother.

432
00:31:39,002 --> 00:31:40,927
What happened?

433
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:44,027
Sihan.

434
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:47,359
Go away.

435
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:51,652
Zhang Xiao.

436
00:31:51,652 --> 00:31:54,469
Did you know that Yin Zheng has our photos on his computer?

437
00:31:54,469 --> 00:31:58,735
The photos at the wedding ceremony.

438
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:03,535
He killed Xinyi.

439
00:32:05,344 --> 00:32:06,219
No.

440
00:32:06,219 --> 00:32:09,378
Then who was it?

441
00:32:15,611 --> 00:32:17,052
Zhang Xiao.

442
00:32:19,469 --> 00:32:21,843
You told me before.

443
00:32:22,902 --> 00:32:25,102
Between me and Xinyi,

444
00:32:26,043 --> 00:32:27,960
you choose Xinyi.

445
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:31,302
You choose friendship.

446
00:32:31,302 --> 00:32:34,027
You were willing to give up on me.

447
00:32:35,152 --> 00:32:36,594
Fine.

448
00:32:38,544 --> 00:32:41,669
Now Xinyi has died because of Yin Zheng.

449
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:43,710
Are you choosing Yin Zheng now?

450
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:47,927
Can you be at ease?

451
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:52,135
Can you sleep at night?

452
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:54,719
Say something.

453
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,985
Say something!

454
00:32:59,985 --> 00:33:01,402
Kang Sihan.

455
00:33:03,027 --> 00:33:04,394
Kang Sihan.

456
00:33:04,394 --> 00:33:07,152
You encountered many bad things recently,

457
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:10,069
but Xiaoxiao doesn't have anything to do with it.

458
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:14,110
If you want to blame someone,

459
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,552
then please get out of here.

460
00:33:15,552 --> 00:33:17,344
This is not a place for you to shout.

461
00:33:17,344 --> 00:33:18,319
<i>The latest news.</i>

462
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,094
<i>Zhen Tian Group's second son, Kang Sihan, has been kidnapped.</i>

463
00:33:22,094 --> 00:33:24,652
<i>It's confirmed he's been killed.</i>

464
00:33:24,652 --> 00:33:26,360
<i>Kang Sihan is dead.</i>

465
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,759
<i>Chairman Kang Zhentian has resigned.</i>

466
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,727
<i>Yin Zheng will be the next chairman.</i>

467
00:33:40,594 --> 00:33:42,535
I'm dead?

468
00:33:46,219 --> 00:33:48,210
I'm dead.

469
00:33:53,985 --> 00:33:55,852
I'm dead.

470
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,969
Zhang Xiao.

471
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:13,135
That's who you love.

472
00:34:19,194 --> 00:34:21,760
Come on.

473
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,440
Second Brother.

474
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,920
I'm sorry, I can't leave my brother now.

475
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:42,669
It's okay.

476
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,186
Dad.

477
00:34:56,902 --> 00:34:58,194
Dad.

478
00:34:59,902 --> 00:35:02,536
Regardless of whether or not what Sihan said is true,

479
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,319
I caused Xinyi to die.

480
00:35:09,294 --> 00:35:10,985
I came back this time

481
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:14,469
to try to fulfill her wish.

482
00:35:17,527 --> 00:35:19,920
I will go tomorrow.

483
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,444
Okay, take care.

484
00:35:24,444 --> 00:35:27,069
Don't forget to call me.

485
00:35:58,527 --> 00:36:00,544
Done, Chairman Yin.

486
00:36:01,943 --> 00:36:03,519
Thank you.

487
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:05,043
Chairman Yin.

488
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:08,859
It's my honor to be able to interview the new chairman immediately.

489
00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:09,694
Thank you.

490
00:36:09,694 --> 00:36:11,386
Thank you for your hard work.

491
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:13,269
It's nothing.

492
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:14,627
This way.

493
00:36:15,569 --> 00:36:18,344
The next thing on our schedule is to visit the former chairman at the hospital.

494
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:19,594
The reporters will follow us.

495
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,152
The cake and flowers have been prepared.

496
00:36:22,152 --> 00:36:23,802
Did I get any calls?

497
00:36:23,802 --> 00:36:25,194
A lot of calls to say congratulations.

498
00:36:25,194 --> 00:36:26,902
I responded to them all for you.

499
00:36:26,902 --> 00:36:28,360
Director Liang from Fu Ya Company.

500
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,902
Director Zhao from Qing Ya Group.

501
00:36:29,902 --> 00:36:31,419
How about Zhang Xiao?

502
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:33,394
Even if she called to yell at me.

503
00:36:37,902 --> 00:36:39,335
Chairman Yin.

504
00:36:41,627 --> 00:36:43,943
We just crossed over an important step.

505
00:36:43,943 --> 00:36:46,386
We can't relax yet.

506
00:36:46,943 --> 00:36:48,402
You just took over this position.

507
00:36:48,402 --> 00:36:49,902
Your position isn't stable yet.

508
00:36:49,902 --> 00:36:52,652
You can't get distracted.

509
00:36:52,652 --> 00:36:54,436
You're saying too much.

510
00:37:13,652 --> 00:37:15,027
How is Chairman?

511
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:17,736
What happened at the conference?

512
00:37:18,752 --> 00:37:21,427
Madam, see for yourself.

513
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:27,210
Everyone.

514
00:37:28,027 --> 00:37:33,194
<i>Sihan's accident has caused Chairman great distress.</i>

515
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:39,794
<i>But he's still powering through the pain in his heart and the pain in his body to stand here and talk.</i>

516
00:37:39,794 --> 00:37:44,427
<i>It is very difficult for him to continue.</i>

517
00:37:44,427 --> 00:37:49,552
Maybe he was too distressed after hearing the news

518
00:37:49,552 --> 00:37:51,760
so he fainted.

519
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,469
<i>From now on,</i>

520
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,969
<i>I will pass my position to my eldest son</i>

521
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:01,536
<i>and let him become...</i>

522
00:38:01,536 --> 00:38:06,478
<i>Chairman of Zhen Tian Group.</i>

523
00:38:07,802 --> 00:38:09,778
<i>Chairman!</i>

524
00:38:09,778 --> 00:38:11,894
<i>Call an ambulance.</i>

525
00:38:13,344 --> 00:38:15,027
I got it.

526
00:38:18,152 --> 00:38:20,010
I got it.

527
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:32,152
Brother.

528
00:38:32,152 --> 00:38:35,110
You shouldn't have said that to Zhang Xiao.

529
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,402
You know her better than I do.

530
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:40,294
You know she doesn't want to be involved.

531
00:38:40,294 --> 00:38:43,177
You're just taking out your hatred on her.

532
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:48,110
Siyu, let's not argue over a woman right now.

533
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:51,194
Call Aunt Lan to ask about Dad's situation.

534
00:38:51,194 --> 00:38:52,502
Okay.

535
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:59,519
Dad must've fainted because Wang Tiecheng gave him the wrong information.

536
00:39:00,127 --> 00:39:03,819
He will recover as soon as he sees you.

537
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:07,177
Wait.

538
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:15,859
Since they think I am dead,

539
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:18,069
then I should let them believe it.

540
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:21,152
I should let Yin Zheng think that I'm actually dead.

541
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:23,759
Then we can seek revenge.

542
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:25,235
Revenge?

543
00:39:27,277 --> 00:39:29,778
Yin Zheng is trying to control the whole group.

544
00:39:29,778 --> 00:39:33,319
He caused Dad to lie in the hospital.

545
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:35,202
I will take revenge.

546
00:39:35,202 --> 00:39:37,586
Brother, calm down.

547
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:39,327
I'll talk to him when we get back.

548
00:39:39,327 --> 00:39:41,885
You're still trying to talk to him?

549
00:39:43,402 --> 00:39:45,819
He hurt me.

550
00:39:45,819 --> 00:39:47,678
He hurt Dad.

551
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:50,660
I will hurt him just the same after I get back.

552
00:39:51,402 --> 00:39:53,678
Siyu, remember.

553
00:39:53,678 --> 00:39:56,694
Keep this a secret.

554
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,002
I can promise you.

555
00:39:59,002 --> 00:40:02,144
But this isn't going to end well.

556
00:40:03,294 --> 00:40:07,086
Do you want to reconsider?

557
00:40:19,152 --> 00:40:20,227
Zhentian.

558
00:40:20,227 --> 00:40:22,935
Zhentian, can you hear me?

559
00:40:23,444 --> 00:40:25,185
Madam.

560
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,277
Doctor.

561
00:40:27,277 --> 00:40:28,778
How is my husband?

562
00:40:28,778 --> 00:40:30,611
We will send him to his room first.

563
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:32,769
You can visit him later.

564
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:34,152
Okay.

565
00:40:34,152 --> 00:40:38,094
But please be mentally prepared.

566
00:40:38,094 --> 00:40:42,652
Your husband just had a brain hemmorhage,

567
00:40:42,652 --> 00:40:46,569
and now he took such a blow before he even recovered.

568
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:50,119
So it caused a hemorrhagic stroke.

569
00:40:50,985 --> 00:40:53,094
Although he has regained consciousness,

570
00:40:53,094 --> 00:40:57,985
he lost the ability to talk and move.

571
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:03,736
Is this permanent?

572
00:41:03,736 --> 00:41:05,678
According to my experience,

573
00:41:05,678 --> 00:41:07,378
it is hard to treat.

574
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,370
Sorry.

575
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:37,480
Zhentian.

576
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,344
Zhentian.

577
00:41:40,344 --> 00:41:44,240
What are you trying to say?

578
00:41:49,277 --> 00:41:50,694
Zhentian.

579
00:41:52,527 --> 00:41:54,143
Zhentian.

580
00:41:57,611 --> 00:41:59,927
Take it easy.

581
00:41:59,927 --> 00:42:00,760
I will stay by your side.

582
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,069
You will get better.

583
00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:05,177
I know.

584
00:42:05,177 --> 00:42:07,677
Don't worry.

585
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:15,552
It's this one.

586
00:42:15,552 --> 00:42:17,569
Chairman Kang, I heard you had a stroke.

587
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:18,678
- Is it serious?
- Stop filming.

588
00:42:18,678 --> 00:42:20,235
- Say something.
- Get out.

589
00:42:20,235 --> 00:42:21,569
Get out! Stop filming.

590
00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:24,210
- Get out.
- Tell us.

591
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,778
What are you doing?

592
00:42:25,778 --> 00:42:26,778
Chairman is here.

593
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:28,010
Everyone please make a way.

594
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:31,302
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

595
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:33,602
Mom.

596
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,985
Did you bring them here?

597
00:42:36,985 --> 00:42:39,219
What are you trying to do?

598
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:40,344
You have suffered a lot.

599
00:42:40,344 --> 00:42:42,160
I just came here to visit him.

600
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,511
Come.

601
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:51,944
Dad, I'm here to visit you.

602
00:42:54,611 --> 00:42:56,777
Why did this happen to you?

603
00:42:58,235 --> 00:43:01,010
You're a hero to me.

604
00:43:02,252 --> 00:43:04,352
I didn't expect for you to fall down.

605
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:07,169
But don't worry.

606
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:11,486
Take care of yourself, and I'll take good care of the company.

607
00:43:11,486 --> 00:43:14,069
I will watch over you

608
00:43:14,069 --> 00:43:16,278
until you recover.

609
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,260
Do you want some water?

610
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,340
Here. Sorry.

611
00:43:21,943 --> 00:43:23,160
Here.

612
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,752
Sorry.

613
00:43:35,752 --> 00:43:38,035
My dad can't even drink water anymore.

614
00:43:41,611 --> 00:43:42,969
Dad.

615
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,378
Dad.

616
00:43:48,194 --> 00:43:50,552
You have to recover soon.

617
00:43:50,552 --> 00:43:51,527
Dad.

618
00:43:51,527 --> 00:43:54,294
Stop filming!

619
00:43:54,294 --> 00:43:56,085
Enough!

620
00:43:56,085 --> 00:43:57,627
Chairman Kang needs rest.

621
00:43:57,627 --> 00:43:58,960
This is the end of the interview.

622
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,819
Please get out.

623
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:01,360
- Get out!
- Everyone please leave.

624
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,469
- Alright.
- Say something.

625
00:44:02,469 --> 00:44:04,402
- Get out.
- Please leave.

626
00:44:04,402 --> 00:44:06,260
Alright, thank you.

627
00:44:12,586 --> 00:44:14,411
Come out.
