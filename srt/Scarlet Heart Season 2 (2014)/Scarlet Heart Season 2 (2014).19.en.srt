<i>[Episode 19]</i>

3
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:22,229
What are you doing here?

4
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:23,938
I came to find someone.

5
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,245
Lan Lan.

6
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:31,979
I think she might be in this mountain.

7
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:33,938
Where did you get the hint?

8
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,437
I saw it on Weibo.

9
00:02:36,437 --> 00:02:40,120
Someone said there was a disfigured girl in this mountain.

10
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:46,370
Why are you here?

11
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,962
Same as you.

12
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:06,462
How much do you know about Lan Lan?

13
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:13,571
Do you know anything aside from her being your sister?

14
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,746
She was adopted by a well-off family when she was five.

15
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:21,195
The family later went to Australia.

16
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:23,938
That's it?

17
00:03:26,312 --> 00:03:27,671
How about you?

18
00:03:30,562 --> 00:03:32,979
I know a bit more than you.

19
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,970
Can you tell me?

20
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,554
Why should I tell you?

21
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:41,187
She is my sister.

22
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,604
She's missing.

23
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:44,979
I'm just as sad as you are.

24
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:48,246
You can ask her when you find her.

25
00:04:00,812 --> 00:04:02,312
Xiaohe.

26
00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:03,495
Director Kang.

27
00:04:03,495 --> 00:04:06,019
Where is Zhang Xiao? Is she not back yet?

28
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:07,646
She left this afternoon.

29
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:09,812
Do you know where she went?

30
00:04:09,812 --> 00:04:12,270
I... I am not sure.

31
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,562
I thought she went out with you.

32
00:04:15,562 --> 00:04:18,162
Alright, thank you then.

33
00:04:18,162 --> 00:04:19,620
Director Kang.

34
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:25,546
Zhang Xiao left in a hurry after seeing the news on Weibo.

35
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:28,120
She asked me to take time off for her for the rest of the afternoon.

36
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,162
What news?

37
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:31,020
I found it.

38
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,012
This is it.

39
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,840
<i>The user you dialed cannot be reached. Please try again later.</i>

40
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,687
This is the only temple in this mountain.

41
00:04:57,687 --> 00:05:01,354
If Lan Lan wants to hide, she should be inside.

42
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:03,612
Lan Lan.

43
00:05:07,912 --> 00:05:09,354
Lan Lan.

44
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:19,329
Lan Lan.

45
00:05:21,412 --> 00:05:22,762
Anything?

46
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:35,912
You can head back first.

47
00:05:35,912 --> 00:05:38,203
Maybe she's just not here now.

48
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:40,145
I'll wait for her to come back.

49
00:05:46,537 --> 00:05:48,519
I'm also waiting for her.

50
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:51,712
She is my sister.

51
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:11,962
Here.

52
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:23,619
You don't know how to eat it?

53
00:06:42,287 --> 00:06:45,120
This is the civilians' happiness.

54
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,587
Try it.

55
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:52,245
How is it?

56
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:15,671
What about you?

57
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:18,354
It's fine.

58
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,629
The fire is warm.

59
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:28,862
<i>I didn't expect for this ice face to have a warm side.</i>

60
00:07:29,812 --> 00:07:33,229
<i>Is this how gentle he is with my sister?</i>

61
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,862
<i>It would be so nice if it were Lan Lan by my side.</i>

62
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:46,087
<i>Why do I have a strange feeling all of a sudden?</i>

63
00:07:46,662 --> 00:07:50,620
<i>It's like I've known him for quite a while.</i>

64
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,919
<i>Lan Lan.</i>

65
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:58,120
<i>Do you feel hungry or cold?</i>

66
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,187
<i>I am here.</i>

67
00:08:00,187 --> 00:08:02,045
<i>Come out.</i>

68
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,846
Whiskey.

69
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:22,145
- I'll do it myself.
- Okay.

70
00:08:22,145 --> 00:08:23,245
- I'm here.
- You're here.

71
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:24,220
Sorry for being late.

72
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,070
- Hurry up.
- You're so late.

73
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,287
Brother, what happened?

74
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:44,287
You're drinking so much. Is something troubling you?

75
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,838
Give me a glass.

76
00:08:47,537 --> 00:08:50,120
I am so busy at work everyday.

77
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,796
It's about work?

78
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:55,579
What else would it be about?

79
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:57,912
If it's not about work, then it's about a girl.

80
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,203
Did you get into an argument with Zhang Xiao?

81
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:00,746
You brat.

82
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:02,454
Wishing that upon your brother?

83
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:04,954
I would rather be arguing with her.

84
00:09:04,954 --> 00:09:07,919
I can't even see her nor get into contact with her.

85
00:09:08,537 --> 00:09:12,354
It seems like Big Brother's situation is a bit better than yours then.

86
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:15,420
Isn't he living like he doesn't have a soul?

87
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:21,120
Doesn't he come to your bar often?

88
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,495
Why isn't he here today?

89
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,079
He was here this afternoon.

90
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:25,771
He said was going to Miao Feng Mountain and left.

91
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:27,395
I don't know what's going on with him.

92
00:09:27,395 --> 00:09:29,203
Miao Feng Mountain.

93
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:02,020
Who are you?

94
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,896
Emperor Yongzheng.

95
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:06,646
Consort Ruoxi is alive!

96
00:10:06,646 --> 00:10:07,838
Wait.

97
00:10:07,838 --> 00:10:11,620
Consort Ruoxi is alive!

98
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,804
Put it on.

99
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,379
Where is she?

100
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:41,679
She ran away.

101
00:10:42,996 --> 00:10:44,646
Are you okay?

102
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:46,796
You seem terrified.

103
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,804
A bit.

104
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:56,212
Aren't you afraid?

105
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,270
I have this ring.

106
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,546
It can drive away evil.

107
00:11:05,454 --> 00:11:08,238
You seem to be very interested in this ring.

108
00:11:09,812 --> 00:11:12,038
If I am not mistaken,

109
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,895
you once sneaked into my office and touched it.

110
00:11:30,854 --> 00:11:32,320
I...

111
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:35,962
I did indeed go into your office and took a photo of it.

112
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:40,071
But I don't know why.

113
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,119
It doesn't matter.

114
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:51,412
According to legend,

115
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,812
Emperor Kangxi gave this to Emperor Yongzheng when he was young.

116
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:56,212
He felt that it could drive away evil.

117
00:11:57,912 --> 00:12:01,520
When I was young, I got really sick.

118
00:12:03,245 --> 00:12:05,087
I remember that time...

119
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:09,329
<i>Come, give me your hand.</i>

120
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,579
<i>Come, grab me.</i>

121
00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:15,919
<i>Zheng'er. Zheng'er.</i>

122
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,038
<i>Don't worry.</i>

123
00:12:30,038 --> 00:12:32,771
<i>According to legend, when Emperor Yongzheng was seriously ill,</i>

124
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:34,354
<i>and his life was at stake,</i>

125
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:38,771
<i>Emperor Kangxi gave him a ring and then he recovered.</i>

126
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:44,620
<i>Therefore, I believe Zheng'er will be okay.</i>

127
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,746
<i>Today I went to Miao Feng Mountain to pray for him.</i>

128
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:50,045
<i>I hope he wakes up soon.</i>

129
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,954
Later, the old man thought that the ring can make me recover.

130
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:03,354
So, he gave it to me.

131
00:13:04,312 --> 00:13:06,954
It is really strange.

132
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,620
It really did come true.

133
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,620
So starting from the day,

134
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,287
I treated this ring as my talisman

135
00:13:13,287 --> 00:13:15,495
and always carry it around.

136
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,370
So,

137
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,171
this ring is belongs to Emperor Yongzheng?

138
00:13:22,787 --> 00:13:24,412
I think so.

139
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:30,904
I think the chairman is good to you.

140
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:37,145
There are a lot of things that just can't be explains with a few words.

141
00:13:38,662 --> 00:13:41,729
That is because you're making things complicated.

142
00:13:42,787 --> 00:13:45,746
If you pay attention to more of the chairman's qualities,

143
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:47,854
things would be much simpler.

144
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,519
Do you still remember what your birth father looks like?

145
00:14:12,354 --> 00:14:15,237
My dad passed away when I was five years old.

146
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,996
If I never saw any of his photos,

147
00:14:18,996 --> 00:14:21,629
I wouldn't remember what he looks like.

148
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:27,245
Actually,

149
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:31,379
I don't know what my birth father looks like.

150
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:35,887
But I know I love my adoptive father.

151
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,162
I also know that he loves me very much.

152
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:42,462
He can't bear to see me suffer.

153
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:46,429
Although he's my adoptive father,

154
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:51,071
I know he will always be my father.

155
00:14:51,854 --> 00:14:54,538
It's great to have an adoptive father who loves you so much.

156
00:14:55,287 --> 00:14:57,562
At least it's better than what I have right now.

157
00:14:59,295 --> 00:15:00,962
Ice face.

158
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:06,087
You're fortunate without knowing it.

159
00:15:11,437 --> 00:15:13,129
What did you call me?

160
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:19,537
Ice face.

161
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:32,737
Lan Lan still isn't back.

162
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,654
Was she never here?

163
00:16:42,454 --> 00:16:44,529
I don't understand.

164
00:16:45,162 --> 00:16:47,604
Why did she leave without saying anything?

165
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:49,696
Why did she leave me?

166
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:54,587
Doesn't she believe that I would do anything for her?

167
00:16:57,871 --> 00:17:01,287
I was always very confident in being able to find her.

168
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,854
But now even the last hope is gone.

169
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:07,971
Where is she hiding?

170
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:12,670
Lan Lan is someone with great self-esteem.

171
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,103
She doesn't want to see you

172
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:18,520
probably because she doesn't want you to feel sorry for her.

173
00:17:20,096 --> 00:17:23,896
Although I'm not qualified to say that's how she feels,

174
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,720
she has been physically and mentally traumatized.

175
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,520
It takes a long time to recover.

176
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:37,154
It takes courage to see you.

177
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:42,495
The most difficult thing to overcome is the fear in her heart.

178
00:17:43,787 --> 00:17:47,454
She wants you to remember her at her best.

179
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:55,846
If that's really how Lan Lan feels,

180
00:17:57,787 --> 00:18:02,219
then it means she doesn't have enough confidence in me.

181
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:09,996
This might be a test for you two.

182
00:18:11,854 --> 00:18:16,220
We can only keep looking for her.

183
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:30,954
The sun is about to rise. You should get some sleep.

184
00:18:30,954 --> 00:18:33,045
I want some time alone.

185
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:00,629
Here you go.

186
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,687
Black Cat Detective.

187
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:26,720
Xiaoxiao, are you okay?

188
00:19:28,287 --> 00:19:29,938
I am sorry.

189
00:19:29,938 --> 00:19:33,687
I bumped into him yesterday when I came.

190
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,620
You didn't tell me you were coming here.

191
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,604
There's no signal in the mountain and I was unable to contact you.

192
00:19:42,604 --> 00:19:44,412
Are you cold?

193
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:46,662
I am sorry.

194
00:19:50,437 --> 00:19:52,079
Come, put it on.

195
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:54,729
Get in the car.

196
00:20:10,454 --> 00:20:11,754
Assistant Qiao.

197
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,062
What?

198
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:16,654
I will be right over.

199
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:25,312
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to be worried.

200
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:28,454
So you mean if anything happened to you while you were alone,

201
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:31,470
I wouldn't be worried because you didn't tell me?

202
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:34,512
I am sorry.

203
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:38,120
Next time no matter what happens,

204
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,429
you'll be the first to know.

205
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:44,762
Try to stay away from him.

206
00:20:46,604 --> 00:20:49,462
I mean try to stay away from Yin Zheng.

207
00:20:55,495 --> 00:20:57,212
Actually,

208
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:00,629
he's not as bad as you think.

209
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,329
What's so good about him?

210
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:14,287
He's alive just to prove one thing.

211
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:16,662
He does anything to beat me.

212
00:21:22,229 --> 00:21:23,587
Please.

213
00:21:32,454 --> 00:21:34,203
You go out first.

214
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:40,762
Wait.

215
00:21:45,912 --> 00:21:47,987
Could I see her back?

216
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:11,538
No problem.

217
00:22:49,604 --> 00:22:53,320
<i>I always thought this man was cold and dark.</i>

218
00:22:54,162 --> 00:22:58,820
<i>I only noticed his sincerity to my sister on Miao Feng Mountain.</i>

219
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,229
<i>People are born kind.</i>

220
00:23:02,229 --> 00:23:06,137
<i>No matter how bad a person is, his heart will always have a soft spot.</i>

221
00:23:06,812 --> 00:23:10,045
<i>His soft spot is for my sister.</i>

222
00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:13,079
<i>Sister.</i>

223
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:15,412
<i>If you can see all of this,</i>

224
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:18,245
<i>how can you bear to leave this man?</i>

225
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:23,862
<i>Sister, where are you?</i>

226
00:23:28,437 --> 00:23:32,919
<i>Is this how you were a week ago?</i>

227
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:34,938
<i>Looking at the river.</i>

228
00:23:36,145 --> 00:23:38,503
<i>Lan Lan.</i>

229
00:23:38,503 --> 00:23:41,162
<i>Why did you choose to leave?</i>

230
00:23:41,162 --> 00:23:43,771
<i>Why did you choose to give up?</i>

231
00:23:43,771 --> 00:23:45,345
<i>Why?</i>

232
00:23:46,671 --> 00:23:48,479
<i>I promised you.</i>

233
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:51,579
<i>I would hire the best doctor in the world to do plastic surgery on you.</i>

234
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:54,954
<i>I will use all my energy to take good care of you.</i>

235
00:23:54,954 --> 00:23:57,420
<i>But why didn't you believe me?</i>

236
00:23:59,162 --> 00:24:01,420
<i>Don't you love me?</i>

237
00:24:09,954 --> 00:24:11,203
Xiaoxiao.

238
00:24:11,203 --> 00:24:13,637
Dad will be alright after the surgery tomorrow.

239
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:15,329
You don't have to keep coming to the hospital.

240
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,119
Dad knows you are busy.

241
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,971
You just get your things done.

242
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:26,412
Xiaoxiao.

243
00:24:28,287 --> 00:24:30,245
Come, sit down.

244
00:24:30,245 --> 00:24:31,962
Chat with me for a bit.

245
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:41,287
Do you miss your sister?

246
00:24:48,746 --> 00:24:52,387
To be honest,

247
00:24:52,387 --> 00:24:54,838
I've been dreaming of your mother these days.

248
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:59,303
What did you dream of?

249
00:24:59,303 --> 00:25:00,329
Tell me about it.

250
00:25:00,329 --> 00:25:01,787
Xiaoxiao.

251
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:06,579
I was only with your mother

252
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:09,245
for a few hours.

253
00:25:09,245 --> 00:25:13,119
I remember she was already dying when I saw her on the road.

254
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,079
I took her to the hospital.

255
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:17,312
She was wheeled into the delivery room.

256
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,412
From the moment I encountered her to the time she entered the delivery room,

257
00:25:21,412 --> 00:25:25,879
it was only about two hours.

258
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:27,871
After that,

259
00:25:27,871 --> 00:25:31,254
the doctor came out and asked me to sign some papers.

260
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:36,304
He said your mother might not make it.

261
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,120
At that time,

262
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,887
seeing you two little babies,

263
00:25:45,387 --> 00:25:47,746
I was very frightened.

264
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,429
I didn't know how to do.

265
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:53,729
No one could help me.

266
00:25:55,537 --> 00:25:57,512
Remembering this now,

267
00:25:58,771 --> 00:26:00,962
I regret it so much.

268
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,587
I regret...

269
00:26:06,454 --> 00:26:08,671
I regret giving your sister up.

270
00:26:10,938 --> 00:26:13,754
I should've raised her up.

271
00:26:16,103 --> 00:26:17,462
Dad.

272
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:21,119
My sister is going to be fine.

273
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,404
We'll find her.

274
00:26:26,687 --> 00:26:29,196
It's been 25 years.

275
00:26:31,495 --> 00:26:34,471
I have been thinking about her.

276
00:26:35,687 --> 00:26:38,145
I didn't expect to receive such news

277
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:42,029
after such a long time of waiting.

278
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:45,687
I blame myself.

279
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,896
Dad, don't blame yourself.

280
00:26:48,896 --> 00:26:50,787
It's not important.

281
00:26:52,162 --> 00:26:56,087
I know you had no choice.

282
00:26:59,629 --> 00:27:01,287
Good.

283
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,087
Things of this world are marvelous.

284
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:15,070
Don't draw any conclusions until the end.

285
00:27:15,771 --> 00:27:20,129
As long as we stay true to our hearts,

286
00:27:21,896 --> 00:27:24,254
our wishes will come true.

287
00:27:29,687 --> 00:27:31,119
Dad.

288
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:36,087
Is my mom pretty?

289
00:27:36,996 --> 00:27:40,046
Yes.

290
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:45,212
You look really similar.

291
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,203
It's like you came from the same mold.

292
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:53,212
You look really similar.

293
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,640
Hello?

294
00:28:10,245 --> 00:28:11,846
Are you Secretary Hou?

295
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:15,287
Great.

296
00:28:15,287 --> 00:28:17,119
Take me there immediately.

297
00:28:21,979 --> 00:28:24,295
Lan Lan and I also look very similar.

298
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:27,912
When you two were babies,

299
00:28:27,912 --> 00:28:31,203
it was hard to distinguish you two from each other.

300
00:28:31,203 --> 00:28:35,245
I remember when the doctor brought you to me,

301
00:28:35,245 --> 00:28:37,270
I got really confused.

302
00:28:39,954 --> 00:28:44,245
You had labels on your hands.

303
00:28:44,245 --> 00:28:47,546
Your time of birth was written on there.

304
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:52,462
Lan Lan was born six minutes earlier than you, so she's the older sister.

305
00:28:53,412 --> 00:28:58,129
So I write the words "older sister" on her hand.

306
00:28:59,746 --> 00:29:04,987
Then I finally found the difference between the two of you.

307
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,837
I remember,

308
00:29:08,495 --> 00:29:12,129
there is a mole behind Lan Lan's ear

309
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,896
and you don't have that.

310
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:19,495
This is the only difference between you and your elder sister.

311
00:29:26,203 --> 00:29:27,687
In fact,

312
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,338
I also have a mole

313
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,596
on the heel.

314
00:29:39,996 --> 00:29:41,546
At that time,

315
00:29:42,495 --> 00:29:46,704
if I could just hang in there a little bit longer,

316
00:29:47,687 --> 00:29:51,762
and kept the two of you with me,

317
00:29:52,354 --> 00:29:55,646
Lan Lan's fate would be different.

318
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,740
Dad, you didn't do anything wrong.

319
00:30:02,729 --> 00:30:06,537
You didn't get married for the two of us.

320
00:30:06,537 --> 00:30:08,954
You don't have your own children.

321
00:30:08,954 --> 00:30:12,120
You worked two jobs and worked hard your entire life.

322
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,019
What else could you have done?

323
00:30:15,996 --> 00:30:19,319
I could've worked harder.

324
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:27,520
God brought you and Mom together.

325
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:32,120
You're one of the rare good people in this world.

326
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,579
Mom understands.

327
00:30:44,145 --> 00:30:50,103
All the encounters in the world have meaning.

328
00:30:51,662 --> 00:30:54,304
I didn't understand what that meant before.

329
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:58,729
But now after living most of my life,

330
00:30:58,729 --> 00:31:03,112
I seem to understand it a bit.

331
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,579
So,

332
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,995
your encounter with Lan Lan definitely has meaning.

333
00:31:28,203 --> 00:31:29,062
Come say hi.

334
00:31:29,062 --> 00:31:31,429
I saw nothing. I don't want to.

335
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:34,003
Why? This is my dad.

336
00:31:34,003 --> 00:31:35,879
My dad.

337
00:31:43,729 --> 00:31:45,412
Where are you going?

338
00:31:45,412 --> 00:31:47,045
Let's do it again.

339
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:53,479
I am back.

340
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,554
Dad.

341
00:31:58,187 --> 00:31:59,579
Dad, what are you doing here?

342
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:00,604
You didn't tell me you were coming.

343
00:32:00,604 --> 00:32:02,062
Xiaoxiao didn't say anything either.

344
00:32:02,062 --> 00:32:03,537
Huang Di, what are you doing?

345
00:32:03,537 --> 00:32:05,662
This is my dad, not your dad.

346
00:32:05,662 --> 00:32:06,679
We're sharing an apartment.

347
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:07,954
What's wrong with sharing a dad too?

348
00:32:07,954 --> 00:32:09,495
You're so stingy.

349
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:10,838
Dad, come. Have some tea.

350
00:32:10,838 --> 00:32:12,520
It's okay.

351
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,354
You are?

352
00:32:13,354 --> 00:32:15,120
Ignore him, he's crazy.

353
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,019
Is he your...

354
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:17,262
No.

355
00:32:17,262 --> 00:32:18,670
He's just one of my poor friends.

356
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,312
I'm helping him out and letting him stay here.

357
00:32:23,395 --> 00:32:24,562
What are you talking about?

358
00:32:24,562 --> 00:32:25,771
Don't make trouble.

359
00:32:25,771 --> 00:32:27,038
Find a basement to stay at for a bit.

360
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:30,610
Go.

361
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,019
Go.

362
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:34,620
- Dad, I'm leaving now.
- Okay.

363
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,329
See you next time.

364
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,629
Go.

365
00:32:42,454 --> 00:32:44,295
I didn't take my luggage.

366
00:32:46,537 --> 00:32:48,270
Dad, you do your things.

367
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,537
I will treat you to a meal next time.

368
00:32:49,537 --> 00:32:50,996
You're too kind.

369
00:32:50,996 --> 00:32:52,312
Goodbye.

370
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,996
Chairman.

371
00:33:20,854 --> 00:33:23,437
What are you doing here so late?

372
00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:25,454
I came to find someone.

373
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,312
Camel.

374
00:33:37,312 --> 00:33:38,962
Brother Kang.

375
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:42,562
Brother Kang.

376
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,119
Camel.

377
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,954
It's been 25 years.

378
00:33:49,954 --> 00:33:52,920
Yes, we haven't seen each other in 25 years.

379
00:33:53,704 --> 00:33:56,354
Xiaoxiao, prepare the tea.

380
00:33:56,354 --> 00:33:58,362
Please come in.

381
00:34:03,829 --> 00:34:08,512
I came to verify something with you.

382
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,938
Go ahead.

383
00:34:09,938 --> 00:34:11,804
Look at this photo.

384
00:34:13,537 --> 00:34:15,679
Do you know these people?

385
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:21,379
Isn't this Big Brother?

386
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,720
This...

387
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,454
He is Xiao...

388
00:34:26,454 --> 00:34:27,245
Xiao Hua.

389
00:34:27,245 --> 00:34:30,162
Right, Xiao Hua.

390
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:36,412
Isn't this Xiaoxiao and Lan Lan's mother?

391
00:34:36,412 --> 00:34:37,412
Are you sure?

392
00:34:37,412 --> 00:34:38,604
Of course I am sure.

393
00:34:38,604 --> 00:34:42,019
Xiao and her look very similar.

394
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:43,219
I'm most definitely sure.

395
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,229
Then I guessed right.

396
00:34:45,746 --> 00:34:47,537
The first time I saw Zhang Xiao,

397
00:34:47,537 --> 00:34:51,262
I thought she was Xiao Hua and Qin Yuzhen's daughter.

398
00:34:54,312 --> 00:34:57,812
She's Xiao Hua's wife?

399
00:34:57,812 --> 00:34:59,996
What is her name?

400
00:34:59,996 --> 00:35:02,871
Qin Yuzhen.

401
00:35:13,038 --> 00:35:15,087
Incredible.

402
00:35:33,996 --> 00:35:35,738
Xiaoxiao.

403
00:35:35,738 --> 00:35:39,919
Do you still remember the day you came to Zhen Tian for your interview?

404
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:41,712
Yes.

405
00:35:41,712 --> 00:35:44,729
The first time I saw you,

406
00:35:44,729 --> 00:35:49,287
I thought you looked like my old friend's wife.

407
00:35:49,287 --> 00:35:51,596
Her name is Qin Yuzhen.

408
00:35:58,646 --> 00:36:00,854
She is your mother.

409
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,362
Xiaoxiao.

410
00:36:08,362 --> 00:36:12,145
Today I finally know who is your father.

411
00:36:12,145 --> 00:36:13,679
25 years ago,

412
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,604
your biological father and Brother Kang went to Ganlin together.

413
00:36:17,604 --> 00:36:20,138
I was their guide.

414
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:21,487
But...

415
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:29,354
But your father was unable to get out of the desert.

416
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,329
25 years ago,

417
00:36:31,329 --> 00:36:34,737
after your mother heard about the bad news,

418
00:36:35,354 --> 00:36:37,120
she disappeared.

419
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,319
We all thought she committed suicide.

420
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:43,119
This thing

421
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,319
has tormented me for 25 years.

422
00:36:47,412 --> 00:36:50,938
I didn't expect that I would meet their daughter

423
00:36:50,938 --> 00:36:54,412
25 years later.

424
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:58,245
When I saw Qin Yuzhen on the side of the road,

425
00:36:58,245 --> 00:37:00,912
she was already dying.

426
00:37:00,912 --> 00:37:04,387
I saw she was pregnant so I rushed her to the hospital.

427
00:37:04,387 --> 00:37:08,604
I didn't expect for her to die after giving birth to her two children.

428
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:13,404
At that time, if I knew she was Brother Xiao's wife,

429
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:24,712
maybe these two children could've had a better life.

430
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,746
You did your best.

431
00:37:29,746 --> 00:37:31,838
You took really good care of them.

432
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:32,979
No.

433
00:37:32,979 --> 00:37:35,787
I only took good care of one of them.

434
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:39,595
You worked hard your entire life just for them.

435
00:37:39,595 --> 00:37:42,604
From now on, leave it to me.

436
00:37:42,604 --> 00:37:47,762
I will treat them as my own daughters.

437
00:37:49,495 --> 00:37:51,262
Thank you.

438
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:56,020
Thank you.

439
00:38:15,787 --> 00:38:17,329
Have you confirmed the corpse?

440
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:20,103
The preliminary identification results have been confirmed.

441
00:38:20,103 --> 00:38:22,395
Don't tell anyone about this,

442
00:38:22,395 --> 00:38:24,687
especially not Zhang Xiao.

443
00:38:24,687 --> 00:38:26,854
She just found out about her birth parents.

444
00:38:26,854 --> 00:38:28,871
She already has a lot to process.

445
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:31,203
If she finds out about her sister now,

446
00:38:31,203 --> 00:38:32,470
I'm worried she can't take it.

447
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,762
I understand.

448
00:38:33,762 --> 00:38:35,479
Also,

449
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,912
send someone to follow Yin Zheng.

450
00:38:37,912 --> 00:38:40,290
I'm sure he's in a bad mood.

451
00:38:40,954 --> 00:38:42,429
I don't want anything to happen to him.

452
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:43,720
Understood.

453
00:38:44,595 --> 00:38:45,996
Let's go.

454
00:38:48,562 --> 00:38:54,354
Big Brother, I heard Yin Zheng has been demoted recently.

455
00:38:55,662 --> 00:38:58,479
Information travels fast.

456
00:38:58,479 --> 00:39:00,662
Yes, he did.

457
00:39:00,662 --> 00:39:04,162
I transferred him to the logistics department to train him.

458
00:39:04,162 --> 00:39:05,646
Logistics department.

459
00:39:05,646 --> 00:39:08,119
Big Brother, I have to say this.

460
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:12,395
Aren't you wasting talent?

461
00:39:12,395 --> 00:39:14,954
He made a mistake so he should be punished.

462
00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:17,537
I am not wasting talent.

463
00:39:17,537 --> 00:39:19,162
How about this?

464
00:39:19,162 --> 00:39:23,119
Let him come to my company in Bangkok.

465
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,162
It can also be considered a punishment for him.

466
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:28,062
He'll be exiled abroad.

467
00:39:28,062 --> 00:39:31,554
But I can't bear to let him go.

468
00:39:33,912 --> 00:39:38,079
Then don't let him waste his time in the logistics department.

469
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,787
Young people need experiences,

470
00:39:40,787 --> 00:39:43,662
but we can't push them too far.

471
00:39:43,662 --> 00:39:48,079
If we go too far, it will bring the opposite effect.

472
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,295
So you're here to plead for Yin Zheng.

473
00:39:56,162 --> 00:39:59,719
Big Brother, to be honest,

474
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,454
I don't have any children.

475
00:40:03,454 --> 00:40:07,754
I treat Yin Zheng as my own son.

476
00:40:08,454 --> 00:40:11,546
I fully regret

477
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:14,579
the mistakes I've made when I was young.

478
00:40:17,662 --> 00:40:22,812
Now I just hope that the younger generation is able to treasure their lives,

479
00:40:22,812 --> 00:40:25,254
and don't follow in my footsteps.

480
00:40:32,919 --> 00:40:36,120
Yin Zheng is different from me.

481
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,287
He was always a smart kid.

482
00:40:38,287 --> 00:40:40,487
He is a rare talent.

483
00:40:41,254 --> 00:40:45,287
I am worried that he will take the wrong step and make a big mistake.

484
00:40:45,287 --> 00:40:46,929
I'm even more worried...

485
00:40:47,787 --> 00:40:49,479
Worried that he's under-appreciated.

486
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:52,812
Furthermore, he has so many years of resentment in his heart.

487
00:40:52,812 --> 00:40:55,462
I'm worried he'll give up on himself.

488
00:40:57,595 --> 00:40:59,520
I know what you mean.

489
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,038
Big Brother.

490
00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:04,912
Every time I have a dream,

491
00:41:04,912 --> 00:41:07,245
I dream of my son.

492
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:10,920
I dream of what happened 25 years ago.

493
00:41:12,162 --> 00:41:16,195
I dream of how I got to this point of having nothing.

494
00:41:16,912 --> 00:41:20,629
Of course I only have myself to blame.

495
00:41:21,454 --> 00:41:24,220
I hate myself.

496
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,829
We can't change the past.

497
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:30,871
The most important thing for us to do now is to focus on the present

498
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:33,370
and arrange for our future.

499
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:37,729
Don't let the pains and sorrows of our generation affect the next generation.

500
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:40,203
Yes.

501
00:41:40,203 --> 00:41:42,079
Big Brother,

502
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,495
we're getting old.

503
00:41:45,495 --> 00:41:47,662
We should enjoy our life.

504
00:41:47,662 --> 00:41:49,462
Don't you think

505
00:41:50,512 --> 00:41:54,954
we should decide on the successor early?

506
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:57,938
Chenggui.

507
00:41:57,938 --> 00:42:00,646
You are very familiar with Qing history.

508
00:42:01,871 --> 00:42:04,412
Why do you think Emperor Kangxi

509
00:42:04,412 --> 00:42:07,695
had his nine sons fight for the throne?

510
00:42:09,495 --> 00:42:13,579
He didn't trust anyone and was reluctant to pass on the throne.

511
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:15,287
No.

512
00:42:15,287 --> 00:42:18,354
Effective government requires minimal intervention.

513
00:42:19,054 --> 00:42:23,537
Governance of a country is the same as governance of a company.

514
00:42:23,537 --> 00:42:27,746
Therefore, talents in management must be tried and tested,

515
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:31,629
courageous and prudent.

516
00:42:33,454 --> 00:42:39,162
Who do you think is qualified, Sihan or Yin Zheng?

517
00:42:39,162 --> 00:42:41,246
They're both too young.

518
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:44,119
Therefore,

519
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:48,495
I need to give more opportunities to test them.

520
00:42:48,495 --> 00:42:51,771
Big Brother, you have good intentions.

521
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:53,203
But this...

522
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:55,079
You don't have to say anymore.

523
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:57,562
I know what I'm doing.

524
00:42:57,562 --> 00:42:59,662
Okay.
