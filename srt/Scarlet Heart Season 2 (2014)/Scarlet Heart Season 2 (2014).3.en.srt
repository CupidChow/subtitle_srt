00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:43,000
<i>[Episode 3]</i>

3
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:07,732
I have a good bottle of red wine in my room.

4
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,490
Are you interested?

5
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:28,607
Go upstairs first.

6
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,299
I have to take this.

7
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,640
Are you Miss Lan?

8
00:03:07,315 --> 00:03:08,816
Hello.

9
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:11,816
This bouquet is from Mr. Yin.

10
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:15,532
He also left you a card.

11
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:19,940
Thank you.

12
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,691
Have a nice night.

13
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:34,040
<i>I have business to attend to, so I can't accompany you.</i>

14
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,249
<i>I look forward to working together.</i>

15
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:11,160
<i>I don't know what you resigning</i>

16
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,816
<i>has to do with you standing in front of the building.</i>

17
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:18,315
<i>If you think running from your problems will help you solve them,</i>

18
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:22,424
<i>I can tell you that's not the way.</i>

19
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:26,991
<i>It's best to face your problems.</i>

20
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,574
Director Yin, this way.

21
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,107
Director Yin.

22
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:28,090
Why are you here so early?

23
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:30,991
Who is that?

24
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:36,940
The way she sleeps is so terrifying.

25
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,082
Sorry, Director Yin.

26
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:39,649
Don't wake her, let her sleep.

27
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,040
She probably worked overtime yesterday.

28
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,107
It's an employee's duty to work overtime for the company.

29
00:06:45,107 --> 00:06:49,332
Director Yin, why are you here so early today?

30
00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:51,891
You're here early too.

31
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:54,291
The jewelry exhibition show the day after tomorrow and Yue-Sai's proposal

32
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,924
for the new launches at the exhibition next week are both in progress.

33
00:06:56,924 --> 00:06:59,624
So I came early to work on it.

34
00:06:59,624 --> 00:07:03,290
We have the responsibility to work hard for the company.

35
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,858
But I've never seen such a hardworking boss like you.

36
00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:09,332
I am not the boss.

37
00:07:09,332 --> 00:07:10,482
I am a worker also.

38
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:12,340
You're such a jokester.

39
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,499
By the way,

40
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,315
is she our poster designer?

41
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:18,390
Ask her to bring me the design after she wakes up.

42
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,482
I will be in the studio today.

43
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:20,982
Okay.

44
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,440
Also,

45
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,640
give her a tablet.

46
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,916
Do you think this is your house?

47
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,416
Come to my office after buying breakfast.

48
00:07:42,607 --> 00:07:44,190
Greetings, Chairman.

49
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:49,482
Sorry, Miss.

50
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:52,040
This is the chairman's personal elevator.

51
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,274
Let her in.

52
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:54,739
Yes.

53
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,149
Thank you.

54
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:00,666
You're welcome.

55
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:02,858
How are you?

56
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,249
You seem to be in a good mood today.

57
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:08,874
I am fine, thank you.

58
00:08:08,874 --> 00:08:12,182
I should thank you for your advice.

59
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:15,682
What is this?

60
00:08:15,682 --> 00:08:18,415
Breakfast for my colleagues.

61
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,039
Young people like you

62
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,357
are still willing to buy others breakfast.

63
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:25,499
Great.

64
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:29,566
Those who like to help others are liked by many.

65
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:31,065
Keep it up.

66
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:32,699
I will.

67
00:08:33,457 --> 00:08:34,816
Mr. Chairman.

68
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:36,482
I bought an extra coffee.

69
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,332
It's for you.

70
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:38,816
Mr. Chairman doesn't drink coffee.

71
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:40,420
It's fine.

72
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,174
You're so friendly.

73
00:08:42,174 --> 00:08:44,139
I will take it.

74
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:47,582
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

75
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:49,465
I will treat you next time.

76
00:08:50,732 --> 00:08:52,524
Mr. Chairman.

77
00:08:52,524 --> 00:08:55,232
Are you interested in Kangxi?

78
00:08:55,232 --> 00:08:57,524
You're very invested in Kangxi.

79
00:08:57,524 --> 00:08:59,390
Yes.

80
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:03,691
It's no wonder you talked about Kangxi so much that day.

81
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:08,239
I think he was a great Emperor.

82
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:11,591
I think so too.

83
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,732
You asked me if I liked tea that day.

84
00:09:15,732 --> 00:09:17,540
I can tell you now.

85
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,165
I like tea, not coffee.

86
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:23,582
Do you like to hunt?

87
00:09:23,582 --> 00:09:25,099
Hunting?

88
00:09:27,082 --> 00:09:28,940
I like fishing.

89
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:31,816
I see.

90
00:09:31,816 --> 00:09:33,149
What's wrong?

91
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:34,716
It's nothing.

92
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:37,982
Your questions are quite unique.

93
00:09:37,982 --> 00:09:41,399
Many do not understand a designer's way of thinking.

94
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:45,640
I'm here.

95
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:49,315
I was so focused with chatting with you that I forgot to press the button.

96
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:50,939
You'll have to go down again.

97
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:53,023
I hope your breakfast is still hot.

98
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:54,732
Thank you.

99
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,149
Secretary Hou.

100
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:03,040
How is her background check going?

101
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,165
Sorry, Mr. Chairman.

102
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:06,107
I've been so busy lately I haven't gotten to it.

103
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:07,524
I don't have all the details yet.

104
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,749
Get on with it.

105
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:10,774
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

106
00:10:10,774 --> 00:10:12,540
One more thing.

107
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,774
Tell the supervisor of the Publicity Department

108
00:10:14,774 --> 00:10:17,039
that we pay the designer

109
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:19,566
for their creativity and designs,

110
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:21,415
not to ask them to buy breakfast.

111
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:23,290
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

112
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,774
Do you have any news on Sihan?

113
00:10:25,774 --> 00:10:27,082
He's returned to Beijing

114
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:29,165
and just registered a company.

115
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:30,749
Director Liu had met with him.

116
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:32,823
He doesn't want to join the company.

117
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:36,974
That's all.

118
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:52,374
Coffee, sandwich.

119
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:00,415
Yes.

120
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:03,374
Sharing is caring.

121
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,516
I don't know how you're so fortunate.

122
00:11:08,516 --> 00:11:10,958
This is from Director Yin.

123
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,257
A tablet.

124
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:19,107
Upload your design and bring it to him.

125
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:21,232
He is waiting for you at the studio.

126
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:22,399
Director Yin?

127
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,457
You mean Vice President Yin Zheng?

128
00:11:24,457 --> 00:11:25,616
Of course.

129
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:29,040
Zhen Tian Group only has one Director Yin.

130
00:11:35,082 --> 00:11:36,415
What are you waiting for?

131
00:11:36,415 --> 00:11:38,207
Go now.

132
00:11:39,123 --> 00:11:41,274
This auction is very important to us.

133
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:43,582
So the poster must be very unique.

134
00:11:43,582 --> 00:11:45,290
Take note of this information.

135
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,040
Understood.

136
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,791
Don't worry, Director Yin. I got it.

137
00:11:52,457 --> 00:11:54,458
<i>He is right in front of me.</i>

138
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:58,874
<i>There's only ten steps in between us.</i>

139
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,939
<i>I just need to take ten steps</i>

140
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:04,332
<i>to stand in front of him.</i>

141
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,965
<i>Ten steps.</i>

142
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:12,880
<i>It's so close</i>

143
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,680

<i>Four.</i>

148
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:36,132
What happened?

149
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:37,732
Is she okay?

150
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,965
Who is that?

151
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:53,680
Lan Lan?

152
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,199
Call an ambulance.

153
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:56,540
Okay.

154
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,060

- Step aside.
- Doctor, is she okay?

Who are you?

00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,774
I am her ex-boyfriend.

160
00:13:12,774 --> 00:13:14,149
Come with us.

161
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:17,224
- Is she going to die?
- We'll know when we get to the hospital.

No way.

172
00:14:47,874 --> 00:14:50,165
You can't remember me?

173
00:14:50,165 --> 00:14:52,140
Don't move. I'll go get the doctor.

00:16:43,732 --> 00:16:46,715
Wait for me at the entrance of the inpatient department in ten minutes.

190
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:49,332
Doctor, hurry.

191
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:51,749
Please check on my friend.

192
00:16:52,457 --> 00:16:54,707
Director Yin, I am Huang Di.

193
00:16:54,707 --> 00:16:56,023
I'm in the Publicity Department.

194
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:58,274
I'm Zhang Xiao's good friend.

195
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,958
Doctor, how is she now?

196
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,374
Doctor, did she lose her memories from the electrocution?

197
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:08,524
She seems to not remember me.

198
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:12,939
I can't comment on that until she's fully awake.

199
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:15,165
She's still under anesthesia.

200
00:17:15,165 --> 00:17:16,232
Don't worry.

201
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:18,049
I will come back later.

202
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,174
You said she doesn't remember you?

203
00:17:25,691 --> 00:17:29,332
I don't know if she remembers me or not.

204
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:32,249
But I'm very appreciative that you came to visit her.

205
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:35,123
I'm sure Zhang Xiao would be very happy too if she knew you came.

206
00:17:35,123 --> 00:17:37,815
The company's vice president is here to see her.

207
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:38,899
That's enough.

208
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:42,432
Call my assistant when she wakes up.

209
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:47,507
- Keep in touch.
- Okay.

210
00:17:49,457 --> 00:17:50,832
Xiaoxiao.

211
00:17:50,832 --> 00:17:52,939
Xiaoxiao, Director Yin.

212
00:17:53,832 --> 00:17:55,791
Xiaoxiao.

213
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,515
How are you doing?

214
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:03,632
You are?

215
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:09,916
Why am I here?

216
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,899
Xiaoxiao, he is Director Yin.

217
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:15,591
You got electrocuted and hit your head.

218
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,307
Here.

219
00:18:24,874 --> 00:18:26,374
Xiaoxiao.

220
00:18:26,374 --> 00:18:28,815
Do you remember me?

221
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,807
Did you really forget me?

222
00:18:34,524 --> 00:18:37,165
You can forget everyone else but you can't forget me.

223
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:39,716
What are you talking about, Cheater Huang?

224
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,123
You scared me.

225
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,791
I knew you wouldn't forget me.

226
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,799
I remember now.

227
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,149
I got into an accident going to meet you

228
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:02,357
in the studio.

229
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:03,839
Yes.

230
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:06,666
You woke up briefly once before.

231
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,740
Do you remember what you said to me?

232
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:13,207
I woke up?

233
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:16,507
What did I say?

234
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:19,940
Forget it.

235
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,290
This is yours.

236
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,399
I've looked at the design.

237
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:32,058
The magnolia is quite textured.

238
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:45,182
Have you seen this before?

239
00:19:50,332 --> 00:19:52,215
I don't know.

240
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:56,899
That's okay. The most important thing right now is for you to have a good rest.

241
00:19:57,432 --> 00:19:59,840
Contact me if she has any updates.

242
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:05,382
Bye, Director Yin.

243
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,266
Do you know who he is?

244
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:13,758
Our boss.

245
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:17,165
What else can you remember?

246
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:19,050
What else?

247
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,410
What do you mean?

248
00:20:22,165 --> 00:20:25,691
You really can't remember?

249
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:29,249
What are you trying to say?

250
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:32,340
Yin Zheng.

251
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,270
Yongzheng.

252
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,130
Emperor.

253
00:20:37,858 --> 00:20:39,765
Yongzheng?

254
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,557
Qing Dynasty.

255
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:43,949
Yes.

256
00:20:45,415 --> 00:20:47,860
What does that have to do with me?

257
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,582
What are you talking about?

258
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:54,190
My head hurts, let me rest.

259
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:05,440
I suspect she was the one who moved this jade in my office.

260
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,040
Are you sure?

261
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,566
It's possible.

262
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:12,916
But I don't understand why she's interested in this ring.

263
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:16,666
I heard from Jack that she was originally rejected after her interview.

264
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:20,457
But the chairman liked her so she stayed.

265
00:21:20,457 --> 00:21:22,249
The chairman?

266
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:25,691
I also thought she worked for the chairman.

267
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:27,874
Look into her background.

268
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:29,749
Find out if she's related to Lan Lan.

269
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:31,107
Okay.

270
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:34,232
One more thing, find me someone who can translate Manchu script.

271
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:37,315
I want to know what this in here means.

272
00:21:38,457 --> 00:21:40,082
This has been with you for many years.

273
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:42,858
But you've never wanted to find out the meaning of the script.

274
00:21:42,858 --> 00:21:45,666
Why do you want to know now?

275
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:51,440
She's stable now.

276
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,566
You said she lost her memories.

277
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:58,482
I think it's selective amnesia after the sudden electric shock.

278
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:01,774
She didn't lose all her memories,

279
00:22:01,774 --> 00:22:07,082
just a very small part of it.

280
00:22:07,082 --> 00:22:09,899
It's possible for her to retrieve her memories,

281
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:12,524
but it'll need more time.

282
00:22:12,524 --> 00:22:16,666
How long will it be?

283
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,357
I can't confirm.

284
00:22:19,357 --> 00:22:21,390
Maybe a month,

285
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,249
maybe a year.

286
00:22:23,249 --> 00:22:27,023
It's also possible she never remembers.

287
00:22:27,023 --> 00:22:30,316
You're making me lose hope.

288
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:34,165
I am a doctor, not a therapist.

289
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:37,124
I have to tell it to you as it is.

290
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,874
<i>Sihan, stop playing.</i>

291
00:24:25,874 --> 00:24:28,591
<i>You have to do your homework.</i>

292
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:31,707
<i>No, Mom.</i>

293
00:24:31,707 --> 00:24:33,939
<i>I still want to play for a bit.</i>

294
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,607
<i>Son, you have to study</i>

295
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:40,832
<i>so you can become as great as your father when you grow up.</i>

296
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:13,149
I'm back, Mom.

297
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,107
Since you've been electrocuted,

298
00:25:16,107 --> 00:25:18,440
and you've been so nice to me,

299
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,532
I'll cook you some nice foods during this time.

300
00:25:21,532 --> 00:25:24,839
Pig brain is good for your brain.

301
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:29,015
My favorite is spicy pork hoof.

302
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,758
And also fries and chips.

303
00:25:44,649 --> 00:25:46,582
Come.

304
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,023
It's so cold.

305
00:25:51,023 --> 00:25:53,899
Let's go back and eat instant noodles instead.

306
00:25:57,939 --> 00:25:59,457
Come on.

307
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:02,623
I'm coming home today!

308
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,039
Hey.

309
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,123
You're such a pig.

310
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:18,766
I've only been gone for a few days and the place looks like this?

311
00:26:20,766 --> 00:26:22,939
Don't let me find a single strand of long hair.

312
00:26:22,939 --> 00:26:26,207
Otherwise, you can't stay here.

313
00:26:26,207 --> 00:26:28,507
I've been at the hospital taking care of you.

314
00:26:28,507 --> 00:26:30,440
I didn't have time to tidy up the house.

315
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,591
There are two different things.

316
00:26:41,724 --> 00:26:44,523
Are these books on the Qing Dynasty yours?

317
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:48,016
Since when were you so invested in this?

318
00:26:56,499 --> 00:27:00,016
Did you write this too?

319
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:04,999
Me?

320
00:27:07,932 --> 00:27:10,039
Impossible.

321
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:13,390
I've always hated calligraphy.

322
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,482
Don't think about it too hard.

323
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:18,899
I'll help you tidy this stuff up.

324
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:22,399
The doctor said that you need to rest.

325
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,816
Let me handle this.

326
00:27:24,816 --> 00:27:26,215
Wait.

327
00:27:29,457 --> 00:27:31,432
What's going on?

328
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:33,107
Tell me.

329
00:27:35,816 --> 00:27:37,915
Do you really want to know?

330
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:42,374
Take out your phone.

331
00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:46,782
Open up your private space

332
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:48,707
and open the camera roll.

333
00:27:48,707 --> 00:27:51,215
You'll see a man with sunglasses on.

334
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:14,174
Do you still remember why you took that photo?

335
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:17,099
What were you thinking when you took it?

336
00:28:22,249 --> 00:28:23,732
Alright.

337
00:28:23,732 --> 00:28:24,816
Forget it if you don't remember.

338
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:26,332
It means he isn't important.

339
00:28:26,332 --> 00:28:27,899
Forget about him.

340
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,315
<i>Forget it if you don't remember.</i>

341
00:28:43,315 --> 00:28:45,065
<i>It means he isn't important.</i>

342
00:28:45,065 --> 00:28:46,632
<i>Forget about him.</i>

343
00:28:53,749 --> 00:28:57,457
Miss, why are you looking at my husband's photo?

344
00:28:57,457 --> 00:29:00,724
- Your husband?
- That's my husband. Give it back.

345
00:29:00,724 --> 00:29:02,207
- Wait.
- Give it back.

346
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,649
Sorry.

347
00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:07,290
She has Alzheimer's.

348
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,123
Sorry.

349
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:12,624
Here, drink.

350
00:29:12,624 --> 00:29:15,440
She's my wife.

351
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,965
But she can't remember you?

352
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,249
She couldn't remember since ten years ago.

353
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:27,139
She took my photo of my husband.

354
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:28,749
Okay.

355
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,323
<i>Why did I take this photo?</i>

356
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:36,166
<i>Maybe it was an accident.</i>

357
00:29:37,165 --> 00:29:41,766
<i>Losing my memory is like losing a part of my life.</i>

358
00:29:42,891 --> 00:29:47,549
<i>I wonder how my life would be different without these memories.</i>

359
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,024
<i>Just like this grandma.</i>

360
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:55,940
<i>She forgot her husband who has been with her all her life.</i>

361
00:29:56,958 --> 00:30:00,482
<i>Why am I overthinking it?</i>

362
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:03,899
Zhang Xiao? Who is Zhang Xiao?

363
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:04,791
Me.

364
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:06,323
It's your turn.

365
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:10,582
Your brain function is normal

366
00:30:10,582 --> 00:30:14,082
and your body has fully recovered.

367
00:30:14,082 --> 00:30:18,649
But you won't recall your lost memories for the time being.

368
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:22,940
<i>And it's possible that they're lost forever.</i>

369
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,466
<i>Be mentally prepared.</i>

370
00:30:30,457 --> 00:30:32,274
Let's move this in first.

371
00:30:32,274 --> 00:30:34,216
Do it gently.

372
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:36,349
Higher.

373
00:30:36,349 --> 00:30:39,039
That's good, a bit higher.

374
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,020
Lower.

375
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,940
Give a hand.

376
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:46,210
- A bit lower.
- ZX.

377
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,890
Higher.

378
00:30:48,707 --> 00:30:50,849
<i>What company is this?</i>

379
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,882
<i>They're using my initials.</i>

380
00:30:52,882 --> 00:30:55,282
Lower.

381
00:30:55,282 --> 00:30:56,923
That's good.

382
00:30:57,858 --> 00:30:59,715
Thank you, everyone.

383
00:31:04,832 --> 00:31:07,016
Xiaoxiao, you're back.

384
00:31:08,165 --> 00:31:09,299
How was your visit?

385
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,499
What did the doctor say?

386
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:13,632
Everything looks good.

387
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:18,782
But I may not ever be able to get my memories back.

388
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,607
I knew this would happen,

389
00:31:22,607 --> 00:31:26,339
so I devised a plan B.

390
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,758
What are you doing with that?

391
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,899
To help you remember.

392
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:41,782
With that?

393
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:44,023
Think about it.

394
00:31:44,023 --> 00:31:47,499
Your brainwaves were passed through strong electric currents

395
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:48,882
causing you to lose your memories.

396
00:31:48,882 --> 00:31:51,182
Now we have to use the same method

397
00:31:51,182 --> 00:31:53,320
to help you get back your memories.

398
00:31:53,874 --> 00:31:55,540
No, thanks.

399
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:59,082
Don't worry. I won't test it on you.

400
00:31:59,082 --> 00:32:00,624
I will try it out first

401
00:32:00,624 --> 00:32:03,816
and bear the consequences.

402
00:32:03,816 --> 00:32:06,774
Forget it, it's too dangerous.

403
00:32:06,774 --> 00:32:10,174
Plus, I don't want to regain those memories.

404
00:32:15,832 --> 00:32:22,082
♪ I am willing ♪

405
00:32:22,082 --> 00:32:28,639
♪ I am willing to risk my life ♪

406
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,707
Huang Di.

407
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,315
Cheater Huang.

408
00:32:43,315 --> 00:32:45,820
Are you alright?

409
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,230
Huang Di.

410
00:32:50,874 --> 00:32:52,791
Huang Di.

411
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:55,691
Do you remember me?

412
00:32:55,691 --> 00:32:57,223
Yes.

413
00:32:58,374 --> 00:33:00,858
Who am I?

414
00:33:00,858 --> 00:33:03,474
Zhang Xiao.

415
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:08,174
I didn't lose my memories.

416
00:33:10,624 --> 00:33:12,440
You look terrifying.

417
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,499
Let me take you to the hospital.

418
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:15,040
No.

419
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,082
I am fine.

420
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:19,632
Are you sure?

421
00:33:23,707 --> 00:33:25,074
Huang Di.

422
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:27,449
Thank you.

423
00:33:28,691 --> 00:33:32,740
But I really don't want to regain those memories.

424
00:33:33,457 --> 00:33:35,707
When I went to my follow-up visit,

425
00:33:35,707 --> 00:33:37,758
I realized something.

426
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,290
Those memories are not what's important.

427
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:44,690
What's important is that there's someone who loves you.

428
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,415
Xiaoxiao.

429
00:33:47,415 --> 00:33:49,182
I'm so touched.

430
00:33:49,182 --> 00:33:52,282
I would die for you.

431
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,932
What are you talking about?

432
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:57,982
I was saying that to myself, not to you.

433
00:33:58,582 --> 00:33:59,923
Xiaoxiao.

434
00:33:59,923 --> 00:34:02,023
I'm asking you sincerely.

435
00:34:02,023 --> 00:34:03,958
Just forgive me.

436
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,432
Huang Di.

437
00:34:05,432 --> 00:34:08,040
Even if I lost my memories of you cheating on me,

438
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,549
we would never get back together.

439
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:13,265
If you want to keep holding on hope,

440
00:34:13,265 --> 00:34:15,074
you can move out.

441
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:18,649
Between a place to live and love,

442
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:21,082
I will settle for a place to live.

443
00:34:21,082 --> 00:34:23,390
You're not that pitiful.

444
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,799
Wait.

445
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:27,807
This is for you.

446
00:34:27,807 --> 00:34:31,149
You can ware off the perverts or something.

447
00:34:32,866 --> 00:34:34,582
I have something else to give you.

448
00:34:34,582 --> 00:34:35,958
Follow me.

449
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,791
This is for you.

450
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:46,699
What a coincidence.

451
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,749
I just passed by the building that was under maintenance.

452
00:34:48,749 --> 00:34:52,039
They're also called ZX.

453
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:54,223
This is their free gift.

454
00:34:54,223 --> 00:34:55,390
You don't know?

455
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:58,082
The company isn't very popular here.

456
00:34:58,082 --> 00:35:00,749
But it's a big company in England.

457
00:35:00,749 --> 00:35:03,123
A big company wanted to acquire them,

458
00:35:03,123 --> 00:35:04,540
but the boss didn't agree to it.

459
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,040
The boss is also Chinese.

460
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,791
This brand is pretty great then.

461
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:13,039
There's also something else.

462
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:16,415
Have you realized that since your accident,

463
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:20,339
the people you've met, your memory loss,

464
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,357
and also this, are all crazy coincidences.

465
00:35:22,357 --> 00:35:23,666
Did you notice?

466
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:28,290
The company's name are your initials.

467
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:31,123
And the office is just beside your house.

468
00:35:31,123 --> 00:35:33,740
Isn't it too much of a coincidence?

469
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,374
You've been watching too much of Detective Conan.

470
00:35:36,374 --> 00:35:39,707
I think this definitely has something to do with you.

471
00:35:39,707 --> 00:35:40,916
Do you want to try it?

472
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:43,349
No, thanks. You should keep it.

473
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:46,039
I think you need it.

474
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:47,170
Me?

475
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,990
I need it?

476
00:36:01,082 --> 00:36:02,758
Good morning, Director Yin.

477
00:36:11,499 --> 00:36:13,791
How are you recovering?

478
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:17,607
I went to in for a check-up yesterday.

479
00:36:17,607 --> 00:36:19,540
The doctor said I'm fine now.

480
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,939
That's good.

481
00:36:20,939 --> 00:36:22,457
Be more careful.

482
00:36:22,457 --> 00:36:24,866
Don't let this happen again.

483
00:36:24,866 --> 00:36:26,399
Got it.

484
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:31,182
By the way,

485
00:36:31,182 --> 00:36:33,849
have we met at a museum?

486
00:36:34,874 --> 00:36:36,640
Museum?

487
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:40,107
No?

488
00:36:40,107 --> 00:36:41,965
Are you sure?

489
00:36:43,374 --> 00:36:46,290
I can't remember.

490
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,916
You know. My memory...

491
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,916
Forget it.

492
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:54,165
Bring the poster design to the studio.

493
00:36:54,165 --> 00:36:55,939
I will wait for you there.

494
00:36:55,939 --> 00:36:57,315
Okay.

495
00:36:59,123 --> 00:37:01,290
Director Yin, this is me. See you.

496
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,190
Your bag is open.

497
00:37:04,749 --> 00:37:06,232
Thank you.

498
00:37:13,707 --> 00:37:16,557
Xiaoxiao, your package.

499
00:37:16,557 --> 00:37:19,015
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

500
00:37:32,858 --> 00:37:33,924
<i>Xiaoxiao,</i>

501
00:37:33,924 --> 00:37:37,307
<i>I brought you a scarf in Nepal last month.</i>

502
00:37:37,307 --> 00:37:40,107
<i>I think it's just in time for the weather now.</i>

503
00:37:40,107 --> 00:37:43,182
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

504
00:37:43,182 --> 00:37:44,824
Thank you, Dad.

505
00:37:52,624 --> 00:37:53,691
Miss Lan.

506
00:37:53,691 --> 00:37:55,332
Turn this way.

507
00:37:55,332 --> 00:37:57,332
Great.

508
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:11,607
Director Yin.

509
00:38:11,607 --> 00:38:13,049
Let's take a break.

510
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:15,140
Let's go.

511
00:38:19,207 --> 00:38:20,874
Good morning, Director Yin.

512
00:38:20,874 --> 00:38:22,190
Miss Lan Lan.

513
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,832
How professional of you to come back to work in time.

514
00:38:25,832 --> 00:38:28,649
Why didn't you stay in Hong Kong a few more days?

515
00:38:28,649 --> 00:38:31,515
I am a very punctual person.

516
00:38:31,515 --> 00:38:33,840
I don't stand people up.

517
00:38:36,016 --> 00:38:38,707
I usually don't see someone who gets too intimate

518
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:41,707
on the first date a second time.

519
00:38:41,707 --> 00:38:44,182
But thinking of the long contract we have,

520
00:38:44,182 --> 00:38:46,340
I came back early.

521
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:51,474
I think you misunderstood.

522
00:38:51,474 --> 00:38:56,766
I thought that time couldn't be used to measure love.

523
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:59,957
Love is love.

524
00:39:01,415 --> 00:39:03,332
Also,

525
00:39:03,332 --> 00:39:07,932
today is my last day working with your company.

526
00:39:07,932 --> 00:39:10,749
Our contract just started.

527
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:13,249
If it was a wrong decision from the beginning,

528
00:39:13,249 --> 00:39:15,607
I would rather end it sooner than later.

529
00:39:18,374 --> 00:39:20,458
Can you calm down?

530
00:39:21,832 --> 00:39:25,824
Can you stay calm when you've been looked down upon?

531
00:39:27,207 --> 00:39:31,074
Since you treated our relationship as a game,

532
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:34,049
I have nothing to say to you.

533
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,916
I'm sorry.

534
00:39:41,582 --> 00:39:43,774
Please accept my apologies.

535
00:39:50,332 --> 00:39:52,049
Director Yin.

536
00:39:53,415 --> 00:39:55,382
Are you free now?

537
00:39:57,415 --> 00:39:58,991
Of course.

538
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:10,140
You...

539
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,110
You are...

540
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:17,357
Sorry I didn't introduce you.

541
00:40:17,357 --> 00:40:20,499
This is our new model, Lan Lan.

542
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:25,499
This is our graphic designer, Zhang Xiao.

543
00:40:26,932 --> 00:40:29,516
Nice to meet you, Miss Lan.

544
00:40:30,265 --> 00:40:32,165
Nice to meet you.

545
00:40:32,165 --> 00:40:35,207
We look alike.

546
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:37,090
Really?

547
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,790
Only our appearances.

548
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,415
Give it to me.

549
00:40:45,182 --> 00:40:46,510
Director Yin.

550
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,620
Please come over here.

551
00:40:52,939 --> 00:40:54,374
What is it?

552
00:40:54,374 --> 00:40:55,566
I've investigated.

553
00:40:55,566 --> 00:40:58,349
Zhang Xiao and Lan Lan aren't related.

554
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:00,139
Zhang Xiao was born in Ganling

555
00:41:00,139 --> 00:41:02,039
into a single-parent household.

556
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,958
Her father was a physical education teacher.

557
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:05,774
Lan Lan was born in Suzhou.

558
00:41:05,774 --> 00:41:08,249
Her family emigrated to Australia when she was five.

559
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:09,390
Both her parents are still alive,

560
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,482
and they're well-educated intellectuals.

561
00:41:11,482 --> 00:41:12,749
Also,

562
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:14,640
the person who translates Manchu scripts is traveling.

563
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,015
They won't be back for another three months.

564
00:41:25,457 --> 00:41:28,958
I know a good Northwestern restaurant.

565
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:32,299
We can go together if you'd like.

566
00:41:33,682 --> 00:41:35,999
If we go together,

567
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:38,916
the boss might think we're twins.

568
00:41:43,207 --> 00:41:47,165
May I ask...

569
00:41:47,165 --> 00:41:50,332
When is your birthday?

570
00:41:50,332 --> 00:41:53,974
Maybe we were born on the same day.

571
00:41:53,974 --> 00:41:56,440
I don't think it's necessary to tell you.

572
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,882
Sorry, I have to go now.

573
00:42:13,207 --> 00:42:15,107
Sorry, Director Yin.

574
00:42:15,107 --> 00:42:18,415
Did I spoil her mood?

575
00:42:18,415 --> 00:42:21,315
She is upset, but it's not because of you.

576
00:42:21,315 --> 00:42:22,724
By the way,

577
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:26,599
I have a favor to ask.

578
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:27,457
What is it?

579
00:42:27,457 --> 00:42:31,707
Bring magnolias to Lan Lan's room starting today.

580
00:42:31,707 --> 00:42:33,791
She likes magnolias?

581
00:42:34,807 --> 00:42:37,791
You can ask the staff at the flower shop to do it.

582
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:40,474
I want you to personally deliver them.

583
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,666
It makes it more sincere.

584
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:45,190
You can report all your expenses to Assistant Qiao.

585
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,823
Understood?
