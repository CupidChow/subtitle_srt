<i>[Episode 26]</i>

3
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,582
You can leave after you finish the porridge.

4
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:23,024
Here's the key.

5
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,207
But let me take you home.

6
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,007
Why?

7
00:02:33,415 --> 00:02:36,149
Because I brought you here from the hospital.

8
00:02:36,149 --> 00:02:38,799
I should make sure you get home safe.

9
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:44,866
I can go home myself.

10
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:49,290
That's my condition.

11
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,074
There's no negotiation.

12
00:02:55,716 --> 00:02:57,939
When facing difficulty,

13
00:02:57,939 --> 00:02:59,882
you have to face it bravely.

14
00:02:59,882 --> 00:03:01,340
You remember it.

15
00:03:06,107 --> 00:03:10,974
I just think it suits our situation.

16
00:03:12,524 --> 00:03:15,640
Many things are difficult to get through.

17
00:03:16,232 --> 00:03:19,799
But we have to accept it as long as we're alive.

18
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,291
Is it my phone?

19
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:09,124
I'll go make a call.

20
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,940
Xiaoxiao.

21
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:16,849
Xiaoxiao.

22
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,932
Xiaoxiao.

23
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,232
Stop looking.

24
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,166
Looks like she's not back yet.

25
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:29,732
How about this?

26
00:04:29,732 --> 00:04:30,832
You should wait here.

27
00:04:30,832 --> 00:04:32,749
Message me on WeChat if she comes back.

28
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:35,566
Don't worry, she will be fine.

29
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,839
Such a terrible thing happened to her.

30
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,249
It's hard for anyone to accept.

31
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:41,907
And Zhang Xiao is especially someone who is easily emotionally attached.

32
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,707
Have you called Yin Zheng?

33
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:46,765
Weren't they together?

34
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:49,040
I'll call.

35
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,482
<i>The number you dialed is turned off.</i>

36
00:04:57,482 --> 00:04:59,000
His phone's off.

37
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:01,432
I'll go find him.

38
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,507
Second Uncle, what is it?

39
00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:36,082
The photos at the wedding ceremony.

40
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:40,149
I had my man ask an employee to do it.

41
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:43,440
Now that someone died because of it,

42
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,860
he wants more money from me.

43
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,524
But I'm busy buying Zhen Tian's shares.

44
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:54,491
I have no time to deal with this.

45
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:56,315
What do you think?

46
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,290
Help me handle it.

47
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,524
I will.

48
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:04,091
Does anyone else at the wedding company know about this?

49
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:07,716
I don't think so.

50
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:09,540
I know what to do.

51
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:19,224
Why are you here?

52
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:22,124
Where are my clothes and my bag?

53
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:25,057
Your clothes are being washed.

54
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:27,691
Just wear that.

55
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:29,315
Your bag is drying on the balcony.

56
00:06:29,315 --> 00:06:31,691
I think it's almost dry.

57
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,315
I'll go get it.

58
00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:35,100
Can I go now?

59
00:06:35,624 --> 00:06:37,232
I'll go down in a bit.

60
00:07:18,816 --> 00:07:20,182
Yin Zheng.

61
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:25,149
Who do you think

62
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:28,290
switched the photos at the wedding ceremony?

63
00:07:35,774 --> 00:07:37,882
You should live your life.

64
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:41,057
Forget those sad memories.

65
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:43,190
Don't talk about it anymore.

66
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,282
Why did they do that?

67
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:09,716
You're still sick.

68
00:08:09,716 --> 00:08:11,774
Let me go up with you.

69
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:14,466
No thanks.

70
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:16,266
I can go up myself.

71
00:09:30,524 --> 00:09:33,840
Miss, can I ask you to dance?

72
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:40,907
Xiaoxiao, what happened?

73
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,715
I am scared.

74
00:09:47,524 --> 00:09:49,149
Scared of what?

75
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:51,190
You have me.

76
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,623
My shoulder is for you.

77
00:09:55,874 --> 00:10:01,410
I got my memories back.

78
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:06,357
What?

79
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:09,182
It's such a heavy burden

80
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:14,557
to get them back.

81
00:10:17,174 --> 00:10:22,482
You mean you remember everything from before your electric shock?

82
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:24,123
Yes.

83
00:10:26,816 --> 00:10:29,316
Why does it feel like it was a dream?

84
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:34,491
What should I do now?

85
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:38,932
You mean Yin Zheng?

86
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:43,132
You should wake up.

87
00:10:43,732 --> 00:10:47,991
Yin Zheng is just a ticking time bomb for you.

88
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,440
He can explode at anytime.

89
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,539
You should stay away from him.

90
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:55,999
You must know

91
00:10:56,774 --> 00:11:01,258
that it's hard for anyone to accept what happened recently.

92
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,800
Don't go back to your dream anymore.

93
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,180
Okay?

94
00:11:08,082 --> 00:11:10,466
But it's not a dream now.

95
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:18,339
You have me and Siyu.

96
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:22,139
You have to stay away from Yin Zheng.

97
00:11:24,982 --> 00:11:26,749
Before this,

98
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:31,049
I knew everyone's destiny.

99
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:34,874
But I didn't know my own destiny.

100
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,540
But now,

101
00:11:42,524 --> 00:11:44,507
I am tired.

102
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:53,882
Your destiny will be different.

103
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:58,658
Why?

104
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,249
Think about it.

105
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:05,999
I wasn't in your dream.

106
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:09,549
But I am here in your real life.

107
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,732
No matter what happens,

108
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:20,707
I will support you.

109
00:12:25,774 --> 00:12:27,307
Thank you.

110
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,540
<i>Siyu.</i>

111
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,023
<i>You've been following me for a while.</i>

112
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:57,732
<i>I didn't mean to follow you.</i>

113
00:12:57,732 --> 00:13:00,349
<i>I was just worried about Zhang Xiao.</i>

114
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,874
<i>I don't think you should worry about her.</i>

115
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:05,249
<i>Just let me handle it.</i>

116
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:07,732
<i>Zhang Xiao isn't an actress on tabloids.</i>

117
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:09,691
<i>She's not Lan Lan's replacement.</i>

118
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:12,582
<i>She's been through a lot.</i>

119
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:15,415
<i>I don't want you to hurt her.</i>

120
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,940
<i>How can you be so sure that I will hurt her?</i>

121
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,891
<i>Do you really think I'm such a bad guy?</i>

122
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:40,424
Xiaoxiao, I'm going to work now.

123
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:42,520
Do you want me to call in sick for you?

124
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,332
Wait for me.

125
00:13:45,332 --> 00:13:46,982
I'll go with you.

126
00:13:46,982 --> 00:13:48,340
Okay.

127
00:13:54,982 --> 00:13:59,290
<i>Yin Zheng, I don't care who you are.</i>

128
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:03,499
<i>I want to know the truth about the photos.</i>

129
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:09,082
Hurry up.

130
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,566
Coming.

131
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:28,716
If my photos caused someone to die,

132
00:14:28,716 --> 00:14:31,257
and led Zhen Tian Group into a crisis,

133
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:33,165
I would have no courage to be here.

134
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:36,290
I would've found a hole to hide inside of.

135
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,374
Jack.

136
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:39,440
You don't need to be so mean.

137
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,065
Zhang Xiao has nothing to do with it.

138
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:44,232
Who gave you permission to talk?

139
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,232
I am here

140
00:14:49,232 --> 00:14:53,899
because I'm investigating this matter.

141
00:14:56,566 --> 00:14:58,332
Thank you for your coffee.

142
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:02,399
Thank you.

143
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,424
I forgot to tell you.

144
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:11,307
I actually prefer lattes.

145
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,940
Sir.

146
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,858
I need to go to the Red Lotus Biochemical Plant.

147
00:15:23,858 --> 00:15:26,123
This is the place.

148
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:28,065
Is this 258 Danxia Road?

149
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:29,649
Yes.

150
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,340
Here is your money.

151
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,765
Thank you.

152
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:39,340
See you.

153
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,591
How much money did Wang Tiecheng pocket?

154
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,015
How can he give our business to this kind of manufacturer?

155
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:02,840
Mr. Kang, you got here so quickly.

156
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,482
Drink some water.

157
00:16:04,482 --> 00:16:06,023
No thanks.

158
00:16:06,023 --> 00:16:07,732
Let's get straight to the point.

159
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:09,149
You have two choices now.

160
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:11,457
One, give us the products now.

161
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:15,324
Two, return our deposit.

162
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:19,123
Mr. Kang, our factory might be small,

163
00:16:19,123 --> 00:16:20,732
but we have everything you need.

164
00:16:20,732 --> 00:16:23,482
We finished your goods a while ago.

165
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,666
Fine, let's go check it out now.

166
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,939
No, what's the rush?

167
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:28,165
You've come so far.

168
00:16:28,165 --> 00:16:29,816
I should treat you to a meal.

169
00:16:29,816 --> 00:16:31,899
Let's go have a meal first.

170
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:34,340
Then you can come back to check it out.

171
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,232
No need.

172
00:16:35,232 --> 00:16:37,274
There is a restaurant nearby.

173
00:16:37,274 --> 00:16:39,649
The boss is from Beijing.

174
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:41,457
People call her cold beauty.

175
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:43,939
She is very pretty.

176
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:47,107
She cooks very well too.

177
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,023
You must go and give it a try.

178
00:16:49,023 --> 00:16:50,165
Yes, Mr. Kang.

179
00:16:50,165 --> 00:16:52,190
It's lunch time.

180
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,290
What are you waiting for?

181
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,858
Take his bag now.

182
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:55,940
Yes.

183
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,716
Don't worry.

184
00:16:56,716 --> 00:17:00,082
If Mr. Kang can't get a meal in, you're the one to blame.

185
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:02,507
I will cut your salary.

186
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,507
Come in.

187
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,566
I've cooked the medicine for you.

188
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:24,915
Should I apply it for you?

189
00:17:28,182 --> 00:17:30,566
No thanks, I can do it myself.

190
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:31,874
Okay.

191
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:04,149
This way, Mr. Kang.

192
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:06,999
Come.

193
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,190
This way.

194
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,965
Director Kang, this way.

195
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,482
Heaven is on my side.

196
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:29,132
I didn't think that you'd come to my turf.

197
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:35,423
It seems we're going to make some money.

198
00:18:47,023 --> 00:18:48,007
What?

199
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:49,940
Baby, what are you busy with?

200
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,982
Listen.

201
00:18:50,982 --> 00:18:52,023
Others might not understand me,

202
00:18:52,023 --> 00:18:53,190
but you should know me.

203
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,357
I'm in need of money.

204
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:56,632
A rich man is here.

205
00:18:56,632 --> 00:18:58,123
I'm going to kidnap him.

206
00:18:58,123 --> 00:19:00,023
He's here at your place.

207
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:02,315
Think about how to get him in your bed.

208
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:06,266
Once he's in your room, I'll make a move.

209
00:19:07,107 --> 00:19:10,939
I'm very busy.

210
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:13,458
You're on your own.

211
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,958
Xiao Ma.

212
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:19,982
You can't let me think that I can't control you.

213
00:19:19,982 --> 00:19:21,958
Understand?

214
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,507
Mr. Kang, cheers.

215
00:19:50,507 --> 00:19:51,524
Bottoms up.

216
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,082
- Mr. Kang.
- Bottoms up.

217
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:54,274
These are our rules.

218
00:19:54,274 --> 00:19:55,916
You have to drink it all.

219
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:00,274
Fill it up.

220
00:20:00,274 --> 00:20:01,649
Boss.

221
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:02,816
Welcome.

222
00:20:02,816 --> 00:20:05,190
This is the client I brought from Beijing.

223
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,057
Do you have any specialties?

224
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,174
Mr. Kang, cheers.

225
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:17,524
Boss.

226
00:20:17,524 --> 00:20:20,249
Are you not feeling well?

227
00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:21,315
Come, drink.

228
00:20:21,315 --> 00:20:23,182
No.

229
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:25,466
I'll get you some menus.

230
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:27,166
Hurry up.

231
00:20:30,165 --> 00:20:31,457
Here.

232
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:35,466
Mr. Kang, let's drink.

233
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:37,691
Our rules here are to drink it in one go.

234
00:20:37,691 --> 00:20:38,832
You didn't finish your last glass.

235
00:20:38,832 --> 00:20:41,523
You have to finish this one.

236
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,899
Listen, everyone.

237
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:46,566
Emergency notice.

238
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:47,958
Due to unforeseen circumstances,

239
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,758
all our advertising plans are put to a stop.

240
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:02,390
Xiaoxiao.

241
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:05,465
Did you hear?

242
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,816
After what happened at the wedding,

243
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:12,065
the company's share price has been dropping since this morning.

244
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:15,691
We might even go bankrupt soon.

245
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,707
All the managers are in a meeting now.

246
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:20,257
They're discussing how to handle this matter.

247
00:21:26,107 --> 00:21:27,374
Xiaoxiao.

248
00:21:27,374 --> 00:21:33,039
Let's go somewhere else.

249
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,716
I'm going to the bathroom.

250
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:43,707
Because of our financial problems,

251
00:21:43,707 --> 00:21:47,524
we have to sell a good amount of shares for cash.

252
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:49,691
But here's the weird thing.

253
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:52,816
There's an account that keeps buying our shares as we sell.

254
00:21:52,816 --> 00:21:57,149
If this continues, he will soon be in control of Zhen Tian Group.

255
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,932
Really?

256
00:21:58,932 --> 00:22:01,649
I sent someone to investigate.

257
00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:04,939
The company is called Revenge.

258
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:06,999
It's registered in Thailand.

259
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:09,482
The registered name was Wu Ren.

260
00:22:09,482 --> 00:22:10,791
Chairman.

261
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,332
It sounds like a fake name.

262
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,123
We have to find someone to investigate it.

263
00:22:16,123 --> 00:22:18,940
I think Yin Zheng is suitable.

264
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,939
I don't think so.

265
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,839
The logistics department isn't in charge of this.

266
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,374
Chairman.

267
00:22:26,374 --> 00:22:28,440
Sihan will be back soon.

268
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,374
You should pass this onto him.

269
00:22:31,374 --> 00:22:32,999
Compared to Supervisor Yin,

270
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:35,774
Sihan is more reliable.

271
00:22:35,774 --> 00:22:37,499
He's also more trustworthy.

272
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:40,507
Sihan won't be back for a while.

273
00:22:41,524 --> 00:22:45,249
It seems that you don't wish for him to come back.

274
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:47,274
What do you mean?

275
00:22:47,274 --> 00:22:49,791
I'm just saying that Yin Zheng has been doing very well recently.

276
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:53,065
We should give him a chance.

277
00:22:53,065 --> 00:22:56,090
I think he'll do a good job with this.

278
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,566
But of course,

279
00:22:58,566 --> 00:23:01,574
you should make the decision.

280
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:04,991
Secretary Hou.

281
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:08,307
Ask Supervisor Yin to come up.

282
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:13,582
The company my Second Uncle is controlling

283
00:23:13,582 --> 00:23:16,182
is buying Zhen Tian Group's shares in bulk.

284
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:22,816
If the old man finds out the company is registered in Thailand,

285
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:24,839
he will think about my Second Uncle

286
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:27,090
and then suspect me.

287
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:29,332
I should tell you this.

288
00:23:29,332 --> 00:23:31,023
Your Second Uncle is rushing things.

289
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:33,082
He doesn't care about you.

290
00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:40,391
Secretary Hou.

291
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,232
I'm just a supervisor.

292
00:23:44,232 --> 00:23:47,215
I don't think you need me at your meeting.

293
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:50,982
Chairman asked for me?

294
00:23:51,939 --> 00:23:54,432
Okay, I'll be right there.

295
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:58,065
Already?

296
00:23:59,582 --> 00:24:01,039
Don't worry.

297
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,823
I have a plan.

298
00:24:21,065 --> 00:24:22,357
Mr. Kang, are you done?

299
00:24:22,357 --> 00:24:23,274
Do you want to go to another restaurant?

300
00:24:23,274 --> 00:24:25,649
No, let's just finish and go.

301
00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:29,115
What's the rush? Have some more food.

302
00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:31,524
Mr. Kang, drink some more.

303
00:24:31,524 --> 00:24:33,199
I'll fill up your glass.

304
00:24:33,732 --> 00:24:37,232
Have you seen this guy before?

305
00:24:37,232 --> 00:24:39,440
He's a rich man.

306
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,432
He's the vice president of Zhen Tian Group.

307
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,632
They are indeed rich.

308
00:24:45,632 --> 00:24:47,650
But they're also difficult.

309
00:24:48,157 --> 00:24:51,691
You all have records.

310
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:55,149
Who's going to help us if anything happens?

311
00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:56,566
Baby.

312
00:24:56,566 --> 00:24:59,107
Are you teaching me a lesson?

313
00:24:59,107 --> 00:25:01,357
Just do what I asked you to do.

314
00:25:01,357 --> 00:25:04,274
Here, cheers.

315
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:08,274
Fill it up.

316
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:09,974
Here, Mr. Kang.

317
00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:13,460
Hello?

318
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,810
Sihan, how's it going?

319
00:25:16,939 --> 00:25:19,232
There's some problems, but I will handle it.

320
00:25:19,232 --> 00:25:21,082
Good.

321
00:25:21,082 --> 00:25:23,791
It's not looking good for the company right now.

322
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:25,940
I hope you can come back soon.

323
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,399
I need you to help with a lot of things.

324
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:32,074
Okay, I'll head back as soon as I handle things here.

325
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,399
Come.

326
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:37,249
Let's drink another.

327
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:40,216
This is for you.

328
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,107
- Here.
- Boss.

329
00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:45,023
How's the food?

330
00:25:45,023 --> 00:25:46,716
Great.

331
00:25:48,332 --> 00:25:51,249
You're from Beijing?

332
00:25:53,524 --> 00:25:57,340
You're not familiar with the places around here.

333
00:25:57,899 --> 00:26:01,315
You shouldn't go to the outskirts alone.

334
00:26:01,315 --> 00:26:03,007
It's dangerous.

335
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:07,632
Mr. Kang is our client.

336
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,340
I wouldn't let him go to the outskirts alone.

337
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,458
We have to treat him well during his visit at our factory,

338
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,990
and then send him back to Beijing safely.

339
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:18,465
Boss.

340
00:26:18,465 --> 00:26:22,665
You never cared about a customer so much before.

341
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,499
You're both from Beijing.

342
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:29,790
Do you know him?

343
00:26:30,415 --> 00:26:33,232
Stop messing around.

344
00:26:33,232 --> 00:26:37,282
How can someone like me know a rich man like him?

345
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:41,674
Please enjoy.

346
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:50,707
Mr. Kang.

347
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:52,566
You didn't finish your last glass.

348
00:26:52,566 --> 00:26:54,839
Our rules are to finish the drink in one go.

349
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,674
You have to finish this one.

350
00:26:56,674 --> 00:26:58,290
Drink.

351
00:27:00,023 --> 00:27:02,107
Uncle Wang, Uncle Liu.

352
00:27:02,107 --> 00:27:03,549
Zheng'er.

353
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:06,999
Chairman.

354
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:08,199
Have a seat.

355
00:27:13,374 --> 00:27:16,032
I just discussed this with them.

356
00:27:16,032 --> 00:27:19,549
There's a company called Revenge.

357
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:22,474
They keep buying our shares.

358
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:27,223
This company is registered in Thailand.

359
00:27:27,223 --> 00:27:29,640
What are your thoughts about this?

360
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:36,249
Second Uncle's company is registered in Thailand.

361
00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:37,624
How about this?

362
00:27:37,624 --> 00:27:40,899
I'll have Second Uncle find out more about this company.

363
00:27:42,732 --> 00:27:44,707
I forgot about that.

364
00:27:44,707 --> 00:27:48,057
We can ask Chenggui.

365
00:27:50,374 --> 00:27:51,723
Okay.

366
00:27:51,723 --> 00:27:54,874
I'll put you in charge of this.

367
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:56,123
Okay.

368
00:27:58,582 --> 00:28:00,524
<i>Nothing.</i>

369
00:28:00,524 --> 00:28:02,816
<i>I'm actually quite happy about that.</i>

370
00:28:02,816 --> 00:28:06,049
<i>Seems like I was wrong about him.</i>

371
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,107
<i>If I can't find anything on the computer,</i>

372
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,457
<i>I should stop my mind from wandering.</i>

373
00:28:42,582 --> 00:28:46,923
Zhen Tian Group's firewall is so weak.

374
00:28:49,082 --> 00:28:51,749
Perfect timing.

375
00:28:51,749 --> 00:28:53,632
What are you so happy about?

376
00:28:55,749 --> 00:28:57,440
You hacked Zhen Tian?

377
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,040
How cool.

378
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:02,165
Big Brother has been onto Zhang Xiao.

379
00:29:02,165 --> 00:29:03,707
For the sake of Zhang Xiao's safety,

380
00:29:03,707 --> 00:29:06,916
I should check his motive.

381
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:10,249
Being in love really makes you a busybody.

382
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,582
Let me ask you.

383
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:13,165
If you were to set a password,

384
00:29:13,165 --> 00:29:14,274
what password would you use?

385
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:20,965
K-A-N-G-S-I-Y-U.

386
00:29:21,832 --> 00:29:23,774
What a lousy password.

387
00:29:23,774 --> 00:29:26,057
The pinyin for Kang Siyu.

388
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:34,339
But recently I've been wanting to change it to H-U-A-N-G-L-I.

389
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:36,790
Because I think

390
00:29:37,457 --> 00:29:39,690
he's cuter than a busybody.

391
00:29:41,482 --> 00:29:43,199
Busybody.

392
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,682
Please come in.

393
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,816
Have a seat.

394
00:29:47,816 --> 00:29:48,749
No need.

395
00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:50,990
Let's go check the goods.

396
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:52,965
No problem.

397
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:55,082
But according to the procedures,

398
00:29:55,082 --> 00:29:58,349
you have to show the contract.

399
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,974
Done deal.

400
00:30:15,582 --> 00:30:18,257
What? You don't have a contract?

401
00:30:18,257 --> 00:30:23,165
How can I trust you then?

402
00:30:23,165 --> 00:30:25,123
How can you do such a thing?

403
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,039
Mr. Kang, you better watch your words.

404
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,107
We're a legal company who follows the rules.

405
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:31,582
Watch your words.

406
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:34,482
If you don't have the contract,

407
00:30:34,482 --> 00:30:36,716
then you should go back now.

408
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:41,332
Do you think you can just steal the contract and this would be over?

409
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:45,082
Wang Tiecheng gave our business to your small company.

410
00:30:45,082 --> 00:30:48,040
If we were to investigate, there's evidence of illegal activity everywhere.

411
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,607
Then you should go gather some evidence.

412
00:30:51,607 --> 00:30:53,250
Then we can talk.

413
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,560
See you.

414
00:31:19,774 --> 00:31:22,290
Are you going to Lancheng?

415
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,107
Hurry up.

416
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:26,607
Are you going to Lancheng?

417
00:31:26,607 --> 00:31:27,540
Yes.

418
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,416
Hurry up.

419
00:31:33,882 --> 00:31:35,499
Come. Going to Lancheng.

420
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:37,149
Sit here.

421
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:50,207
Hi.

422
00:31:51,415 --> 00:31:53,040
Move.

423
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,190
What are you doing?

424
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,007
Don't move.

425
00:31:55,007 --> 00:31:56,816
What are you doing?

426
00:31:56,816 --> 00:31:58,590
What are you trying to do?

427
00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:17,507
What are you doing here?

428
00:32:17,507 --> 00:32:19,732
We happen to need a chef.

429
00:32:19,732 --> 00:32:20,440
Get in the car.

430
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,049
Come on.

431
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:24,390
Get in.

432
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,582
Go.

433
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,400
<i>[Meng Xinyi Personality Analysis Report]</i>

434
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:16,491
Why is his desktop background magnolia flowers?

435
00:33:48,123 --> 00:33:49,807
What are you looking for?

436
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:53,591
I want to talk to you.

437
00:34:03,265 --> 00:34:05,039
Your clothes have been washed.

438
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,939
I wanted to take them to you,

439
00:34:06,939 --> 00:34:07,899
but you're here.

440
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:09,723
I want to talk to you.

441
00:34:12,499 --> 00:34:14,374
You unlocked my computer.

442
00:34:14,374 --> 00:34:15,632
Yes.

443
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:22,666
I didn't switch the photos at the wedding.

444
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:25,090
Then what's the wedding candy about?

445
00:34:26,374 --> 00:34:29,691
Do you have to know everything?

446
00:34:29,691 --> 00:34:32,324
I have to know about this.

447
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:36,307
Fine.

448
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:39,415
I swear to you with my father name.

449
00:34:39,415 --> 00:34:41,690
I didn't do it.

450
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:48,849
Are you hiding something?

451
00:34:50,058 --> 00:34:51,432
It already happened.

452
00:34:51,432 --> 00:34:53,524
You knowing won't change anything.

453
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,332
Just give me an explanation.

454
00:34:56,607 --> 00:34:58,382
Is it really that hard for you?

455
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,207
Fine.

456
00:35:05,207 --> 00:35:07,558
I'll give you an explanation.

457
00:35:08,832 --> 00:35:12,016
Someone is marrying into Zhen Tian Group.

458
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:15,165
It's normal for us to investigate the bride's background.

459
00:35:15,165 --> 00:35:17,932
The board of directors authorized it.

460
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:20,632
You can ask if you don't believe me.

461
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,907
As for the message about the wedding candy,

462
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,916
Sihan's wedding was rushed.

463
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:32,999
He also wanted to have the ceremony on Valentine's Day at a high-class restaurant.

464
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:35,791
What other choice did I have

465
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:37,499
aside from bribing the employees at the wedding company?

466
00:35:39,415 --> 00:35:43,374
But now the employee is getting punished because of this.

467
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,499
He called me

468
00:35:45,499 --> 00:35:48,074
and wants some more money.

469
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,582
Are you satisfied with this answer?

470
00:35:53,374 --> 00:35:56,607
If you still think I'm involved in this,

471
00:35:56,607 --> 00:35:58,639
you can call the police.

472
00:36:11,474 --> 00:36:13,340
Okay.

473
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,939
Director Yin.

474
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:28,749
I contacted the employee at the wedding company.

475
00:36:28,749 --> 00:36:30,874
We couldn't come to an agreement.

476
00:36:30,874 --> 00:36:33,165
He might just be a little punk,

477
00:36:33,165 --> 00:36:34,691
but he's so greedy.

478
00:36:34,691 --> 00:36:36,882
He wanted two million.

479
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:44,799
Just now a girl asked me who switched the photos at the wedding.

480
00:36:46,557 --> 00:36:49,599
Although I didn't do it,

481
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,932
I also didn't tell her I know what happened.

482
00:36:56,515 --> 00:37:00,657
I think my life is filled with lies.

483
00:37:02,874 --> 00:37:06,223
You mean Zhang Xiao?

484
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,166
Is there anything else?

485
00:37:19,332 --> 00:37:21,624
Regarding the investigation on Revenge,

486
00:37:21,624 --> 00:37:23,799
you should plan for it early.

487
00:37:36,457 --> 00:37:37,739
Second Uncle.

488
00:37:38,474 --> 00:37:42,707
The old man is starting to suspect the buying of the shares.

489
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:47,315
He found out the company was registered in Thailand.

490
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:49,032
Already?

491
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,791
I underestimated him.

492
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:55,123
He's going to dive deep into this matter.

493
00:37:55,123 --> 00:37:59,557
I did a lot of explaining to take on this responsibility.

494
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:02,074
But I don't know what to tell him.

495
00:38:02,974 --> 00:38:06,023
He just started suspecting and you're already scared?

496
00:38:06,023 --> 00:38:09,874
You said you'd avenge your father.

497
00:38:09,874 --> 00:38:14,382
It's just the beginning and you're already losing courage.

498
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:20,499
I just have no plan yet because it happened so suddenly.

499
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:22,557
Since he found out about Thailand,

500
00:38:22,557 --> 00:38:25,123
he will soon suspect your company.

501
00:38:25,123 --> 00:38:30,232
I now need to shift his focus in another direction.

502
00:38:30,232 --> 00:38:32,290
Let me teach you.

503
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,290
Play some tricks on him.

504
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,939
Think about how to handle this.

505
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:41,406
You mean have him shift his focus on companies within the country?

506
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:43,635
You are smart.

507
00:38:43,635 --> 00:38:49,460
I'll have someone fax you the letter of authorization.

508
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,294
Forge some domestic receipts.

509
00:38:52,294 --> 00:38:56,211
We'll be fine after we confuse Kang Zhentian for a bit.

510
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:58,643
You are experienced.

511
00:39:00,173 --> 00:39:02,960
Try to hold out a few more days.

512
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,443
I'm planning something big.

513
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,877
A big move will defeat him.

514
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:10,569
It'll be easy.

515
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,860
We won't need to watch out for him anymore.

516
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,916
What is your plan?

517
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:20,691
Don't ask.

518
00:39:21,432 --> 00:39:24,248
It'll be a surprise.

519
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,420
Give the employee whatever he wants.

520
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,332
But you have to alert.

521
00:39:34,332 --> 00:39:36,694
We'll receive a fax from Thailand soon.

522
00:39:36,694 --> 00:39:39,140
It's a letter of authorization.

523
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,658
Send the money from that account once you receive it.

524
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:49,115
You're trying to shift the chairman's focus to inside the country?

525
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:52,040
Not just that.

526
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,265
I'm using that bastard to change the whole situation.

527
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,708
I crossed the line earlier.

528
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,110
Please forgive me.

529
00:40:22,675 --> 00:40:24,659
I should not have suspected you.

530
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,192
No need to apologize.

531
00:40:39,352 --> 00:40:41,752
What do I have to do for you to forgive me?

532
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,359
Tell me.

533
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,779
As long as I can do it,

534
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:48,646
I'll make it happen.

535
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:54,418
I'm hungry.

536
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,475
I want a homemade meal.

537
00:41:00,103 --> 00:41:01,769
That's it?

538
00:41:04,743 --> 00:41:08,335
Come to my house in an hour.

539
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,800
I didn't know what to buy, so I brought some red wine.

540
00:41:36,487 --> 00:41:38,420
I'm making dumplings.

541
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,730
Won't it be weird to have red wine with it?

542
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,128
I don't think it matters.

543
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:45,962
Okay then.

544
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:48,804
I am almost done. We can eat soon.

545
00:41:56,093 --> 00:41:58,408
Can I get some slippers?

546
00:41:58,408 --> 00:41:59,986
They're inside the shoe rack.

547
00:41:59,986 --> 00:42:01,587
Get some yourself.

548
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,580
I don't know which one to grab.

549
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,413
Help me get it.

550
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,582
You have to ask for even slippers?

551
00:42:18,582 --> 00:42:21,265
Can't you see I'm making dumplings?

552
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,971
You can't even fulfill such a simple request.

553
00:42:24,971 --> 00:42:27,005
Are you sure you're sorry?

554
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,542
Here's a new pair.

555
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,146
Do you need my help?

556
00:43:14,146 --> 00:43:16,188
You can't even change into slippers on your own.

557
00:43:16,188 --> 00:43:18,155
How are you going to make dumplings?

558
00:43:21,837 --> 00:43:24,504
I helped my mom when I was a kid.

559
00:43:24,504 --> 00:43:26,046
Let me help.

560
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,300
It's so ugly.

561
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,278
And you said you know how to do it?

562
00:43:47,278 --> 00:43:49,044
It's fine.

563
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:51,360
It's what I remember from my childhood.

564
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,551
Don't have such high expectations.

565
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,182
It'll break apart if you do it like that.

566
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,020
It won't.

567
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,270
Go wash your hands. I don't want your help.

568
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,550
Wait.

569
00:44:14,279 --> 00:44:15,837
You got something on your face.

570
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,660
Let me help you wipe it.
