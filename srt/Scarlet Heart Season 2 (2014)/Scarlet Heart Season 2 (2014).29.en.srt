18
00:03:41,604 --> 00:03:45,579
After getting exposed by the media after the art exhibition yesterday,

19
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:49,119
our stock price immediately dropped by half.

20
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:52,103
The decline of the company is inevitable.

21
00:03:52,103 --> 00:03:53,896
We can't turn this around.

22
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:57,729
I think we should just announce bankruptcy when Chairman gets back.

23
00:03:57,729 --> 00:03:59,296
Bankruptcy?

24
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:02,662
Madam.

25
00:04:02,662 --> 00:04:04,187
Sorry, everybody.

26
00:04:04,187 --> 00:04:05,954
Chairman is unwell today.

27
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,254
He won't be able to attend Monday's weekly meeting.

28
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:10,829
But it doesn't matter.

29
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:15,145
He asked me to discuss a very important issue with you all on his behalf.

30
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:16,729
Mom, have a seat.

31
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:18,595
Everyone, please have a seat.

32
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:26,779
Sihan was kidnapped in Ganlin.

33
00:04:28,395 --> 00:04:31,746
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of 100 million to release him.

34
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:34,395
No matter what, we must save Sihan.

35
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:37,979
Madam, are you sure it isn't a scam?

36
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,120
I talked to Sihan myself on the phone.

37
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,787
The kidnapper hung up the phone after they told me their demands.

38
00:04:43,787 --> 00:04:46,512
I couldn't reach them after calling back.

39
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:49,871
These kidnappers are too outrageous.

40
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:52,162
Not only did they kidnap, but they also demanded such an exorbitant price.

41
00:04:52,162 --> 00:04:54,103
They want so much ransom.

42
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:56,537
Not only can our company not take out the money right now,

43
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:59,412
but even if we can, we can't let them take advantage of us.

44
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:01,579
We should call the police.

45
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:04,395
No, calling the police might enrage the kidnappers.

46
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:05,996
Who's responsible for his safety then?

47
00:05:05,996 --> 00:05:08,103
The kidnappers would get their money too easily.

48
00:05:08,103 --> 00:05:09,604
If something happens to him,

49
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:12,012
who will bear the responsibility?

50
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:18,846
Yin Zheng, what are your thoughts?

51
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,729
My position at the company is too low.

52
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:27,979
I don't have a say on such an important thing.

53
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,203
This is not only related to the company, but it's also about our family.

54
00:05:32,203 --> 00:05:34,529
How can you stay out of it?

55
00:05:36,912 --> 00:05:38,520
Fine.

56
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,245
Then we should see how much money the company's departments can take out.

57
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:51,062
I have to say something.

58
00:05:51,062 --> 00:05:53,979
Chairman only has three sons.

59
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,187
If we can't save Vice President Kang,

60
00:05:57,187 --> 00:06:04,062
think about who will end up taking over Zhen Tian Group.

61
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:06,862
He knows very well.

62
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:10,254
But I want to tell this person,

63
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:12,796
don't get too excited.

64
00:06:12,796 --> 00:06:17,295
Don't forget you just took away Vice President Kang's girlfriend

65
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:21,646
in front of the media yesterday.

66
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:23,854
If Vice President Kang dies,

67
00:06:23,854 --> 00:06:28,062
the media wouldn't think that it's because Zhen Tian Group couldn't get the money.

68
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:33,020
They would think that some people refused to help

69
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,437
in order to get his seat.

70
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,019
The spluttering can kill people.

71
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:42,270
Think about it.

72
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,879
Who can sit firmly in the chairman's seat?

73
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:48,587
Weigh yourself.

74
00:06:49,896 --> 00:06:53,412
Uncle Liu, according to what you said,

75
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,704
we should give the kidnappers whatever they want then.

76
00:06:56,704 --> 00:07:00,812
Zhen Tian Group is being controlled by several kidnappers.

77
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:04,529
Do you think everyone will be satisfied with that?

78
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,537
Moreover,

79
00:07:07,537 --> 00:07:10,787
I'm just a supervisor at the company.

80
00:07:10,787 --> 00:07:14,662
The logistics department isn't worth 100 million even if I sell everything.

81
00:07:14,662 --> 00:07:18,379
I won't be blamed for not saving him.

82
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:22,871
But Sihan is my brother.

83
00:07:22,871 --> 00:07:24,979
I don't need others to tell me to do so.

84
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:27,320
I'll try my best to save him.

85
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:30,795
How do you plan on saving him?

86
00:07:32,437 --> 00:07:36,745
Let's see how much each department can give.

87
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,871
Zheng'er.

88
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:49,079
You must find a way to save Sihan.

89
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,746
I already expressed my thoughts inside.

90
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:54,287
I'm your mom.

91
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:56,495
You think I don't know you?

92
00:07:56,495 --> 00:08:00,220
You were putting up a front just now.

93
00:08:01,412 --> 00:08:03,270
Your father is in the hospital.

94
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,537
Zhen Tian Group is in distress.

95
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:08,287
Those departments are contemplating how to minimize their losses.

96
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,479
They won't take out any money.

97
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,004
You have to personally ask them for money.

98
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,871
I don't have that much power.

99
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:22,312
Zheng'er, we're not in the office.

100
00:08:22,312 --> 00:08:25,812
Don't try to brush me off.

101
00:08:26,512 --> 00:08:29,020
I just want to hear the truth.

102
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,954
Can you save Sihan?

103
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:34,270
Regardless of what kind of resentment you had in the past,

104
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,654
we're family after all.

105
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,729
So many years have passed.

106
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,695
You should let it go.

107
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:47,970
If you feel that your position is too low for you to say anything,

108
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,520
you should at least tell me what to do.

109
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:55,517
Mom, don't worry.

110
00:08:55,517 --> 00:08:57,834
I'm taking this very seriously.

111
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:02,834
But the directors aren't easy to deal with.

112
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:06,434
Asking them for money during such a difficult time for the company.

113
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:08,809
I'll find a way.

114
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:10,342
Just wait and see.

115
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,200
Good. I'm willing to believe you.

116
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,167
I hope you can do as you say.

117
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:22,542
Alright, your dad is still in the hospital.

118
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,434
I have to go over there.

119
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,910
<i>Sorry, the number you dialed is turned off.</i>

120
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,930
<i>Sorry, the number you dialed is turned off.</i>

121
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:58,450
I'm done drinking.

122
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,376
It's my treat.

123
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:05,309
Don't worry. I'm sure you'll have to keep treating me in the future.

124
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:07,767
I'm planning on selling this place and the stud farm.

125
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:10,225
I need money to save my Second Brother.

126
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:12,000
You're selling this place?

127
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:17,034
Whatever.

128
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:20,242
Have you seen Xiaoxiao?

129
00:10:20,242 --> 00:10:22,009
No, why?

130
00:10:22,684 --> 00:10:24,100
No?

131
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,167
I haven't seen her since yesterday.

132
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,325
She hasn't been home all day.

133
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:29,726
When I came back from eating noodles,

134
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:31,600
her luggage and clothes were gone.

135
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,199
Did she disappear?

136
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,283
What did you say?

137
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:36,767
Do you think it's because of what happened yesterday?

138
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:38,292
Did something happen to her?

139
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:39,851
Come on, I'll look with you.

140
00:10:39,851 --> 00:10:40,967
Wait.

141
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:42,309
She left with so many things.

142
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,375
This must be different from last time.

143
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,567
Do you know her ID card number?

144
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,475
Should we be doing that?

145
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:51,976
Why not? Just tell me.

146
00:10:51,976 --> 00:10:54,099
We're breaking the law.

147
00:10:54,099 --> 00:10:55,200
It's an emergency.

148
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,659
Come on.

149
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:17,350
She booked a train ticket to Ganlin.

150
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,410
Hello?

151
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,283
Brother, did you know that Zhang Xiao left with her luggage?

152
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,517
She left?

153
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,284
Brother, are you even her boyfriend?

154
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:28,559
Didn't you say you would take care of her?

155
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,209
She went through a lot yesterday.

156
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:31,976
Shouldn't you be spending time with her?

157
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:34,117
Why didn't you even know that she left?

158
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,792
Zhang Xiao always finds such unreliable boyfriends.

159
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:51,851
I get attacked without even doing anything.

160
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:55,559
Boss, would you go to Ganlin to save Xiaoxiao?

161
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,617
Second Brother is in trouble.

162
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:58,517
I have to save him first.

163
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,876
I have to go.

164
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,200
I just remembered something.

165
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,559
Among Xiaoxiao's ex-boyfriends,

166
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,876
although I'm not the tallest,

167
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:10,475
nor the most handsome nor the richest,

168
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:14,334
the only thing I did to Zhang Xiao was cheat on her.

169
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,617
That comforts me.

170
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,892
You really know how to console yourself.

171
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:22,834
How could I have survived for so long if I didn't?

172
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:27,734
Tell me what's making you upset.

173
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,726
I'm not.

174
00:12:31,726 --> 00:12:33,517
Don't lie to me.

175
00:12:33,517 --> 00:12:35,659
I can make a guess.

176
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:36,784
Tell you a secret.

177
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:38,575
Whenever you're upset,

178
00:12:38,575 --> 00:12:40,676
you'll put absinthe in your drink.

179
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:44,083
You sure know a lot.

180
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,959
You have to observe someone with your heart.

181
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,300
You need to experience it with your heart.

182
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,425
Am I the best boy friend among all your friends?

183
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:54,600
Of course, I'm not your boyfriend.

184
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,959
But you can try me for free.

185
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,859
Of course, the goal is for you to change your tomboy image.

Second Uncle.

206
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,851
Zheng'er, we finally succeeded.

207
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:30,018
Zhen Tian Group is at the point of no return.

208
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:34,309
I rushed back to share this news with you as soon as I heard.

209
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:38,450
Zheng'er, you can finally avenge your father.

210
00:15:40,242 --> 00:15:43,018
What's wrong?

211
00:15:43,018 --> 00:15:45,283
You don't seem to be yourself.

212
00:15:45,283 --> 00:15:46,325
It's nothing.

213
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:50,351
Is it because of the woman at the art exhibition?

214
00:15:53,992 --> 00:15:55,600
No way.

215
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,109
I said those things because I wanted Meng Yinan to hate Kang Sihan even more.

216
00:16:00,617 --> 00:16:02,475
You know me well.

217
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:04,876
When have I ever taken women seriously?

218
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:08,350
I'm overthinking it then.

219
00:16:08,992 --> 00:16:10,626
What do you want to drink?

220
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:12,125
Anything.

221
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:20,125
Cheers for our victory.

222
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,834
For our complete defeat of Zhen Tian Group.

223
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:25,942
For the future of Yin Group.

224
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:32,959
Good thing I didn't listen to you.

225
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,475
I insisted on switching out the video at the wedding.

226
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:38,209
Otherwise, we wouldn't see this victory today.

227
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:39,899
Indeed.

228
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:42,767
Not only did we strike Kang Sihan this time,

229
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:45,367
but we also hit Zhen Tian Group pretty hard.

230
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:48,809
Even Yin Feng Group, the only group that could stop us from acquiring Zhen Tian Group,

231
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,642
has now become Zhen Tian's enemy.

232
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,751
The enemy of our enemy is our friend.

233
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:55,276
Yin Feng is on our side now.

234
00:16:55,809 --> 00:16:58,742
Her daughter's death is really unfortunate.

235
00:16:58,742 --> 00:17:01,826
But it was such good timing.

236
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:24,851
Who called?

237
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:28,584
My mom.

238
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:36,418
Why aren't you picking up?

239
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:40,600
She already called many times.

240
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,275
It's about Kang Sihan's kidnapping.

241
00:17:44,142 --> 00:17:47,109
I heard about that too.

242
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:52,967
Second Uncle, I hope you can help me with this.

243
00:17:53,826 --> 00:17:55,867
I don't want Kang Sihan to die.

244
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,099
Instead, I want to save him.

245
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:03,826
Because that's the only way to gain the hearts of the people in Zhen Tian Group.

246
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:07,918
Can you help me with the ransom?

247
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:11,417
Looks like your mom has influenced your judgement.

248
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:13,851
Your mother is confused.

249
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:16,667
She married Kang Zhentian in order to survive.

250
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:17,642
I get that.

251
00:18:17,642 --> 00:18:19,642
And I didn't say much.

252
00:18:19,642 --> 00:18:21,642
But even today,

253
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,851
she's still helping the Kangs.

254
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:25,375
She...

255
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:29,100
My mom must have her own reasons for doing this.

256
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,726
Besides,

257
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:33,700
Kang Zhentian has been treating her well over the years.

258
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,434
She's a reasonable person.

259
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:37,851
She has her own stance on this.

260
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,709
Did you forget?

261
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:42,976
Kang Zhentian is your enemy who killed your father.

262
00:18:42,976 --> 00:18:48,775
Did you forget Kang Sihan is your enemy's son?

263
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:53,209
When did you heart become so soft?

264
00:18:53,209 --> 00:18:55,099
Why?

265
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:58,076
You're overthinking it, Second Uncle.

266
00:18:58,076 --> 00:19:01,726
I want to save Kang Sihan for the sake of the overall situation.

267
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:03,309
Think about it.

268
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,475
Although Zhen Tian Group is already in jeopardy,

269
00:19:06,475 --> 00:19:08,475
there are a group of subordinates

270
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:11,726
who will always be loyal to Kang Zhentian.

271
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:14,200
If we take over the company just like that,

272
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,617
even if they aren't confrontational with us,

273
00:19:16,617 --> 00:19:19,076
they'll resign and leave.

274
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:22,250
Then we'll just have have a shell company with high debt in our hands.

275
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,659
What's the point?

276
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:27,700
Everyone knows I don't get along with Kang Sihan.

277
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,726
If I can make a contribution in trying to save him,

278
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:34,842
I believe I can change the subordinates' opinions of me.

279
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,909
Second Uncle, this is a great opportunity to gain popular support.

280
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:46,467
Second Uncle, please help me.

281
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,750
<i>The number you dialed is powered off.</i>

282
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:35,492
- Hello?
- Is the money ready?

283
00:20:35,492 --> 00:20:36,892
I'll make sure I have the money.

284
00:20:36,892 --> 00:20:39,292
But don't harm even a hair on my Second Brother.

285
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:41,199
Listen.

286
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,099
If I don't see the money,

287
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:45,667
or even a penny less,

288
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:49,434
I'll even strip off his skin.

289
00:20:49,434 --> 00:20:52,475
Do you believe I'll do it?

290
00:20:52,475 --> 00:20:53,509
Listen to me.

291
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:55,142
Please give us more time.

292
00:20:55,142 --> 00:20:57,059
Our money...

293
00:20:57,617 --> 00:21:00,517
I'm the Vice President of Zhen Tian Group, Yin Zheng.

294
00:21:00,517 --> 00:21:02,309
Our group doesn't have that much money right now.

295
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:04,659
If you want to kill him, go ahead.

296
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:06,976
If you kill him, I can become the chairman.

297
00:21:06,976 --> 00:21:08,434
Thank you.

298
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,225
Understood.

299
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,351
Are you crazy?

300
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:20,326
You'll get Sihan killed!

301
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:21,100
Call him back.

302
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,834
Tell them we'll give them whatever they want.

303
00:21:22,834 --> 00:21:24,709
Mom, calm down.

304
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:27,325
Brother, are you really going to do this to him?

305
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:33,726
I managed to get 5 million this afternoon.

306
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:37,200
Then why did you say that?

307
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:40,726
I just wanted to let them know where we stand.

308
00:21:40,726 --> 00:21:43,434
I want them to compromise.

309
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:46,100
Mom, if we listen to you,

310
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,851
and give them however much they want,

311
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:51,018
Zhen Tian Group doesn't even have 100 million to give.

312
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,809
Everyone knows of the group's current situation.

313
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:58,142
Are we really going to shut down the company to save Sihan?

314
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:02,534
Since Sihan is worth so much to the kidnappers,

315
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:05,309
I'm sure they wouldn't kill him so easily.

316
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:08,892
So they'll call back to bargain.

317
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:12,934
Zheng'er, do you already have a plan?

318
00:22:12,934 --> 00:22:16,167
Siyu, when they call again,

319
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:18,442
put on a show with me.

320
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:21,142
You act as the good guy, I act as the bad guy.

321
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:22,767
There's only one purpose.

322
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:24,717
Try to reduce the ransom to as low as possible.

323
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:27,384
Then we'll actually have a chance to save Sihan.

324
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:37,100
I think you're quite miserable.

325
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,767
Really, I sympathize with you.

326
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:42,792
The first day you got here,

327
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:46,034
you were scolded and beaten by us.

328
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:53,100
But today I found out your life is even more sad.

329
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,599
You're abandoned by your family.

330
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:06,692
They're not willing to fork over the money for you.

331
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:12,826
If you become a ghost in future,

332
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:14,580
don't hate me.

333
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:21,950
Hate your ruthless brother.

334
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:24,630
Yin Zheng.

335
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,542
I'm sure it's Yin Zheng.

336
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:30,751
I will not let you get away with this!

337
00:23:55,092 --> 00:23:57,517
- Hello?
- I'll give you one last chance.

338
00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:59,383
Are you going to get me the money?

339
00:24:00,617 --> 00:24:01,809
I'll tell you again.

340
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:03,851
Zhen Tian Group doesn't have the money.

341
00:24:03,851 --> 00:24:05,575
If you want to kill him, then go ahead.

342
00:24:05,575 --> 00:24:08,826
He's not the Kang's only son.

343
00:24:08,826 --> 00:24:12,200
We won't hand over 100 million for Kang Sihan.

344
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,051
Got it.

345
00:24:14,051 --> 00:24:16,584
You mean you don't want to give me money.

346
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:20,083
You even want me to kill him now.

347
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,667
Okay.

348
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:23,450
Yin Zheng.

349
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,018
Yin Zheng.

350
00:24:27,018 --> 00:24:31,250
Even if I become a ghost, I won't let you get away with this.

351
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,709
No, listen to me.

352
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:33,959
I'm Kang Sihan's younger brother.

353
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:35,851
I'll do my best to free my Second Brother.

354
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:39,309
But you must have heard the current situation of Zhen Tian Group.

355
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:41,076
100 million is simply an astronomical figure.

356
00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:43,717
Could you give us a better offer?

357
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:47,500
You can be saved again.

358
00:24:48,784 --> 00:24:51,667
Then say how much money you can offer.

359
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:54,275
How much?

360
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,199
Ten million.

361
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,334
Fifty million.

362
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,726
Not a penny less.

363
00:25:02,726 --> 00:25:05,142
Bring it to Lancheng within three days.

364
00:25:05,142 --> 00:25:07,499
I'll contact you again.

365
00:25:11,951 --> 00:25:13,659
They want fifty million.

366
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:17,534
Then let's try to figure out how much money we can gather.

367
00:25:17,534 --> 00:25:19,250
I have around ten million.

368
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,200
I sold my bar and stud farm.

369
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,100
I should have about ten million.

370
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,700
I can come up with ten million.

371
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,984
So now we have thirty million.

372
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:31,976
That means we just need to ask the company for another twenty million.

373
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:33,976
I don't feel optimistic.

374
00:25:33,976 --> 00:25:36,667
I'll attend the board meeting personally tomorrow.

375
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:39,684
See whether I can ask them for twenty million.

376
00:25:39,684 --> 00:25:41,325
- Zhentian.
- Dad.

377
00:25:41,325 --> 00:25:42,267
You heard it all.

378
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:45,059
Why would you hide this from me?

379
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,183
Zhentian, Sihan's situation is important,

380
00:25:47,183 --> 00:25:48,742
but your health is also important.

381
00:25:48,742 --> 00:25:50,976
Let the kids handle this.

382
00:25:50,976 --> 00:25:52,199
You should take care of yourself.

383
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:53,542
Just wait for Sihan to come back.

384
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:57,367
I already abandoned him once when I sent him abroad.

385
00:25:57,367 --> 00:25:59,292
I can't abandon him again.

386
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:05,167
Zheng'er, thank you.

387
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:08,242
Yes, in order to save Sihan,

388
00:26:08,242 --> 00:26:10,392
Zheng'er is working hard.

389
00:26:10,392 --> 00:26:12,042
I'll try my best.

390
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,851
Brother, are we still beating him?

391
00:26:17,851 --> 00:26:19,267
We can't.

392
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:20,867
Why not?

393
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:22,667
Do you see anyone beat the God of Wealth?

394
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:25,134
Pig brain.

395
00:26:30,242 --> 00:26:32,059
I gave you a 50% discount.

396
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,609
Cool right?

397
00:26:37,826 --> 00:26:39,225
God of Wealth.

398
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:41,583
Wake up.

399
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:43,475
Playing dead?

400
00:26:43,475 --> 00:26:45,417
You still have that energy? Beat him.

401
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:46,209
Beat him!

402
00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:48,199
No.

403
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:52,099
He fainted.

404
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:56,425
He might not even survive the night.

405
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:11,200
Why would you say that?

406
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,417
What do you mean he won't survive the night?

407
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:14,792
I haven't gotten a penny from him.

408
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:17,242
What do you mean he won't survive the night?

409
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,467
Treat him.

410
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:25,009
Make sure he survives until...

411
00:27:28,118 --> 00:27:30,242
Until we get the money.

412
00:27:31,976 --> 00:27:33,751
Be good.

413
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:35,734
Go, treat him.

414
00:27:37,242 --> 00:27:39,151
Treat him.

415
00:27:56,784 --> 00:27:58,192
The knife pierced too deep. I can't save him.

416
00:27:58,192 --> 00:27:59,326
Nonsense.

417
00:27:59,326 --> 00:28:01,309
You were so injured when you got here.

418
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:02,851
You've survived, right?

419
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:04,684
Why can't he be saved?

420
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:06,499
Listen.

421
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:09,642
Keep him alive for three more days.

422
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,417
Did you hear me?

423
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:14,267
Did you hear?

424
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:26,475
Come on, put the God of Wealth down.

425
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:28,951
Step aside.

426
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:26,380
<i>Am I dead?</i>

427
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,650
<i>Where am I?</i>

428
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:32,100
Wake up.

429
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:36,025
Wake up. Don't go to sleep.

430
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:46,183
Xiaoxiao, you're here.

431
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:51,100
Why are you here?

432
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:02,392
Wake up.

433
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:04,542
Please don't fall asleep.

434
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:06,484
You can't fall asleep.

435
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:09,125
You can't fall asleep.

436
00:30:16,142 --> 00:30:18,475
It's you.

437
00:30:18,475 --> 00:30:20,834
You'll be fine.

438
00:30:29,726 --> 00:30:31,834
Thank you.

439
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:37,299
Thank you.

440
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,475
Wake up.

441
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:49,342
You can't fall asleep.

442
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:55,076
Don't sleep.

443
00:30:55,076 --> 00:30:59,584
Wake up. You can't fall asleep.

444
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,634
Throw him down.

445
00:32:27,475 --> 00:32:29,717
Brother.

446
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:32,851
I didn't see any of your money,

447
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:34,934
but now I'm offering you money.

448
00:32:34,934 --> 00:32:36,492
What does that mean?

449
00:32:36,492 --> 00:32:38,183
It mean I'm a good person.

450
00:32:38,183 --> 00:32:41,092
I'm doing a great job.

451
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:45,292
Take it.

452
00:32:57,267 --> 00:33:02,851
Go.

453
00:33:06,176 --> 00:33:07,609
Let's go.

454
00:33:24,434 --> 00:33:27,209
Chairman, are you feeling better?

455
00:33:27,209 --> 00:33:27,959
I'm fine.

456
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:29,726
Come have a seat.

457
00:33:29,726 --> 00:33:31,734
Come, here.

458
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,590
Have a seat, Madam.

459
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,910
Have a seat.

460
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,242
Aren't you the chef from the canteen?

461
00:33:42,242 --> 00:33:44,350
Can't you see we're in a meeting?

462
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:47,167
Get out.

463
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:49,534
Let me introduce you.

464
00:33:49,534 --> 00:33:51,267
He's my youngest son.

465
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:53,018
Kang Siyu.

466
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:57,434
Since he's never been involved in company affairs,

467
00:33:57,434 --> 00:34:00,200
you all might not know him.

468
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,826
But this matter is serious.

469
00:34:02,826 --> 00:34:05,718
So I asked him to help.

470
00:34:07,283 --> 00:34:08,809
So he's one of us.

471
00:34:08,809 --> 00:34:10,417
I'm sorry.

472
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:13,375
It's okay. I'm just here to help.

473
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:15,267
That's great.

474
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:17,292
Please have a seat.

475
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,118
We all know Sihan went to Ganlin on a business trip.

476
00:34:26,118 --> 00:34:28,459
He unfortunately got kidnapped.

477
00:34:28,459 --> 00:34:33,267
Since Yin Zheng needs to stay here to help me with the company affairs,

478
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:38,700
my youngest son, Siyu,

479
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,459
will handle the delivery and negotiation of the ransom.

480
00:34:43,018 --> 00:34:47,000
Director Kang, I'm the last person Vice President Kang had contact with.

481
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,309
Let me go with Siyu to Ganlin.

482
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:53,018
If we get badgered by kidnappers,

483
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:54,751
we can take care of each other.

484
00:34:54,751 --> 00:34:56,934
That sounds good.

485
00:34:56,934 --> 00:35:02,409
The most important thing for us now is to discuss the problem of the ransom.

486
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,475
Second Uncle.

487
00:35:17,475 --> 00:35:20,484
Did you know that Kang Zhentian was awake?

488
00:35:21,909 --> 00:35:22,642
Yes.

489
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:24,918
Why didn't you tell me?

490
00:35:24,918 --> 00:35:28,475
If Kang Zhentian asks for the money to save Kang Sihan,

491
00:35:28,475 --> 00:35:31,409
how can you gain popular support then?

492
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:34,742
I also didn't expect for him to wake up at this time.

493
00:35:34,742 --> 00:35:36,283
Now that he's awake,

494
00:35:36,283 --> 00:35:37,542
what's your plan now?

495
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:41,242
We need to forget about gaining popular support.

496
00:35:41,242 --> 00:35:46,809
I'm immediately announcing that Zhen Tian Group now belongs to me.

497
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:51,183
We'll see how Kang Zhentian can tamper with company money now.

498
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:06,534
Director Kang, I checked our accounts yesterday.

499
00:36:06,534 --> 00:36:10,125
The sales department can cut down part of its budget.

500
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:13,100
We can contribute to the ransom for Vice President Kang.

501
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,076
That would be great.

502
00:36:15,076 --> 00:36:17,517
Thanks, Brother.

503
00:36:17,517 --> 00:36:18,976
Chairman Kang.

504
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,784
I watched Sihan grow up.

505
00:36:21,784 --> 00:36:26,042
Whenever I think about the kidnappers hanging and beating him,

506
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:28,125
I feel...

507
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:30,626
I feel pain.

508
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:32,983
How would you know my brother was hung and beaten?

509
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:34,292
I...

510
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:42,500
That's how it always is in TV shows.

511
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,434
Enough.

512
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:48,075
Siyu, go back and prepare.

513
00:36:49,283 --> 00:36:53,034
Let me handle getting the ransom.

514
00:36:53,034 --> 00:36:54,375
Got it.

515
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,200
Listen carefully.

516
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,334
Report it now.

517
00:37:13,334 --> 00:37:15,909
With the twenty million from the sales department,

518
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:18,250
we're almost there.

519
00:37:21,018 --> 00:37:25,042
Who dares to use the company's money without my permission?

520
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:29,534
Surprise.

521
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:32,459
You all should...

522
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,918
You should have at least some kind of reaction.

523
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,459
Chenggui, what is the meaning of this?

524
00:37:37,459 --> 00:37:38,559
Yin Chenggui.

525
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,600
I was going to look for you.

526
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,592
I can't believe you came here yourself.

527
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,459
Brother Kang.

528
00:37:46,976 --> 00:37:49,417
Why aren't you surprised?

529
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:52,751
I wanted to see a surprised look on your face

530
00:37:52,751 --> 00:37:55,242
after seeing the unchanged expression on your face for many years.

531
00:37:56,867 --> 00:38:01,018
Did Meng Yinan tell you in advance?

532
00:38:01,018 --> 00:38:04,992
That woman really can't hide a secret.

533
00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:11,783
I specifically prepared this surprise for you.

534
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,675
It's unfortunate I can't enjoy.

535
00:38:18,784 --> 00:38:22,483
I was wondering when you would come for a showdown.

536
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:26,659
You switched the photos at the wedding ceremony.

537
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:30,225
You also planned Xinyi's art exhibition.

538
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:33,600
You're the real boss of Revenge Company.

539
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:37,584
You purposely attacked Zhen Tian Group,

540
00:38:37,584 --> 00:38:40,834
to let the share price drop and take the opportunity to acquire it.

541
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:44,667
Now you're here to flaunt your powers, right?

542
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:50,542
Brother Kang, you're really experienced.

543
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:53,042
But your realization is slower than my actions.

544
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:55,559
You're still a step behind me.

545
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:57,242
Business is like war.

546
00:38:57,242 --> 00:38:59,450
One step can cause a big difference.

547
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,892
Everyone, listen carefully.

548
00:39:01,892 --> 00:39:06,192
I, Yin Chenggui, am the one who holds 80% of Zhen Tian Group.

549
00:39:06,192 --> 00:39:09,375
The legal representative of Revenge Group.

550
00:39:11,325 --> 00:39:13,099
In other words,

551
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:15,742
I'm the largest shareholder of this company.

552
00:39:15,742 --> 00:39:16,976
Without my signature,

553
00:39:16,976 --> 00:39:20,209
no one can use the company's funds to save Kang Sihan.

554
00:39:20,209 --> 00:39:23,400
Yin Chenggui, you crossed the line.

555
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:25,350
Zhentian and I treat you well.

556
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,167
Why are you so ungrateful?

557
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:28,726
Not only do you want to take over Zhen Tian Group,

558
00:39:28,726 --> 00:39:30,375
but you also want to kill Kang Sihan.

559
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,142
Sister-in-law.

560
00:39:32,142 --> 00:39:34,792
Do you know who you're pleading for?

561
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:37,851
Do you know who you're angry for?

562
00:39:37,851 --> 00:39:39,183
Did you forget?

563
00:39:39,183 --> 00:39:45,034
Zhen Tian Group originally belongs to your ex-husband and my brother, Yin Chengyi.

564
00:39:45,034 --> 00:39:46,892
Now it belongs to me.

565
00:39:46,892 --> 00:39:49,417
This means its been returned to its rightful owner.

566
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:52,267
You're shameless.

567
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:53,142
Zhao Lan.

568
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:54,350
I still call you Sister-in-law

569
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,367
for the sake of my brother.

570
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:58,809
If you dare to disrespect me

571
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:00,459
I'll have you leave now.

572
00:40:00,459 --> 00:40:02,900
Yin Chenggui!

573
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,459
I'm not a match for your schemes.

574
00:40:06,459 --> 00:40:08,709
I'm willing to admit defeat.

575
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:12,892
But do you think such a large company like Zhen Tian Group,

576
00:40:12,892 --> 00:40:16,760
with all its workings and rules,

577
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,450
can be taken over by an outsider who schemed his way into power?

578
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:30,784
If you're willing to save Sihan,

579
00:40:30,784 --> 00:40:32,918
I'm willing to become your subordinate.

580
00:40:32,918 --> 00:40:36,392
I'll serve you and be loyal.

581
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,876
I'm willing to be your pawn.

582
00:40:38,876 --> 00:40:40,417
I'll let you sit

583
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:43,250
on Zhen Tian Group's throne

584
00:40:43,517 --> 00:40:48,059
upright and justifiably.

585
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:51,759
Do you agree with this transaction?

586
00:40:54,142 --> 00:40:56,092
Don't forget.

587
00:40:56,867 --> 00:40:59,283
When you're weeding,

588
00:40:59,283 --> 00:41:01,183
you must dig up the roots.

589
00:41:01,183 --> 00:41:04,809
Heaven is helping me dig up the roots.

590
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:08,526
Do you think I can save Kang Sihan?

591
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,626
Zhentian.

592
00:41:11,242 --> 00:41:12,742
Zhentian.

593
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,617
Yin Chenggui, you'll get your retribution.

594
00:41:17,617 --> 00:41:21,309
Where?

595
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:23,575
Retribution is right here.

596
00:41:23,575 --> 00:41:24,709
Take a look.

597
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:27,009
Look at how angry he is.

598
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:31,500
Now I'm Zhen Tian Group's Director Yin.

599
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,500
Call me Director Yin.

600
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,350
Do it.

601
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:40,525
Call me Director Yin.

602
00:41:42,409 --> 00:41:43,400
Who is Yin Chenggui?

603
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,900
Call me Director-

604
00:41:47,434 --> 00:41:50,242
Are you the legal representative of Revenge Group, Yin Chenggui?

605
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:51,392
What's the issue?

606
00:41:51,392 --> 00:41:53,767
I'm Yin Chenggui's lawyer.

607
00:41:54,617 --> 00:41:56,976
Yin Chenggui is suspected of bodily harm.

608
00:41:56,976 --> 00:42:00,167
We're now detaining him.

609
00:42:02,851 --> 00:42:04,459
This is bodily harm to me.

610
00:42:04,459 --> 00:42:05,809
What's going on?

611
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:06,684
Don't act dumb.

612
00:42:06,684 --> 00:42:08,060
You'll know when we get to the police station.

613
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,559
Take him away.

614
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:11,092
Wait.

615
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,267
I'll go myself.

616
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,851
Heaven may be forgiven for its wrongdoings,

617
00:42:24,851 --> 00:42:27,125
but a sinning man will not survive.

618
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:28,876
He deserves it, Chairman.

619
00:42:28,876 --> 00:42:30,667
We should focus on rescuing Sihan.

620
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:34,726
Yes, we should focus on rescuing him.

621
00:42:34,726 --> 00:42:38,583
Director Yin, the police have taken Yin Chenggui.

622
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,017
Everything is according to your plan.

623
00:42:45,934 --> 00:42:48,159
<i>I followed your instructions.</i>

624
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:50,467
<i>After receiving the letter of authorization from Revenge Group,</i>

625
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:54,434
<i>I immediately sent the money to the employee of that wedding company.</i>

626
00:42:54,434 --> 00:42:55,992
<i>After he received the money,</i>

627
00:42:55,992 --> 00:42:58,851
<i>I called a gang to beat him up.</i>

628
00:42:58,851 --> 00:43:01,599
<i>The injuries are severe enough to get the attention of the police.</i>

629
00:43:05,325 --> 00:43:09,517
<i>The police tracked it down and became suspicious of the huge amount of money pretty quickly.</i>

630
00:43:09,517 --> 00:43:13,375
<i>They followed the clues to Revenge Group and Yin Chenggui.</i>

631
00:43:14,242 --> 00:43:15,709
Following your orders,

632
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:19,709
I put a fake tax receipt in Revenge Group's accounts.

633
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:23,542
If the police investigates the company because of the criminal cases,

634
00:43:23,542 --> 00:43:26,325
they'll find the fake tax receipt easily.

635
00:43:26,325 --> 00:43:28,892
If it involves economic crimes,

636
00:43:28,892 --> 00:43:32,999
Yin Chenggui wouldn't be released so easily.

637
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:36,826
Yin Chenggui kept thinking he could use you.

638
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:39,667
He never expected to fall into your trap.

639
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:42,809
He still doesn't know what's going on.

640
00:43:43,617 --> 00:43:46,951
This is all going according to your plan.

641
00:43:46,951 --> 00:43:49,200
You foretell things like a prophet.

642
00:43:52,784 --> 00:43:54,809
He might be my Second Uncle,

643
00:43:54,809 --> 00:43:59,051
But his unscrupulous behavior really makes me chill.

644
00:44:00,118 --> 00:44:02,934
If he gets control of Zhen Tian Group,

645
00:44:02,934 --> 00:44:05,600
he will drive out the old man first,

646
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,659
then me next.

647
00:44:07,659 --> 00:44:09,784
So I had to fight back.

648
00:44:09,784 --> 00:44:12,434
But I didn't think he'd be so greedy.

649
00:44:12,434 --> 00:44:14,642
He exposed himself early.

650
00:44:14,642 --> 00:44:19,967
The old man will suspect me very soon.

651
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,350
But I still have some things to clear up.

652
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:24,551
What should we do?

653
00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:30,167
Look at my drawing.

654
00:44:32,684 --> 00:44:35,718
When two tigers fight, one will surely get hurt.

655
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:39,109
The mantis preys on the cicada, unaware of the siskin behind.

656
00:44:39,784 --> 00:44:42,142
This is affection for a child.

657
00:44:42,142 --> 00:44:44,392
The old man is now eager to save his child.

658
00:44:44,392 --> 00:44:47,018
He can't tell what cards I'm holding.

659
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,100
If he goes against me now,

660
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,659
it won't benefit him at all.

661
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:56,509
So we have to try to settle everything before Kang Sihan gets back.

662
00:44:56,509 --> 00:44:59,575
We must transfer ownership of Revenge to me.

663
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:03,150
Then I'll be Zhen Tian Group's largest shareholder.
