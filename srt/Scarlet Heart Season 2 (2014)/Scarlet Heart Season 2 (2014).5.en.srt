00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,550
<i>[Scarlet Heart 2]</i>

2
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:43,010
<i>[Episode 5]</i>

3
00:01:55,486 --> 00:01:57,511
Thank you for dinner today.

4
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:59,110
See you tomorrow.

5
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,402
What?

6
00:02:09,402 --> 00:02:11,678
You aren't going to invite me in?

7
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,430
No.

8
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,386
I told you, you have to get to know me again.

9
00:02:19,386 --> 00:02:21,344
I'm serious.

10
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,894
I'm serious as well.

11
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,135
I just want to talk to you for a bit longer.

12
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:34,586
Is that alright?

13
00:02:36,227 --> 00:02:37,685
Yes.

14
00:02:39,652 --> 00:02:41,736
Then if we're not chatting in your room,

15
00:02:41,736 --> 00:02:43,369
where shall we go?

16
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:48,686
Here?

17
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,577
If you think it's inconvenient,

18
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:55,636
we can talk tomorrow.

19
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:00,902
Okay.

20
00:03:01,778 --> 00:03:05,078
I actually wanted to hear more about your story.

21
00:03:07,502 --> 00:03:09,611
My story?

22
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:12,010
Start from your earrings.

23
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:15,194
You didn't want to talk about it last time.

24
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,386
What about today?

25
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,352
One of my aunts gave it to me.

26
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:29,052
She passed away.

27
00:03:33,027 --> 00:03:34,344
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:36,010
It's okay.

29
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,510
I would've told you sooner or later.

30
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,560
What do you wish to know?

31
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,435
I'll tell you everything.

32
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:52,100
But I hope

33
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:55,252
you can give me some time and space.

34
00:03:57,277 --> 00:04:01,159
I'm not used to telling people about me.

35
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,152
I hope you can slowly get to know me.

36
00:04:06,152 --> 00:04:08,252
And appreciate me.

37
00:04:08,252 --> 00:04:10,359
Just like magnolias.

38
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,359
The longer you look, the more beautiful.

39
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,969
The more you smell, the more fragrant.

40
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:27,160
You know,

41
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:32,359
I think maybe you are the one I've been waiting for.

42
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:35,611
What do you mean?

43
00:04:35,611 --> 00:04:37,569
Over the years,

44
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,202
I often have the same dream.

45
00:04:42,778 --> 00:04:45,319
I dream of a woman.

46
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,319
But I can never see her face clearly.

47
00:04:51,127 --> 00:04:53,994
I just know that she has a magnolia with her.

48
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:58,343
I understand now.

49
00:05:01,686 --> 00:05:04,544
Maybe you're the one I've been waiting for.

50
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:13,486
You don't have to believe me.

51
00:05:13,486 --> 00:05:15,427
It's okay.

52
00:05:16,277 --> 00:05:18,311
We still have a lot of time.

53
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:22,360
Good night.

54
00:05:26,377 --> 00:05:27,952
Also,

55
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,859
don't let unimportant people upset you.

56
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:32,627
I'll deal with them.

57
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:55,902
<i>Why do I have this photo?</i>

58
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,743
<i>Did I take this?</i>

59
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:02,419
<i>It looks like a jade ring.</i>

60
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,527
<i>What does the text say?</i>

61
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,886
<i>Did my brain get fried?</i>

62
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,569
<i>Why did I grab his hand?</i>

63
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:22,727
<i>What's going on with me?</i>

64
00:06:27,302 --> 00:06:29,052
Stop thinking about it.

65
00:06:29,052 --> 00:06:34,227
I must've hit my head a bit too hard to have such abnormal behavior.

66
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,469
Give me one.

67
00:06:44,294 --> 00:06:46,235
You have a good appetite.

68
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:47,736
Hurry up and eat.

69
00:06:47,736 --> 00:06:50,694
I want to talk about making changes to the poster.

70
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:52,694
Changes?

71
00:06:52,694 --> 00:06:57,169
I want you to use a real magnolia hairpin as the poster design.

72
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:00,652
Your design is good, but it's not what I want.

73
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:03,611
I want a unique sense of elegance.

74
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:06,444
Director Yin, can you explain?

75
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:09,427
What is a unique sense of elegance?

76
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:12,611
I can only give you some ideas.

77
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:15,902
It's your job to figure out how to execute, isn't it?

78
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,719
Your concept is too abstract.

79
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:20,552
I can't understand.

80
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:23,902
Zhang Xiao, is that how you should be talking to him?

81
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,360
Director Yin is right.

82
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,210
Your design is too generic.

83
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,860
So Director Yin is right to have you redo it.

84
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,444
I just don't understand his meaning of elegance.

85
00:07:32,444 --> 00:07:34,277
Did I do something wrong?

86
00:07:34,277 --> 00:07:37,235
Is it wrong for me to ask for some clarity?

87
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:39,110
Of course.

88
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,860
Director Yin is the Vice President.

89
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,652
He doesn't have the time to explain the small stuff.

90
00:07:44,652 --> 00:07:48,960
If Director Yin needs to always explain everything to clearly to everyone,

91
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,235
then what does he need you for?

92
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:56,444
Anyway, I'll give you two days.

93
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:59,659
Get me the poster at noon two days from now.

94
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:02,194
Director Yin.

95
00:08:02,194 --> 00:08:04,419
I think she should get it to you tomorrow morning.

96
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:08,152
Otherwise there won't be any time to make changes if there are any problems with the design.

97
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,759
Don't say anything.

98
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,511
Why not?

99
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:14,569
Jack, don't go too far.

100
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,194
I'm not a robot.

101
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:18,778
You have to give me more time.

102
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:21,444
If you want to be unreasonable, then I quit.

103
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:23,327
I quit now.

104
00:08:27,878 --> 00:08:29,927
You can choose to quit.

105
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:34,319
But you've already eaten half of your employee meal.

106
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:37,694
Unless you spit out the meal and keep it intact,

107
00:08:37,694 --> 00:08:40,852
you still have to finish your work for today.

108
00:08:41,627 --> 00:08:44,360
Zhen Tian Group is so successful

109
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,943
because we all follow the principles and act according to the rules.

110
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:52,002
So you better quickly finish your meal

111
00:08:52,002 --> 00:08:53,927
and hand in the poster on time.

112
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:58,069
Eat up.

113
00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:00,043
Your food's getting cold.

114
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:17,819
The chairman issued a document just now

115
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:20,569
that states that all borrowed articles must be returned within one hour.

116
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:23,252
And if anything happens during that period of time,

117
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:25,319
the lender will be held responsible.

118
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:27,652
We're not even supposed to lend out this hairpin.

119
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:30,085
Only the board directors have the power to borrow.

120
00:09:30,085 --> 00:09:33,586
But I brought it out because I saw Director Yin's signature of approval.

121
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:37,344
However, you must protect this article.

122
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:40,294
Of course, this is a repeated reminder from the chairman.

123
00:09:40,294 --> 00:09:41,652
I understand.

124
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:43,652
I'll specifically tell my colleagues.

125
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:44,611
Okay.

126
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:47,402
Please sign.

127
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:48,511
Do we both sign?

128
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:49,885
Yes.

129
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,859
Dad, where are you?

130
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:21,169
It's no wonder I couldn't get a hold of you last time.

131
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:23,344
Are you back home now?

132
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:28,319
I have something to ask you.

133
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:33,577
Do I have a sister?

134
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:37,450
No?

135
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,260
Are you sure?

136
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:43,511
It's nothing.

137
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:45,885
Take care.

138
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:48,760
I have to get back to work.

139
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:51,136
Bye.

140
00:10:57,527 --> 00:10:59,360
- Are we ready?
- Yes.

141
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,927
- Let's start.
- Come on.

142
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:04,685
Ready.

143
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:08,644
One, two.

144
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,702
What's going on?

145
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:31,411
How much time do you need?

146
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:37,377
Can we still shoot?

147
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:38,860
I'm sorry. Please wait a moment.

148
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,552
Please speed it up, thank you.

149
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:42,002
Okay.

150
00:11:55,985 --> 00:11:59,194
Zhentian, have some tea.

151
00:11:59,194 --> 00:12:00,152
Try it.

152
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,377
It's this year's new tea.

153
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:05,627
What do you think?

154
00:12:06,444 --> 00:12:07,927
It's great.

155
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,070
What?

156
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,985
Did you call the police?

157
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:19,694
I'll be right over.

158
00:12:20,444 --> 00:12:22,110
Are you going out?

159
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,302
The magnolia hairpin is gone.

160
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:26,759
Someone broke into the treasury?

161
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,627
It's just the hairpin that's lost.

162
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:30,460
Zhentian.

163
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,294
Be careful on the road.

164
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:39,778
The hairpin was gone when I turned back around.

165
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:41,360
Okay.

166
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,736
Chairman.

167
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:45,652
Why was the hairpin taken out of the treasury?

168
00:12:45,652 --> 00:12:47,169
Zhang Xiao is responsible.

169
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:49,335
We're only responsible for shooting the photos.

170
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,778
Sorry, Chairman.

171
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:53,444
I borrowed the hairpin.

172
00:12:53,444 --> 00:12:55,902
Who allowed you to borrow the hairpin?

173
00:12:56,344 --> 00:12:58,678
Director Yin didn't like my original poster design

174
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,319
and wanted me to redesign it with photos of the hairpin.

175
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:03,544
Director Yin?

176
00:13:03,544 --> 00:13:06,527
I'm sorry I made such a big mistake.

177
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:08,985
I'll take full responsibility for this matter.

178
00:13:08,985 --> 00:13:11,219
Can you afford the responsibility?

179
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:15,552
I'll try my best before I leave the company.

180
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:17,527
Leave the company?

181
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:21,359
Director Yin fired me.

182
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:23,794
Let's not talk about that for now.

183
00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:28,402
The priority is to cooperate with the police to get back the hairpin.

184
00:13:28,402 --> 00:13:30,611
Secretary Hou, tell Director Yin to come to my office.

185
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:31,994
Yes.

186
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,543
Chairman.

187
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:46,152
Tell me about the hairpin.

188
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:51,860
I feel very sorry that the hairpin was stolen.

189
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,235
I know it has special significance for you.

190
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:59,043
I've taught the person responsible a lesson and I fired her.

191
00:13:59,043 --> 00:14:01,110
To tell the truth,

192
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,210
I didn't think a photoshoot would have caused such an accident.

193
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,194
It wasn't an accident, was it?

194
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:09,985
What do you mean?

195
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:17,727
How can you still stand here with a clear conscience?

196
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:20,652
Why do you suspect me of?

197
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:24,760
You borrowed the hairpin with the excuse that the poster was unsatisfactory.

198
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:29,778
And you had someone steal it during the photoshoot to blame it on Zhang Xiao.

199
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:33,860
Zhang Xiao is a new employee,

200
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,778
and I'm the one who hired her.

201
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:43,502
Using her as scapegoat is perfect.

202
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:47,927
Please find evidence before you accuse me.

203
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,652
Chairman.

204
00:14:56,652 --> 00:14:58,427
Do you think I can trust him?

205
00:14:58,427 --> 00:15:00,802
Director Yin may go against you sometimes,

206
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:04,986
but I don't think he would act recklessly given such an important matter.

207
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,535
I don't think he would either.

208
00:15:16,152 --> 00:15:19,836
But I'm worried we underestimated his courage.

209
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:54,394
My bag!

210
00:16:07,878 --> 00:16:09,736
How unlucky.

211
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:12,869
You could've at least left me with my phone and wallet!

212
00:16:29,985 --> 00:16:31,177
Are you okay?

213
00:16:31,177 --> 00:16:34,435
Get up first.

214
00:16:35,843 --> 00:16:38,302
Do you think this is an amusement park?

215
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:41,069
It seems like you're fine.

216
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:42,460
You're pretty,

217
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,586
but your temper is so bad.

218
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,210
Do you know how to drive?

219
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,152
We're on the streets.

220
00:16:48,152 --> 00:16:49,960
Yes, we're on the streets.

221
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,544
Why are you squatting here? Using the toilet?

222
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,985
Do you think I want to squat here?

223
00:16:54,985 --> 00:16:57,659
You think I want to bump into you?

224
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,043
I'm so unlucky.

225
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,302
I'll take you to the hospital.

226
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:07,669
Then get a cab.

227
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,778
Why?

228
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,094
Just get on my bike.

229
00:17:12,094 --> 00:17:13,502
What about my bike?

230
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:15,386
I'll have someone take care of it. Let's go.

231
00:17:16,752 --> 00:17:17,943
Hold this.

232
00:17:17,943 --> 00:17:20,002
I'll make a phone call.

233
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,778
Your bones look fine.

234
00:17:27,778 --> 00:17:29,027
I told you.

235
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:31,444
How can a working woman be so fragile?

236
00:17:31,444 --> 00:17:33,859
You just wanted to take advantage of me.

237
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:36,077
Who told me to be so rich and handsome?

238
00:17:38,652 --> 00:17:40,110
Doctor.

239
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,919
I'm suddenly feeling pain.

240
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:46,527
Did I break something when I got hit by the bike?

241
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:49,736
Although your bones are fine,

242
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,169
just to be safe,

243
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,859
you'd better do a comprehensive check up.

244
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:56,378
Okay.

245
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,943
I was right.

246
00:18:07,943 --> 00:18:09,486
You just wanted to take advantage of me.

247
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:12,194
Other than the wisdom tooth you need pulled out,

248
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:13,960
you have no other problems.

249
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,927
Do you need to stop by the gynecology department too?

250
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,235
Don't leave yet, I still want a word with you.

251
00:18:20,235 --> 00:18:22,110
What?

252
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,669
I paid for all the medical bills today.

253
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,285
You should leave this with me.

254
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:30,719
You really think you're rich and handsome?

255
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:33,594
You're just rich second generation.

256
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:36,669
So sexy.

257
00:18:38,152 --> 00:18:40,527
Such a sexy skeleton.

258
00:18:41,235 --> 00:18:43,152
You pervert.

259
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:47,585
If there's anything wrong with me within the next week, I'll look for you.

260
00:18:52,402 --> 00:18:54,419
Do you have the mobile manager app?

261
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:56,127
Yes, why?

262
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,260
Cut the crap, take out your phone.

263
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,669
Do you want my number?

264
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,719
I lost my phone.

265
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:07,627
I need yours to help me delete the things I have in there.

266
00:19:07,627 --> 00:19:11,202
To avoid them getting into the hands of perverted people like you.

267
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:18,327
Also,

268
00:19:18,327 --> 00:19:20,427
give me your name, contact number,

269
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:23,010
office address, and identification card number.

270
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,936
This is my business card.

271
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,760
You're Siyu.

272
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,827
Yes, it means in charge of the universe.

273
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,310
Bar?

274
00:19:40,386 --> 00:19:43,219
You're the typical idle rich second generation

275
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:45,943
who doesn't do honest work.

276
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:47,486
Yes.

277
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:51,594
Remember to deliver my bike to my apartment.

278
00:19:51,594 --> 00:19:55,110
If anything is broken, I'll be asking you for full compensation.

279
00:19:56,085 --> 00:19:57,344
You haven't told me your address.

280
00:19:57,344 --> 00:20:00,036
It's easy to find on my medical records.

281
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:11,736
Where have you been?

282
00:20:11,736 --> 00:20:13,802
Do you know what time it is?

283
00:20:13,802 --> 00:20:15,377
Why didn't you answer my calls?

284
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:19,610
I thought you were kept at the police station because of the hairpin.

285
00:20:23,294 --> 00:20:26,860
Say something.

286
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,302
What happened?

287
00:20:28,302 --> 00:20:31,360
Starting from today, you are not allowed to access the internet,

288
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,611
not allowed to watch TV, and not allowed to shower.

289
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:35,885
I want to save money to pay back the company.

290
00:20:38,043 --> 00:20:39,486
You're not allowing me to do anything.

291
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:41,594
How am I supposed to live?

292
00:20:45,135 --> 00:20:47,135
Can you read the room?

293
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:48,985
How do you still have the appetite to eat?

294
00:20:48,985 --> 00:20:51,694
I'm going crazy.

295
00:20:51,694 --> 00:20:54,360
Okay, I won't eat or drink.

296
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,794
Okay?

297
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:01,759
How much do you need to pay?

298
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:05,802
As much as possible.

299
00:21:08,502 --> 00:21:10,252
I'm just worried...

300
00:21:10,778 --> 00:21:12,878
What?

301
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:14,969
I'm just worried that that hairpin...

302
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,840
is priceless.

303
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,930
What's going on?

304
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,194
Who did this?

305
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,469
Who put this horse manure here?

306
00:22:02,469 --> 00:22:03,902
So wick, now got any kind of person

307
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:06,069
Who did this?

308
00:22:06,069 --> 00:22:07,544
How can they do such a thing?

309
00:22:07,544 --> 00:22:08,985
Look at this.

310
00:22:08,985 --> 00:22:10,511
- Take a look.
- Who did this?

311
00:22:10,511 --> 00:22:14,652
Does anyone know who did this wicked thing?

312
00:22:14,652 --> 00:22:18,235
Tell us if you know something.

313
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:21,219
Tell a committee member or come to me.

314
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,152
Auntie, this is my bike.

315
00:22:26,152 --> 00:22:27,419
You did this?

316
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:29,652
It wasn't me.

317
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:31,902
But the bike is mine.

318
00:22:31,902 --> 00:22:33,602
Understood.

319
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:37,069
It must've been the guy who likes you.

320
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:41,611
He couldn't get with you, so he wants revenge.

321
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:44,219
Am I right?

322
00:22:44,219 --> 00:22:47,043
I don't know.

323
00:22:47,043 --> 00:22:48,486
Auntie, don't get angry.

324
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:50,110
I'll clear it immediately.

325
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,860
No worries.

326
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,852
Huang Di!

327
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:00,260
Are you confessing your love to me?

328
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,052
Get down here!

329
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:11,027
Who did this?

330
00:23:11,027 --> 00:23:13,586
I'll kill him when I find him.

331
00:23:13,586 --> 00:23:15,152
A rich second generation bastard.

332
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:17,294
The rich second generation do such things?

333
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:20,027
He's one of the scourges I was met with yesterday.

334
00:23:20,027 --> 00:23:21,002
Who is he?

335
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:22,694
I'll give you his business card later.

336
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:24,677
He even has a business card?

337
00:23:27,135 --> 00:23:29,360
Here, that's him.

338
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,194
Xiaoxiao, the smell of horse manure in my nose won't go away.

339
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:34,094
Then just wash your nose.

340
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,327
A General Manager.

341
00:23:46,678 --> 00:23:48,402
<i>There was a lot of commotion in your community.</i>

342
00:23:48,402 --> 00:23:50,135
<i>What's the good news?</i>

343
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:54,652
<i>Don't talk about it. It's bad news.</i>

344
00:23:54,652 --> 00:23:57,311
<i>I'm so unlucky.</i>

345
00:24:01,252 --> 00:24:03,969
<i>Sounds like it's your bad news.</i>

346
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:11,102
<i>Yes, I met a prankster.</i>

347
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,936
Go away.

348
00:24:27,486 --> 00:24:30,152
<i>Seems like someone has a crush on you.</i>

349
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:32,127
<i>That would be nice.</i>

350
00:24:32,127 --> 00:24:34,127
<i>But he just wants to mess with me.</i>

351
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:50,569
<i>Don't be so sure.</i>

352
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:54,159
<i>Men do many strange things to get a woman to like them.</i>

353
00:24:56,527 --> 00:24:58,959
<i>Whether it's love or hate,</i>

354
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:01,094
<i>I don't want to see him again.</i>

355
00:25:10,985 --> 00:25:12,759
Xiaoxiao.

356
00:25:13,402 --> 00:25:17,694
Your messages have been quite the commotion recently.

357
00:25:17,694 --> 00:25:19,986
You're the commotion.

358
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,610
<i>[Music House]</i>

359
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:51,752
Hey, where is your boss?

360
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:53,419
Who are you looking for?

361
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:56,085
I'm looking for your boss, Siyu.

362
00:25:56,085 --> 00:25:57,594
That's me.

363
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,169
You?

364
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:04,127
Who are you?

365
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:05,544
I'm Zhang Xiao's boyfriend.

366
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:07,769
Who's Zhang Xiao?

367
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:08,819
You recently hit her.

368
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:11,694
It hasn't even been 24 hours and you already forgot her?

369
00:26:11,694 --> 00:26:13,960
I didn't forget. You're talking about the tough girl, right?

370
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,402
I didn't forget. What is it?

371
00:26:18,235 --> 00:26:20,169
This is the compensation for mental damage

372
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:22,127
and follow up consultation fees, a total of 93,500.

373
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:24,252
Pay according to the details written here.

374
00:26:24,252 --> 00:26:25,235
Why should I?

375
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:27,759
I paid the medical expenses yesterday.

376
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:31,502
Do you think you can get rid of us with just that money?

377
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,410
Do you know what carrying the handle means?

378
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:50,819
Back in the day,

379
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:53,943
I've traveled from the north to the south, and fought on the train tracks.

380
00:26:53,943 --> 00:26:57,510
Went to work, got fired, hit the boss and got rewards.

381
00:26:59,143 --> 00:27:02,078
Who are you? Give it back.

382
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:17,460
Ling Dang,

383
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,335
he said he was a handle carrier or something.

384
00:27:20,335 --> 00:27:21,985
It's his first time at our bar.

385
00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:24,052
We should treat him well.

386
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:26,527
I'm in a bad state today.

387
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:28,277
I'll come look for you when I feel better.

388
00:27:28,277 --> 00:27:29,569
Don't be in such a rush to leave.

389
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:31,019
We have unfinished business.

390
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:33,419
How about you promise me a small request?

391
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,252
Then I'll give you the money.

392
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:38,569
What?

393
00:27:47,802 --> 00:27:49,736
Handle carrier.

394
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:52,043
If you drink all these,

395
00:27:52,043 --> 00:27:53,694
I'll give you the money immediately.

396
00:27:53,694 --> 00:27:55,027
No nonsense.

397
00:27:55,027 --> 00:27:56,194
We can be friends.

398
00:27:56,194 --> 00:27:57,610
What do you think?

399
00:28:01,194 --> 00:28:02,052
You said it.

400
00:28:02,052 --> 00:28:04,127
Yes.

401
00:28:04,127 --> 00:28:05,527
No back outs.

402
00:28:05,527 --> 00:28:07,344
Why would I do that for just 90,000?

403
00:28:07,344 --> 00:28:09,636
Kang Siyu is not that kind of person.

404
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,759
Again.

405
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,911
Impressive.

406
00:28:48,652 --> 00:28:50,043
Bye.

407
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:59,477
You proved yourself a man, so I wrote you a check for 100,000 yuan.

408
00:28:59,477 --> 00:29:01,235
Keep the change.

409
00:29:01,235 --> 00:29:03,477
I'm not thanking you.

410
00:29:08,652 --> 00:29:10,194
A check for 100,000 yuan.

411
00:29:10,194 --> 00:29:12,360
Have you seen this much money?

412
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,680
Where did you get that money?

413
00:29:16,185 --> 00:29:17,402
You don't need to know.

414
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:19,843
I just wanted to help you through this difficult time.

415
00:29:20,985 --> 00:29:22,410
It's...

416
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,859
It's for me?

417
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:27,569
Of course.

418
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:30,260
Take it and pay back the company.

419
00:29:31,586 --> 00:29:33,859
Why are you being so nice to me?

420
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:35,377
Rest assured.

421
00:29:35,377 --> 00:29:38,611
I'm not asking you to get back together with me this time.

422
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:41,010
It's just an act of kindness for a friend.

423
00:29:48,694 --> 00:29:50,240
Thank you.

424
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:55,894
I'll return the money as soon as possible.

425
00:29:57,252 --> 00:29:59,736
It's okay.

426
00:29:59,736 --> 00:30:02,043
You don't have to return it.

427
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:12,302
Let go.

428
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:21,369
All that money for such a short hug?

429
00:30:25,794 --> 00:30:27,927
What else do you want?

430
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,902
Nothing, I don't want anything.

431
00:30:43,444 --> 00:30:46,943
Are you naive or just not that smart?

432
00:30:47,627 --> 00:30:49,152
I already told you.

433
00:30:49,152 --> 00:30:52,043
The magnolia hairpin has special significance for the chairman.

434
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:54,652
No amount of money will fix this.

435
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:57,902
It's priceless to him.

436
00:30:57,902 --> 00:31:01,910
What is this amount of money going to do?

437
00:31:03,794 --> 00:31:05,544
You're better off being more sincere.

438
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:07,919
Write a resignation letter and leave the company.

439
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,502
Never appear in front of the chairman again.

440
00:31:14,444 --> 00:31:16,052
Chairman.

441
00:31:17,611 --> 00:31:19,219
Chairman.

442
00:31:26,444 --> 00:31:28,110
Director Yin is right.

443
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:32,435
The hairpin can't solved with money.

444
00:31:33,627 --> 00:31:35,985
If we're firing you,

445
00:31:35,985 --> 00:31:41,394
then Director Yin also holds responsibilities for this.

446
00:31:49,652 --> 00:31:52,819
You should've told me earlier that you had someone backing you.

447
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:55,085
I won't make it difficult for you.

448
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:59,959
The police started investigating this case.

449
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:04,669
We'll talk about this again after we hear of their findings.

450
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:16,402
I know this check can't compensate for anything.

451
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:18,627
But I made such a big mistake.

452
00:32:18,627 --> 00:32:20,319
I feel guilty.

453
00:32:21,502 --> 00:32:24,177
Please accept it.

454
00:32:29,335 --> 00:32:31,760
Didn't you hear the chairman?

455
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,843
He doesn't need the money.

456
00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:02,711
<i>What a strange feeling.</i>

457
00:33:03,586 --> 00:33:08,278
<i>Why does the scent of this fragrance put me at peace?</i>

458
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:11,636
<i>The sad, depressing,</i>

459
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:14,544
<i>down, and depression emotions I had</i>

460
00:33:14,544 --> 00:33:18,294
<i>have all disappeared and faded.</i>

461
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,144
<i>Have you eaten, ZX?</i>

462
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:32,377
<i>Not yet.</i>

463
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:35,027
- Thank you.
- Please wait.

464
00:33:37,778 --> 00:33:41,644
Z&X is indeed suitable for ZX.

465
00:33:42,152 --> 00:33:44,569
You mean me?

466
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:48,586
I think you used the orange bottle.

467
00:33:48,586 --> 00:33:50,277
Your sense of smell is so good.

468
00:33:50,277 --> 00:33:52,943
And I'm guessing that you didn't apply it to your skin,

469
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:55,586
but sprayed it into the air.

470
00:33:55,586 --> 00:33:57,302
How'd you know that?

471
00:34:01,794 --> 00:34:04,402
You use cherry flavored liquid hand soap.

472
00:34:04,402 --> 00:34:06,194
You use handmade soap to wash your face.

473
00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:09,919
And the soap is scented with gardenia.

474
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,135
You have a faint neutral perfume scent on you.

475
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,802
It's very faint.

476
00:34:15,802 --> 00:34:19,235
I don't think you're the one using it, but someone around you is.

477
00:34:19,235 --> 00:34:21,669
That person likes concentrated scents

478
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:23,811
and he sprays it excessively.

479
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:27,819
Your boss is too powerful.

480
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:29,878
What does this have to do with my boss?

481
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:33,000
His staff who distribute samples

482
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,127
has such a keen sense of smell and accurate judgment.

483
00:34:36,127 --> 00:34:40,978
It shows that your boss is very powerful and has great vision.

484
00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:43,090
You're right.

485
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:48,260
My boss is not only nice, but also wise.

486
00:34:50,444 --> 00:34:53,460
I really envy that you have such a good boss.

487
00:34:53,978 --> 00:34:56,469
What's wrong?

488
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,802
Nothing.

489
00:34:58,802 --> 00:35:02,859
You were right about all of it.

490
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:05,694
The one who likes neutral perfume is the head of my department.

491
00:35:05,694 --> 00:35:08,919
His fragrance can kill a pig.

492
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:19,043
Tell me about the food from your hometown.

493
00:35:19,043 --> 00:35:20,711
Okay.

494
00:35:20,711 --> 00:35:24,411
This is mutton soup, my favorite.

495
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:26,194
Take this.

496
00:35:27,678 --> 00:35:29,960
Just break it like this,

497
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,685
and put each piece in the soup to eat.

498
00:35:33,544 --> 00:35:35,160
Just like that.

499
00:35:36,152 --> 00:35:37,560
Try it.

500
00:35:49,085 --> 00:35:50,578
Delicious.

501
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:54,969
It'll taste better with this.

502
00:35:56,335 --> 00:35:57,843
Give it a try.

503
00:36:16,127 --> 00:36:19,444
Sorry, I don't eat peppers because of my job.

504
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:21,302
It's too stimulating.

505
00:36:22,135 --> 00:36:24,377
Why didn't you say something?

506
00:36:24,377 --> 00:36:26,711
I felt embarrassed.

507
00:36:26,711 --> 00:36:28,694
Moreover, I'm always abroad

508
00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:30,636
so I don't really get a chance to eat them.

509
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:33,452
You've been abroad?

510
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:37,194
For labor export.

511
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:39,286
I worked in Africa.

512
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,210
I'm a local drifter.

513
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,752
But you're an international drifter.

514
00:36:53,927 --> 00:36:58,852
People like us always travel for work.

515
00:36:58,852 --> 00:37:01,236
When can we see success?

516
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:06,252
Come on.

517
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:08,669
Since we're always traveling for work,

518
00:37:08,669 --> 00:37:11,110
let's have a toast with tea.

519
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,294
Come, cheers.

520
00:37:13,294 --> 00:37:14,536
Cheers.

521
00:37:19,335 --> 00:37:22,752
I've known you for so long and still don't know your name.

522
00:37:22,752 --> 00:37:26,052
You can just call me Black Cat Detective.

523
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:28,819
Got it.

524
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:30,943
What?

525
00:37:30,943 --> 00:37:33,486
You must not have a nice name.

526
00:37:33,486 --> 00:37:37,252
It probably contains something about wealth or money.

527
00:37:37,252 --> 00:37:39,202
Hard for you to tell people, right?

528
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:43,652
Names are just a code.

529
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:47,902
No matter what my name is, I'm still me.

530
00:37:47,902 --> 00:37:49,569
You're right.

531
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:53,085
Our names are also given by our parents.

532
00:37:53,085 --> 00:37:57,302
They always wish for unrealistic aspirations in the child's name.

533
00:37:57,302 --> 00:38:01,085
Take me for example. My dad wanted me to get up with sun,

534
00:38:01,085 --> 00:38:03,069
so my name is Zhang Xiao.

535
00:38:03,069 --> 00:38:07,060
Now I still hardly wake up even with ten alarms.

536
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:10,052
Your dad must be disappointed.

537
00:38:10,052 --> 00:38:15,202
I don't believe your parent's never forced you to do anything weird.

538
00:38:19,527 --> 00:38:23,569
My mother passed away many years ago.

539
00:38:25,902 --> 00:38:27,736
Me and my dad

540
00:38:28,943 --> 00:38:31,211
haven't been in contact for many years.

541
00:38:33,127 --> 00:38:34,910
Sorry.

542
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:38,769
I didn't mean to snoop.

543
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:45,402
I was actually brought up by my dad.

544
00:38:45,402 --> 00:38:48,927
My mother passed away after I was born.

545
00:38:50,152 --> 00:38:54,586
So we don't just have the same misfortune and can sympathize with each other,

546
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:58,652
we're also both very unlucky.

547
00:38:58,652 --> 00:39:00,794
I don't believe in that.

548
00:39:00,794 --> 00:39:04,486
I don't believe that we'll keep having bad luck.

549
00:39:04,486 --> 00:39:07,310
I prepared something special today.

550
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,486
What is it?

551
00:39:08,486 --> 00:39:10,659
You'll find out later.

552
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:15,394
What are you doing?

553
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:17,636
Do you dare to light it?

554
00:39:17,636 --> 00:39:21,736
You're not allowed to set off fireworks within the city.

555
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:25,219
Well, if you won't do it, I will.

556
00:39:28,611 --> 00:39:30,259
Let's do it together.

557
00:39:31,878 --> 00:39:33,319
That's right.

558
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:36,194
I'll light up those two while you light up these.

559
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:41,052
One, two, three.

560
00:39:53,152 --> 00:39:54,652
Did you know?

561
00:39:54,652 --> 00:39:57,335
This can expel bad things.

562
00:39:57,335 --> 00:40:01,159
It can expel all your bad luck.

563
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:07,694
Expel all the bad luck.

564
00:40:07,694 --> 00:40:09,302
Expel them!

565
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:15,860
What's going on?

566
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,335
Who allowed you to set fireworks?

567
00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:18,643
- Run!
- Stop!

568
00:40:18,643 --> 00:40:20,143
- Go!
- Stop!

569
00:40:20,143 --> 00:40:22,152
Go!

570
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:23,760
Stop!

571
00:40:29,085 --> 00:40:30,986
Triumphant return.

572
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,552
Thank you for spending this crazy night with me.

573
00:40:35,552 --> 00:40:36,859
Listen.

574
00:40:36,859 --> 00:40:39,685
I had a great time today,

575
00:40:39,685 --> 00:40:41,627
but don't do it again.

576
00:40:41,627 --> 00:40:44,569
You'll be met with bad luck.

577
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:46,060
Understood!

578
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,743
I'll never make the same mistake a second time.

579
00:40:52,335 --> 00:40:54,569
So,

580
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:57,127
when I was working,

581
00:40:57,127 --> 00:40:59,859
I lost something of value to my boss.

582
00:40:59,859 --> 00:41:01,735
Something of value?

583
00:41:03,435 --> 00:41:06,369
My boss didn't blame me,

584
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:09,277
but I feel guilty.

585
00:41:09,277 --> 00:41:11,860
Have you found a solution?

586
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,778
Not yet.

587
00:41:13,778 --> 00:41:16,969
But I'll try to make up for it.

588
00:41:16,969 --> 00:41:20,252
I hope you can get through this difficult time.

589
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:22,436
Thank you.

590
00:41:33,736 --> 00:41:37,859
It's quite late, I'm going home.

591
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:40,677
I'll walk with you.

592
00:41:41,486 --> 00:41:42,819
It's okay.

593
00:41:42,819 --> 00:41:44,919
It's quite close.

594
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,577
I'll walk with you.

595
00:41:48,836 --> 00:41:50,219
Stop.

596
00:41:52,269 --> 00:41:54,110
I...

597
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,840
Bye.

598
00:41:58,252 --> 00:41:59,635
Bye.
