<i>[Episode 21]</i>

3
00:01:46,646 --> 00:01:48,587
I'm getting a phone call.

4
00:01:50,854 --> 00:01:53,504
He's here. I'll go pick him up.

5
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,871
What?

6
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:05,095
Fine, go do your thing.

7
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,787
What's wrong?

8
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:19,896
He said he suddenly has a meeting.

9
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:21,712
He can't make it.

10
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:25,671
There will be plenty of opportunities.

11
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:28,354
You're right.

12
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:31,896
Happy women need their alone time too.

13
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:37,320
Let's party tonight!

14
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:44,062
♪ Unfortunately, you're not with me until the very end ♪

15
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:46,512
You're off-key.

16
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:52,329
Princess, do you remember when I broke up with my boyfriend in college?

17
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,712
We also sang this song.

18
00:02:53,712 --> 00:02:55,603
Really?

19
00:02:56,395 --> 00:02:58,554
I don't remember.

20
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:03,671
I didn't realize until now.

21
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:05,854
I think you got chubbier.

22
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:09,270
Really? It might be edema.

23
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,103
Plus, I still haven't adjusted to the time difference.

24
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:14,354
Then you need to go to bed early tonight.

25
00:03:14,354 --> 00:03:15,471
No way.

26
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:18,437
I can't sleep if I'm hanging out with you.

27
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:21,938
I have many things to tell you.

28
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:23,203
Piggy.

29
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,562
You know,

30
00:03:24,562 --> 00:03:29,770
I'm treating today as my bachelorette party.

31
00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:32,604
You're getting married?

32
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:35,771
I'm getting married in spirit.

33
00:03:36,395 --> 00:03:37,712
After today,

34
00:03:37,712 --> 00:03:41,879
I will be the woman who backs a successful man.

35
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,287
Married in spirit?

36
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:46,854
I don't understand.

37
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:50,145
You don't get it.

38
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:53,979
Because you haven't met your Mr. Right.

39
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:55,403
Yes I have.

40
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:58,229
Black Cat Detective is my Mr. Right.

41
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:02,020
You couldn't meet my boyfriend today.

42
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,295
You should go see your Black Cat Detective.

43
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:05,629
No way.

44
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:08,871
I don't want him to see me like this.

45
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:14,203
I'm extra different today.

46
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:16,879
I never had so much to drink before.

47
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,487
My boyfriend.

48
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:27,379
Why did he go away?

49
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,062
He sure is your secret boyfriend.

50
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:33,019
But...

51
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:37,804
He must be famous if he's appearing on this street. Who is he?

52
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:40,395
I'm not telling you.

53
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:44,020
I want to keep him a secret.

54
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,771
How could you do this to me?

55
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:47,338
Of course.

56
00:04:47,338 --> 00:04:51,229
I want you to be surprised.

57
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,662
I want you to be jealous!

58
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:57,762
I'm gonna get you!

59
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:12,879
Don't run.

60
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,320
Let me see what we have to eat tonight.

61
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:24,254
The answer is...

62
00:05:24,254 --> 00:05:26,070
Two packs of udon,

63
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,487
three tomatoes, one apple,

64
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:30,362
milk and eggs.

65
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:31,696
Nothing else.

66
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:33,429
That's it?

67
00:05:33,429 --> 00:05:36,154
We shouldn't have such oily food at night.

68
00:05:36,154 --> 00:05:41,246
Do you want a bowl of tomato egg udon noodle soup?

69
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,738
Do you not want to make it?

70
00:05:44,738 --> 00:05:46,645
Fine, I don't want to eat anymore.

71
00:05:56,903 --> 00:05:58,903
Princess, don't be mad.

72
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:01,712
I will make you something else.

73
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:02,571
No.

74
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,629
Give me ten minutes.

75
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:08,129
I will make you tuna egg salad.

76
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:10,029
What are you saying?

77
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:12,379
Tuna egg salad.

78
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:19,037
Then can I also add what you just said?

79
00:06:19,037 --> 00:06:21,420
The udon noodle soup?

80
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:24,529
Can you finish that much food?

81
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,312
Fine.

82
00:06:27,312 --> 00:06:30,929
Please wait a moment.

83
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,117
Go!

84
00:06:42,632 --> 00:06:46,424
You made such a simple dish look so fancy.

85
00:06:46,424 --> 00:06:48,965
They look beautiful.

86
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:51,739
I'm taking a picture for my mom.

87
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:53,382
You're exaggerating.

88
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:55,049
Auntie has seen it all.

89
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:56,382
This is different.

90
00:06:56,382 --> 00:07:00,982
You were already such a great cook in college.

91
00:07:09,816 --> 00:07:11,274
Piggy.

92
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:13,466
Your skills have improved.

93
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,839
I'm glad you like it.

94
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,758
I'll have more ingredients next time.

95
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:18,765
Then we can have an abundant meal.

96
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:23,340
It would be great if we could include your Black Cat Detective and my secret boyfriend.

97
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,090
The four of us should have a meal together.

98
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:25,799
Okay.

99
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:27,882
Make sure to help me in the kitchen.

100
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:31,316
Deal.

101
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:37,632
Are you getting tired?

102
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:40,374
No, I'm fine.

103
00:07:40,374 --> 00:07:43,965
We'll talk all night then.

104
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:45,758
No problem.

105
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:46,474
Finish your food first.

106
00:07:46,474 --> 00:07:47,807
Okay.

107
00:08:12,923 --> 00:08:14,382
Don't move.

108
00:08:19,591 --> 00:08:21,778
Why are you drawing me?

109
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:23,402
I forgot to tell you.

110
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,943
I'm having an art exhibition.

111
00:08:24,943 --> 00:08:28,527
I'm showcasing all my work from the past few years.

112
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:32,235
Don't tell me you're showcasing this drawing too.

113
00:08:32,235 --> 00:08:33,469
Of course.

114
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:34,860
You are my best friend.

115
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,010
I have to put you up.

116
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:43,360
Do you have a venue and time planned yet?

117
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,069
I'll try to go and support.

118
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:51,210
I'll let you know after I settle something more important than this.

119
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,569
Something more important than your art exhibition?

120
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:55,977
What is it?

121
00:08:57,486 --> 00:08:58,960
Piggy.

122
00:08:59,736 --> 00:09:01,919
Have you ever thought about getting married?

123
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:04,859
With Black Cat Detective?

124
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:07,636
Of course.

125
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:12,860
We just started dating, so I never really thought about it.

126
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:17,727
What did you mean when you said you were getting married in spirit?

127
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:23,144
It means I'm changing myself for the sake of getting married.

128
00:09:23,694 --> 00:09:26,860
Changing yourself for a man?

129
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,611
Is he really that great?

130
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:31,640
He's worth it.

131
00:09:33,027 --> 00:09:36,377
I originally didn't think he was that great.

132
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:38,290
But later on,

133
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,190
I couldn't find anyone better than him.

134
00:09:42,902 --> 00:09:46,860
I'm getting more curious about your secret boyfriend.

135
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,669
You're so loyal to him.

136
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:51,186
He must be amazing.

137
00:09:52,652 --> 00:09:56,319
I was spoiled child.

138
00:09:56,319 --> 00:09:58,902
I only cared about my own feelings.

139
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:01,260
I never thought about how he felt.

140
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,819
But when we weren't together anymore,

141
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:07,819
I only then realized how good he was to me.

142
00:10:08,636 --> 00:10:12,260
So I'm determined to marry him.

143
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,135
Okay.

144
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:18,110
You're lucky to have found someone you love.

145
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,027
I am happy for you.

146
00:10:20,027 --> 00:10:23,085
Don't forget our promise.

147
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:25,802
What promise?

148
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:27,302
To be my bridesmaid.

149
00:10:27,302 --> 00:10:30,227
Come on, I won't break my promise.

150
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:33,444
Are you done?

151
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:35,019
Almost done.

152
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:36,911
I want to see it.

153
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,111
You made me look so good.

154
00:10:49,386 --> 00:10:52,360
You're good-looking to begin with.

155
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,885
You also have good qualities that I don't have.

156
00:10:55,885 --> 00:11:00,527
You're perfect to me.

157
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:03,911
I'm going to grow wings if you keep flattering me.

158
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:08,427
I feel so lucky.

159
00:11:08,427 --> 00:11:10,527
To have a great friend like you,

160
00:11:10,527 --> 00:11:14,036
and to get married to the man I love.

161
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:15,986
I have no regrets.

162
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:19,302
You're so sentimental.

163
00:11:19,302 --> 00:11:22,077
I'm not used to this.

164
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:24,511
You're hugging me so tight.

165
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:26,969
Let go of me.

166
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,802
Fine, take the crab.

167
00:11:31,802 --> 00:11:34,427
I don't want that.

168
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:38,860
Fine, you can keep hugging me.

169
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,227
Don't try to get rid of me.

170
00:11:53,552 --> 00:11:55,885
Princess, your phone.

171
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:58,210
Help me answer it.

172
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,110
Fine.

173
00:12:01,852 --> 00:12:05,710
I'll take advantage of him then.

174
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,302
Hello?

175
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:09,110
Give it back to me.

176
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,450
Hello?

177
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:14,885
Stop.

178
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:18,052
I stayed with a friend yesterday.

179
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:21,069
Okay, see you later.

180
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:22,427
Bye.

181
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:24,994
Wake up.

182
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,594
- Come meet my boyfriend.
- No, I want to sleep.

183
00:12:26,594 --> 00:12:28,752
No, I want to sleep.

184
00:12:28,752 --> 00:12:31,152
You weren't tired when you were tickling me just now.

185
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:32,878
Get up.

186
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:37,678
Princess, I'm an office worker.

187
00:12:37,678 --> 00:12:40,759
I want to wake up naturally.

188
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,960
Let me sleep ten more minutes.

189
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,386
Ten minutes.

190
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,402
Fine.

191
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:49,194
If you want to find me,

192
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:51,930
go to the restaurant opposite of the art studio.

193
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,636
Okay?

194
00:12:53,636 --> 00:12:56,027
Go, see you later.

195
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,302
I'm taking the drawing.

196
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:11,277
Xinyi.

197
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,902
Sorry to keep you waiting.

198
00:13:13,902 --> 00:13:16,330
It's fine. I just got here.

199
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,690
Have a seat.

200
00:13:18,552 --> 00:13:21,736
I was late because I stopped by my house.

201
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:23,319
Thank you.

202
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:26,069
For what?

203
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:29,040
We talked about this restaurant in London.

204
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,650
Do you remember?

205
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:36,194
The first time we met.

206
00:13:36,194 --> 00:13:38,502
It was raining

207
00:13:38,502 --> 00:13:40,235
and we both forgot to bring an umbrella.

208
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:42,694
So we continued to talk.

209
00:13:42,694 --> 00:13:47,486
Then you told me that you missed this restaurant a lot.

210
00:13:47,486 --> 00:13:49,177
Did you forget?

211
00:13:50,611 --> 00:13:52,794
I think so.

212
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,511
Fine.

213
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:58,885
I guess I thought too much of it.

214
00:14:00,969 --> 00:14:02,386
But it's fine.

215
00:14:02,386 --> 00:14:04,552
Everything is good when I'm eating with you.

216
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,110
Have you ordered yet?

217
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,802
No, you can do it.

218
00:14:07,802 --> 00:14:09,552
You should order.

219
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:13,678
I have to learn to follow your tastes.

220
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:16,610
So you can stop saying I have the temper of a princess.

221
00:14:17,611 --> 00:14:19,511
Fine, I'll order.

222
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:29,985
Why are you back so soon?

223
00:14:29,985 --> 00:14:31,719
Because I missed you.

224
00:14:34,627 --> 00:14:36,027
What's wrong?

225
00:14:36,027 --> 00:14:38,960
Are you too busy at work?

226
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,860
I'm fine.

227
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:47,902
You know what?

228
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:49,678
My advisor got married.

229
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:52,177
His wife is beautiful.

230
00:14:52,177 --> 00:14:55,294
I went to their wedding ceremony.

231
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,827
The bride is almost forty years younger than him.

232
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:14,777
Sihan, sorry.

233
00:15:15,511 --> 00:15:17,611
Why are you apologizing?

234
00:15:17,611 --> 00:15:20,494
I have many things to tell you.

235
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:46,719
That's it.

236
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:47,902
Okay, please wait.

237
00:15:47,902 --> 00:15:49,219
Thank you.

238
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,186
Hello?

239
00:16:02,186 --> 00:16:04,902
Hello, Black Cat Detective? Have you eaten yet?

240
00:16:04,902 --> 00:16:06,535
I'm eating now.

241
00:16:07,235 --> 00:16:08,402
Fine.

242
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:10,094
How about you?

243
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,719
Don't worry about me.

244
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:16,210
Are you free tonight?

245
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,611
Yes.

246
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:20,444
Then can you eat with me tonight?

247
00:16:20,444 --> 00:16:21,760
Yes.

248
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:24,943
Bye.

249
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,394
Sorry.

250
00:16:27,902 --> 00:16:33,860
A phone call asking to meet for dinner at this is normally from a mother or a wife.

251
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,859
But neither can be the case for you.

252
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:40,002
Who called?

253
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,277
Xinyi,

254
00:16:47,277 --> 00:16:50,544
if I told you that my new girlfriend just called,

255
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:52,302
would you believe me?

256
00:16:53,252 --> 00:16:55,027
That's impossible.

257
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:58,527
I would believe it if it were someone else sitting in front of me.

258
00:16:58,527 --> 00:17:02,210
But not you.

259
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,902
Why not?

260
00:17:03,902 --> 00:17:08,177
Because you once told me it takes you a year to fall in love with someone.

261
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:10,177
I didn't believe it at first,

262
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:14,352
but then it really did take you that long to fall in love with me.

263
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,177
You only came back a few months ago.

264
00:17:18,177 --> 00:17:21,552
It's not possible for you to have already fallen in love with someone.

265
00:17:22,502 --> 00:17:26,152
Plus, I know you love me.

266
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,985
Xinyi, I...

267
00:17:38,985 --> 00:17:40,778
Am I wrong?

268
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:42,902
Alright, that's enough.

269
00:17:42,902 --> 00:17:44,460
I'm hungry.

270
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,460
Why aren't the dishes being served yet?

271
00:17:47,402 --> 00:17:49,436
I'm going to the washroom.

272
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,320
<i>[ZX]</i>

273
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:48,459
There you are.

274
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:51,959
Piggy.

275
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:54,678
Here to see me?

276
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,052
I'm so curious.

277
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,427
Come on.

278
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,169
Sihan.

279
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:17,277
Let me introduce you.

280
00:19:17,277 --> 00:19:19,611
She is my best friend,

281
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:20,969
Zhang Xiao.

282
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:25,702
This is who couldn't make it yesterday, Mr. Kang Sihan.

283
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,260
Nice to meet you.

284
00:19:34,511 --> 00:19:35,835
Nice to meet you.

285
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,678
Take a seat.

286
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:49,336
Sihan, give me the menu.

287
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:55,002
I'll decide on some dishes.

288
00:19:55,552 --> 00:19:57,010
You don't eat spicy food.

289
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,302
Piggy likes spicy food.

290
00:19:59,302 --> 00:20:01,560
You two are annoying.

291
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,135
Not this.

292
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:09,319
Piggy likes sweet food.

293
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:12,010
Piggy, do you want egg tart?

294
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:13,759
It's okay.

295
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,194
I just realized I have to go.

296
00:20:16,194 --> 00:20:17,127
Why?

297
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:18,486
I have to go visit my father at the hospital.

298
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:21,010
I won't make visitation hours.

299
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,435
Just a few more minutes.

300
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:24,736
Sorry.

301
00:20:24,736 --> 00:20:27,778
I think my father is more important than this meal.

302
00:20:27,778 --> 00:20:30,585
I will treat you next time.

303
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:33,860
We'll wait for you.

304
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,052
No, it's okay.

305
00:20:35,052 --> 00:20:38,736
I won't disturb you.

306
00:20:38,736 --> 00:20:40,177
Piggy.

307
00:21:06,694 --> 00:21:09,102
Sihan, what's wrong?

308
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:12,719
Nothing.

309
00:21:14,444 --> 00:21:16,611
Xinyi,

310
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:19,277
I just remembered I have to call a client.

311
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:20,885
Give me a second.

There's nothing to say.

No need to explain.

332
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,127
Go.

I can go, but listen to my explanation first.

There's nothing to explain.

Xiaoxiao.

337
00:23:31,552 --> 00:23:34,569
Xinyi and I were classmates in London.

338
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:36,943
I broke up with her before I came back.

339
00:23:36,943 --> 00:23:38,586
You know how she is.

340
00:23:38,586 --> 00:23:39,577
She acts like a princess.

341
00:23:39,577 --> 00:23:42,860
We wouldn't have ended up together.

342
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:47,952
I never thought about keeping this from you.

343
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:53,110
I just never thought you two would be good friends.

344
00:23:55,152 --> 00:23:57,278
What's the point of saying all this?

345
00:24:00,627 --> 00:24:04,736
Kang Sihan, let me tell you.

346
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:07,110
It's meaningless.

347
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,102
Do you want to know why?

348
00:24:10,344 --> 00:24:12,859
Because she is Meng Xinyi.

349
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:15,552
She is my best friend.

350

Even if you're already broken up,

351
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,559
I can't be with you.

352
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:29,619
Don't let her find out about this.

353
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:33,778
Xiaoxiao, don't be so childish.

354
00:24:33,778 --> 00:24:36,319
Let's be reasonable about this.

355
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,843
You're now realizing I'm childish?

356
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,250

Hello, Xinyi.

376
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,943
Something came up.

377
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:40,985
Sorry for leaving without saying anything.

378
00:27:40,985 --> 00:27:42,360
It's fine.

379
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,611
I know you are busy.

380
00:27:44,611 --> 00:27:46,736
I just finished a meeting.

381
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:48,736
My mother asked Auntie to cook some soup for me.

382
00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:50,527
I'll bring you some.

383
00:27:50,527 --> 00:27:52,502
It's okay, thank you.

385
00:27:55,486 --> 00:27:57,069
You're being so polite with me.

386
00:27:57,069 --> 00:27:59,102
I'm not used to it.

387
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,344
Hello?

388
00:28:04,344 --> 00:28:06,052
Are you listening?

389
00:28:08,902 --> 00:28:11,694
Xinyi, I'm tired.

390
00:28:11,694 --> 00:28:14,219
Can't you forgive me?

391
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:15,694
I know I have many shortcomings.

392
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,969
I'll change.

393
00:28:17,969 --> 00:28:20,627
I missed you so much after you came back.

394
00:28:20,627 --> 00:28:22,444
Forgive me.

Xinyi.

396
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,430
We're broken up.

397
00:28:28,878 --> 00:28:32,177
To me, we never broke up.

398
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:35,960
We were fine after we broke up the first time.

399
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,952
It's the same this time around.

400
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,094
I'm really tired.

401
00:28:47,678 --> 00:28:49,943
Have some rest then.

Get here before 9 am for a meeting.

- Nice to meet you.

428
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,344
Director Kang.

429
00:31:45,344 --> 00:31:46,152
Director Yin.

430
00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:47,552
There's been some changes within the company.

431
00:31:47,552 --> 00:31:49,469
I'm now in the logistics department.

432

Director Kang is here. Have a seat.

00:31:57,177 --> 00:31:59,060
Why are you here?

434
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,402
I came for the meeting.

435
00:32:02,402 --> 00:32:03,694
Did you get reinstated?

436
00:32:03,694 --> 00:32:05,969
Why didn't I hear the news?

437
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,002
I didn't.

438
00:32:10,002 --> 00:32:14,943
But I was in charge of the communications with the clients at this meeting.

439
00:32:14,943 --> 00:32:19,027
Chairman might be worried that you can't handle them.

440
00:32:19,027 --> 00:32:22,694
So he asked me to join this meeting.

441
00:32:23,486 --> 00:32:24,760
But don't worry.

442
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,294
You have many chances in the future.

443
00:32:28,594 --> 00:32:30,369

444
00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:32,594
Good morning, please take your seats.

445
00:32:32,594 --> 00:32:33,902
Chairman.

446
00:32:33,902 --> 00:32:36,619
Did you give Sihan the client's information?

447
00:32:38,985 --> 00:32:40,859
Yes, this morning.

448
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:42,260

00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:45,010
It's in the file you have.

Sihan, have you looked at it?

451
00:32:47,636 --> 00:32:49,210
I...

452
00:32:53,152 --> 00:32:54,427
Please.

453
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,027
Director Meng is here.

00:33:00,802 --> 00:33:01,943
Nice to meet you.

00:33:01,943 --> 00:33:02,885
Welcome, Director Meng.

00:33:02,885 --> 00:33:03,885

00:33:03,885 --> 00:33:04,552
Please take your seat.

458
00:33:04,552 --> 00:33:06,177
Sure.

459
00:33:06,177 --> 00:33:07,969
Have a seat.

460
00:33:11,927 --> 00:33:13,843
Can we start now?

461
00:33:15,152 --> 00:33:19,194
Chairman Kang, I have a question before we start.

462
00:33:19,194 --> 00:33:20,444
Is it okay to ask?

463
00:33:20,444 --> 00:33:22,069
What is it?

464
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:28,902
My daughter said she met a boyfriend named Kang Sihan in London.

465
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:30,469
Really?

466
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:34,069
Young people today are always dating in secret.

467
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:35,486
I asked her to show me a photo,

468
00:33:35,486 --> 00:33:37,902
and she said I will meet him today.

469
00:33:37,902 --> 00:33:42,127
May I know who Kang Sihan is?

470
00:33:44,127 --> 00:33:45,219
Sihan.

471
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:47,502
Say hi to Aunt Meng.

472
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:50,760
Nice to meet you, Director Meng.

473
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:52,919
Don't be so polite.

474
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,986
Call me Aunt Meng.

475
00:33:56,859 --> 00:33:59,469
Xinyi, what are you waiting for?

476
00:34:01,444 --> 00:34:03,344
Nice to meet you, Uncle Kang.

477
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:03,969
- Nice to meet you.
- Look at that.

478
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:07,585
Our meeting has turned into a blind date.

479
00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:12,811
Zheng'er, let Sihan sit next to me.

480
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:16,700
Have a seat.

481
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:29,978
This meeting is to discuss our cooperation

482
00:34:29,978 --> 00:34:32,902
in the jewelry auction.

483
00:34:32,902 --> 00:34:36,569
I don't think I need to talk about

484
00:34:36,569 --> 00:34:41,759
how Yin Feng Group's jewelry company is one of the leaders in the business.

485
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:46,985
I am here to talk about Zhen Tian's position.

486
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:48,985
Honestly,

487
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:53,386
we're still unfamiliar with jewelry.

488
00:34:53,386 --> 00:34:58,843
Our main business is in antiques.

489
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:00,427
During our time,

490
00:35:00,427 --> 00:35:05,027
we gained plenty of experience in organizing auctions.

491
00:35:05,027 --> 00:35:07,110
So we can say

492
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:10,919
that our cooperation is greatly anticipated.

493
00:35:10,919 --> 00:35:15,010
I hope that this is just the beginning.

494
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:20,419
I hope that we will still continue to cooperate in the future.

495
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:27,069
Xinyi is my assistant.

496
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:28,252
Since they're a couple,

497
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:32,027
I think we'll have no problems in our communication.

498
00:35:32,027 --> 00:35:34,319
I'm confident as well.

499
00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:38,411
Sihan, talk about the plan.

500
00:35:38,411 --> 00:35:40,377
Okay.

501
00:35:40,377 --> 00:35:43,294
I will talk about the plan.

502
00:35:43,294 --> 00:35:45,659
Our plan is focused on Yin Feng Group...

503
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:47,152
Lao Wang.

504
00:35:47,152 --> 00:35:49,552
What's going on?

505
00:35:49,552 --> 00:35:53,327
Wasn't Director Yin in charge of this before?

506
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,627
Can't you tell?

507
00:35:57,627 --> 00:36:01,719
Director Kang and Yin Feng Group's daughter.

508
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:04,444
There's something going on.

509
00:36:04,444 --> 00:36:06,819
Things are working in his favor.

510
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:10,078
I think Chairman...

511
00:36:11,985 --> 00:36:14,319
It's all for private gain.

512
00:36:17,527 --> 00:36:19,960
That's the general plan.

513
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,411
Thank you.

514
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:26,735
Xinyi.

515
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:29,494
Talk about your plan.

516
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:36,444
Hi everyone.

517
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,719
I'm Meng Xinyi, the representative for Yin Feng Group.

518
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,010
Director Kang, let me ask you.

519
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:45,902
What's Sihan's position at the company?

520
00:36:45,902 --> 00:36:47,569
Vice President.

521
00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:51,694
He'll be responsible for this collaboration.

522
00:36:51,694 --> 00:36:52,659
Great.

523
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:55,960
I'll also hand this over to Xinyi.

524
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,486
Where is Sihan?

525
00:36:57,486 --> 00:36:59,319
He's still packing his things.

526
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:00,736
I'm heading back to the office.

527
00:37:00,736 --> 00:37:02,235
Go talk to him.

528
00:37:02,235 --> 00:37:03,219
Okay.

529
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:06,277
Don't take up too much of his time.

530
00:37:07,802 --> 00:37:10,636
Ask him to come over for dinner tonight.

531
00:37:10,636 --> 00:37:11,678
Okay.

532
00:37:11,678 --> 00:37:13,344
Director Kang, you may come also.

533
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,943
I'm okay.

534
00:37:14,943 --> 00:37:16,110
Young people should have their time.

535
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,277
This way.

536
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:17,985
Okay.

537
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,636
I'll go now.

538
00:37:30,402 --> 00:37:34,277
Sihan, who was that sitting next to you?

539
00:37:34,277 --> 00:37:35,319
Why the long face?

540
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,885
He's acting like everyone owes him something.

541
00:37:39,277 --> 00:37:40,943
A cold and strange man.

542
00:37:40,943 --> 00:37:42,580
Ignore him.

543
00:37:43,152 --> 00:37:44,719
No wonder.

544
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:47,760
How did I do today?

545
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:50,719
I spent all night preparing.

546
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:52,636
Why didn't you tell me yesterday?

547
00:37:52,636 --> 00:37:55,927
My mom didn't tell me until yesterday.

548
00:37:55,927 --> 00:37:59,227
Plus, you were feeling down.

549
00:38:03,778 --> 00:38:04,969
Sorry.

550
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:06,444
There's nothing to apologize for.

551
00:38:06,444 --> 00:38:08,444
You haven't answered my question.

552
00:38:08,444 --> 00:38:10,985
How did I do today?

553
00:38:10,985 --> 00:38:11,902
Great.

554
00:38:11,902 --> 00:38:13,544
Then...

555
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:17,219
Shouldn't you give me a reward?

556
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:19,778
I think you should ask your mother for a reward.

557
00:38:19,778 --> 00:38:21,859
She's your boss after all.

558
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:25,427
My boss seems to like you.

559
00:38:25,427 --> 00:38:30,119
She told me to invite you over for dinner.

560
00:38:32,152 --> 00:38:35,443
Why did you call me this morning by the way?

561
00:38:37,444 --> 00:38:39,752
It's nothing important.

562
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,386
Piggy.

563
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,194
Princess.

564
00:39:00,194 --> 00:39:01,819
What a coincidence.

565
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:04,194
Yeah, did you come visit your boyfriend?

566
00:39:04,194 --> 00:39:06,819
No, I came for a meeting.

567
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:08,402
Why are you here?

568
00:39:08,402 --> 00:39:09,859
I work here.

569
00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:11,778
I just started recently.

570
00:39:11,778 --> 00:39:12,960
Sihan.

571
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,586
You work together.

572
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:17,010
You never met before?

573
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,511
I...

574
00:39:18,511 --> 00:39:19,486
The company is so big.

575
00:39:19,486 --> 00:39:20,752
More than 3,000 people.

576
00:39:20,752 --> 00:39:22,552
We had no chance to meet.

577
00:39:23,302 --> 00:39:24,802
You're right.

578
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:27,843
I'll get going now.

579
00:39:27,843 --> 00:39:29,094
Okay.

580
00:39:29,843 --> 00:39:32,902
Wait, what's that?

581
00:39:32,902 --> 00:39:34,027
Lunch.

582
00:39:34,027 --> 00:39:35,360
Why do you have so many?

583
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,319
Are they bullying you because you're new?

584
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:40,860
No, I just happened to get it for them.

585
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,469
Hi, Director Kang.

586
00:39:42,469 --> 00:39:44,110
Can you help me take this up?

587
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,969
Sure.

588
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:46,640
Thank you.

589
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,960
See?

590
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,177
Let's find your supervisor.

591
00:39:51,177 --> 00:39:52,527
- Xinyi.
- It's fine.

592
00:39:52,527 --> 00:39:53,694
Forget it.

593
00:39:53,694 --> 00:39:54,778
What?

594
00:39:54,778 --> 00:39:56,444
Don't make it bigger than it is.

595
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:59,527
Sihan, listen.

596
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:01,652
Zhang Xiao is my best friend.

597
00:40:01,652 --> 00:40:04,611
I won't forgive even you if she gets bullied.

598
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:07,085
Please take care of my best friend.

599
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:12,110
Besides, she's the woman I love the most, second only to my mother.

600
00:40:14,627 --> 00:40:16,360
Stop it.

601
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,444
What?

602
00:40:17,444 --> 00:40:19,377
I'm telling it like it is.

603
00:40:19,377 --> 00:40:22,827
If this happens again, I will take down your entire company.

604
00:40:23,344 --> 00:40:27,069
Princess, stop it.

605
00:40:27,069 --> 00:40:29,819
Alright, let's go to lunch.

606
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:32,736
I already bought lunch. Next time.

607
00:40:32,736 --> 00:40:34,127
Fine.

608
00:40:36,194 --> 00:40:37,759
I'm heading up now.

609
00:40:40,843 --> 00:40:42,386
Let's go.

610
00:40:49,527 --> 00:40:53,052
That's why I said Zhang Xiao...

611
00:40:56,152 --> 00:40:57,886
Zhang Xiao.

612
00:40:59,486 --> 00:41:00,902
I have some news.

613
00:41:00,902 --> 00:41:02,885
I don't know if I should tell you or not.

614
00:41:05,152 --> 00:41:09,527
Director Kang's real girlfriend is the daughter of Yin Feng Group.

615
00:41:09,527 --> 00:41:13,152
The news has been spreading amongst the higher-ups.

616
00:41:13,152 --> 00:41:15,694
You better watch out.

617
00:41:15,694 --> 00:41:17,802
A perfect match.

618
00:41:17,802 --> 00:41:19,694
They're the perfect example.

619
00:41:19,694 --> 00:41:23,544
Zhen Tian and Yin Feng is family now.

620
00:41:24,502 --> 00:41:26,135
What do you think?

621
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:35,027
Zhang Xiao, are you alright?

622
00:41:35,027 --> 00:41:37,694
Zhang Xiao has it tough.

623
00:41:37,694 --> 00:41:39,427
But it can be a good thing.

624
00:41:39,427 --> 00:41:42,110
She can wake up now.

625
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:46,527
You should know the difference between reality and a fairy tale.

626
00:41:46,527 --> 00:41:50,378
Not everyone can be Cinderella.

627
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:55,869
Here.

628
00:41:57,135 --> 00:41:58,319
I told you.

629
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,552
Men can't be trusted.

630
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:02,069
Don't cry anymore.

631
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:04,194
Don't let him take advantage of you.

632
00:42:04,194 --> 00:42:06,510
Our time is valuable.

633
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,760
You should ask him for stuff.

634
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,110
At least some compensation.

635
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:13,886
This amount.

636
00:42:15,277 --> 00:42:19,219
No, this amount.

637
00:42:40,594 --> 00:42:46,885
♫ <i>Time passes quickly, so love in the moment</i> ♫

638
00:42:46,885 --> 00:42:54,836
♫ <i>Would rather be hurt than to feel empty</i> ♫

639
00:42:54,836 --> 00:42:58,027
♫ <i>Everyone wants to be loved, looking for a future</i> ♫

640
00:42:58,027 --> 00:43:00,102
Why isn't the car here yet?

641
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,778
Lao Li, where are you?

642
00:43:09,778 --> 00:43:12,135
I've decided.

643
00:43:12,135 --> 00:43:13,894
Let's break up.

644
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:16,544
Xiaoxiao, don't do this.

645
00:43:16,544 --> 00:43:17,927
Calm down.

646
00:43:17,927 --> 00:43:19,943
I am sorry.

647
00:43:19,943 --> 00:43:23,527
I'm sorry for making you uncomfortable with this decision.

648
00:43:23,527 --> 00:43:27,586
I'm not uncomfortable. I feel guilty.

649
00:43:27,586 --> 00:43:29,960
Don't do this.

650
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,827
Remember.

651
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,902
Zhang Xiao was with Black Cat Detective.

652
00:43:35,902 --> 00:43:38,235
Not Kang Sihan.

653
00:43:38,235 --> 00:43:41,360
Now Black Cat Detective no longer exists.

654
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,836
Kang Sihan has nothing to feel sorry for.

655
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,759
Also,

656
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:52,878
rumors are spreading throughout the company.

657
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:57,394
Don't let Xinyi hear any of it.

658
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,860
Xinyi is a simple and innocent girl.

659
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,927
Treat her well.

660
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,710
Or I won't forgive you.

661
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,100
Hello?

662
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:55,110
What are you doing?

663
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,859
Let go of me.

664
00:44:57,859 --> 00:44:59,244
Don't move.
