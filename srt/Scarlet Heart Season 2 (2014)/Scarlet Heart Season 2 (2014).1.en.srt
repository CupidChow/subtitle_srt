Your Majesty.

7
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:18,754
If you can't come to my world to look for me,

8
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:28,471
then I'll go to yours.

9
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:58,437
Send this thing to the Northwest.

10
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:02,754
To Ruoxi's hometown.

11
00:04:11,612 --> 00:04:13,119
Quick.

12
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:43,279
The sandstorm is coming, let's go quickly.

13
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,096
Quick!

14
00:04:57,487 --> 00:04:59,571
Quick! Keep up.

15
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:02,162
- Quick.
- Keep up!

16
00:05:03,254 --> 00:05:05,379
Let's go.

Water.

00:06:39,962 --> 00:06:42,703
- Why aren't you drinking it?
- I'm not thirsty anymore.

25
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:49,154
Camel, forget it if we can't find it. Let's go back.

26
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:51,029
No way.

27
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:58,604
The weather isn't looking too good.

28
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:01,479
Let's go back to our camp first. We're running out of gas too.

29
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:04,670
No way, it wasn't easy for us to get here. We can't go back empty-handed.

30
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,487
I'll go back myself if you don't.

31
00:07:06,487 --> 00:07:08,170
Chenggui, we've tried our best.

32
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,854
- Don't be reckless.
- Reckless?

33
00:07:09,854 --> 00:07:11,879
I've put in all the money my family gave me for my studies.

34
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,738
How can I just go back without getting anything?

35
00:07:13,738 --> 00:07:15,779
We've been searching for the past ten days.

36
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:18,454
- So what?
- What if the box is just a legend?

37
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:20,571
That's impossible.

38
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:23,554
Stop fighting. The weather really doesn't look too good right now.

39
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:25,462
Brother, wake up.

40
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:28,662
- We found it?
- No, but someone here wants to quit.

41
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:31,262
I'm here to look for treasure, not to risk my life.

42
00:07:31,262 --> 00:07:32,730
Camel, head back.

43
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,379
Okay.

44
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:35,954
No way!

45
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:41,295
- What are you doing?
- Chenggui, let go!

46
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,229
- Leave me alone.
- Chenggui!

47
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:57,071
- Don't be so stubborn.
- Just leave if you want to!

48
00:07:57,071 --> 00:07:59,279
Keeping us here is like leaving us to die.

49
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,862
If you want to leave, don't blame me for not giving you this opportunity.

50
00:08:01,862 --> 00:08:05,579
- Are you crazy?
- Stop fighting!

51
00:08:08,562 --> 00:08:11,279
Go, leave.

52
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,112
- Just go.
- What are you talking about?

53
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:14,779
Go.

54
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:19,179
Stop fighting! The tornado is coming! Get in the car!

55
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,090
- Get into the car, Chenggui.
- Quickly!

56
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,612
Tornado.

57
00:08:30,504 --> 00:08:32,079
Get in the car!

58
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,529
- Let's go.
- Come on.

59
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:34,996
Okay.

60
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:37,320
Chenggui.

61
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,979
Brother.

62
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,312
- Don't let go.
- Hold on tight, Chenggui.

63
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:47,379
- Brother.
- Hold on tight.

64
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,012
- Chenggui. Don't let go.
- Brother, save me.

65
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:55,520
- Don't let go, Brother.
- Hold on tight.

66
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,379
Brother.

67
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:01,479
Don't let go.

68
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:04,262
- Hold on tight.
- Save me.

69
00:09:04,262 --> 00:09:06,062
Chenggui.

70
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:17,029
Brother.

71
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:18,729
Brother!

72
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:23,896
Brother.

73
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:30,503
- How are you doing, Chenggui?
- I'm fine.

74
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,312
Me too.

75
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:44,119
Xiao Hua.

76
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,138
Brother.

77
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,638
Look.

78
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,003
God has blessed us.

79
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:02,320
He knew we were having a hard time finding it, and it is right in front of us now.

80
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,987
There's more over here.

81
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:05,771
We're rich.

82
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:13,262
Come take a look.

83
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:18,337
What is that?

84
00:10:18,337 --> 00:10:20,029
Let me see.

85
00:10:26,638 --> 00:10:29,446
I guess this is the box of Emperor Yongzheng.

86
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:31,162
Not necessarily.

87
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,929
Brother, your knife.

88
00:10:34,754 --> 00:10:36,179
Here.

89
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,654
Be careful.

90
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,170
What's written on here?

91
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:16,754
I recognize two characters.

92
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:21,912
One of them is "you", and the other is "I".

93
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,862
Everything's fine. We're rich now.

94
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:45,320
It was a misunderstanding just now. Everything's fine now.

95
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,895
We're fine now, cheer up.

96
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:54,012
Let's take a picture.

97
00:11:58,312 --> 00:11:59,429
Wait.

98
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:01,245
Wait for me.

99
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,770
Okay.

100
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,004
Hurry.

101
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,220
<i>[Present Day]</i>

102
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,337
<i>Thinking about the past, I have many regrets.</i>

103
00:12:28,337 --> 00:12:32,462
<i>I hope I can mend all those moments.</i>

104
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,245
<i>For the past three months, I've been spending time in this museum.</i>

105
00:12:55,112 --> 00:13:00,529
<i>Looking at the people in these paintings, I still can feel their presence.</i>

106
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:04,929
<i>What am I looking for?</i>

107
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:10,845
<i>Am I looking for those familiar faces and trying to recall what they had said?</i>

108
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:18,454
<i>Shouldn't I understand the pain of parting by now?</i>

109
00:13:18,454 --> 00:13:24,362
<i>Is the pain of parting with a loved one really more painful than death?</i>

110
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,870
<i>What's going on with me?</i>

111
00:13:29,462 --> 00:13:34,387
<i>Am I so afraid of losing those memories so I'm unable to let it go?</i>

112
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:39,179
<i>No way.</i>

113
00:13:40,395 --> 00:13:42,719
<i>I can't keep myself here.</i>

114
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:46,187
<i>I need to move on.</i>

115
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,070
<i>What's he doing here?</i>

116
00:14:29,546 --> 00:14:32,045
<i>Are you looking for me?</i>

117
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:34,112
<i>I'm right here.</i>

118
00:14:34,738 --> 00:14:36,920
<i>Can you see me?</i>

119
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,146
<i>Do you still remember me?</i>

120
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:21,112
Do we know each other?

121
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:30,087
Are you okay?

122
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,737
<i>Do we know each other?</i>

123
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:02,187
<i>Fourth Prince.</i>

124
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:08,070
<i>No, I can't let you go.</i>

125
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,495
I'm sorry.

126
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,462
I'm sorry.

127
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:35,254
You can't run in here.

128
00:16:35,254 --> 00:16:37,054
I'm sorry.

129
00:16:58,654 --> 00:17:00,512
My balloons.

130
00:17:06,546 --> 00:17:10,129
Are you blind? You're paying me back for those balloons.

131
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,170
I'm sorry. How much is it?

132
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,329
There were many balloons. At least 500.

133
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:17,712
I don't have that much money right now.

134
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:20,120
Maybe you can give me your address. I'll bring the money to you tomorrow.

135
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,154
I don't trust you. Let me see your purse.

136
00:17:23,854 --> 00:17:25,712
Your phone looks nice.

137
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,445
I'll take this as collateral.

138
00:17:31,546 --> 00:17:33,520
This should be enough.

139
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:55,229
You know who I am now?

140
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:59,154
Do you recognize me?

141
00:18:01,671 --> 00:18:03,796
I really don't recognize you.

142
00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:13,829
I'm sorry.

143
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:18,546
I thought...

144
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,187
You were someone I knew.

145
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:29,529
Whether it's someone you thought you knew or whatever the reason is,

146
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:33,012
it's dangerous to follow a man around.

147
00:19:17,103 --> 00:19:19,229
<i>Director Yin, the chairman is here.</i>

148
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:21,296
<i>How long do you need?</i>

149
00:19:59,803 --> 00:20:01,929
Hi, Director Yin.

150
00:20:07,404 --> 00:20:08,962
Good morning, Director Yin.

151
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:10,819
Director Yin, the chairman is already in the conference room.

152
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:12,420
Everyone is waiting for you.

153
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,495
It's such a nice day. Can we talk about something else?

154
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:16,979
Regarding Aili's incident, I've asked the Internet water army to refute the rumor on Weibo.

155
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:19,945
I've just called her agent to give her a warning.

156
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:21,687
Let's go.

157
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,100
- It's Director Yin. He's so handsome.
- Director Yin.

158
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,295
Director Yin.

159
00:20:26,295 --> 00:20:28,195
Are you alright?

160
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:30,254
He is really handsome.

161
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:32,646
Director Yin.

162
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:34,270
Hi, Director Yin.

163
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,790
Hi.

164
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:43,820
Miss, please show your employee ID.

165
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,820
What?

166
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,029
Do you work here?

167
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,629
- No.
- I'm sorry.

168
00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:53,738
Only staff of Zheng Tian Group can go inside.

169
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:55,362
I'm here for an interview.

170
00:20:55,362 --> 00:20:58,480
Please proceed to the reception area to check in.

171
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,990
Please.

172
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:23,779
Don't wait for him, let's start the meeting.

173
00:21:25,487 --> 00:21:27,304
Haven't started yet?

174
00:21:27,304 --> 00:21:30,154
I could've gotten a cup of coffee from downstairs first then.

175
00:21:30,154 --> 00:21:32,662
You're 35 minutes late.

176
00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:36,796
It's 36 minutes now.

177
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:43,029
With Mr. Chairman here, there's no need for me as the vice president.

178
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:47,429
If you don't respect yourself and your work,

179
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:50,462
it's meaningless for you to stay in this conference room.

180
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,662
Mr. Chairman. Don't be angry.

181
00:21:55,662 --> 00:22:02,295
Director Yin went to the Qing Treasures Exhibition to prepare for the winter auction next month.

182
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:03,920
That's why he's late.

183
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,620
He put a lot of effort into advertising for the auction next month.

184
00:22:11,612 --> 00:22:14,296
Then let's start the meeting.

185
00:22:14,296 --> 00:22:16,137
Mr. Chairman.

186
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:19,945
First of all, I would like to apologize for being late.

187
00:22:19,945 --> 00:22:24,795
Now please just give me five minutes to explain my proposal.

188
00:22:24,795 --> 00:22:28,870
Look at that. He is well-prepared.

189
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:33,696
Since you have a plan already, just go straight to the point.

190
00:22:33,696 --> 00:22:35,712
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

191
00:22:37,512 --> 00:22:39,050
Please take a look.

192
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:43,910
Survival competition.

193
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,946
Mr. Chairman. And everyone in charge of the winter auction.

194
00:22:53,946 --> 00:23:00,637
I think the best way to advertise is to first make it become a hot topic among the people.

195
00:23:00,637 --> 00:23:04,612
And I think a survival competition is a very good way to do so.

196
00:23:04,612 --> 00:23:09,329
We can offer the title of ambassador of the auction

197
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:12,045
to organize a big audition.

198
00:23:12,045 --> 00:23:15,220
If we do this, the media will report it.

199
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,970
It's not very realistic.

200
00:23:19,212 --> 00:23:24,146
Mr. Chairman. I'm not even done yet and you already think it's unrealistic?

201
00:23:24,146 --> 00:23:28,695
What we're discussing now is the advertising plan for the winter auction.

202
00:23:28,695 --> 00:23:30,819
Not some entertainment show.

203
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:35,620
You always teach us to change and improve with the times.

204
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,820
This has nothing to do with that.

205
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,838
Of course it does.

206
00:23:40,446 --> 00:23:42,346
That's actually your biggest flaw.

207
00:23:42,346 --> 00:23:44,446
You refuse to adapt and you're opinionated.

208
00:23:44,446 --> 00:23:46,303
Vice President.

209
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,012
You always say one thing and do another.

210
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:50,612
How dare you?

211
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:56,762
You can leave.

212
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:02,596
Everyone knows about my plan now.

213
00:24:02,596 --> 00:24:06,471
Just let me know if the chairman wants to use it or not.

214
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:09,087
Mr. Chairman, I'll take my leave now.

215
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:09,487
Cheater Huang.

216
00:25:09,487 --> 00:25:11,912
How old are you? Still playing this?

217
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:17,295
How old are you? Can't even play a game with me?

218
00:25:17,295 --> 00:25:18,962
What are you doing here?

219
00:25:18,962 --> 00:25:20,687
I have big news.

220
00:25:33,154 --> 00:25:35,154
What do you want exactly?

221
00:25:37,154 --> 00:25:39,654
Come sit down first.

222
00:25:43,903 --> 00:25:48,312
Xiaoxiao, let's get back together.

223
00:25:48,945 --> 00:25:50,446
Get lost.

224
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:54,654
I thought you just started a new relationship.

225
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:57,154
You broke up already?

226
00:25:57,154 --> 00:25:59,987
Don't mention her, she spends a lot.

227
00:25:59,987 --> 00:26:04,237
All my credit cards got maxed out. My debit card too.

228
00:26:04,237 --> 00:26:09,354
Now I have no money left. But it helped me realize something.

229
00:26:09,354 --> 00:26:12,054
You're the one who treats me the best.

230
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:16,246
Xiaoxiao, forgive me. I won't cheat on you again.

231
00:26:16,246 --> 00:26:18,404
I won't get seduced by other girls anymore.

232
00:26:18,404 --> 00:26:21,312
Stop.

233
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:25,187
I don't want to hear this anymore. And stop playing the victim.

234
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:30,662
We're done.

235
00:26:40,604 --> 00:26:43,103
Find a basement room for 40 yuan a day.

236
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:46,962
This is enough for two weeks of expenses. You're on your own after that.

237
00:26:46,962 --> 00:26:49,903
Xiaoxiao,

238
00:26:49,903 --> 00:26:53,903
since your accident, housing prices have soared.

239
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:57,170
Where can I find a basement room for 40 yuan a day?

240
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,945
How much do you need then?

241
00:27:02,195 --> 00:27:05,679
I'm not here to ask you for money.

242
00:27:07,754 --> 00:27:11,879
I know I've wronged you in many ways.

243
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:14,719
I cheated on you and upset you.

244
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:17,696
I know you don't believe that I still love you.

245
00:27:17,696 --> 00:27:19,690
But...

246
00:27:20,445 --> 00:27:25,403
Taking into consideration that we've been together for three years, can't you allow me to stay?

247
00:27:25,403 --> 00:27:29,971
You should take responsibility for me, Xiaoxiao.

248
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,512
Xiaoxiao,

249
00:27:37,512 --> 00:27:41,012
I'd rather be crying on your bathroom floor

250
00:27:41,012 --> 00:27:44,429
than be smiling on a bed of a basement room.

251
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,362
Xiaoxiao, please let me stay.

252
00:27:47,362 --> 00:27:49,820
I know you'll allow me to stay.

253
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,695
Because you are the kindest, the most gentle, the prettiest...

254
00:27:53,695 --> 00:27:56,203
Enough.

255
00:27:56,803 --> 00:27:58,870
I'll do this for you one last time.

256
00:27:59,562 --> 00:28:01,662
It's the last time.

257
00:28:01,662 --> 00:28:04,904
You can only stay here for a month. After that you need to move out.

258
00:28:04,904 --> 00:28:06,519
Understand?

259
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,187
Yes.

260
00:28:10,187 --> 00:28:12,738
Understood.

261
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,879
Where should I sleep?

262
00:28:21,738 --> 00:28:23,529
The bathroom.

263
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:29,087
You really want me to sleep in the bathroom?

264
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:30,696
That was your own choice.

265
00:28:30,696 --> 00:28:34,519
Shit. I was just kidding.

266
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:37,380
<i>[Qing Treasures Exhibition]</i>

267
00:28:39,112 --> 00:28:41,487
You went to the museum again?

268
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:44,045
It's been three months since you woke up.

269
00:28:44,045 --> 00:28:46,871
Why you go to the museum everyday?

270
00:28:46,871 --> 00:28:50,895
I know you might think that I'm long-winded, but I ask because I care about you.

271
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:55,129
In this cold city, I'm the one that cares about you the most.

272
00:28:55,129 --> 00:28:59,362
I don't want to see you playing as the museum curator.

273
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:02,170
Sooner or later, you'll go crazy.

274
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:05,219
Although you had a dream

275
00:29:05,219 --> 00:29:09,738
that all the men in the Qing Dynasty fell in love with you, you still need to come back to reality.

276
00:29:09,738 --> 00:29:14,554
In the real world, I, Huang Di, is the one that loves you the most.

277
00:29:14,554 --> 00:29:16,096
Enough.

278
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:21,087
You can stay here, but food is at your own expense.

279
00:29:21,087 --> 00:29:25,354
And also... don't say the word "love" in front of me.

280
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:35,304
Xiaoxiao, I'm so hungry.

281
00:29:35,304 --> 00:29:37,820
Make me some food.

282
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,819
Food is at your own expense. Don't make me repeat myself again.

283
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:44,596
I really don't have any money.

284
00:29:44,596 --> 00:29:47,703
You can search me if you don't believe me.

285
00:29:50,095 --> 00:29:51,912
What's wrong?

286
00:29:52,729 --> 00:29:54,295
Nothing.

287
00:29:55,646 --> 00:29:58,095
You met someone?

288
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:01,420
It was just a random guess.

289
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,571
You really did?

290
00:30:03,571 --> 00:30:07,287
Ex-boyfriend? Ex-ex-boyfriend?

291
00:30:07,287 --> 00:30:09,287
- Ex-ex-ex...
- Stop it.

292
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,287
Give it back.

293
00:30:16,896 --> 00:30:20,187
This is our boss' fake son.

294
00:30:20,187 --> 00:30:21,612
What?

295
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:25,462
This is Zhen Tian Group's Kang Zhentian's adopted son.

296
00:30:25,462 --> 00:30:27,320
I know him.

297
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,079
You know him?

298
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:33,738
Director Yin, I just met with the chairman.

299
00:30:33,738 --> 00:30:36,620
He seems to be bringing an antique specialist to check out the exhibition antiques in the storeroom.

300
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,803
But I can tell he's still mad at you.

301
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:43,671
One more thing, I heard that Kang Sihan is back.

302
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,079
- Hello?
- <i>Director Yin, the flowers will be there before 4 o'clock.</i>

303
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,754
<i>Don't worry.</i>

304
00:31:09,754 --> 00:31:11,729
Great job.

305
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:14,596
I asked you to find out why Kang Sihan is back.

306
00:31:14,596 --> 00:31:16,362
Did you find out?

307
00:31:16,362 --> 00:31:20,712
Yin Zheng's mother is Kang Zhentian's second wife.

308
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:25,037
And Kang Zhentian is Yin Zheng's mother's second husband too.

309
00:31:25,037 --> 00:31:29,929
And I heard that Kang Zhentian has another son.

310
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:34,379
That means he has a brother.

311
00:31:34,379 --> 00:31:37,571
Yin Zheng's background is very complicated.

312
00:31:37,571 --> 00:31:41,229
Don't even think about approaching him.

313
00:31:41,229 --> 00:31:48,120
If you like those kind of playboys, you might as well come back to me.

314
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,154
What are you talking about?

315
00:31:50,962 --> 00:31:53,210
Come on.

316
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,800
Come with me.

317
00:32:01,654 --> 00:32:04,220
Take a look.

318
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,571
Look at his scandals.

319
00:32:06,571 --> 00:32:10,919
As I was saying, unfaithfulness is hereditary.

320
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:13,503
Take my dad for example. He is a playboy.

321
00:32:13,503 --> 00:32:17,096
That's why it's difficult for me to be loyal to women.

322
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:19,970
It's hard for me too.

323
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,554
Xiaoxiao. Can you sympathize with me now?

324
00:32:23,554 --> 00:32:25,103
Shut up.

325
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:30,187
Why did you take pictures of him?

326
00:32:31,938 --> 00:32:33,760
You have a crush on him?

327
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,670
Love at first sight?

328
00:32:37,504 --> 00:32:39,479
Or did he take advantage of you?

329
00:32:40,112 --> 00:32:42,419
Are you guys in a relationship already?

330
00:32:43,571 --> 00:32:45,337
He would never be interested in you.

331
00:32:45,337 --> 00:32:47,871
You don't have a sexy figure nor are you pretty enough.

332
00:32:47,871 --> 00:32:49,487
Shut up.

333
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:52,920
I'll go to buy something to eat then.

334
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,129
<i>Why does he look so much like him?</i>

335
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:01,446
<i>Very familiar.</i>

336
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,587
<i>Is it just a coincidence?</i>

337
00:33:20,137 --> 00:33:22,954
<i>Give it to me.</i>

338
00:33:40,903 --> 00:33:44,729
This hairpin and I are really meant to be.

339
00:33:45,446 --> 00:33:52,212
When I first saw it 25 years ago, it was buried under the sand.

340
00:33:52,212 --> 00:33:56,612
I never thought it would come back to me again.

341
00:33:56,612 --> 00:33:58,638
What a miracle.

342
00:33:58,638 --> 00:34:01,803
Mr. Chairman, you're blessed. That's why your wishes always come true.

343
00:34:01,803 --> 00:34:04,162
Right, right.

344
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:06,903
Mr. Chairman,

345
00:34:06,903 --> 00:34:13,079
this hairpin is the only antique from Yongzheng's dynasty that we have for the auction.

346
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:16,129
It has delicate carving.

347
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:19,371
It is made of top quality jade and looks smooth.

348
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:21,204
- Right.
- It's a quality antique.

349
00:34:21,204 --> 00:34:23,054
- Yes.
- It will definitely sell for a lot.

350
00:34:23,054 --> 00:34:26,420
Yes.

351
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,095
It's not for sale.

352
00:34:28,696 --> 00:34:31,545
It'll just be put on display but not for sale.

353
00:34:31,545 --> 00:34:33,220
Xiao Chen.

354
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,446
Take good care of it for me.

355
00:34:35,446 --> 00:34:40,812
This hairpin means a lot to me.

356
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,638
So this is the famous Zhen Tian Building.

357
00:34:50,638 --> 00:34:54,729
How imposing.

358
00:34:54,729 --> 00:34:56,546
I've been here before.

359
00:34:56,546 --> 00:34:57,920
Wait.

360
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,629
I work for the Zheng Tian Group planning department.

361
00:35:03,629 --> 00:35:05,712
What?

362
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:10,103
An employee.

363
00:35:10,103 --> 00:35:11,770
Enough nonsense.

364
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,379
<i>[Zhen Tian Group]</i>

365
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:16,662
Wait for me. Let me give you a brief.

366
00:35:17,237 --> 00:35:20,320
The chairman's office is on the 38th floor,

367
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,137
which is also the highest floor in this building.

368
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:26,370
Yin Zheng's office is on the 37th floor.

369
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,354
To occupy such a lofty position, second only to the chairman.

370
00:35:29,354 --> 00:35:32,412
That feeling is just like being in an imperial palace.

371
00:35:33,404 --> 00:35:36,587
<i>This is my only chance to get in touch with Yin Zheng.</i>

372
00:35:36,587 --> 00:35:39,254
<i>Maybe I will get my answers very soon.</i>

373
00:35:42,462 --> 00:35:45,354
It's all up to you from here on out.

374
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:46,754
Let's go.

375
00:35:54,962 --> 00:35:56,870
Come on.

376
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,540
Hurry.

377
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,687
Zhang Xiao.

378
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:52,520
Take a seat.

379
00:36:54,903 --> 00:36:57,420
Where did you work previously?

380
00:36:58,103 --> 00:37:02,729
At an advertisement company. I've also built a webpage for a magazine.

381
00:37:02,729 --> 00:37:06,420
You often change your job. And you didn't last long for any of them.

382
00:37:17,629 --> 00:37:21,487
You just have a bachelor's degree and from a third-rate university.

383
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:25,420
You don't have much work experience, and the companies you worked for are all pretty unpopular.

384
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:30,154
You should know that Zhen Tian Group is the leader

385
00:37:30,154 --> 00:37:33,212
in the auction house, jewelry, and Yuesai cosmetics industries.

386
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:39,062
Our jewelry and cosmetics target the elite group.

387
00:37:40,254 --> 00:37:44,404
Do you think we need someone like you?

388
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,345
You can take a look at my previous designs first.

389
00:37:55,495 --> 00:38:00,403
Insights and anima are the most important things for a designer.

390
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,887
Although I don't have much working experience

391
00:38:02,887 --> 00:38:07,862
I hope that I can have a chance to showcase my talents here.

392
00:38:07,862 --> 00:38:09,920
You're asking for a lot.

393
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,003
Not classy at all.

394
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:15,320
Fortunately, your look passes the test.

395
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,054
But if you want to stay here for long, good looks won't be enough.

396
00:38:18,054 --> 00:38:19,879
So.

397
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:23,229
You can go home now.

398
00:38:27,554 --> 00:38:31,920
Good morning, Mr. Chairman.

399
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,554
<i>He's Zhen Tian Group's chairman?</i>

400
00:38:34,554 --> 00:38:37,320
<i>He looks just like Kangxi.</i>

401
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:42,812
Please take your seats.

402
00:38:46,504 --> 00:38:47,862
What's your name?

403
00:38:47,862 --> 00:38:50,495
Mr. Chairman, these are her personal details.

404
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:56,729
My name is Zhang Xiao.

405
00:38:56,729 --> 00:38:59,387
I'm here to interview for the graphic designer role.

406
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:01,838
Why do you want to work here?

407
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:07,312
Your resume doesn't really fulfill our company's requirements.

408
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:10,304
I want a fresh start.

409
00:39:11,129 --> 00:39:15,762
You're only 25. And you already want a fresh start?

410
00:39:15,762 --> 00:39:19,546
I didn't know what kind of job I wanted before.

411
00:39:19,546 --> 00:39:23,787
Now I want a new opportunity for growth.

412
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:29,404
We have a Spring Auction next month.

413
00:39:29,404 --> 00:39:36,179
What do you know about the ancient emperors from the past 5000 years of Chinese civilization?

414
00:39:37,746 --> 00:39:43,329
I think the emperor that I most familiar with is Emperor Kangxi.

415
00:39:43,979 --> 00:39:46,270
Emperor Kangxi?

416
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:50,762
Tell me you think about Emperor Kangxi.

417
00:39:51,437 --> 00:39:54,838
His merits and demerits will be assessed by history.

418
00:39:54,838 --> 00:40:01,712
What I respect the most about him is that during his 61 years on the throne, he never stopped working for even a day.

419
00:40:01,712 --> 00:40:05,571
He was diligent and loved his people. He was one in a million.

420
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:12,154
Unfortunately, he was faced with a great dilemma due to disputes of throne succession.

421
00:40:12,154 --> 00:40:17,019
I think that was his biggest pain too.

422
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:26,771
If you were to describe him with a poem, which poem suits him the most?

423
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:36,404
It's a pity Emperor Qin and Emperor Wu were lacking in literary grace.

424
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:41,003
Emperor Taizong and Emperor Taizu lacked poetry in their letters.

425
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:47,512
Genghis Khan, the proud son of Heaven, knew only of bending his bows to shoot eagles.

426
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:55,570
They're all people of the past; Brilliant heroes are those whom we will see today!

427
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:06,362
You are quite interesting.

428
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:12,154
Your hometown is Ganlin?

429
00:41:12,154 --> 00:41:14,129
Yes.

430
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:16,562
Ganlin is a good place.

431
00:41:17,919 --> 00:41:21,003
What do your parents do now?

432
00:41:21,003 --> 00:41:25,620
My father was a physical education teacher but he's retired.

433
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,146
My mother passed away when I was young.

434
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,696
Mr. Chairman, have a safe journey.

435
00:41:36,504 --> 00:41:38,129
Come to work tomorrow.

436
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:39,746
Really?

437
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,487
Of course.

438
00:41:43,237 --> 00:41:45,295
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

439
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:51,254
Mr. Chairman, do you like tea?

440
00:41:51,254 --> 00:41:56,179
So you are trying to find out my hobbies before you even start working here?

441
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:58,220
Are you trying to please me?

442
00:42:00,212 --> 00:42:01,845
No.

443
00:42:06,919 --> 00:42:10,862
It'll take more than some flattery and a pretty face to hold your ground here.

444
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:14,179
Remember to report to me tomorrow.

445
00:42:19,587 --> 00:42:24,929
I want that girl's family background and detailed information on her parents.

446
00:42:24,929 --> 00:42:26,996
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

447
00:42:41,419 --> 00:42:44,612
Cheater Huang. I have some bad news for you.

448
00:42:44,612 --> 00:42:47,138
I passed the interview.

449
00:42:49,045 --> 00:42:51,045
I will start working tomorrow.

450
00:42:51,045 --> 00:42:53,303
Okay, see you later.

Are you okay?

453
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,879
Lan Lan. Are you okay?

454
00:43:33,879 --> 00:43:37,219
- Lan Lan.
- Excuse me.

455
00:43:37,219 --> 00:43:39,362
Lan Lan, are you alright?

456
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:52,304
Ms. Lan, let's go take a break.

457
00:43:52,304 --> 00:43:55,304
Come, follow me.

458
00:43:55,304 --> 00:43:58,587
<i>Who was that?</i>

459
00:43:58,587 --> 00:44:00,995
<i>Why does she look exactly like me?</i>

460
00:44:01,696 --> 00:44:03,704
<i>She is Ruoxi.</i>
