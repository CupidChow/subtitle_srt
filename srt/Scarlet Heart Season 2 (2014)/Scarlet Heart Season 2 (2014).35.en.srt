00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:43,020
<i>[Episode 35]</i>

3
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:52,083
What did you want to tell me about Sihan?

4
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,934
Sihan doesn't know the direction of the company

5
00:01:57,934 --> 00:02:02,034
because he's been gone for so long.

6
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,200
He asked me to ask you

7
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,434
about the situation now.

8
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:10,934
As you can see,

9
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:12,892
we are now shooting a video.

10
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:16,600
It's to promote the company's brand Yue-Sai.

11
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,451
At the same time, it's also my current attitude on life.

12
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:27,251
How did you come up with this idea?

13
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:33,276
<i>Maybe I can pass my current thoughts to Sihan through her.</i>

14
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:39,867
I'm sure you know that in the past year,

15
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:42,617
Zhen Tian Group has been through a lot of hardships.

16
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:46,542
I've been reflecting on it.

17
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:51,542
So I asked myself, life's short so what do I want in life?

18
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:55,800
After so many things happened,

19
00:02:56,617 --> 00:02:59,300
I finally realized

20
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,784
that I did a lot of wrong things at my young age.

21
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,367
I've also lost the most precious thing in my life.

22
00:03:13,034 --> 00:03:16,984
So I decided to shoot this video in hopes that it can send a message

23
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:21,099
that when you finally realize your mistakes,

24
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:23,334
you should start over again.

25
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:28,259
Continue to chase the warmth and beauty of life.

26
00:03:30,575 --> 00:03:32,092
Luckily,

27
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:35,190
I still have time.

28
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,667
Luckily,

29
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:40,434
we can still make it.

30
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,342
I hope you can understand how I feel.

31
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:52,942
I get it.

32
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,240
That's also how I feel.

33
00:03:57,767 --> 00:04:01,800
<i>We used to share the same beliefs,</i>

34
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:07,618
<i>so we decided to be a couple.</i>

35
00:04:07,618 --> 00:04:11,540
<i>Now we still share the same beliefs,</i>

36
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:15,851
<i>so we put our past behind us and became friends.</i>

37
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,967
By the way,

38
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:30,134
I met Zhang Xiao when I was in Ganlin.

39
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:35,700
She was the one who brought Siyu to us

40
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,880
to find Sihan.

41
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:42,383
But she left Ganlin after that.

42
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,667
I'm finally hearing some news about her.

43
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:55,767
I hope she can see that you've changed

44
00:04:58,076 --> 00:05:00,520
after the video is launched.

45
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:05,180
She'll come back to you.

46
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,751
Thank you.

47
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,917
I also hope that you and Sihan can cherish what you have now.

48
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:20,959
Thank you.

49
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,899
You went to see him.

50
00:06:11,118 --> 00:06:12,826
I don't want to lie to you.

51
00:06:13,826 --> 00:06:15,626
I saw Yin Zheng.

52
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:18,876
So?

53
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:26,575
He's shooting a video.

54
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:28,976
It's about what we want in life.

55
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:33,017
The video encapsulates his current thoughts.

56
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:36,584
So?

57
00:06:40,742 --> 00:06:45,134
Yin Zheng is no longer who he was.

58
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,417
He's not after fame and money anymore.

59
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:51,226
He values relationships.

60
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,983
So I believe that he was being truthful with what he said to you.

61
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,726
He's no longer who he was?

62
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,450
Perfect.

63
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,350
Lan Lan is no longer who she was before either.

64
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,809
You should get with him again.

65
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:19,118
Sihan, I'm very sure about this.

66
00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:22,018
He's fine without me.

67
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:24,309
But you are different.

68
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:26,283
You've suffered so much.

69
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:29,050
You still haven't let go of the hate.

70
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,818
So you feel sorry for me?

71
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:36,809
You just feel sorry for me?

72
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:38,225
Sorry, I don't need it.

73
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:41,470
Go find him.

74
00:07:42,742 --> 00:07:45,325
I know you don't mean that.

75
00:07:45,325 --> 00:07:47,867
He realized his mistakes.

76
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:51,200
Why can't you just let it go?

77
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,890
We can start a new life.

78
00:07:54,617 --> 00:07:56,517
I won't leave you.

79
00:07:56,517 --> 00:08:00,309
You won't leave me?

80
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:02,809
I asked you to stay away from him but you still went to see him.

81
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:05,142
Now you want to lecture me?

82
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:08,692
Sure, he's the sun.

83
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:11,684
And I am hell.

84
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:14,600
Go find your sun.

85
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:30,990
Fine, I will.

86
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:39,520
Go.

87

Didn't you say this was our home?

101
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:35,142
I've never had a home.

102
00:10:35,142 --> 00:10:39,026
This is the only place that's mine.

103
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:43,809
Do you still want me to leave?

104
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:16,000
Don't ask me to leave.

105
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:20,317
I don't want to go.

106
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:23,709
I don't want to go.

107
00:11:32,283 --> 00:11:33,959
Sorry.

108
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:40,309
I shouldn't have hurt you.

109
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:43,018
I'm the one who's sorry.

110
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:45,684
You're the only one who lives in my heart.

111
00:11:45,684 --> 00:11:49,600
There's no Yin Zheng.

112
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,575
I love you.

00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,517
Uncle.

118
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,475
Excuse me.

119
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:35,700
Have you seen this girl before?

120
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,600
She is a new teacher.

121
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,659
Teacher?

122
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:40,350
Then do you know which school she's at?

123
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,976
We only have one school.

124
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:44,642
Just go straight from here.

125
00:12:44,642 --> 00:12:45,851
Thank you.

126
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:47,626
You're welcome.

127
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:20,867
There's no one here.

128
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,834
<i>It's hard for the kids here to get to school</i>

129
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:30,851
<i>because there's no road that leads to the school.</i>

130
00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:42,792
Hold hands.

131
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,784
Be careful.

132
00:13:49,784 --> 00:13:50,918
Slow down.

133
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:52,600
Be careful.

134
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,283
- Take your time.
- Miss Zhang.

135
00:13:55,283 --> 00:13:56,200
Don't keep going.

136
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,392
The bridge collapsed up there.

137
00:13:58,392 --> 00:14:00,934
The bridge collapsed? What do we do now?

138
00:14:00,934 --> 00:14:01,834
Is there another route?

139
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:04,100
No, you have to go around.

140
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,100
Go around?

141
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,200
Yes.

142
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,500
But then we won't make it back before sundown.

143
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,617
There's no other way.

144
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:11,325
You'll have to go around.

145
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:12,167
Thank you.

146
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:13,383
Let's go.

147
00:14:13,383 --> 00:14:15,267
We can walk faster.

148
00:14:15,267 --> 00:14:16,726
Yes, let's go.

149
00:14:16,726 --> 00:14:19,051
We'll walk faster.

150
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:22,700
Okay, we'll walk faster.

151
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,375
Let's go.

152
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:26,909
Okay, let's go.

153
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,520
Be careful.

154
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,120
Keep up.

155
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:35,367
Follow me.

156
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:49,784
I am here to help.

157
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:52,834
Let's get in.

158
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:55,142
- Yay!
- Let's get in.

159
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:56,526
One at a time.

160
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:58,951
- This is great.
- Be careful.

161
00:14:58,951 --> 00:15:00,159
Come.

162
00:15:03,283 --> 00:15:04,642
Let's go.

163
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,142
This is all I have.

164
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:12,600
Eat up.

165
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,100
Thank you.

166
00:15:14,684 --> 00:15:17,400
How long do you plan on being here?

167
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:25,518
Thank you for helping us.

168
00:15:26,784 --> 00:15:29,934
I don't want to answer your question

169
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:31,618
about my personal life.

170
00:15:33,742 --> 00:15:37,492
It is meaningful to teach here.

171
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:40,909
But are you going to stay here forever?

172
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,267
Xinyi's dreams led me here.

173
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:47,759
But this is a quiet place.

174
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:52,617
It can at least let me feel peace.

175
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:56,450
Are you really going to give up your life for Xinyi?

176
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,799
And forget about all your friends?

177
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:02,325
I know what is important

178
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:04,270
and what is not important.

179
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:08,475
What's important or not important.

180
00:16:08,475 --> 00:16:10,718
I'm sure you can figure it out.

181
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,767
How about this?

182
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:14,492
If you don't think I am a trouble,

183
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:16,059
I will stay here for a few more days.

184
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,967
Just let me know if you need help with anything.

185
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,851
Thank you for the noodles.

186
00:16:21,851 --> 00:16:23,426
I'll get going now.

187
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,650
<i>Princess, another day has gone by.</i>

188
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:45,100
<i>I brought the children to the wilderness today.</i>

189
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,492
<i>They were really excited.</i>

190
00:16:47,492 --> 00:16:50,434
<i>They weren't even worried that the bridge collapsed</i>

191
00:16:50,434 --> 00:16:53,480
<i>and were excited to go around.</i>

192
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,267
<i>They're naive.</i>

193
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:58,517
<i>They have the courage to keep moving forward.</i>

194
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:02,700
<i>I think that's what I need now.</i>

195
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,517
See you.

196
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:08,567
Be careful.

197
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:10,909
We will.

198
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:11,809
Miss Zhang.

199
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:15,434
Your friend from Beijing is fixing a road for the school.

200
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,267
Fixing the road?

201
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:18,118
Yes, they've been doing it since this morning.

202
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:20,159
Even the village chief is there.

203
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:21,199
This is great.

204
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,892
The kids don't have to walk on the dirt road to get to school anymore.

205
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:25,918
Got it, thank you.

206
00:17:25,918 --> 00:17:27,600
I'll go take a look then.

207
00:17:48,242 --> 00:17:50,659
Thank you for doing this.

208
00:17:51,951 --> 00:17:55,784
But you don't have to stay here.

209
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,225
I'm sure you have your own business to attend to.

210
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:01,492
Friends should help each other.

211
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:04,659
I can stay away from you if you don't want to see me.

212
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,351
What are you doing here?

213
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,826
You're finally asking me that question.

214
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:17,100
It's pretty simple.

215
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,217
I think you know.

216
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:24,142
Did your Big Brother send you here?

217
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,892
No.

218
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:29,742
I just don't want to see you guys like this.

219
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,934
I think love should be simple.

220
00:18:32,934 --> 00:18:36,809
Since you love each other, you should go find him.

221
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,659
I don't want to see you guys apart like this.

222
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:42,575
You're both suffering.

223
00:18:42,575 --> 00:18:44,709
You're making it too complicated.

224
00:18:45,976 --> 00:18:50,226
You wouldn't understand.

225
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:54,492
You're right, I don't.

226
00:18:54,492 --> 00:18:58,083
But I'm sure it's not hard to understand.

227
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:01,976
Why are you finding trouble for yourselves?

228
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:08,600
Fine, don't tell me.

229
00:19:09,118 --> 00:19:11,409
I know what my mission is.

230
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,751
Your mission?

231
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:20,409
It's like in basketball.

232
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,767
Every player has their own duty and task.

233
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:26,283
But there is a special position.

234
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:28,325
He fills the spot wherever there's a gap.

235
00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:31,434
He will solve any problem.

236
00:19:33,742 --> 00:19:35,309
I am this kind of player.

237
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:38,009
I am wherever I'm needed.

238
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:42,409
"I'm here"?

239
00:19:54,475 --> 00:20:00,492
Cow.

240
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:05,876
Head.

241
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:07,125
Okay, go.

242
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,459
Go.

243
00:20:11,183 --> 00:20:12,334
Let me try it.

244
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:14,900
Okay, start over.

245
00:20:20,142 --> 00:20:21,534
Here.

246
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:25,325
Okay, go play now.

247
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,192
- Be careful.
- Okay, let's go.

248
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,851
Take it easy.

249
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:30,300
Be careful.

250
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:42,192
Pass it to me.

251
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,042
Here.

252
00:20:45,042 --> 00:20:48,575
We want to play.

253
00:20:48,575 --> 00:20:50,942
Okay, go play.

254
00:20:52,475 --> 00:20:54,442
- Pass it to me.
- Give it to me.

255
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:56,459
Over there.

256
00:20:56,459 --> 00:20:57,850
Go.

257
00:20:58,734 --> 00:21:01,018
Pass it to me.

258
00:21:01,892 --> 00:21:06,492
<i>Princess, Siyu and I are teaching the kids together.</i>

259
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:08,809
<i>It's like having a helper.</i>

260
00:21:10,492 --> 00:21:13,351
<i>But I don't feel relaxed at all.</i>

261
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:17,283
<i>Because his perseverance</i>

262
00:21:17,283 --> 00:21:20,100
<i>is because he wants me to go back and face him.</i>

263
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,767
<i>How can I face him?</i>

264
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:27,642
I officially announce,

265
00:21:27,642 --> 00:21:29,383
that starting from today,

266
00:21:29,383 --> 00:21:33,042
Kang Sihan is Zhen Tian Group's new CEO.

267
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:51,275
Best of luck, Sihan.

268
00:21:53,751 --> 00:21:55,183
<i>Yin Zheng.</i>

269
00:21:55,183 --> 00:22:00,626
<i>I will take back everything you took from me.</i>

270
00:22:00,626 --> 00:22:05,134
<i>I'll also take away everything that belongs to you.</i>

271
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:24,151
<i>Zhang Xiao.</i>

272
00:22:24,151 --> 00:22:26,792
<i>I made this video for you.</i>

273
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:30,818
<i>I hope you can see it and come back to me.</i>

274
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:41,450
Zhang Xiao.

275
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,934
I'm going back tomorrow.

276
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:46,851
I'm worried about my dad.

277
00:22:46,851 --> 00:22:49,142
How is he now?

278
00:22:49,142 --> 00:22:53,034
He had a stroke. It's bad.

279
00:22:53,034 --> 00:22:55,000
Then you should go back.

280
00:23:09,492 --> 00:23:12,059
It's the company's latest advertisement.

281
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,000
Big Brother planned it himself.

282
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,826
Siyu.

283
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:34,559
When is your flight tomorrow?

284
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,534
I want to go with you.

285
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:39,290
You made up your mind?

286
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:43,509
I was actually always prepared to go back to Beijing.

287
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,650
I just came here to fulfill Xinyi's wish.

288
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:53,334
And I was waiting.

289
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:56,809
I was waiting for your Big Brother to let go of hate.

290
00:23:58,425 --> 00:24:02,742
I think I can go back to him now.

291
00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:06,100
Should I change the flight to tonight?

292
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,892
Keep it for tomorrow morning.

293
00:24:07,892 --> 00:24:10,700
I want to say goodbye to the kids.

294
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,050
Okay.

295
00:24:23,851 --> 00:24:25,709
Kids.

296
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:28,325
I want to tell you something.

297
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:30,584
I'm leaving tomorrow.

298
00:24:30,584 --> 00:24:32,134
Don't go.

299
00:24:32,134 --> 00:24:34,542
- Don't go.
- We will miss you.

300
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:37,600
Don't go.

301
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,483
I miss my family.

302
00:24:42,434 --> 00:24:44,559
But I promise you.

303
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,025
I'll come back to visit every year at this time.

304
00:24:49,025 --> 00:24:54,684
Don't go.

305
00:24:56,118 --> 00:24:58,667
You can write letters to me.

306
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:03,640
Don't go.

307
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,200
Don't leave us.

308
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:10,959
Be good.

309
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,475
<i>I'm leaving here</i>

310
00:25:15,475 --> 00:25:18,450
<i>with love from all the kids.</i>

311
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:23,142
<i>Princess, you gave this to me.</i>

312
00:25:23,142 --> 00:25:24,618
<i>Thank you.</i>

313
00:25:49,018 --> 00:25:50,099
Doctor.

314
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:52,934
If there is even the slightest chance,

315
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:54,851
please save my dad.

316
00:25:54,851 --> 00:25:56,059
Sorry.

317
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:58,125
We tried our best.

318
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:02,392
But due to the changes in adrenaline at the end of one's life,

319
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:04,684
he might be able to talk

320
00:26:04,684 --> 00:26:09,550
after he wakes up again.

321
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,092
You should prepare for his funeral.

322
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:17,159
Aunt Lan.

323
00:26:20,076 --> 00:26:22,099
Help me inside.

324
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:24,751
I want to talk with him.

325
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,642
Mom.

326
00:26:26,642 --> 00:26:28,559
Let me go in.

327
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,534
This is my last chance to apologize to him.

328
00:26:30,534 --> 00:26:31,626
Please.

329
00:26:31,626 --> 00:26:35,367
Leave.

330
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:37,842
Mom.

331
00:26:38,475 --> 00:26:40,492
Sihan, please.

332
00:26:40,492 --> 00:26:42,925
I want to see him before he goes.

333
00:26:45,976 --> 00:26:47,709
Please.

334
00:26:49,884 --> 00:26:52,999
Okay, I'll try my best.

335
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,059
Zhentian, don't worry.

336
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:21,390
I'm here with you.

337
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm here.

338
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,851
Zhentian, I'm here with you.

339
00:27:27,851 --> 00:27:29,876
I'm here.

340
00:27:30,976 --> 00:27:32,517
I'm here.

341
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,699
Don't worry, Zhentian.

342
00:27:35,992 --> 00:27:37,459
Zhentian.

343
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,742
Sihan is here.

344
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:44,859
Dad.

345
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:48,584
Dad.

346
00:27:49,742 --> 00:27:51,226
I'm here.

347
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:56,509
Dad.

348
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:04,375
Zheng... Yu...

349
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:06,184
Siyu?

350
00:28:06,742 --> 00:28:08,099
Dad.

351
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:09,492
Siyu is on his way.

352
00:28:09,492 --> 00:28:11,500
He'll be here soon.

353
00:28:12,934 --> 00:28:14,800
Don't worry.

354
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:18,067
Zheng...

355
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:22,384
Yin Zheng.

356
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:28,876
Yin... Zheng...

357
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:48,500
Zheng...

358
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,467
He's outside.

359
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:53,883
I get what you mean.

360
00:29:01,976 --> 00:29:04,642
Sihan, is Dad awake?

361
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,542
Let me go inside.

362
00:29:10,892 --> 00:29:14,018
Yin Zheng, Aunt Lan has low blood sugar.

363
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,784
Can you go downstairs to buy her some chocolate?

364
00:29:21,018 --> 00:29:22,818
Go now.

365
00:29:24,726 --> 00:29:26,767
Brother, how's Dad doing?

366
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:27,826
How is Uncle Kang?

367
00:29:27,826 --> 00:29:28,784
You're finally here.

368
00:29:28,784 --> 00:29:30,800
Go inside.

369
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:45,125
Dad.

370
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:47,592
Dad.

371
00:29:52,484 --> 00:29:54,926
Siyu.

372
00:30:01,976 --> 00:30:03,634
Zheng...

373
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:10,600
Dad, he went downstairs.

374
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:15,834
Zheng...

375
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,976
Dad.

376
00:30:29,525 --> 00:30:32,767
Zhentian, don't worry.

377
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,584
Don't worry.

378
00:30:44,017 --> 00:30:46,484
Xiao...

379
00:30:48,626 --> 00:30:52,042
- Uncle Kang, I'm here.
- Xiao...

380
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:54,090
Xiao...

381
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:11,109
Resolve...

382
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:15,060
Resolve...

383
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:21,534
Resolve...

384
00:31:22,225 --> 00:31:27,426
Resolve...

385
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:33,050
I understand.

386
00:31:38,592 --> 00:31:40,783
Thank you.

387
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,151
Xiao...

388
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:50,067
Zhentian.

389
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:53,434
We're all here.

390
00:31:53,434 --> 00:31:55,642
Don't worry.

391
00:32:12,892 --> 00:32:14,250
Dad.

392
00:32:20,617 --> 00:32:22,000
Dad.

393
00:32:22,826 --> 00:32:25,200
Dad!

394
00:32:26,826 --> 00:32:29,617
- Dad!
- Dad.

395
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:32,500
His hand is still warm.

396
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,600
- Dad.
- He's still so handsome.

397
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,360
- Dad!
- Dad!

398
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:42,440
His hand is still warm.

399
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:14,392
I'm sorry.

400
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:20,899
I'm sorry.

401
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:27,199
I'm sorry.

402
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:36,967
I'm sorry.

403
00:33:40,225 --> 00:33:41,834
Dad.

404
00:34:15,142 --> 00:34:17,959
I know you're sad

405
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,851
because you couldn't see Uncle Kang before he died.

406
00:34:24,851 --> 00:34:27,600
Thinking back on everything I've done,

407
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:32,659
I hate myself for my childish and ignorant behavior.

408
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:43,142
I couldn't see my dad before he died.

409
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:48,667
He asked for you

410
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,134
before he died.

411
00:34:55,784 --> 00:34:57,309
I believe

412
00:34:58,951 --> 00:35:01,000
that he has forgiven you.

413
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,918
But I can't forgive myself.

414
00:35:54,392 --> 00:35:58,325
We grieve for the death of Mr. Kang Zhentian.

415
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:03,142
Mr. Kang has been in the business for over 40 years.

416
00:36:03,142 --> 00:36:08,984
He has built an empire that has global influences.

417
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:14,442
His death will be our biggest loss.

418
00:36:15,325 --> 00:36:19,659
Please give Mr. Kang three minutes of silence.

419
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:33,626
Thank you.

420
00:36:34,934 --> 00:36:37,083
First bow.

421
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:42,175
Second bow.

422
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,292
Third bow.

423
00:36:48,892 --> 00:36:50,967
Final bow.

424
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:54,959
You may now pay your respects.

425
00:37:00,976 --> 00:37:04,660
My condolences.

426
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,584
Thank you.

427
00:37:06,584 --> 00:37:08,242
My condolences.

428
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:10,626
- Thank you.
- My condolences.

429
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:13,450
My condolences.

430
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,783
Mom.

431
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:43,909
I want to talk to Sihan.

432
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:52,959
Sihan.

433
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:58,099
I want to talk to you.

434
00:37:58,099 --> 00:37:59,684
Do you have time?

435
00:38:00,951 --> 00:38:02,918
You want to talk to me?

436
00:38:40,767 --> 00:38:42,242
Sihan.

437
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:45,426
Now it's only the two of us.

438
00:38:46,475 --> 00:38:49,267
Stop pretending.

439
00:38:49,267 --> 00:38:50,792
I know.

440
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:55,467
You're only pretending to be good brothers with Yin Zheng.

441
00:38:56,018 --> 00:39:00,318
You still hate him.

442
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:06,417
Yin Zheng realized his mistakes now.

443
00:39:07,525 --> 00:39:09,299
You should let it go.

444
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,326
I didn't expect this.

445
00:39:19,326 --> 00:39:22,720
We're talking about such a serious topic already?

446
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,759
Fine.

447
00:39:26,726 --> 00:39:30,183
Let's be honest then.

448
00:39:30,183 --> 00:39:32,209
I'll be honest with you.

449
00:39:33,183 --> 00:39:35,626
How can you ask me to not hate him?

450
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:39,450
He used many tricks to get what he wanted.

451
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:42,242
He took away the company from my dad.

452
00:39:42,242 --> 00:39:44,099
He took you away from me.

453
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:46,351
How can I forgive him?

454
00:39:49,283 --> 00:39:50,759
Sihan.

455
00:39:51,992 --> 00:39:55,184
I hope we can be calm about this.

456
00:39:56,242 --> 00:39:57,800
I know.

457
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:01,626
I got with him

458
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,709
shortly after we broke up.

459
00:40:05,392 --> 00:40:08,951
I know it makes you uncomfortable.

460
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,626
Sorry.

461
00:40:23,851 --> 00:40:25,609
Sorry?

462
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,059
Sorry?

463
00:40:31,934 --> 00:40:33,542
Three words.

464
00:40:36,492 --> 00:40:39,350
It's too easy to say.

465
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,017
It's too late.

466
00:40:42,909 --> 00:40:44,850
All of it is too late.

467
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:47,475
He's nothing.

468
00:40:47,475 --> 00:40:48,517
Why does he deserve you?

469
00:40:48,517 --> 00:40:51,517
How can he take you away from me?

470
00:40:51,517 --> 00:40:53,225
He killed my dad.

471
00:40:53,225 --> 00:40:55,675
He is the one to blame.

472
00:40:55,675 --> 00:40:57,200
How can I forgive him?

473
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,309
Tell him.

474
00:40:58,309 --> 00:40:59,559
Give me back everything he took from me.

475
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:03,199
Tell him to give everything back to me!

476
00:41:08,434 --> 00:41:10,892
Go, get out of the car.

477
00:41:10,892 --> 00:41:11,959
Go!

478
00:41:11,959 --> 00:41:13,059
- Go!
- Sihan.

479
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:13,870
Sihan.

480
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,083
Go.

481
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:17,809
Get out of the car.

482
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:31,767
Tell your lover.

483
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:34,634
Giving the company back to me is just the first step.

484
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,209
Brother, it's raining.

485
00:42:00,209 --> 00:42:01,967
I'll take you home.

486
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:16,826
Big Brother.

487
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:20,726
Uncle Donghai said you bought the bar to give back to me.

488
00:42:20,726 --> 00:42:21,999
Thank you.

489
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:25,330
You are my brother.

490
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:28,000
It belonged to you in the first place.

491
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,183
Brother, Dad was calling your name before he died.

492
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:35,380
He has forgiven you.

493
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:37,834
Don't blame yourself.

494
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:41,809
I hope so.

495
00:42:47,584 --> 00:42:49,459
You know?

496
00:42:49,459 --> 00:42:53,334
Zhang Xiao came back because she saw your video.

497
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:56,100
She saw it?

498
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,142
Yes.

499
00:42:57,142 --> 00:43:00,542
She said you already let go of hate and made clear a lot of things.

500
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:02,918
So she's willing to come back to you.

501
00:43:02,918 --> 00:43:05,999
She's willing to be with you even if it gets tough.

502
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:09,059
Brother, she still loves you.

503
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,860
Will you bring her happiness?

504
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,500
I will.
