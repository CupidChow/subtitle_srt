Come in.

4
00:02:09,107 --> 00:02:13,274
Do you know what happened today?

5
00:02:13,274 --> 00:02:15,107
I've heard about it.

6
00:02:15,816 --> 00:02:20,440
When I asked you to investigate Revenge,

7
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,566
why didn't you realize Yin Chenggui was involved?

8
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:25,357
Sorry.

9
00:02:25,357 --> 00:02:27,357
I'm still too inexperienced.

10
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:29,099
I got confused.

11
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:35,974
I'm not trying to hold you responsible.

12
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:39,839
I'm just worried.

13
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:45,582
If Yin Chenggui takes over Zhen Tian group,

14
00:02:47,758 --> 00:02:51,340
the company will go bankrupt pretty soon.

15
00:02:57,691 --> 00:02:59,257
Zheng'er.

16
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,799
We've been arguing with each other for many years.

17
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:08,716
I hope we can be on good terms from now on.

18
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,382
I hope you can save Zhen Tian Group.

19
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:36,499
I heard from your mom

20
00:03:37,215 --> 00:03:41,965
that you've put a lot of effort into Sihan's situation.

21
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:49,266
Thank you.

22
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:09,123
Hello? Who is it?

23
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:10,965
It's me.

24
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:13,940
Forget about what we talked about before.

25
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,382
Here's the current situation.

26
00:04:16,982 --> 00:04:19,049
Once Kang Sihan dies,

27
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:22,132
we'll forgive your debts to the company.

28
00:04:22,132 --> 00:04:23,340
Really?

29
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,466
You just need to say you already gave him the goods.

30
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:30,132
Dead men tell no tales.

31
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:34,340
Kang Zhentian won't ask the kidnappers for the goods.

32
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,674
Just remember that as long as he's alive,

33
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,157
Zhen Tian Group won't let you off so easily.

34
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:42,507
Do you understand?

35
00:04:42,507 --> 00:04:45,382
You mean...

36
00:04:45,382 --> 00:04:49,674
Since neither of us want him alive,

37
00:04:49,674 --> 00:04:52,466
then we should do something.

38
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:54,839
Don't forget he's on your turf.

39
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,023
Don't worry.

40
00:04:56,023 --> 00:04:58,290
As long as he's on my turf,

41
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,399
I have my ways of getting ahold of the ransom.

42
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,090
Once the ransom is gone,

43
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,257
they won't get him back.

44
00:05:07,257 --> 00:05:09,399
Okay, just remember.

45
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:12,507
You must be careful. Bye.

Didn't we just talk about how we're running out of time?

57
00:06:36,607 --> 00:06:40,190
We have to transfer ownership before Kang Sihan gets back.

But Kang Siyu and Wang Tiecheng are taking the ransom to the kidnappers on the first flight tomorrow morning.

66

The weather forecast says there's a rare storm there tonight.

70
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:18,932
Don't you want me to get back early?

71
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:23,199
It'll be fine as long as the plane arrives at the Lancheng Airport before the storm.

00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:50,907
Okay.

128
00:10:50,907 --> 00:10:52,665
You eat.

00:11:53,132 --> 00:11:54,424
Dad.

140
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:00,999
Xinyi...

141
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,340
What's up with Xinyi?

142
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,982
On the day of her wedding ceremony,

143
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:11,532
she passed away.

144
00:12:15,274 --> 00:12:17,970
Because the groom is my boyfriend.

145
00:12:18,674 --> 00:12:19,566
What?

146
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:22,182
The groom is your boyfriend?

147
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:25,224
Before they got married,

148
00:12:26,232 --> 00:12:28,799
I already broke up with Sihan.

149
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,015
Brother Kang's son.

150
00:12:35,123 --> 00:12:36,540
But dad.

151
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,090
I'm still responsible for Xinyi's death.

152
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,458
I feel so guilty.

153
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:51,099
I can't forgive myself.

154
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:55,965
I'm on the verge of a breakdown.

155
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:58,307
I don't know what to do.

156
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:05,949
I always thought I knew what love was.

157
00:13:06,982 --> 00:13:09,882
I want those around me to all be happy.

158
00:13:10,482 --> 00:13:12,523
But in the end,

159
00:13:13,374 --> 00:13:16,049
I still hurt them.

160
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:18,639
Daughter.

161
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,858
There's no right or wrong when it comes to love.

162
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,582
I can't give you any advice.

163
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:32,023
But,

164
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:35,274
the past is in the past.

165
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,632
Do you still remember what I told you before?

166
00:13:40,632 --> 00:13:45,065
If you're ever faced with someone or something that makes you unhappy,

167
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:48,140
just forget about it.

168
00:13:48,832 --> 00:13:50,599
There's still someone...

169
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:57,965
I can't forget about.

170
00:13:59,315 --> 00:14:02,299
Do you mean Sihan?

171
00:14:06,357 --> 00:14:09,440
He's someone I thought I never had a chance with.

172
00:14:14,257 --> 00:14:15,890
Yin Zheng.

173
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:23,316
Yin Chengyi's son.

174
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:30,865
What's your plan?

175
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:36,132
Come.

176
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:41,899
Brother Zhang.

177
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:44,049
Brother Zhang, are you home?

178
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,790
Brother Zhang.

179
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
- Brother Zhang, my wife is about to give birth.
- What's the matter?

180
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,691
Don't you have a car?

181
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:55,324
Can you help take her to the hospital?

182
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:56,882
Okay, calm down.

183
00:14:56,882 --> 00:14:58,990
Dad, remember to take an umbrella.

184
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:00,649
Okay, let's go.

185
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,524
Thank you.

186
00:15:01,524 --> 00:15:03,424
Xiaoxiao, be careful.

187
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:05,266
- I'll get you to the car.
- Come on.

188
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,407
Dad, please be careful.

189
00:15:29,982 --> 00:15:31,758
Why are you here?

190
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:35,299
I don't want to see you.

191
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:37,432
Just go.

192
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,591
What do you want me to do?

193
00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:48,507
Xinyi already passed away.

194
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:52,407
I can't change that.

195
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:59,732
I really didn't expect for this to happen.

196
00:16:02,716 --> 00:16:07,890
I've never regret anything I've done before.

197
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,123
But I'll feel guilty about this for my whole life.

198
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:23,782
I don't know what to do.

199
00:16:26,357 --> 00:16:28,849
There's no use in regretting it.

200
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:33,332
What do you want me to do?

201
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,149
What do you want me to do?

202
00:16:41,357 --> 00:16:43,491
What should I do?

203
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:47,649
What should I do?

204
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:54,574
I'm not here to ask for forgiveness.

205
00:17:00,023 --> 00:17:02,523
I just want to let you know

206
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:08,716
I don't want to lose you.

207
00:17:29,232 --> 00:17:30,615
Boss.

208
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:35,149
Your trip to Ganlin is a long and dangerous one.

209
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:37,274
You must take care of yourself.

210
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:38,749
Thank you.

211
00:17:39,357 --> 00:17:41,432
I have something to say to you too.

212
00:17:42,457 --> 00:17:45,732
Although this used to be my bar,

213
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,232
it also belongs to you.

214
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:50,440
Don't be lazy at work because I'm not here.

215
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,940
And don't slack off because there's a new boss.

216
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:56,115
Don't worry.

217
00:17:56,115 --> 00:18:00,123
We'll tidy up here once you leave.

218
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:02,032
We'll be waiting for you to come back.

219
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:08,524
It doesn't matter.

220
00:18:08,524 --> 00:18:10,591
Making cocktails is the same anywhere.

221
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,223
Who made the cocktails so bitter yesterday?

222
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:18,315
Alright.

223
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:19,940
We have such a huge problem on our hands.

224
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,940
I have no choice.

225
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,315
After I find Second Brother,

226
00:18:24,315 --> 00:18:26,040
I'll go look for Zhang Xiao.

227
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,399
After breaking up with Zhang Xiao,

228
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,816
I was jealous of Yin Zheng,

229
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:31,982
and I was jealous of Sihan.

230
00:18:31,982 --> 00:18:36,574
But now I'm most jealous of Zhang Xiao.

231
00:18:38,774 --> 00:18:39,574
Learn from him.

232
00:18:39,574 --> 00:18:41,340
You must treat me well.

233
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,582
Come on.

234
00:18:42,582 --> 00:18:45,549
I'm going to get more alcohol.

235
00:18:56,274 --> 00:18:57,340
What's up?

236
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,382
We made it through 2012 safely.

237
00:18:59,382 --> 00:19:01,399
What's making you upset?

238
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:02,399
Don't worry.

239
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:04,466
No matter what happens,

240
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:06,482
I'll always be there with you.

241
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,466
Who do you think you are?

242
00:19:10,466 --> 00:19:12,582
Me?

243
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:15,849
I'm the famous singer here.

244
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:18,374
By the way,

245
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:21,958
only I like the cocktails you make.

246
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:28,549
From now on,

247
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:32,382
we only have each other to rely on.

248
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:34,758
You just want free drinks, don't you?

249
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,899
What did I say just now?

250
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:39,549
You must treat me well.

251
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,549
It's only been a few minutes.

252
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:46,374
My heart is broken.

253
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,799
Here, drink.

254
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:56,424
If you don't even come to me for drinks,

255
00:19:56,424 --> 00:19:59,199
then life is truly meaningless.

256
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,965
Drink up.

257
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:09,565
Ling Dang, I'll be good to you.

258
00:20:13,482 --> 00:20:15,049
I'll also keep asking you for drinks,

259
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,190
laugh at you, bully you,

260
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,274
and let you feel as if nothing in this world has changed.

261
00:20:20,732 --> 00:20:24,315
Siyu, I want to sing a song for you.

262
00:20:46,716 --> 00:20:48,958
<i>Just let it be.</i>

263
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:54,682
<i>No pain, no sorrow.</i>

264
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:07,190
You're still alive.

265
00:24:08,507 --> 00:24:10,566
I'm not dead.

266
00:24:11,482 --> 00:24:13,315
Why did you come back?

267
00:24:15,274 --> 00:24:18,049
I hope you can save me.

268
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:20,291
I still want to live.

269
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:29,549
There are two guards out there.

270
00:24:30,732 --> 00:24:32,839
Aren't you worried?

271
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,774
What if I hand you over to them?

272
00:24:38,232 --> 00:24:40,174
I trust you.

273
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:47,932
You won't do it.

274
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:25,982
Are you feeling better?

275
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:41,199
Can you tell me about your past?

276
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,432
I don't want to talk about my past.

277
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:50,840
You know.

278
00:26:52,632 --> 00:26:56,132
The first time you looked at me,

279
00:26:56,132 --> 00:26:58,457
I felt strange.

280
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,765
It felt like we knew each other.

281
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,257
You're still unwell.

282
00:27:08,415 --> 00:27:10,032
Get some rest.

283
00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:11,649
Do you know

284
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:19,407
how I climbed out of the grave?

285
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:27,591
I thought about Yin Zheng.

286
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,816
I told myself.

287
00:27:34,207 --> 00:27:36,891
I must get out alive.

288
00:27:40,507 --> 00:27:42,516
Why are you quiet?

289
00:27:47,315 --> 00:27:49,466
What's your name?

290
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:52,758
My name is Ma Yinuo.

291
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,540
Ma...

292
00:27:59,215 --> 00:28:01,640
Ma Yinuo.

293
00:28:04,524 --> 00:28:06,290
I feel...

294
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,632
I feel like you know me.

295
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,466
Do you know...

296
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,282
Do you know Yin Zheng?

297
00:28:24,858 --> 00:28:26,466
No.

298
00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:36,507
I want to call my younger brother.

299
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,839
Can you help me?

300
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:46,239
The police is onto them.

301
00:28:47,566 --> 00:28:50,265
They're being very careful.

302
00:28:51,415 --> 00:28:55,340
The boss confiscated everyone's phones.

303
00:28:57,357 --> 00:28:59,840
We're in the highlands.

304
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,399
Without someone familiar with the area to lead us out,

305
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,507
there's no way out.

306
00:29:06,499 --> 00:29:10,799
Then...

307
00:29:12,174 --> 00:29:14,591
Then we have to find a way

308
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:20,932
to get those two kidnappers to get us out of here.

309
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,491
Get us out of here.

310
00:29:27,482 --> 00:29:29,507
In your current state,

311
00:29:30,482 --> 00:29:32,199
how are you going to get out?

312
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,316
You better get some rest.

313
00:29:37,315 --> 00:29:40,816
And then find the opportunity to get out of here.

314
00:29:40,816 --> 00:29:43,174
No need to worry about me.

315
00:29:43,174 --> 00:29:47,140
No.

316
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:52,174
Ma Yinuo.

317
00:29:52,732 --> 00:29:54,620
Believe me.

318
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:01,132
We...

319
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,007
We...

320
00:30:06,715 --> 00:30:15,807
We'll get out of here alive.

321
00:30:42,982 --> 00:30:44,799
What are you thinking about?

322
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:53,215
Can you let go of your hatred?

323
00:31:03,482 --> 00:31:05,882
Can we not talk about this?

324
00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:11,040
If we want to be together,

325
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:14,257
I hope we can stay away from hatred.

326
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:22,132
I can't decide this on my own.

327
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,266
I don't have a choice.

328
00:31:30,524 --> 00:31:33,140
What if I need you to give up?

329
00:31:35,982 --> 00:31:37,566
This is my own business.

330
00:31:37,566 --> 00:31:40,032
Why do you want to be involved?

331
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:43,357
It has nothing to do with you.

332
00:31:43,357 --> 00:31:45,323
But you're involved.

333
00:31:47,023 --> 00:31:50,420
I don't want to see you hurt yourself

334
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,520
and other people because of resentment.

335
00:31:58,315 --> 00:32:00,682
I know what I'm doing.

336
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:04,057
I will bear all the consequences.

337
00:32:09,424 --> 00:32:11,415
Xinyi's death

338
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:15,058
already caused us so much pain.

339
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,791
Why can't you understand?

340
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:30,816
I already made up my mind.

341
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:33,015
Please don't intervene, okay?

342
00:32:52,065 --> 00:32:54,257
If that's the case,

343
00:32:57,274 --> 00:32:59,290
come find me

344
00:33:00,132 --> 00:33:02,132
after you figure it out.

345
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:08,758
You can sleep here tonight.

346
00:33:11,274 --> 00:33:13,291
I'll go to my dad's room.

347
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:37,649
Xiao Wei, give me the hospital's address.

348
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:38,582
I'm coming now.

349
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:40,107
I will be there soon.

350
00:34:15,732 --> 00:34:17,249
Zhang Xiao.

351
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:22,958
Zhang Xiao.

352
00:34:31,023 --> 00:34:32,624
Zhang Xiao.

353
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,970
<i>Your call will go to voicemail.</i>

354
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,800
<i>You will be charged after the tone.</i>

355
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,550
<i>Please hang up if you're not leaving a message.</i>

356
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:05,410
<i>Please press the button after leaving your message.</i>

357
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:11,816
Zhang Xiao, I didn't see you after I woke up.

358
00:35:11,816 --> 00:35:13,299
Where are you?

359
00:35:16,749 --> 00:35:18,691
I'm waiting for you at home.

360
00:35:20,524 --> 00:35:21,840
Bye.

361
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:29,074
Dad.

362
00:35:29,899 --> 00:35:31,940
Is your hand still in pain?

363
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:34,774
It's not painful anymore after taking the medicine.

364
00:35:34,774 --> 00:35:36,190
Don't worry, it's just a small injury.

365
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,357
I'll be fine after a few days.

366
00:35:37,357 --> 00:35:40,215
The pain will last a hundred days.

367
00:35:40,215 --> 00:35:43,774
I was so scared when I got Xiao Wei's call.

368
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:48,023
Yes, I was lucky I got in the accident on the way home from the hospital.

369
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:52,039
Otherwise, Xiao Wei's wife would've been in big trouble.

370
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,070
<i>Your call will go to voicemail.</i>

371
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,890
<i>You will be charged after the tone.</i>

372
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,982
<i>Please hang up if you're not leaving a message.</i>

373
00:36:14,982 --> 00:36:16,490
Director Yin.

374
00:36:19,065 --> 00:36:20,274
What are you doing here?

375
00:36:20,274 --> 00:36:23,732
I don't think you would've gone back if I didn't come.

376
00:36:23,732 --> 00:36:25,566
I got the notice from the Industry and Commerce Bureau.

377
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:27,982
The change of legal representative requires signatures.

378
00:36:27,982 --> 00:36:29,749
The accountant and lawyer is already there.

379
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:32,274
You must go back today.

380
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:34,357
I already booked the flight.

381
00:36:34,357 --> 00:36:36,424
We must go to the airport now.

382
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:38,774
If you don't go back today,

383
00:36:38,774 --> 00:36:40,482
we don't know when our next chance is.

384
00:36:40,482 --> 00:36:44,282
Your efforts will all go to waste.

385
00:36:45,999 --> 00:36:47,315
Wait for me in the car.

386
00:36:47,315 --> 00:36:48,707
Okay.

387
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:59,057
Zhang Xiao, I keep calling you, but you're not picking up.

388
00:36:59,057 --> 00:37:00,440
Something urgent came up.

389
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,249
I have to go back now.

390
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,040
Don't worry.

391
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,566
After I settle everything,

392
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:10,790
I will come back for you, okay?

393
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:13,165
Wait for me.

394
00:37:22,649 --> 00:37:24,557
Director Yin, get in the car.

395
00:37:41,549 --> 00:37:42,882
Dad.

396
00:37:44,399 --> 00:37:46,182
Thank you, Sir.

397
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,007
Be careful.

398
00:37:55,882 --> 00:37:57,649
Dad.

399
00:37:57,649 --> 00:38:01,440
A friend came to visit me last night.

400
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,374
He spent the night at our house.

401
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,649
Alright, do I know him?

402
00:38:07,257 --> 00:38:10,458
Let's go inside first.

403
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,949
Okay.

404
00:38:15,482 --> 00:38:17,765
I'll go in first.

405
00:38:46,474 --> 00:38:47,758
Dad.

406
00:38:48,524 --> 00:38:50,558
Can I borrow your phone?

407
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:58,039
♫ <i>The pedestrians crowd the streets</i> ♫

408
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:02,899

414

Who is it?

415
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,507
An unknown number.

<i>He chose to leave.</i>

422
00:39:53,232 --> 00:39:54,907
<i>He chose to leave me.</i>

423
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:09,332
Daughter, who is your friend?

424
00:40:12,982 --> 00:40:15,949
You said he was inside, but he's not here anymore.

425
00:40:20,899 --> 00:40:24,939
Is your friend Yin Zheng?

426
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:53,049
Xiaoxiao, we'll be very busy the next few days.

427
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:55,649
I forgot to tell you something.

428
00:40:55,649 --> 00:40:57,566
Because of my job,

429
00:40:57,566 --> 00:40:59,424
I already sold the house.

430
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:01,482
I bought a house in the west.

431
00:41:01,482 --> 00:41:04,839
We're moving tomorrow.

432
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,923
Tomorrow?

433
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,099
Yes.

434
00:41:09,549 --> 00:41:12,166
Get your stuff packed.

435
00:41:37,023 --> 00:41:38,424
Too much Renminbi?

436
00:41:38,424 --> 00:41:40,674
You had to exchange them for American dollars?

437
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:44,674
Let's go to the factory first.

438
00:41:44,674 --> 00:41:46,549
We're strangers to this area.

439
00:41:46,549 --> 00:41:50,691
Maybe they'll know where the kidnappers are.

440
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:52,058
Okay.

441
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:08,860
Are you sure it's here?

442
00:42:11,427 --> 00:42:12,678
Yes.

443
00:42:12,678 --> 00:42:14,094
Don't look down on this factory.

444
00:42:14,094 --> 00:42:15,552
They have everything we need.

445
00:42:15,552 --> 00:42:17,969
Don't judge a book by its cover.

446
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,610
Director Wang, come.

447
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,611
Hello, Mr. Kang.

448
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:28,302
- Just give it to me.
- It's okay.

449
00:42:28,302 --> 00:42:30,511
- Come in and take a seat.
- Okay.

450
00:42:30,511 --> 00:42:32,411
The wind is strong today.

451
00:42:32,411 --> 00:42:34,002
Yes.

452
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,050
Hello?

453
00:42:43,736 --> 00:42:46,169
Okay, don't worry. I got it.

454
00:42:49,511 --> 00:42:50,860
I can't believe it.

455
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,235
After Mr. Kang left the factory,

456
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:55,636
he was met with such misfortune.

457
00:42:56,377 --> 00:42:58,552
Is the ransom inside the box?

458
00:42:58,552 --> 00:43:00,344
It's not safe to have it on you.

459
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,943
It's most safe inside our factory's safe.

460
00:43:02,943 --> 00:43:03,859
It's okay.

461
00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:05,985
I think the kidnappers will call me at any time.

462
00:43:05,985 --> 00:43:07,860
I'll keep it on me.

463
00:43:08,636 --> 00:43:10,159
Okay, sure.

464
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:12,444
I already arranged the hotel for you.

465
00:43:12,444 --> 00:43:14,152
Let's go over there in a bit.

466
00:43:14,152 --> 00:43:15,235
It's okay.

467
00:43:15,235 --> 00:43:17,210
We already book our hotel.

468
00:43:18,527 --> 00:43:19,869
Alright.

469
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:21,969
Then come in for some tea.

470
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:22,985
Okay, let's go.

471
00:43:22,985 --> 00:43:24,760
Let's go.
