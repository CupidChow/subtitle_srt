<i>[Scarlet Heart 2]</i>

2
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:43,000
<i>[Episode 33]</i>

3
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,270
Tell me the truth.

4
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,896
What happened at the press conference?

5
00:01:47,896 --> 00:01:50,254
Why did your dad faint?

6
00:01:51,187 --> 00:01:55,787
Maybe he had a stroke because he was too shocked by Sihan's death.

7
00:01:56,562 --> 00:01:59,754
Then why did your dad hand over Zhen Tian Group to you?

8
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:01,662
I didn't even hear about it in advance.

9
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:03,062
Sihan is dead.

10
00:02:03,062 --> 00:02:04,620
Siyu has no interest in running the company.

11
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,520
I am the only successor.

12
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,138
Shut up.

13
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:16,646
Don't try to fool me.

14
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:19,250
Stop putting up an act in front of me.

15
00:02:19,796 --> 00:02:21,495
Don't lie to me.

16
00:02:21,495 --> 00:02:24,337
Save the script for the reporters.

17
00:02:24,337 --> 00:02:28,729
Yes, your dad had a stroke because of shock.

18
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:31,712
But it wasn't just because of Sihan's death.

19
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:34,579
What did you tell him during the press conference?

20
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:40,603
I really can't lie to you.

21
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,871
You want to know what I told him during the press conference?

22
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:53,812
I'll tell you.

23
00:02:55,437 --> 00:02:57,895
I just told him one thing.

24
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:03,020
I now own 80% of Zhen Tian Group's shares.

25
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,787
Regardless of whether there's an announcement,

26
00:03:04,787 --> 00:03:09,029
I'm still Zhen Tian Group's official chairman.

27
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,462
No.

28
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:19,279
No.

29
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,437
Although you're telling me personally,

30
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,754
I still can't believe it.

31
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:30,837
How could you hold 80% of Zhen Tian's shares?

32
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:32,396
Why?

33
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,987
During this time,

34
00:03:38,987 --> 00:03:42,687
Second Uncle has been arranging for Revenge Group

35
00:03:42,687 --> 00:03:44,650
to acquire Zhen Tian Group's shares gradually over time.

36
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:47,712
I was able to send him to jail,

37
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:50,162
and I can also take over this company.

38
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:54,212
You sent your uncle to jail?

39
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,962
Yin Chenggui might be my uncle,

40
00:03:58,962 --> 00:04:02,020
but he's been using me all these years.

41
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,979
To achieve his objective, he would stop at nothing.

42
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:07,945
I suspect he has something to do with Lan Lan's death too.

43
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:13,871
He would ruin Zhen Tian once it's in his hands.

44
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:15,412
I'm doing this for the sake of the company.

45
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:17,162
Stop talking.

46
00:04:17,162 --> 00:04:22,771
The truth is that you worked with Yin Chenggui to take over the company.

47
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:25,203
How can you do that to your father?

48
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:28,145
I did it for my father.

49
00:04:28,145 --> 00:04:30,320
My birth father.

50
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:34,437
My father isn't Kang Zhentian who is lying in the hospital.

51
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:36,462
My father is Yin Chengyi.

52
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:39,962
I have been waiting for years,

53
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:43,079
and I finally succeeded in my revenge.

54
00:04:44,854 --> 00:04:48,010
So it's all about revenge.

55
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:53,812
And I thought you already let go of the past.

56
00:04:53,812 --> 00:04:58,545
You know I've been waiting for this moment.

57
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:02,910
I might have not mentioned it,

58
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:06,437
but I would never forget.

59
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:12,370
Kang Zhentian loved you for 20 years.

60
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,287
Aren't you even a bit touched?

61
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:16,787
He gave you all that love

62
00:05:16,787 --> 00:05:20,129
in exchange for your cruelty?

63
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,295
I was touched.

64
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,712
I know he loves me.

65
00:05:39,854 --> 00:05:43,054
I tried to treat him as my real father.

66
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:49,370
But every time I feel touched,

67
00:05:49,938 --> 00:05:52,062
I tell myself,

68
00:05:57,562 --> 00:06:01,520
my father was the one who made me laugh with his beard during my childhood.

69
00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:07,679
My father was the one who taught me how to write my name

70
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,404
when I was a kid.

71
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:15,170
He took me to get Western food.

72
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,429
My father was the one who ate just a pickle

73
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:20,729
and shuddered in front of the shop.

74
00:06:22,187 --> 00:06:25,354
He taught me to reach the top of The Great Wall in one go.

75
00:06:25,354 --> 00:06:27,938
That was my father.

76
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:30,162
He is Yin Chengyi.

77
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,671
It's all Kang Zhentian's fault.

78
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:41,854
My father is no longer with us because of him.

79
00:06:44,354 --> 00:06:47,620
He let my father watch him from heaven.

80
00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:50,671
He stole his wife

81
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:52,346
and his family.

82
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:53,446
- No.
- His business.

83
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,520
- Stop talking.
- His everything.

84
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,820
Stop talking.

85
00:07:03,938 --> 00:07:06,870
If I had known this would happen,

86
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:13,479
I should've told you the truth 20 years ago.

87
00:07:14,045 --> 00:07:15,754
The truth is that he murdered my father.

88
00:07:15,754 --> 00:07:17,319
No.

89
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:20,245
Your birth father is not the hero you think he is.

90
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:23,120
You can cry for your Kang Zhentian,

91
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,562
but don't insult my father.

92
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,929
Don't insult your husband.

93
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:35,450
Zheng'er!

94
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,110
Zheng'er!

95
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:46,119
Zheng'er.

96
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,246
I want to ask about Dad.

97
00:08:11,996 --> 00:08:14,979
Siyu, you must remember.

98
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:16,812
Make sure they get the message.

99
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:19,104
Kang Sihan is gone.

100
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,854
Siyu.

101
00:08:32,854 --> 00:08:33,896
Mom.

102
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:37,370
Siyu, tell me.

103
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,062
Is Sihan really not coming back anymore?

104
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,829
Yes.

105
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:54,395
What happened?

106
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:55,979
Siyu.

107
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:59,187
Where is his body?

108
00:08:59,187 --> 00:09:00,619
Mom, sorry.

109
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:03,038
I haven't found Second Brother's body yet.

110
00:09:03,038 --> 00:09:04,495
How's dad?

111
00:09:04,495 --> 00:09:06,462
Your dad is already awake.

112
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,746
But he hasn't fully recovered.

113
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:11,729
He can't accept that your Second Brother is dead.

114
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:13,771
He was also shocked by something else.

115
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:16,787
So it's not looking good.

116
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:18,938
But don't worry, Siyu.

117
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:21,229
I will take good care of Dad.

118
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:22,746
What happened to Dad?

119
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:25,329
Did he have another stroke?

120
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:28,329
It's a hemorrhagic stroke this time.

121
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:31,438
He can't speak nor move now.

122
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:34,896
Mom, Second Brother...

123
00:09:34,896 --> 00:09:37,020
Your Second Brother what?

124
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,762
Tell me.

125
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:45,212
Mom, don't be too sad.

126
00:09:45,938 --> 00:09:48,203
As soon as I finish up here,

127
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:49,920
I'll go back as soon as possible.

128
00:09:52,979 --> 00:09:54,919
Siyu.

129
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,245
You heard about Dad's condition.

130
00:10:05,245 --> 00:10:07,979
Do you still want to tell them you're dead?

131
00:10:07,979 --> 00:10:09,771
I have no choice now.

132
00:10:09,771 --> 00:10:13,145
We have to keep this from them if we want to defeat Yin Zheng.

133
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,162
Let him be in the light while we hide in the dark,

134
00:10:15,162 --> 00:10:17,146
so that the odds are in our favor.

135
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:26,290
Zhentian.

136
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,103
I know about everything.

137
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:32,729
We thought it was simple.

138
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:36,638
We thought that our kindness could reduce the hatred in Zheng'er's heart.

139
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:39,854
I didn't expect him to still be so extreme.

140
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:44,595
If we told him the truth earlier,

141
00:10:44,595 --> 00:10:47,746
maybe things wouldn't turn out the way it did.

142
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:56,562
Zhentian, your kindness led to your downfall.

143
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:58,562
I am sorry.

144
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,412
Doctor Chen.

145
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:13,520
Excuse me.

146
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,370
For my husband,

147
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,437
do we have other alternatives

148
00:11:17,437 --> 00:11:19,420
apart from taking medicine and physical therapy?

149
00:11:19,996 --> 00:11:23,996
Mrs. Kang, we can only leave our fate to God.

150
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:27,812
However, you can share more of his previous happy moments with him

151
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,229
and let him stay optimistic.

152
00:11:30,229 --> 00:11:33,412
Maybe this will work.

153
00:11:34,704 --> 00:11:36,803
Previous happy moments?

154
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,771
Thank you, Doctor Chen.

155
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:42,087
You're welcome.

156
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,520
- Sister, can you look after him for me?
- Okay.

157
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,662
I'll be right back.

158
00:11:47,662 --> 00:11:48,871
No problem.

159
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:52,395
Zhentian, I'll be back soon.

160
00:12:02,746 --> 00:12:03,604
Chairman.

161
00:12:03,604 --> 00:12:04,912
Your father is unconscious.

162
00:12:04,912 --> 00:12:06,719
What else are you trying to do?

163
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:09,979
I just want to chat with him.

164
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,495
Go.

165
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:12,803
Okay.

166
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:20,954
- Are you Xiao Wang?
- Yes.

167
00:12:20,954 --> 00:12:23,120
Your head-nurse asks you to see her

168
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,454
to verify your overtime sheet.

169
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,245
But I'm with a patient.

170
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:29,454
Just go ahead, I'll take care of the patient for you.

171
00:12:29,454 --> 00:12:31,120
Thank you.

172
00:13:01,354 --> 00:13:04,662
I can see the hatred in your eyes at last.

173
00:13:06,771 --> 00:13:08,420
After so many years,

174
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:13,437
you should also experience what hate is all about.

175
00:13:13,437 --> 00:13:18,271
Dirty swine.

176
00:13:19,038 --> 00:13:21,329
You hate me now, right?

177
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,612
Let me bring you somewhere.

178
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:07,420
Do you know why I brought you here?

179
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:11,395
I want you to see

180
00:14:11,395 --> 00:14:15,619
how resentment can destroy someone.

181
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:32,138
Scared?

182
00:14:34,687 --> 00:14:36,962
I have a good show for you.

183
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,640
<i>[Mom]</i>

184
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,587
This is between us men.

185
00:14:58,103 --> 00:15:00,596
We'll settle it ourselves.

186
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:37,950
Kang Zhentian.

187
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:42,245
However you killed my father back then,

188
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:44,712
I'll do the same to you now.

189
00:15:46,437 --> 00:15:48,471
Listen up.

190
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:54,029
I am Yin Chengyi's son, Yin Zheng.

191
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:01,054
Is Chairman Kang at the office?

192
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:03,729
How about Chairman Yin?

193
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,270
He's not there either?

194
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,137
Alright, Secretary Hou.

195
00:16:15,745 --> 00:16:19,120
Auntie Rong, is Chairman Kang at home?

196
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,896
No?

197
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,371
Okay.

198
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,640
<i>[Yin Zheng]</i>

199
00:16:38,145 --> 00:16:40,003
Bastard!

200
00:16:43,687 --> 00:16:46,479
<i>Yin Zheng must've brought Zhentian there.</i>

201
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,154
<i>He must've.</i>

202
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:49,812
Drive out of the city.

203
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:51,537
- Hurry.
- Yes.

204
00:17:42,203 --> 00:17:46,945
My father left these toys for me.

205
00:17:52,687 --> 00:17:57,054
All my happiness and my sweet memories

206
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:01,003
would be buried here

207
00:18:01,971 --> 00:18:04,120
together with my resentment towards you.

208
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,137
They're all buried here!

209
00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:11,262
Ever since you came into my life,

210
00:18:13,395 --> 00:18:15,662
my happiness was gone.

211
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:20,496
Only resentment was left over.

212
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:29,854
I said I would let you experience

213
00:18:29,854 --> 00:18:33,079
how resentment can destroy someone.

214
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:36,829
Look carefully.

215
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:40,170
My life was destroyed.

216
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,446
It's me who's destroyed!

217
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:49,038
Every morning,

218
00:18:49,687 --> 00:18:52,562
I could only enjoy freedom for just a few minutes.

219
00:18:53,395 --> 00:18:56,187
I could enjoy the fresh air.

220
00:18:56,187 --> 00:18:58,462
I could listen to the birds sing.

221
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,729
But I immediately remind myself.

222
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:05,312
I'm someone who will seek revenge at all costs.

223
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,203
I'm not supposed to have emotions.

224
00:19:09,203 --> 00:19:12,045
I'm not supposed to have love.

225
00:19:12,646 --> 00:19:17,312
This is all because of you.

226
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:25,537
So I took over Zhen Tian Group.

227
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:28,403
I wanted you to end up the way you did today.

228
00:19:29,187 --> 00:19:31,019
This is all your fault.

229
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:33,279
Your fault.

230
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:38,771
You have to face your consequences today.

231
00:19:38,771 --> 00:19:40,412
Bite.

232
00:19:53,212 --> 00:19:55,629
<i>Help me!</i>

233
00:20:23,003 --> 00:20:24,770
Why?

234
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,870
Why?

235
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:07,554
Zhentian!

236
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,129
Zhentian!

237
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:12,395
Zhentian!

238
00:21:19,254 --> 00:21:20,520
- Mom.
- Get up.

239
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,019
- Get up.
- Mom.

240
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:22,954
Go away.

241
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:24,771
You already did so much to him. When will you stop?

242
00:21:24,771 --> 00:21:27,103
You want him die? Bastard!

243
00:21:27,103 --> 00:21:30,720
Zhentian, get up. Come on.

244
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:40,979
Do you know how much he's done for you over the years?

245
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:45,254
I would've told you the truth already if he didn't stop me.

246
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,270
The box is over there.

247
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,212
Look at it yourself.

248
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:45,996
<i>Zhentian.</i>

249
00:22:45,996 --> 00:22:49,662
<i>It's April 2, 1978.</i>

250
00:22:49,662 --> 00:22:54,462
<i>It's been three days since you left me for Vietnam.</i>

251
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,529
<i>I miss you more and more each day.</i>

252
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:05,646
<i>I couldn't stop thinking about you when I went to dance practice today.</i>

253
00:23:05,646 --> 00:23:07,162
<i>Do you still remember?</i>

254
00:23:07,162 --> 00:23:10,520
<i>That's where we first met.</i>

255
00:23:46,312 --> 00:23:48,704
<i>Why did you bring me here?</i>

256
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:49,996
<i>I have a delivery for the convenience store.</i>

257
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:51,287
<i>You're seeing something good.</i>

258
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:53,420
<i>You'll see.</i>

259
00:24:01,412 --> 00:24:04,137
<i>The girl in the black.</i>

260
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:09,662
<i>Why are you watching her dance?</i>

261
00:24:09,662 --> 00:24:11,079
<i>Let's go.</i>

262
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,829
<i>Look at her.</i>

263
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:14,112
<i>Look.</i>

264
00:24:17,495 --> 00:24:20,687
<i>She's in great shape.</i>

265
00:24:20,687 --> 00:24:23,162
<i>She's beautiful.</i>

266
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:24,646
<i>It would be great if she could be my wife.</i>

267
00:24:24,646 --> 00:24:26,260
<i>Keep dreaming.</i>

268
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,490
<i>Does she even like you?</i>

269
00:24:27,495 --> 00:24:30,210
<i>She's a dancer, an artist. You think you're good enough for her?</i>

270
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,787
<i>Let's go.</i>

271
00:24:31,787 --> 00:24:33,103
<i>Let's just stay and watch.</i>

272
00:24:33,103 --> 00:24:37,204
<i>It's like enjoying a dancing show to cultivate our taste.</i>

273
00:25:01,395 --> 00:25:03,420
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

274
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,019
<i>Run!</i>

275
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:05,838
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

276
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,262
<i>I'm not some punk.</i>

277
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:10,354
<i>Then why are you watching them dance?</i>

278
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,938
<i>I just admire her.</i>

279
00:25:25,687 --> 00:25:27,619
<i>I came here to give her some canned foods.</i>

280
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:35,579
<i>Zhentian.</i>

281
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:39,103
<i>That was how you broke into my heart.</i>

282
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:42,412
<i>You later had to pay back the convenience store</i>

283
00:25:42,412 --> 00:25:46,187
<i>all your savings for the canned food.</i>

284
00:25:46,187 --> 00:25:49,719
<i>But you said you didn't regret it.</i>

285
00:25:51,604 --> 00:25:53,646
<i>Mom used to dance?</i>

286
00:25:53,646 --> 00:25:56,070
<i>I've never seen her dance before.</i>

287
00:25:56,854 --> 00:26:00,879
<i>Before she married Dad,</i>

288
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:03,203
<i>she already knew Kang Zhentian.</i>

289
00:26:13,229 --> 00:26:17,038
<i>Zhentian, after you left to join the army,</i>

290
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,604
<i>I've been waiting for your letter to have your mailing address</i>

291
00:26:20,604 --> 00:26:24,120
<i>so that I could send my yearn to you.</i>

292
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,312
<i>But I still haven't received your letter.</i>

293
00:26:27,312 --> 00:26:29,562
<i>What happened?</i>

294
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:33,687
<i>I practiced a new dance</i>

295
00:26:33,687 --> 00:26:35,929
<i>and wanted to show you.</i>

296
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,504
<i>Zhentian, where are you now?</i>

297
00:26:42,504 --> 00:26:45,079
<i>Why aren't you writing to me?</i>

298
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:49,454
<i>I asked your friend Yin Chengyi, but he says he doesn't know.</i>

299
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:54,020
<i>Zhentian, I'm worried about you.</i>

300
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:10,838
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

301
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:24,519
<i>Brother Kang is in trouble.</i>

302
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:26,546
<i>What happened to him?</i>

303
00:27:26,546 --> 00:27:27,854
<i>He...</i>

304
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,420
<i>He was arrested.</i>

305
00:27:31,287 --> 00:27:32,787
<i>Let us tell you the details.</i>

306
00:27:32,787 --> 00:27:35,329
<i>Chenggui, close the window.</i>

307
00:27:38,954 --> 00:27:41,604
<i>Chenggui, keep watch outside.</i>

308
00:27:41,604 --> 00:27:43,387
<i>Go.</i>

309
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:52,370
<i>Sexy, I missed you so much.</i>

310
00:27:54,604 --> 00:27:56,570
<i>What are you doing?</i>

311
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,454
<i>Zhentian, I'm sorry.</i>

312
00:28:11,454 --> 00:28:13,270
<i>Since that night,</i>

313
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,896
<i>I lost my chastity.</i>

314
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:18,312
<i>I'm not qualified to dance anymore.</i>

315
00:28:18,312 --> 00:28:23,095
<i>I swear I won't ever dance ever again.</i>

316
00:29:00,103 --> 00:29:01,270
<i>Bitch.</i>

317
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,687
<i>You want to abort my baby?</i>

318
00:29:03,687 --> 00:29:07,312
<i>Don't you know how shameful it is to get pregnant before marriage?</i>

319
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,162
<i>Not only is my brother not ashamed of you, but he's even willing to marry you.</i>

320
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:11,812
<i>You should appreciate it.</i>

321
00:29:11,812 --> 00:29:12,820
<i>Listen.</i>

322
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,019
<i>You better deliver my baby safely.</i>

323
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,395
<i>Or else I will kill you.</i>

324
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:17,930
<i>Don't even think about aborting my baby.</i>

325
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:18,854
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

326
00:29:18,854 --> 00:29:20,119
<i>What are you crying for?</i>

327
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,129
<i>Want me to hit you?</i>

328
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,050
<i>Zhentian, I'm sorry.</i>

329
00:29:27,854 --> 00:29:30,637
<i>I don't deserve you anymore.</i>

330
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:48,312
- Let me go!
- Don't move.

331
00:29:48,312 --> 00:29:49,687
- Let me go!
- Don't move!

332
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,520
- Stay put.
- Untie the rope.

333
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,629
- Let me go.
- You better behave yourself.

334
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:54,287
- Let me go.
- Do you hear me?

335
00:29:54,287 --> 00:29:56,503
- Let me go.
- Don't move.

336
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,938
What do you want?

337
00:29:59,938 --> 00:30:01,629
Let me go.

338
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,704
Kang Sihan, a life for a life.

339
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:08,354
I'll sue you!

340
00:30:08,354 --> 00:30:12,519
It's still too early to talk about killing anyone.

341
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,170
Let me go.

342
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:26,937
A life for a life.

343
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:36,437
Those who specialize in chemistry should know what this is, right?

344
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:39,120
It's hydrochloride.

345
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,520
Be careful.

346
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,820
Don't fall into it.

347
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:48,896
Kang Sihan.

348
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,938
Kang Sihan.

349
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:54,287
You just want money.

350
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:55,120
No need to kill me.

351
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,629
This is not what I want to hear from you.

352
00:31:04,604 --> 00:31:09,379
I'll give you money.

353
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,587
I'll give you money.

354
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,604
Wang Hao, thanks for your help.

355
00:31:23,604 --> 00:31:26,203
Give me a call the next time you come to Beijing.

356
00:31:26,203 --> 00:31:27,595
For sure.

357
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:31,479
Brother, I didn't expect you to do this.

358
00:31:32,604 --> 00:31:34,812
If he didn't give you the money,

359
00:31:34,812 --> 00:31:36,329
would you have killed him?

360
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:38,187
I didn't try to kill him.

361
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,729
He fell on his own.

362
00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:42,229
Right?

363
00:32:04,954 --> 00:32:06,229
Mom.

364
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:11,646
Why didn't you tell me about the truth earlier?

365
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:19,537
You are smart.

366
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,920
I shouldn't have needed to tell you.

367
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:29,845
We didn't tell you because we wanted to protect you.

368
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:34,437
We didn't want you living in the shadows

369
00:32:34,437 --> 00:32:36,810
after knowing about your father.

370
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:43,587
Zhentian wished for you to be proud of your father so you could grow up happily.

371
00:32:44,454 --> 00:32:48,495
He spent more time teaching and loving you than he did with Sihan and Siyu,

372
00:32:48,495 --> 00:32:51,250
just in hopes that you would grow up to be successful.

373
00:32:52,312 --> 00:32:55,062
But all his efforts were wasted.

374
00:32:55,062 --> 00:32:59,120
It's all because of your crazy obsession.

375
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,454
He put you as priority,

376
00:33:00,454 --> 00:33:03,520
and you just hurt him deeply.

377
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,829
Revenge is the only thing on your mind.

378
00:33:04,829 --> 00:33:08,554
You can't see the kindness and love other people give to you.

379
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:10,996
You just know to take away their everything.

380
00:33:10,996 --> 00:33:14,438
How are you any different from your birth father?

381
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:17,279
Zheng'er.

382
00:33:18,103 --> 00:33:23,396
I'm very disappointed in you.

383
00:33:26,729 --> 00:33:28,195
Mom.

384
00:33:28,896 --> 00:33:31,162
I've realized my mistakes.

385
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:37,819
I always knew Dad loved me.

386
00:33:39,812 --> 00:33:42,340
I tried to love him,

387
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,838
but I just failed.

388
00:33:48,537 --> 00:33:51,187
I couldn't let go of my anger.

389
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:59,871
Let me go up to see him.

390
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,704
Let me apologize to him.

391
00:34:02,704 --> 00:34:04,954
You do not deserve it.

392
00:34:04,954 --> 00:34:08,954
Someone who doesn't know love does not deserve any forgiveness.

393
00:34:08,954 --> 00:34:11,438
Zhentian is miserable because of you.

394
00:34:12,245 --> 00:34:15,854
You're not allowed to come in our home anymore.

395
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:17,445
You can go now.

396
00:34:19,245 --> 00:34:20,754
Mom.

397
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:24,719
I'm sorry.

398
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,754
I'm sorry.

399
00:34:41,103 --> 00:34:42,512
Mom.

400
00:34:43,771 --> 00:34:46,112
I'm sorry.

401
00:35:34,145 --> 00:35:37,087
Sorry, I should've knocked.

402
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,119
I died once.

403
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,812
I've become more wary of others.

404
00:35:43,812 --> 00:35:45,354
I'm sorry.

405
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,629
You're trying to shave?

406
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,662
If you still won't shave,

407
00:35:59,662 --> 00:36:05,319
I might forget that our handsome Brother Kang used to be on the cover of a magazine.

408
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:10,662
Let me help you.

409
00:36:15,354 --> 00:36:18,196
But about the wariness you mentioned just now,

410
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:21,262
aren't you afraid of me?

411
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:23,495
You saved me once.

412
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:26,938
I feel comfortable with you.

413
00:37:38,562 --> 00:37:41,203
I'm so lucky

414
00:37:41,203 --> 00:37:45,896
to know a good looking and smart guy.

415
00:37:48,038 --> 00:37:52,812
I didn't expect you to be so good at shaving.

416
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,996
I used to shave for someone.

417
00:37:54,996 --> 00:37:56,870
Practice make perfect.

418
00:38:06,103 --> 00:38:10,445
So I have Yin Zheng to thank for that.

419
00:38:13,287 --> 00:38:14,729
Sorry.

420
00:38:15,662 --> 00:38:17,379
That wasn't my intention.

421
00:38:19,287 --> 00:38:22,312
Can we stop bringing up the past?

422
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:32,019
I just want the handsome guy in front of me now to glow.

423
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:40,395
Yinuo, do you still feel pain on your face?

424
00:38:40,395 --> 00:38:44,170
I haven't felt any pain since I've been with you.

425
00:38:44,812 --> 00:38:48,529
But my skin has become very sensitive.

426
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:51,579
I don't think I can put up makeup anymore.

427
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,495
I know there is a type of Cordyceps.

428
00:38:53,495 --> 00:38:55,829
It is very good for skin.

429
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:59,220
I'll get some for you to try if there's ever a chance.

430
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:10,303
I feel very happy now.

431
00:39:13,787 --> 00:39:17,496
Can we prolong our happiness?

432
00:39:18,687 --> 00:39:22,219
Can't we stay here?

433
00:39:27,229 --> 00:39:30,238
You want me to give up revenge?

434
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:35,120
You know very well how much I've suffered.

435
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,087
You know how much Yin Zheng hurt me.

436
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,079
No.

437
00:39:46,203 --> 00:39:48,679
You're wounds are almost fully recovered.

438
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:53,303
If that's your choice, then we can only say goodbye.

439
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,495
Did you already make your decision?

440
00:39:59,495 --> 00:40:01,454
If you've already decided,

441
00:40:02,354 --> 00:40:04,046
I won't ask you to stay.

442
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:08,187
I already died once.

443
00:40:09,203 --> 00:40:10,871
You did too.

444
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,504
Life is precious.

445
00:40:14,504 --> 00:40:17,646
Why do you want to waste your life for revenge?

446
00:40:17,646 --> 00:40:20,354
I know you still have feelings for Yin Zheng.

447
00:40:20,354 --> 00:40:23,337
You don't want to come with me to face him.

448
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,395
It's okay, you can go.

449
00:40:26,395 --> 00:40:28,420
- I'm not-
- Just go.

450
00:40:32,537 --> 00:40:33,962
Yinuo.

451
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:39,520
Take it.

452
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,679
Keep it. I don't need it.

453
00:40:57,145 --> 00:40:59,120
Zhentian.

454
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,854
It's a sunny day.

455
00:41:00,854 --> 00:41:02,546
Do you feel warm?

456
00:41:04,354 --> 00:41:06,495
That's good.

457
00:41:08,412 --> 00:41:11,045
Zhentian, look.

458
00:41:11,045 --> 00:41:12,979
Let me show you.

459
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,203
Look.

460
00:41:16,203 --> 00:41:18,329
Look at Siyu.

461
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:20,620
He's been naughty since young.

462
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,879
It wasn't an easy task to get him to take a proper photo.

463
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:25,620
Do you still remember?

464
00:41:40,103 --> 00:41:43,512
Look at this one.

465
00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:48,796
Zhang...

466
00:41:51,162 --> 00:41:53,212
Zhang...

467
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:58,671
Xiao.

468
00:41:58,671 --> 00:42:01,920
What? Zhang Xiao?

469
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,337
- Zhang...
- What happened to Zhang Xiao?

470
00:42:03,337 --> 00:42:05,019
Zhang...

471
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,471
Zhang...

472
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:14,703
Xiao...

473
00:42:15,437 --> 00:42:17,120
Zhentian.

474
00:42:17,629 --> 00:42:21,387
You want me to look for Zhang Xiao?

475
00:42:21,979 --> 00:42:23,454
Zhang...

476
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:27,896
Zhentian.

477
00:42:27,896 --> 00:42:30,604
Do you think you owe Zhang Xiao something?

478
00:42:30,604 --> 00:42:32,495
Are you worried about her?

479
00:42:32,495 --> 00:42:35,237
Do you want someone to take care of her?

480
00:42:39,854 --> 00:42:43,087
Alright, don't worry.

481
00:42:43,746 --> 00:42:45,229
Don't worry.

482
00:42:50,145 --> 00:42:52,045
Don't worry.
