00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,550
<i>[Scarlet Heart 2]</i>

2
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:42,980
<i>[Episode 13]</i>

3
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:51,619
Not ready yet?

4
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:52,552
It's almost time.

5
00:01:52,552 --> 00:01:54,744
Zhentian, come take a look.

6
00:01:54,744 --> 00:01:56,535
Which one looks better?

7
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:58,619
This one or that one?

8
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,827
The one you're holding in your hand looks good.

9
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:03,911
Simple but elegant.

10
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:06,236
It matches your outfit.

11
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:11,786
Zhentian, look at me properly.

12
00:02:11,786 --> 00:02:13,827
Am I overdressed?

13
00:02:13,827 --> 00:02:16,786
No, it's perfect.

14
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:19,159
Take it easy.

15
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,410
Just treat it as normal family dinner.

16
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,744
Our sons are just coming back to visit us.

17
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:26,159
But I'm so excited.

18
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,635
This is Yin Zheng's first time bringing his girlfriend home.

19
00:02:28,635 --> 00:02:31,660
He's had so many girlfriends previously, but she's the first.

20
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,970
And Sihan.

21
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,280
I've never met any of his girlfriends.

22
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:40,543
But I trust he has great taste.

23
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:46,478
These two girls might be our future daugher-in-laws.

24
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,652
Before I forget.

25
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:53,360
Look at these two necklaces.

26
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,159
Do you think they will like it?

27
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,343
These have been in your collection for years.

28
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,827
Are you willing to give them away?

29
00:02:58,827 --> 00:03:02,969
Yes, these two necklaces are my favorite.

30
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:06,544
But they're nothing compared to my lovely sons.

31
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:11,094
Sihan is coming home.

32
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:16,178
I do hope the two of them can iron out their disputes and become united,

33
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:19,502
assisting you in developing a better future for Zhen Tian Group.

34
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:27,102
I hope they can understand your good intentions.

35
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:32,136
I really hope for our family to be together.

36
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:36,394
Harmonious and complete.

37
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,700
Hello? What is it?

38
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:54,752
The movie premiere?

39
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:58,119
I thought I told you to turn it down.

40
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:00,119
I know it's important,

41
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,427
but I have something more critical.

42
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:03,744
Sorry.

43
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:12,452
If you have something important to attend, then we shouldn't go.

44
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,694
I don't really want to attend anyways.

45
00:04:15,677 --> 00:04:17,478
Why?

46
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:20,660
Isn't it your first family gathering in twenty years?

47
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,619
If they really thought of me as family,

48
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:25,894
they wouldn't have worked together to mess with me.

49
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:28,869
Asking me to first take down Kang Sihan,

50
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,219
then having Kang Sihan join Zhen Tian.

51
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:34,327
I'm the bad guy while he gets to be the good guy.

52
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,136
The old man is so cunning.

53
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:41,327
If that's the case, then you should definitely be there.

54
00:04:41,327 --> 00:04:43,260
If you don't go,

55
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,510
they'll suspect you,

56
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,319
and think that you're upset with Kang Sihan coming home.

57
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,469
I am upset.

58
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:54,052
I have been working hard at Zhen Tian Group for ten years

59
00:04:54,052 --> 00:04:56,260
to earn my current title.

60
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,159
What has Kang Sihan done?

61
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,802
Why is he entitled to the same status as mine?

62
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:11,159
I believe in your capabilities.

63
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:27,786
Are you going to a red carpet?

64
00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:30,485
I think it's fine.

65
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:32,886
It's a family reunion, so I'm dressing a bit formal.

66
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:36,059
You clean up quite nice.

67
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:39,860
Wait a moment.

68
00:05:42,952 --> 00:05:45,902
Don't you think we're clashing a bit?

69
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:49,952
A bit.

70
00:05:49,952 --> 00:05:51,410
Give me a minute.

71
00:05:54,577 --> 00:05:56,952
Here, change into this.

72
00:06:01,343 --> 00:06:04,077
The color and material is pretty good.

73
00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:05,327
Was this expensive?

74
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:06,960
Don't worry about it. It's not expensive.

75
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,530
Just put it on.

76
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:11,669
Wait for me then.

77
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:30,680
Not bad.

78
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,210
Get in the car.

79
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,560
You're driving your boss' car again?

80
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,911
Aren't you worried you'll scratch it?

81
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:39,660
Trust my driving skills.

82
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,111
Get in.

83
00:06:48,385 --> 00:06:49,869
Let's get our responses in order.

84
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:51,619
Responses for what?

85
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,552
Your family is going to ask

86
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:56,594
about when we met and how long we've been together.

87
00:06:56,594 --> 00:06:57,827
How should I respond?

88
00:06:57,827 --> 00:07:00,119
We should have the same reply, shouldn't we?

89
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,327
If you're asked questions you don't know how to answer,

90
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:05,494
just keep smiling.

91
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,119
That's not a bad solution.

92
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:12,894
And...

93
00:07:13,744 --> 00:07:15,927
It's fine. We'll talk about it when we get there.

94
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:17,202
What do you mean?

95
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:19,494
It'll be too late if we wait until then.

96
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:24,285
Just keep calm no matter what.

97
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:28,259
Are you worried about my acting?

98
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,119
Not at all.

99
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:32,577
You'll know what I'm talking about

100
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,469
after this dinner.

101
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:37,660
So secretive.

102
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,527
Okay, let's go.

103
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,869
Siyu, you're here.

104
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:00,785
I've been here for a while, Second Brother.

105
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,369
What are you doing here?

106
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:05,435
Mr. Horseshit?

107
00:08:05,435 --> 00:08:07,919
You know each other?

108
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:10,159
She went to my stud-farm before.

109
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,610
Her horse riding skills are pretty good.

110
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,277
What did he just call you?

111
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:17,952
Siyu, my brother.

112
00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:21,119
This is Zhang Xiao, my girlfriend.

113
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:23,119
Girlfriend?

114
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,535
What's wrong?

115
00:08:26,178 --> 00:08:27,385
Nothing.

116
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:30,078
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.

117
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:43,577
Everyone is already here.

118
00:08:47,552 --> 00:08:50,002
Zhang Xiao, what are you doing here?

119
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:51,827
She is my girlfriend.

120
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:53,336
Girlfriend?

121
00:08:58,343 --> 00:09:00,036
You two make a good couple.

122
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:01,343
Thank you.

123
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,760
This is?

124
00:09:08,886 --> 00:09:10,510
My girlfriend.

125
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:14,952
Nice to meet you, Director Kang. I'm Lan Lan.

126
00:09:15,927 --> 00:09:17,485
Nice to meet you.

127
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:21,494
Who are you?

128
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,302
Don't you know?

129
00:09:23,302 --> 00:09:28,144
He is the chairman's son, Kang Sihan.

130
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:31,652
Kang Sihan?

131
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:33,802
Zhang Xiao,

132
00:09:33,802 --> 00:09:36,860
don't you know your boyfriend's name?

133
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,869
We usually refer to each other by nickname.

134
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:42,602
I don't think I need to explain this further with you.

135
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:47,243
You don't need to explain, and I don't want to know.

136
00:09:47,243 --> 00:09:50,952
But be honest, Sihan.

137
00:09:50,952 --> 00:09:52,985
Where do you rent this girlfriend of yours from?

138
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:55,243
Yin Zheng,

139
00:09:55,243 --> 00:09:57,627
please have some respect.

140
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:00,143
You're all here.

141
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:01,660
Mom.

142
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,078
Dad, Mom.

143
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:04,635
Chairman.

144
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:07,159
We are having dinner together tonight.

145
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:09,285
Don't call me Chairman.

146
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:11,594
Dad, Mom, let me introduce you.

147
00:10:11,594 --> 00:10:13,219
This is Big Brother's girlfriend,

148
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:15,702
and this is Second Brother's girlfriend.

149
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:19,285
She looks just like Lan Lan.

150
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,369
They look almost identical.

151
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:24,844
It's the talk of our company.

152
00:10:24,844 --> 00:10:27,178
She is the Zhang Xiao I always mention to you.

153
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:30,302
She's an advertisement graphic designer from our Planning Department.

154
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:34,952
Uncle, Auntie, nice to meet you.

155
00:10:34,952 --> 00:10:36,802
I just came back from filming in Korea,

156
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,535
and brought back some Korean ginseng.

157
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:40,202
Some health supplements for you.

158
00:10:40,202 --> 00:10:42,410
Lan Lan, you are so courteous.

159
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,535
Just a simple dinner, and you brought us gifts.

160
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:45,760
Thank you.

161
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,327
You're welcome.

162
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:52,159
Sihan.

163
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:54,119
Aunt Lan.

164
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:57,977
I am glad to see you today.

165
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:02,869
I can't believe your girlfriend looks so similar to Yin Zheng's girlfriend.

166
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:05,078
This is fate.

167
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:06,677
It's just a coincidence.

168
00:11:06,677 --> 00:11:09,452
When did you two get together?

169
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:11,269
We...

170
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:13,243
Not too long ago.

171
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:15,110
Great.

172
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,427
Please be seated.

173
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:18,211
Mom, give it to me.

174
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:25,269
It's rare for our family to get together.

175
00:11:25,944 --> 00:11:28,994
Sihan, welcome back home.

176
00:11:28,994 --> 00:11:32,243
I know you have a lot of opinions about me.

177
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:34,327
I know even if you don't tell me.

178
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:40,694
I hope all the unhappiness can be erased after this drink.

179
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,535
Cheers.

180
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:54,394
Let's have soup.

181
00:12:02,577 --> 00:12:03,811
Lan Lan,

182
00:12:03,811 --> 00:12:07,860
do you talk to your family often?

183
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,219
Yes, I do.

184
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:11,694
I'm on the phone with them almost every day.

185
00:12:12,485 --> 00:12:14,269
How about Zhang Xiao?

186
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:18,594
My father often brings expedition teams to the desert.

187
00:12:18,594 --> 00:12:21,719
So it's hard to get into contact with him.

188
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:24,302
I remember when I screened through your resume

189
00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:27,719
you told me that your father was a retired physical education teacher.

190
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:28,819
Yes.

191
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:32,343
His hobby is to be a tour guide for expedition teams.

192
00:12:32,343 --> 00:12:35,036
Does he talk to you about your mom?

193
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:36,835
Yes, always.

194
00:12:36,835 --> 00:12:41,159
But since my mom passed away so early in her life,

195
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:45,343
my dad is only left with thoughts and fantasies of her.

196
00:12:45,343 --> 00:12:48,711
So every story he tells of my mom is slightly different.

197
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,627
Let's have soup.

198
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,678
Sihan, I'll have Aunt Rong cook for you the next time you're home.

199
00:13:02,635 --> 00:13:05,427
I do miss Aunt Rong's cooking.

200
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:08,011
It's the taste of my mother's cooking.

201
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:11,202
Based on what you said,

202
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:13,552
you're saying your mom taught Aunt Rong the dishes she cooks?

203
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:15,927
Didn't you know?

204
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:19,494
I always thought that my mom taught Aunt Rong her dishes.

205
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:24,660
Sihan, is there something wrong with your memory or mine?

206
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,927
Why don't we ask Aunt Rong?

207
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:27,619
Yin Zheng.

208
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:29,469
Alright, Big Brother. Let's just eat.

209
00:13:29,469 --> 00:13:31,202
Why are we discussing these serious topics?

210
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:33,219
Aren't you tired of them?

211
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:35,719
Fine, we'll stop talking about this.

212
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:39,994
But Sihan hasn't had much Chinese food these years.

213
00:13:39,994 --> 00:13:42,286
Seems like he lowered his standards.

214
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:50,159
I'm not sure about Sihan's standards for food,

215
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,586
but he chose a great partner.

216
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:56,994
Zhang Xiao is a smart and beautiful girl.

217
00:13:56,994 --> 00:13:58,802
You have good taste.

218
00:13:59,994 --> 00:14:01,802
Come on.

219
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:03,460
Cheers.

220
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,902
Are you okay?

221
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:19,819
Excuse me.

222
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:23,160
I'll go with you.

223
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:46,302
What do you want?

224
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,159
I'm asking you.

225
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:51,036
I told you many times.

226
00:14:51,036 --> 00:14:54,011
We're not related in any way.

227
00:14:54,011 --> 00:14:56,469
Why are you here?

228
00:14:56,469 --> 00:14:59,036
Can't you stay away from me?

229
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:01,744
I'm only here to do my friend a favor.

230
00:15:01,744 --> 00:15:03,302
It has nothing to do with you.

231
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,969
Only?

232
00:15:09,385 --> 00:15:14,644
You're wearing a custom-made high-end evening dress just to do a favor?

233
00:15:15,152 --> 00:15:18,994
What a costly favor.

234
00:15:18,994 --> 00:15:22,327
Is this expensive?

235
00:15:22,327 --> 00:15:24,259
Stop pretending!

236
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:28,069
Do you think you'll become someone by putting on this dress?

237
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,302
Stop washing it.

238
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:41,594
The material gets ruined with water.

239
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:48,635
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

240
00:15:48,635 --> 00:15:52,060
Then how would I have proven that you're rube?

241
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:58,094
Zhang Xiao,

242
00:15:58,094 --> 00:16:01,259
don't say I didn't warn you.

243
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:04,369
You're being played by both father and son.

244
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:06,960
Can't you tell?

245
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:11,535
Kang Sihan is using you as a free replacement

246
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:13,744
to infuriate his old man.

247
00:16:13,744 --> 00:16:18,669
And the old man is using you to butter up his son.

248
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,886
I hope you don't think they take you seriously.

249
00:16:21,886 --> 00:16:24,452
If they really cared about you,

250
00:16:24,452 --> 00:16:26,843
they wouldn't have kept you in the dark.

251
00:16:27,702 --> 00:16:30,159
Look in the mirror.

252
00:16:30,777 --> 00:16:35,010
Cinderella is just a fairy tale.

253
00:16:48,011 --> 00:16:50,136
Xiaoxiao.

254
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:51,886
Please give this back to your mom.

255
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,369
Xiaoxiao, please let me explain.

256
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:55,119
There's nothing to explain.

257
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:58,635
Do the wealthy like having entertainment during their family gatherings?

258
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:01,635
Why did it have to be me? Are you messing with me?

259
00:17:01,635 --> 00:17:04,052
I didn't mean to embarrass you on purpose.

260
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:06,760
Don't lie to me.

261
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,952
You've been lying to me since day one.

262
00:17:08,952 --> 00:17:10,552
Black Cat Detective, conciege,

263
00:17:10,552 --> 00:17:12,577
good boss, they're all lies!

264
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:14,802
I won't trust you anymore.

265
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:15,786
You're a liar.

266
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:18,152
Xiaoxiao, please listen to me.

267
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:20,994
I just wanted to get to know you as equals.

268
00:17:20,994 --> 00:17:23,369
I didn't want my background to cause you any burden.

269
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:26,427
Yes, I told a white lie.

270
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:28,911
I wanted to tell you the truth today.

271
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:31,702
I want you to know everything about me

272
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:33,652
because I like you.

273
00:17:44,827 --> 00:17:47,702
Xiaoxiao.

274
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:50,494
Let me go.

275
00:17:50,494 --> 00:17:52,094
Let her go.

276
00:17:52,094 --> 00:17:54,552
Kang Sihan, watch yourself.

277
00:17:54,552 --> 00:17:57,078
This is none of your business.

278
00:17:57,078 --> 00:17:58,569
Are you okay?

279
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:07,552

I wanted to.

00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:09,769
You want everything that's mine.

292
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:11,594
She doesn't belong to you.

293
00:19:11,594 --> 00:19:13,527

298
00:20:01,036 --> 00:20:02,302
Good morning, Director Yin.

299
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,835
Do you need something?

300
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:07,577
Thanks for the jacket.

301
00:20:08,552 --> 00:20:10,211
Did you wash it?

302
00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:16,219
Please send it for dry cleaning before returning it to me.

303
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:19,900
When you send it for dry cleaning,

304
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,760
tell them to not use bleach or softener.

305
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,510
And don't use vanilla scented dry cleaning solution.

306
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,136
And remember to not iron press for more than ten minutes.

307
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:29,744
Got it?

308
00:20:49,385 --> 00:20:50,494
Did you hear?

309
00:20:50,494 --> 00:20:52,827
The company recruited a handsome vice president.

310
00:20:52,827 --> 00:20:55,343
That's none of my business.

311
00:20:55,343 --> 00:20:57,294
Sure it is.

312
00:20:57,294 --> 00:21:01,027
I heard that he's the chairman's son.

313
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:04,352
Dating Director Kang

314
00:21:04,352 --> 00:21:07,194
will give you leverage over Lan Lan.

315
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:11,377
You always doze off when you're working,

316
00:21:11,377 --> 00:21:13,702
but you can't stop talking when it's about guys.

317
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:16,094
I don't want to talk to you.

318
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,078
Director Kang, this way please.

319
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:20,619
Everyone.

320
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:23,535
Put down your work for a bit.

321
00:21:26,394 --> 00:21:29,027
Let me introduce you.

322
00:21:29,027 --> 00:21:33,452
This is Zhen Tian Group's newly appointed vice president.

323
00:21:33,452 --> 00:21:35,702
Mr Kang Sihan.

324
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:44,143
Director Kang thinks highly of our Planning Department.

325
00:21:44,143 --> 00:21:47,452
And so he came for a visit on his first day.

326
00:21:47,452 --> 00:21:48,436
Therefore,

327
00:21:48,436 --> 00:21:52,878
let's give Director Kang a warm applause.

328
00:21:54,869 --> 00:21:57,936
Xiaoxiao, why does he look so familiar?

329
00:21:57,936 --> 00:22:00,994
Everyone, I'm Kang Sihan.

330
00:22:00,994 --> 00:22:05,019
If you want, you can call me Sihan or Xiao Kang.

331
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:07,260
However, if the chairman is here,

332
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,243
I wouldn't suggest for you to call me that

333
00:22:09,243 --> 00:22:11,327
because he might think...

334
00:22:11,908 --> 00:22:13,866
That you're addressing him as Xiao Kang.

335
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:19,142
I heard that everyone is very interested in the details of my personal life.

336
00:22:19,142 --> 00:22:22,099
So I'll tell you all now.

337
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:23,542
I am 32 years old,

338
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,350
182cm, 70kg.

339
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,309
I hope for these numbers to remain the same for the next 50 years.

340
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:31,809
My horoscope is Scorpio, blood type O,

341
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,309
and my favorite color is beige.

342
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:35,309
I spent a few years in the UK.

343
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:39,642
Everyone might think I like fast food such as burgers and french fries,

344
00:22:39,642 --> 00:22:42,242
but I'm here to honestly tell you

345
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:44,584
that food in the UK is disgusting.

346
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:48,517
It's just slightly better than Sumatra civet coffee.

347
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:54,018
My favorite food is northwestern Chinese cuisine.

348
00:22:54,018 --> 00:22:56,183
Especially mutton soup

349
00:22:56,183 --> 00:22:58,125
and grain.

350
00:22:59,684 --> 00:23:02,726
Last but not least, I'd like to say that although I'm still single,

351
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:05,018
there's already someone I'm interested in.

352
00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:09,425
My heard belongs to this kind girl with a pure heart.

353
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:13,709
Alright.

354
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:15,267
That's all our chatting today.

355
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:16,876
Thanks, everybody.

356
00:23:19,892 --> 00:23:22,767
Alright. Please continue your work now.

357
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:25,325
Director Kang, this way please.

358
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,000
Director Kang seems easy to get along with.

359
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:33,609
He just has a glib tongue.

360
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:37,625
- He seems like a liar.
- Director Kang, I'll introduce you to some of our colleagues.

361
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:42,059
He's coming.

362
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,767
Director Kang, let's me introduce.

363
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:45,734
She is Zhang Xiao.

364
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:48,018
Zhang Xiao, this girl...

365
00:23:48,018 --> 00:23:50,426
Let me introduce. Huang Di, come here.

366
00:23:58,018 --> 00:24:00,500
Why are you avoiding me?

367
00:24:01,392 --> 00:24:04,600
Director Kang, you have the wrong person.

368
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,834
Are you still mad at me?

369
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:11,500
Mad at you? Not worthwhile.

370
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,709
You're thinner than air in the Tibetan Plateau to me.

371
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:18,851
What am I supposed to do if you pretending to not know me?

372
00:24:18,851 --> 00:24:20,584
What if I want mutton soup?

373
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,726
What if I want to go to Shichahai to set off firecrackers?

374
00:24:23,726 --> 00:24:26,600
I think it's necessary for me to inform you seriously.

375
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,350
Although I am just a white collar,

376
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,225
I may be insignificant in your eye,

377
00:24:30,225 --> 00:24:32,099
but I still have dignity.

378
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:36,959
I would never ever become entertainment for the rich second generation.

379
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:37,709
ZX, I-

380
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,209
Sorry, please do not disturb my work.

381
00:25:13,392 --> 00:25:14,867
Come in please.

382
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:16,375
Director Kang.

383
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,225
Zhuo Yue.

384
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,667
Our office is all packed up.

385
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:21,100
All the stuff was moved over.

386
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,225
The stores also started the renovations.

387
00:25:23,225 --> 00:25:25,751
Will you consider moving to some place near by?

388
00:25:25,751 --> 00:25:27,999
No, I'll stay where I am.

389
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:30,767
But your commute won't be easy.

390
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:33,600
Love itself isn't easy to begin with.

391
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,042
Love?

392
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:40,417
I mean that working is same as falling in love.

393
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:44,392
The more you want to have, the greater effort and time you need to put in.

394
00:25:44,392 --> 00:25:45,709
Okay.

430
00:28:40,225 --> 00:28:42,918
When I found out he lied to me,

431
00:28:42,918 --> 00:28:45,200
I felt stupid.

432
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,334
I never thought

433
00:28:48,992 --> 00:28:51,267
that would happen.

434
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:57,559
Princess, I'm angry.

435
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:59,999
Very, very angry.

436
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:01,767
What are you angry at?

437
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:03,726
Because he didn't kiss you long enough?

438
00:29:03,726 --> 00:29:06,042
Or because the kiss wasn't deep enough?

439
00:29:06,684 --> 00:29:07,825
Princess,

440
00:29:07,825 --> 00:29:12,309
don't try to pass your capitalistic thoughts onto me, okay?

441
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:15,059
It's not about the kiss.

442
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:17,892
It's because he lied to me about who he was.

443
00:29:17,892 --> 00:29:19,267
He's not Black Cat Detective, not a concierge,

444
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:20,684
and not a drifter.

445
00:29:20,684 --> 00:29:22,142
What's wrong with that?

446
00:29:22,142 --> 00:29:25,626
Do you wish for your boyfriend to be a concierge?

447
00:29:25,626 --> 00:29:27,517
- I...
- I know.

448
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:30,792
Black Cat Detective isn't the problem.

449
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:33,600
It's you.

450
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,309
What do you mean?

451
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:37,751
Lack of confidence.

452
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:39,267
What are you talking about?

453
00:29:39,267 --> 00:29:41,267
I'm just as great as he is.

454
00:29:41,267 --> 00:29:43,918
I was awarded with the good student award five times,

455
00:29:43,918 --> 00:29:45,409
outstanding class leader four times,

456
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,876
and my university design project ranked in the top 9.

457
00:29:47,876 --> 00:29:48,999
Okay, okay.

458
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:51,250
Stop lying to yourself.

459
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,575
Let's strive for a better future.

460
00:29:53,575 --> 00:29:55,559
I'm going to the studio.

461
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,626
Bye now.

462
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,959
Bad princess.

463
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:11,099
Xiaoxiao.

464
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:12,959
Let me share a secret with you.

465
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:14,542
What?

466
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:18,250
The mysterious chef who gave you the cake is...

467
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:28,409
You found the chef?

468
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,809
No, not yet.

469
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:31,909
Then why did you mention him?

470
00:30:32,851 --> 00:30:35,125
Did I mention him? I...

471
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:39,225
I'm trying to say you should stop investigating.

472
00:30:39,225 --> 00:30:41,642
It was a free cake.

473
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:42,726
It would've been a waste if we didn't enjoy it,

474
00:30:42,726 --> 00:30:44,500
and it didn't cost anything to us in the first place.

475
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Crazy.

476
00:30:48,492 --> 00:30:50,950
You're just an idiot.

477
00:31:00,475 --> 00:31:04,492
What do I have to do for you to forgive me?

478
00:31:05,642 --> 00:31:06,709
Director Kang.

479
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:08,375
What do you mean?

480
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:10,125
This is none of your business.

481
00:31:11,475 --> 00:31:14,542
Do you think you can avoid me forever?

482
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:18,809
What is he talking about?

483
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:22,000
Cheater Huang, make him disappear within the next three seconds.

484
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:26,183
Are you crazy?

485
00:31:26,183 --> 00:31:28,667
Sorry, who are you?

486
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:29,892
Director Kang.

487
00:31:29,892 --> 00:31:31,250
I am Huang Di from the Planning Department.

488
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,751
No, I'm Huang Di.

489
00:31:32,751 --> 00:31:33,976
Not the Huang in emperor,

490
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:35,526
but the Huang as in yellow.

491
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,767
Mr. Huang, come on.

492
00:31:41,876 --> 00:31:44,492
I can understand how you're feeling.

493
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:47,892
If I was in your shoes,

494
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:52,767
and you asked me to accept someone who hid their entire background,

495
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:54,876
it would be hard for me as well.

496
00:31:54,876 --> 00:31:59,325
Getting to know someone should be intimate and interesting.

497
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:01,642
But my shamelessness

498
00:32:01,642 --> 00:32:04,976
hurt you instead.

499
00:32:04,976 --> 00:32:07,442
If you know you're being shameless,

500
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:09,584
why are you still here?

501
00:32:09,584 --> 00:32:11,718
I was indeed shameless.

502
00:32:12,325 --> 00:32:15,167
But I don't want to lie to you about myself anymore.

503
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:17,767
I want you to know the real me.

504
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:24,309
I invited you to our family gathering that day

505
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:28,409
because I wanted to let you know my true identity.

506
00:32:29,325 --> 00:32:31,200
But I didn't expect

507
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,542
that it would hurt you.

508
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:38,083
I am sorry.

509
00:32:39,475 --> 00:32:41,509
No need to apologize.

510
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,242
Director Kang,

511
00:32:45,142 --> 00:32:46,799
I can't afford it.

512
00:32:50,951 --> 00:32:53,025
Please give me one more chance.

513
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:56,409
Let me turn over a new leaf.

514
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:04,876
What is that? Chilis?

515
00:33:04,876 --> 00:33:06,950
What is he doing?

516
00:33:11,684 --> 00:33:15,999
♫ <i>Even if my smile returns</i> ♫

517
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:23,417

You thought

532

I made you a laughing stock.

533
00:34:38,517 --> 00:34:42,151
I am now the laughing stock of the company.

534
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:46,050
Are you happy now?

535
00:34:48,642 --> 00:34:50,367
We're even now.

536
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,892
I like you.

537
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,500
Be my girlfriend.

538
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:21,792
Say yes! Say yes!

540
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:24,709
- Yeah, what?
- Why did she leave?

541
00:35:53,976 --> 00:35:55,592
It's real.

542
00:35:56,934 --> 00:35:58,742
I'm not dreaming.

543
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:30,150
I don't know Kang Sihan.

544
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,367

Maybe you can still change things.

Can't you tell we're closed for today?

603
00:40:24,976 --> 00:40:26,851
My sister Ling Dang.

605

Please get me a drink.

606
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:32,710
I'm not your sister.

607

00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:35,559

610
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:47,325
Are you talking about Zhang Xiao?

611
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:50,042
Who else?

612
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,367
I don't get it.

613
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,542
What's so great about her?

614
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:58,867
She has so many admirers.

615
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:02,100
I need to clarify something.

616
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,934
I am different from all these guys.

617
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:08,209
Back in the day, it was Zhang Xiao who begged me to be with her.

618
00:41:08,784 --> 00:41:10,918
It's a story of the past.

619
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:12,784
You can tell it however you like.

620
00:41:13,876 --> 00:41:16,467
I'm not making it up.

621
00:41:16,467 --> 00:41:20,267
When I competed in the school singing competition back in the day,

622
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:22,309
I just needed to sing one song,

623
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:25,167
and all the ladies in the crowd cheered.

624
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:27,392
They gave me chocolates, love letters, flowers.

625
00:41:27,392 --> 00:41:29,167
It wouldn't even fit in a truck.

626
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:31,051
However,

627
00:41:31,051 --> 00:41:33,409
there was one unique gift in the bunch.

628
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:35,325
It was Zhang Xiao's gift.

629
00:41:36,767 --> 00:41:38,809
That's why I chose to be with her.

630
00:41:43,325 --> 00:41:45,042
What did she give to you?

631
00:41:49,118 --> 00:41:50,517
Height increase insoles.

632
00:41:52,517 --> 00:41:56,242

633
