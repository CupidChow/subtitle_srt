3
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:35,550
<i>Good morning, Black Cat Detective.</i>

4
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,509
<i>The weather is nice.</i>

5
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:39,300
<i>Do you have any plans today?</i>

6
00:02:43,742 --> 00:02:46,867
<i>Sorry, I've been busy.</i>

7
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,134
<i>See you on your birthday.</i>

8
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:01,492
Lan Lan, are you here to pick me up from work?

9
00:03:01,492 --> 00:03:02,926
Who said that?

10
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:05,176
I just happened to be in the area.

11
00:03:05,176 --> 00:03:08,784
If you just happened to be here, then I'm lucky.

12
00:03:08,784 --> 00:03:11,492
If you went out of your way, then I'm unlucky.

13
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:12,909
Why?

14
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:17,700
I heard from your agent that you charge by the second.

15
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,926
If you come pick me up every day,

16
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:21,784
I would be bankrupt soon.

17
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:25,692
I also heard that you're surrounded by ladies.

18
00:03:25,692 --> 00:03:29,259
I need to get in line to invite you for dinner.

19
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,542
Not recently, business hasn't been good.

20
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,909
By the way, I want to switch hotels.

21
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:40,951
Why? You don't like it there?

22
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:45,210
I want to be closer to you.

23
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:50,242
I'll have Assistant Qiao make arrangements.

24
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,659
Come on, let's eat.

25
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:05,751
What do you want to eat?

26
00:04:06,884 --> 00:04:09,534
I know a good Russian restaurant.

27
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,784
Whatever you like.

28
00:04:24,342 --> 00:04:26,325
What's happening?

29
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:27,867
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

30
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,159
Elevator failure.

31
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,409
Yin Zheng, I'm scared.

32
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:41,367
You're going to be okay. Don't be scared.

33
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:51,434
Is anyone there?

34
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:52,992
Go ahead.

35
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,034
I'm Yin Zheng.

36
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:55,492
We're trapped in the elevator.

37
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:57,059
Send the engineers.

38
00:04:57,059 --> 00:04:58,200
Okay, got it.

39
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,784
The elevator is experiencing failure.

40
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:01,183
We'll send someone immediately.

41
00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:03,076
How long will it be?

42
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:05,009
Please wait, we're working on it now.

43
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:06,000
Hurry.

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,500

<i>No!</i>

48
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:37,800
- Lan Lan.
- Let me out.

49
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,267
- Let me out!
- What's wrong? Don't be scared.

50
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:40,259
Don't touch me!

51
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,851

53

Please let me out.

00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,159
I'm by your side.

56
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,718
Don't be scared.

57
00:05:56,242 --> 00:05:57,800
Everything will be fine.

58
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:01,283
Let me out.

59
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:06,159
Everything will be fine.

60
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,867

Yin Zheng.

Why did you only come now?

70
00:06:44,492 --> 00:06:46,300
Don't be scared.

71
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,592
I'll always be by your side.

72
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:50,675
I won't leave you.

73
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,659
I'll never leave.

74
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:56,826
Don't be afraid.

75
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,034

My claustrophobia was triggered.

81
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:39,425
Wasn't it scary?

82
00:07:41,342 --> 00:07:43,284
Stop thinking about it.

83
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:46,826
You're beautiful no matter what.

84
00:07:46,826 --> 00:07:51,775
Did you mean what you said in the elevator?

85
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,459
Or did you just say that to calm me down?

86
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:03,009

I want to ask you a question.

109

Why should I answer you?

I've seen your white magnolia earring.

00:11:58,525 --> 00:12:00,234
What do you mean?

113
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:05,742
I seem to also have one of those earrings.

114
00:12:05,742 --> 00:12:07,800
What can that explain?

115
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,467
I want to know about your earring.

116
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:13,059
What do you want to know?

117
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:15,509
I want to know if the two of us...

118
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:19,759
Miss Zhang, why are you always pestering me?

119
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,976
Are you delusional?

120
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:25,600
Do you think that you're me?

121
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,242
You want to replace me?

122
00:12:27,242 --> 00:12:28,800
Don't get me wrong.

123
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,492
I never thought about that.

124
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:35,867
I just think that the two of us look alike,

125
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:38,051
and we have the same thing.

126
00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:39,700
Maybe we...

127
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,767
We're not related.

128
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:43,450
I'll warn you one last time.

129
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,992
My father is a professor and my mother is an opera singer.

130
00:12:45,992 --> 00:12:47,592
I was born in Australia.

131
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:49,092
I'm the only child.

132
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:51,059
What more do you want to know?

133
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,551
Sorry.

134
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:57,992
Forget I asked.

135
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:18,425
President Kang.

136
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:20,283
How is the investigation of the fire going?

137
00:13:20,283 --> 00:13:24,383
They found that it was induced by the alcohol in our perfume warehouse.

138
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:26,884
There were no signs of human trail.

139
00:13:26,884 --> 00:13:28,842
That's impossible.

140
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:31,034
I also think it's very strange.

141
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,575
This scoundrel has always liked playing dirty.

142
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:39,509
I didn't expect him to still be like that.

143
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:42,034
President Kang, who are you referring to?

144
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:43,650
A rival.

145
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:47,299
A rival who shouldn't have appeared in my life.

146
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:49,617
I didn't expect for him to become my lifetime opponent.

147
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:52,450
President Kang, I don't understand.

148
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,642
You don't need to understand.

149
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:54,951
He has nothing to do with you.

150
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:56,784
I'm his target.

151
00:13:56,784 --> 00:14:00,467
How are the negotiations with the factories?

152
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:02,634
Not going very smoothly.

153
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,059
Two more breached their contracts.

154
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:05,934
With similar excuses as before.

155
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:10,259
Now we still have ninety orders who don't have a manufacturer.

156
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:14,867
We'll lose about three million if we don't meet the orders.

157
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:17,383
We have less than a month.

158
00:14:17,383 --> 00:14:22,534
And we're losing another seven million from the two fires.

159
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:27,109
He wants to kill me.

160
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,909
President Kang.

161
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,909
You can all leave.

162
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:33,034
I want to be alone.

163
00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:34,800
One more thing.

164
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,234
Say it.

165
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,310

167
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,159
Help me appease those who want to resign.

168
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,842
Tell them, I'll find a way to weather the storm.

169
00:14:56,842 --> 00:14:58,675
Sorry, President Kang.

170
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:00,617
My letter is also among them.

171
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:01,909
You want to leave too?

172
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:04,550
I know it's bad timing.

173
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,575
But...

174
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:07,076
Don't say anymore.

175
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:10,476
Have you found a new job?

176
00:15:14,176 --> 00:15:16,575
I'm asking as a friend.

177
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:17,951
Yes.

178
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:20,817
Zhen Tian.

179
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:22,942
Sihan, I'm sorry.

180
00:15:23,575 --> 00:15:26,659
It's okay, I understand.

181
00:15:27,742 --> 00:15:29,534
I'll get going then.

182
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:30,967
Wait.

183
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:35,118
Return the resignation letters to them.

184
00:15:35,118 --> 00:15:37,434
Tell them I don't accept.

185
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:39,525
I understand that you are very angry now.

186
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:42,199
But what can you change?

187
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:44,450
I don't accept their resignation.

188
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,283
You're all leaving

189
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:48,592
because I fired you.

190
00:15:48,592 --> 00:15:50,742
Because according to the labor laws,

191
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,383
you can all get additional compensation this way.

192
00:15:53,383 --> 00:15:57,218
Sihan, why are you doing this?

193
00:15:57,218 --> 00:15:59,409
The company doesn't have that much money to begin with.

194
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:01,759
You're pushing yourself towards a dead end.

195
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,367
This is my own business.

196
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:05,383
It has nothing to do with you.

197
00:16:05,383 --> 00:16:07,326
The compensation treat as the memorial we work together

198
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:11,142
as a keepsake for our time working together.

199
00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:15,409
Then I thank you on behalf of everyone.

200
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,325
Alright, we're friends.

201
00:16:17,325 --> 00:16:19,550
Don't get so emotional.

202
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,592
Do your best at Zhen Tian.

203
00:16:21,592 --> 00:16:23,699
Come visit me when you can.

204
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:31,592
Okay, just go.

205
00:16:31,592 --> 00:16:32,367
I'll go then.

206
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,742
Go ahead.

207
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:25,300
<i>Mom, please believe in your son.</i>

208
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,920
<i>Z&X will not end like this.</i>

209
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,951
Dear, Happy Birthday.

210
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:45,550
You're good. How did you know it was my birthday?

211
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,642
Huang Di told me.

212
00:17:46,642 --> 00:17:50,218
Huang Di? What a big mouth.

213
00:17:50,218 --> 00:17:52,700
But really, thank you.

214
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,800
Huang Di is not a big mouth.

215
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,425
He has deep feelings for you.

216
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:05,183
He even said you and him were a perfect match.

217
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:09,334
And that you've lived together for many years.

218
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:12,176
Damn Huang Di.

219
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:14,409
His mouth is going to rot.

220
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:17,299
Remember.

221
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:19,926
Take everything he says as the opposite.

222
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:24,484
It seems like there's someone else.

223
00:18:26,734 --> 00:18:29,118
Do you really have a boyfriend?

224
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:33,575
I really envy you.

225
00:18:33,575 --> 00:18:36,400
Certainly he's better than Huang Di.

226
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,242
It's like when others switch houses.

227
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:42,009
Every time they switch, the greater the house.

228
00:18:42,575 --> 00:18:46,867
Why can't my life be that good?

229
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:48,325
Alright.

230
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:52,950
You will certainly find your love within the Zhen Tian building.

231
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:55,584
I have to go, bye.

232
00:19:05,051 --> 00:19:07,951
Jack, have you seen Zhang Xiao?

233
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:09,342
Zhang Xiao.

234
00:19:09,342 --> 00:19:11,742
You look for Zhang Xiao every day.

235
00:19:11,742 --> 00:19:14,034
What's your relationship?

236
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:16,759
You can't tell?

237
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,967
You seem like a couple,

238
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:21,399
but Zhang Xiao never looks at you in the eye.

239
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:23,199
Or you could just be colleagues,

240
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:25,342
but you live together.

241
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:28,067
I can't tell.

242
00:19:31,134 --> 00:19:33,951
What do you mean she doesn't look me in the eye?

243
00:19:33,951 --> 00:19:36,867
It's me who doesn't look her in the eye.

244
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:40,183
Our love can be written into a romance story.

245
00:19:40,183 --> 00:19:42,300
A romance story?

246
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,867
I love romances.

247
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:45,967
Especially Tong Hua's.

248
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:50,026
Tell me your story.

249
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:51,617
You like Tong Hua right?

250
00:19:51,617 --> 00:19:54,199
Our story is even more interesting than Qiong Yao's.

251
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:57,051
Back in the day...

252
00:19:57,051 --> 00:19:58,283
- Waiter.
- Hello.

253
00:19:58,283 --> 00:19:59,425
I want curry chicken.

254
00:19:59,425 --> 00:20:01,159
Okay, please wait.

255
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,800
Go on.

256
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,259
Back in the day,

257
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:07,059
we were both seventeen years old.

258
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:09,742
We were childhood sweethearts.

259
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:12,325
She loved me so much.

260
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:15,990
Why does it sound so familiar?

261
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,183
What happened next?

262
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:20,659
Time is relentless.

263
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:23,200
I grew up

264
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,700
and got more handsome.

265
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,018
And Zhang Xiao?

266
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:28,299
She doesn't have the figure nor the looks.

267
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:30,867
She's a Fortune Cat when she smiles and the Hulk when she's mad.

268
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:33,434
That's when we started becoming estranged.

269
00:20:33,434 --> 00:20:35,909
Makes sense.

270
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:38,826
I wanted to have an amicable breakup

271
00:20:38,826 --> 00:20:40,450
and just be friends,

272
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,675
but she wouldn't let me go.

273
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:45,359
She followed me wherever I went.

274
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,299
I couldn't escape her.

275
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:50,742
I finally understand why she's sometimes hot and sometimes cold.

276
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:52,617
So that's the story.

277
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:54,325
Yes.

278
00:20:54,325 --> 00:20:57,450
I can't escape her.

279
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,826
Your relationship is messy.

280
00:21:01,675 --> 00:21:03,525
You grew up?

281
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:05,076
Time is relentless?

282
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:06,492
The world is full of love?

283
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:08,450
You can't escape her?

284
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,951
Enough.

285
00:21:09,951 --> 00:21:12,076
You'll kill him.

286
00:21:12,076 --> 00:21:13,834
Let me stir it up for him.

287
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:19,625
Xiao Fan, food's ready.

288
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,226
Coming.

289
00:21:34,342 --> 00:21:35,867
What's wrong?

290
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:37,867
I've never seen you so angry before.

291
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:40,459
This is the price for talking nonsense.

292
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,634
Maybe Huang Di is telling the truth.

293
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:46,034
Zhang Xiao's love life may not be as simple as you think.

294
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:46,867
So what?

295
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:49,367
I like Zhang Xiao, not her love life.

296
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:51,159
You keep saying you like her,

297
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,550
but I don't think that's love.

298
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,367
A tomboy like you has no right to speak.

299
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:58,926
Sure, I'm not a woman in your eyes.

300
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:00,692
But I must tell you.

301
00:22:00,692 --> 00:22:04,675
A woman's heart can only live one man.

302
00:22:04,675 --> 00:22:08,409
No one will take notice of a silly little crush.

303
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:10,425
Do I seem like I lack a place to live?

304
00:22:10,425 --> 00:22:13,559
If you don't, then why are you spending all your time in this dark kitchen?

305
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,009
If you don't want to be here, then leave.

306
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:17,099
No one is forcing you to be here.

307
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:18,509
Step aside.

308
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:26,492
Hi, all your dishes have been served.

309
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:27,909
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

310
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:29,367

340
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:52,892
Uncle Liu, you cared about me the most growing up.

341
00:24:53,442 --> 00:24:56,918
The first person I think of is you whenever I encounter any problems.

342
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:01,276
I know it may be inappropriate to ask for this.

343
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,409
But I really don't want to see my company and brand end like this.

344
00:25:09,492 --> 00:25:11,118
How much do you want to borrow?

345
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:14,550
Twenty million will help me get through this.

346
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,442
Sihan.

347
00:25:16,442 --> 00:25:21,575
I value you the most amongst the chairman's three sons.

348
00:25:21,575 --> 00:25:24,575
But you're also the one that upsets me the most.

349
00:25:24,575 --> 00:25:28,592
You have a very large platform at Zhen Tian Group.

350
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:31,759
The place that can let you succeed is in front of you.

351
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:34,300
But you don't want it

352
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,826
and insist on starting from nothing.

353
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,926
Why do that to yourself?

354
00:25:38,926 --> 00:25:40,467
Uncle Liu.

355
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:42,617
Zhen Tian Group has nothing to do with me.

356
00:25:42,617 --> 00:25:44,617
Why are you saying that?

357
00:25:44,617 --> 00:25:47,575
That's your family.

358
00:25:47,575 --> 00:25:50,909
When I went to Europe visit you,

359
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:55,299
I told you your dad really wishes for you to help him after you graduate.

360
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:58,592
You were young at the time so I could understand.

361
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:02,259
But you're 30 now.

362
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:03,909
You can't be childish.

363
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:05,617
Whether it's the past or now,

364
00:26:05,617 --> 00:26:07,650
my attitude hasn't changed.

365
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,850
I spent twenty years abroad.

366
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,259
I'm used to not having a dad.

367
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:15,109
And now I also don't want to share his glory.

368
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:19,967
I transfer my business back here because I promised my mom.

369
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:22,467
I told her I'd show her a successful business.

370
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:25,076
Kang Zhentian owes her too many things.

371
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:26,575
I want to help her get back her honor.

372
00:26:26,575 --> 00:26:27,700
Sihan.

373
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,467
Uncle Liu, I'm here to borrow money,

374
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:33,942
not here for you to intercede.

375
00:26:35,884 --> 00:26:41,976
Just let me know whether or not you'll help.

376
00:26:43,342 --> 00:26:45,199
Money is not the problem.

377
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:47,717
I have it.

378
00:26:47,717 --> 00:26:54,218
But since your company is Zhen Tian Group's Yue-Sai's competitor,

379
00:26:54,218 --> 00:26:57,659
and I'm one of Zhen Tian Group's directors,

380
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:03,376
I'm afraid I can't lend you the money now.

381
00:27:05,884 --> 00:27:09,159
Okay, I understand.

382
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:15,717
Uncle Liu, I've always admired your morals.

383
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,583
And I still do.

384
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,975
Then...

385
00:27:20,992 --> 00:27:22,826
I'll get going then.

386
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,283
Carry on.

387
00:27:37,383 --> 00:27:38,984
Come out.

388
00:27:38,984 --> 00:27:41,534
The show is over.

389
00:27:45,034 --> 00:27:48,951
Donghai, your acting skills are improving a lot.

390
00:27:48,951 --> 00:27:51,767
I have no choice.

391
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:53,742
You asked me to do this.

392
00:27:53,742 --> 00:27:56,076
It's so embarrassing.

393
00:27:56,076 --> 00:27:57,867
But you have a good eye.

394
00:27:57,867 --> 00:28:00,784
He has the backbone and courage.

395
00:28:00,784 --> 00:28:02,717
It's not enough to just have courage.

396
00:28:02,717 --> 00:28:06,034
It's just destructive aggression.

397
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:13,534
It becomes useless after experiencing failure.

398
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:14,659
It's not easy.

399
00:28:15,218 --> 00:28:17,700
But you also shouldn't make it so difficult for him.

400
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,325
It's because he still has lots to learn.

401
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:23,442
Alright, let's not talk about him anymore.

402
00:28:23,442 --> 00:28:25,717
We haven't finished our chess game.

403
00:28:26,675 --> 00:28:29,367
Every move is risky.

404
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:32,283
The odds are against me.

405
00:28:32,283 --> 00:28:34,842
Seek wealth through risk.

406
00:28:34,842 --> 00:28:37,251
We won't know who will win

407
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,659
until the last moment.

408
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,851
Okay, thanks for the advice.

409
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:44,759
Come on.

410
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:47,283
Checkmate.

411
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:52,592
Amazing, I won three rounds in a row.

412
00:28:52,592 --> 00:28:55,575
Second Uncle, is something on your mind?

413
00:28:55,575 --> 00:28:58,826
I usually lose to you.

414
00:28:58,826 --> 00:29:00,325
There's nothing on my mind.

415
00:29:00,325 --> 00:29:02,199
I'm just thinking.

416
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,450
If you use your skills in chess in business,

417
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,534
you'll have a great future.

418
00:29:08,534 --> 00:29:11,859
Business partially relies on luck.

419
00:29:14,634 --> 00:29:16,325
Chess is also the same.

420
00:29:16,325 --> 00:29:19,742
As the ancients said, man is an integral part of nature.

421
00:29:19,742 --> 00:29:21,784
Business is the same.

422
00:29:21,784 --> 00:29:25,409
Not only do you need God, but you also need to rely on other people.

423
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:31,867
Kang Sihan's soon to open stores caught fire recently.

424
00:29:31,867 --> 00:29:35,580
Do you think that was God or man?

425
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,159
His stores were burnt down?

426
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:41,200
You didn't know, Second Uncle?

427
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,218
I didn't hear.

428
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,334
It happened recently.

429
00:29:49,842 --> 00:29:51,034
It's getting late.

430
00:29:51,034 --> 00:29:53,051
I was so preoccupied in the game I forgot the time.

431
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:55,367
Have an early night, I'll head home now.

432
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:56,784
Okay.

433
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:01,159
Drive carefully.

434
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:03,634
Don't worry. Goodnight.

435
00:30:09,951 --> 00:30:11,567
No need to see me out.

436
00:30:19,742 --> 00:30:21,034
Boss.

437
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:23,592
Does he know we did it?

438
00:30:23,592 --> 00:30:26,118
You didn't leave any traces.

439
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:27,492
How would he know?

440
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,884
But he was dropping hints.

441
00:30:30,884 --> 00:30:32,059
He was probing.

442
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:34,534
That's your guilty conscience.

443
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:39,509
Boss, we could've just sat back and watched the fight.

444
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:41,650
Why intervene?

445
00:30:45,118 --> 00:30:49,492
I want to add some seasoning to the feast.

446
00:30:49,492 --> 00:30:52,225
So it's more interesting.

447
00:30:52,992 --> 00:30:55,492
Think about it. The stores were burned down.

448
00:30:55,492 --> 00:30:58,784
The first person Kang Sihan suspects is Yin Zheng.

449
00:30:58,784 --> 00:31:02,300
And the first person Yin Zheng suspects is Kang Zhentian.

450
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,492
How interesting.

451
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:11,142
I want to see what they work up.

452
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,767
Liven up the show.

453
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,926
Black Cat Detective.

454
00:31:58,926 --> 00:32:01,050
What happened?

455
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,051
The store caught fire.

456
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,700
How did that happen?

457
00:32:16,642 --> 00:32:19,826
Does your boss know about it?

458
00:32:20,483 --> 00:32:21,984
Yes.

459
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:25,325
He's really upset.

460
00:32:37,867 --> 00:32:43,118
I was also pretty upset today.

461
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:47,834
Because someone promised to spend my birthday with me,

462
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:52,076
but he still didn't show up after I waited for two hours.

463
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:57,375
But after I came here,

464
00:32:57,867 --> 00:33:00,450
I realized someone is more upset than me.

465
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,109
ZX.

466
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:05,300
I'm sorry.

467
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:08,784
It's okay.

468
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:21,717
It's not midnight yet, there's still time.

469
00:33:21,717 --> 00:33:26,425
Let's light the candles, cut the cake, and make a wish.

470
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:28,926
I don't want to have bad luck for the year.

471
00:33:31,425 --> 00:33:35,609
Okay, let's forget all the troubles.

472
00:33:36,425 --> 00:33:37,626
Come on.

473
00:33:45,383 --> 00:33:59,383
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

474
00:33:59,383 --> 00:34:05,309
♪ Happy birthday to Xiaoxiao ♪

475
00:34:09,425 --> 00:34:11,118
I was out of tune just now.

476
00:34:11,118 --> 00:34:12,492
I hope you didn't mind.

477
00:34:12,492 --> 00:34:14,026
Not at all.

478
00:34:15,118 --> 00:34:18,192
What did you wish for?

479
00:34:18,192 --> 00:34:20,951
It won't come true if I tell you.

480
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:24,159
I can figure it out even if you don't tell me.

481
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,942
Take a guess then.

482
00:34:26,592 --> 00:34:30,617
Your wish must be to not spend your next birthday

483
00:34:30,617 --> 00:34:33,783
in this wasteland.

484
00:34:34,425 --> 00:34:36,842
You just reminded me.

485
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:41,134
I can't believe I'm having such a special 25th birthday.

486
00:34:41,134 --> 00:34:44,092
On your 26th birthday,

487
00:34:44,092 --> 00:34:45,999
I'll make it up to you.

488
00:34:47,926 --> 00:34:49,650
No need for that.

489
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:58,183
What should we do after we eat the cake?

490
00:35:00,926 --> 00:35:02,467
I haven't thought about it.

491
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:06,400
I have an idea.

492
00:35:23,342 --> 00:35:25,425
Black Cat Detective.

493
00:35:25,425 --> 00:35:28,575
You're selling such expensive perfume on the streets.

494
00:35:28,575 --> 00:35:30,434
You'll have to pay your boss back.

495
00:35:30,434 --> 00:35:33,784
Z&X must make its first sale today.

496
00:35:33,784 --> 00:35:36,092
It's not midnight yet.

497
00:35:43,118 --> 00:35:45,200
Actually,

498
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,826
for my birthday wish,

499
00:35:49,817 --> 00:35:54,492
I wished that Z&X's stores can reopen soon.

500
00:35:55,717 --> 00:35:57,234
Thank you.

501
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:00,826
Let's go crazy today.

502
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:03,167
Let's sell all the perfume.

503
00:36:06,509 --> 00:36:08,350
Come take a look.

504
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,209
Z&X, a brand from England.

Let's count the fruits of our labor.

515
00:36:47,183 --> 00:36:48,450
Okay.

516
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:57,951
¥18,050,000.

517
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:02,134
¥18,050,000.

518
00:37:03,051 --> 00:37:04,409
Not bad.

519
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:05,800
Let's celebrate.

520
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,259
Okay.

521
00:37:12,509 --> 00:37:15,083
I see you really like this drink.

522
00:37:16,675 --> 00:37:18,442
Grain.

523
00:37:20,259 --> 00:37:22,176
Thanks for your Grain.

524
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,575
I have a feeling.

525
00:37:27,575 --> 00:37:32,759
You seem to be very attached to Z&X.

526
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:36,499
Like its your baby.

527
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:44,442
Your boss should be very happy to have an employee like you.

528
00:37:44,442 --> 00:37:49,659
It's rare for someone to treat an office as home and treat their boss as a friend.

529
00:37:49,659 --> 00:37:51,999
One day you will also be like me.

530
00:37:54,617 --> 00:37:56,192
Maybe.

531
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:03,300
Sihan.

532
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,283
Zhuo Yue, I've prepared the severance compensation.

533
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:08,259
Come get it when you're free.

534
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:09,575
Okay.

535
00:38:12,934 --> 00:38:15,575
Are you Miss Qiao Qi?

536
00:38:15,575 --> 00:38:17,259
I'm Zhuo Yue.

537
00:38:17,259 --> 00:38:19,951
Are you free?

538
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:22,717
Yes, I want to meet with you.

539
00:38:34,218 --> 00:38:35,967
Those who let themselves be guided by the current course of events are real heroes.

540
00:38:35,967 --> 00:38:38,199
It seems that Mr. Zhuo finally figured it out.

541
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,592
Yes, I figured it out.

542
00:38:40,592 --> 00:38:41,826
Good.

543
00:38:41,826 --> 00:38:44,375
We welcome you to Zhen Tian Group.

544
00:38:49,383 --> 00:38:50,675
Mr. Zhuo, this...

545
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:53,342
The car and money is important,

546
00:38:53,342 --> 00:38:56,299
but for me, friends are most important.

547
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:59,292
That's all I figured out the past few days.

548
00:39:00,675 --> 00:39:02,717
Mr. Zhuo, why are you doing this to yourself?

549
00:39:02,717 --> 00:39:04,218
Director Yin has spoken to me.

550
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:07,092
If you're not satisfied with the salary, we can continue to discuss.

551
00:39:07,092 --> 00:39:08,442
No need.

552
00:39:08,442 --> 00:39:10,259
Could you please tell Director Yin.

553
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:13,076
Say I let him down.

554
00:39:13,076 --> 00:39:14,575
Sorry.

555
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,076
Mr. Zhuo.

556
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:24,926
President Kang.

557
00:39:26,342 --> 00:39:27,784
Zhuo Yue.

558
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:30,700
I went to the office just now and they said you were here.

559
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,918
Is there anything I can help with?

560
00:39:36,176 --> 00:39:37,159
Zhuo Yue.

561
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:40,034
I've prepared the severance compensation.

562
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:42,342
I'll grab it from my bag now.

563
00:39:42,342 --> 00:39:45,509
President Kang, I'm not leaving anymore.

564
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:48,884
I also called those who wanted to leave on my way here.

565
00:39:48,884 --> 00:39:52,034
I told them no one is allowed to leave as long as I'm still around.

566
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:56,842
Zhuo Yue, what do you mean?

567
00:39:56,842 --> 00:39:58,367
We share both honor and disgrace.

568
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:01,717
That's what we vowed when we started Z&X.

569
00:40:01,717 --> 00:40:04,742
I can't believe I'm the first to break the vow.

570
00:40:04,742 --> 00:40:06,742
I have the responsibility to do this.

571
00:40:08,425 --> 00:40:09,859
Zhuo Yue.

572
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:12,575
I appreciate your kindness.

573
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:16,383
But now Z&X is having internal turmoil and external threat.

574
00:40:16,383 --> 00:40:19,199
We can't find a factory to process the orders.

575
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,200
We also lost a lot of money from the store.

576
00:40:22,717 --> 00:40:25,634
To be honest,

577
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:28,325
I don't want you to wait until the day I suffer a complete loss to leave.

578
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,884
Sihan, that day won't come.

579
00:40:30,884 --> 00:40:34,367
Even if it does, I'll be right there with you.

580
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:38,159
I rushed here to tell you some good news.

581
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,118
What good news?

582
00:40:39,118 --> 00:40:42,867
We met with Mr. Jiang, the chairman of Hua Yang Group, in London.

583
00:40:42,867 --> 00:40:43,992
Do you remember him?

584
00:40:43,992 --> 00:40:45,242
Yes, I remember.

585
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:46,992
He always admired you.

586
00:40:46,992 --> 00:40:49,550
He called me on my way here

587
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,299
and said he wanted to invest in us.

588
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:54,099
He wants you to meet him at his office at 10am.

589
00:40:55,734 --> 00:40:58,700
Zhuo Yue, are you for real?

590
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,659
Yes, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

591
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:02,592
Believe in yourself.

592
00:41:02,592 --> 00:41:03,450
Where is his office?

593
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,383
CBD.

594
00:41:04,383 --> 00:41:05,659
Okay, let's go.

595
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:07,409
- Let's go.
- Okay.

596
00:41:07,409 --> 00:41:08,467
Is this even skin care?

597
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:09,675
This is disfigurement.

598
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,509
Our products all pass through quality control.

599
00:41:11,509 --> 00:41:12,467
Quality control?

600
00:41:12,467 --> 00:41:14,159
Ask your boss to come out.

601
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:14,951
Hi, sir.

602
00:41:14,951 --> 00:41:16,967
I'm the boss.

603
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:17,617
You're the boss?

604
00:41:17,617 --> 00:41:18,550
Use your words.

605
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,784
Zhuo Yue.

606
00:41:21,218 --> 00:41:22,920
Sorry.

607
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,867
What's going on?

608
00:41:23,867 --> 00:41:25,550
President Kang, I'm not sure.

609
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:29,300
I gave this lady the samples we got delivered this morning.

610
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,492
It was fine when she put it on,

611
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:35,009
but that's what it looks like after two to three minutes.

612
00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:36,951
See for yourself.

613
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:38,592
Give me a cotton swab.

614
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:45,826
Can I see your sample?

615
00:41:45,826 --> 00:41:47,076
Give it to him.

616
00:41:47,076 --> 00:41:48,325
Here.

617
00:41:53,675 --> 00:41:55,409
Zhuo Yue, send this for testing.

618
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:56,675
Wait.

619
00:41:56,675 --> 00:41:58,659
How are you going to compensate us?

620
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:01,759
If my girlfriend's face can't recover,

621
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:03,592
I'll make sure you suffer.

622
00:42:03,592 --> 00:42:04,884
Sir, Miss.

623
00:42:04,884 --> 00:42:07,134
If it's really a problem with our product's quality,

624
00:42:07,134 --> 00:42:09,492
we'll be sure to give you a satisfactory answer.

625
00:42:09,492 --> 00:42:11,951
Okay, I'll wait.

626
00:42:11,951 --> 00:42:15,025
Okay, I'm really sorry.

627
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:28,700
Director Yin.

628
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,240
Director Yin.

629
00:42:36,383 --> 00:42:37,267
Chairman.

630
00:42:37,267 --> 00:42:38,775
Come in.

631
00:42:42,383 --> 00:42:46,367
I want to hear how your progress is.

632
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:48,118
What are you referring to?

633
00:42:48,118 --> 00:42:50,759
You should know what I'm referring to.

634
00:42:51,926 --> 00:42:53,659
If everything goes as planned,

635
00:42:53,659 --> 00:42:56,792
Z&X will disappear in a month.

636
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,826
Not bad.

637
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:03,300
Chairman.

638
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,383
When I looked into Z&X's background,

639
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,726
I found something interesting.

640
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,292
You mean Kang Sihan?

641
00:43:15,784 --> 00:43:19,051
Did you know?

642
00:43:19,051 --> 00:43:21,951
If I knew Kang Sihan was Z&X's founder,

643
00:43:21,951 --> 00:43:24,118
what difference does it make?

644
00:43:24,118 --> 00:43:26,176
I don't know if it makes a difference.

645
00:43:26,176 --> 00:43:28,800
I only know that if this spreads,

646
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,092
I'll get accused for not getting along with my brother.

647
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:35,218
You're so thoughtful.

648
00:43:35,218 --> 00:43:39,592
I heard you put a lot of effort into destroying Z&X.

649
00:43:39,592 --> 00:43:44,942
It shows you don't really care what the public thinks of you.

650
00:43:44,942 --> 00:43:46,734
Am I right?

651
00:43:49,634 --> 00:43:51,609
Don't overthink it.

652
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:54,326
Some words of advice.

653
00:43:54,326 --> 00:43:57,076
As leader of a large company,

654
00:43:57,076 --> 00:44:00,909
your heart should be with the company.

655
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:05,759
Every decision is for the interest of the company.

656
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,926
Everything else is secondary.

657
00:44:11,634 --> 00:44:14,109
I'll keep that in mind.

658
00:44:16,342 --> 00:44:19,409
Okay, get on with your work.

659
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:30,350
<i>[Scheme]</i>
