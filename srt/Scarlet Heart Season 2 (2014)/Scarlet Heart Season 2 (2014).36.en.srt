All bachelors of high potential in Zhen Tian Group have become your captive.

93
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:27,250
I am no longer dreaming to have any one of them to be my boyfriend.

94
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,267
Don't say that.

95
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:33,592
You must be well prepared today, then?

96

I'm wearing a powerful bracelet to bring luck.

97
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:40,026
This rose quartz crystal bracelet is supposed to be a pair.

98
00:10:40,026 --> 00:10:42,959
It helps attracts guys.

99
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,999
Unfortunately, I was slightly late when I purchased it.

100
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:50,083
The other one was bought by the other customer.

101
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,283
If I manage to catch him or her,

102
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:54,792
I'll take the lady in as my helper,

103
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:57,475
and take the man in as my guy.

104
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,117
Our dearest Princess Yuxi is back.

105
00:11:01,117 --> 00:11:02,125

106
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,434
Give me a hug.

107
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:05,500
I haven't seen you in so long.

108
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,584

109
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,542

111
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:11,292
Could you please help us take a photo?

112
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:14,292
I will upload this to our official Weibo account

113
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:16,109
and just write six words in the description.

114
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,626

115
00:11:18,626 --> 00:11:21,099
It'll gain more than a million clicks and become very popular.

116
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:22,125
Come on.

117
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,709
Quickly.

118
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:26,792
Is that good?

119
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:28,651
I have serious work to do.

120
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:33,092
You should know that what you're doing now is serious work.

121

You're the one who bought the rose quartz crystal bracelet.

122
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,034
You're the one who bought the rose quartz crystal bracelet.

123
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:43,667
Irritating.

124
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,542
That means charming and never boring, you know?

125
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:46,642
- I never heard that before.
- Never heard it before?

126
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:48,751
Then let me tell you. Let's go.

127
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,040
Sorry.

128
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,410
Let's go.

129
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:55,183
Come on, over here.

Thank you.

133
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,542
You're the one who got the other bracelet.

134
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:05,042
You are a man.

135
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:06,834
Can't you be a gentleman?

136
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:09,042
I am a gentleman.

137
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:12,417
How about you? You're a lady.

138
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,576
Can't you be more ladylike?

139
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,475
So what if I'm a man?

140
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:18,920
A man doesn't have the right to attract women?

141
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:21,309
You want the bracelet to help you attract women?

142
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:23,584
What kind of lady will you even find?

143
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,250
Whoever it is, it's not someone like you.

144
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:49,150
Even if you want to find someone like me,

145
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,459
you wouldn't be able to do it.

146
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:58,999
What if I can?

147
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:01,340
What then?

148
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:03,259
Then...

149
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,742
Let's give it a try then.

150
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,799
How do you want me to try?

151
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,351

<i>Yin Zheng, you know your place.</i>

179
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,359
<i>You are so obedient.</i>

180
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:46,475
Big Brother, what you are doing?

181
00:15:46,475 --> 00:15:48,959
It's better for you to manage Zhen Tian Group.

182
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,767
I can assist you.

183
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:52,550
I trust you.

184
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,600
Morever, Zhen Tian Group should belong to you.

185
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,476
I genuinely want to return it to you.

186
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,826
I hope you get back to being yourself again.

187
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:09,567
Let's welcome Zhen Tian Group's newly appointed Chairman,

188
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,034
Kang Sihan.

189
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:16,251
Great.

190
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,718
Chairman Yin.

191
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:25,100
Can you tell me what this means?

192
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,642
Uncle Liu.

193
00:16:26,642 --> 00:16:28,942
Please assist him in the future.

194
00:16:29,584 --> 00:16:32,125
Zhen Tian Group is now yours to handle.

195
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:36,584
I thought I was experienced enough to be able to read people.

196
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:39,559
But I was wrong about you.

197
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:44,876
Thank you.

198
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:49,400
Sihan, congratulations.

199
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,626
Uncle Liu.

200
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:51,542
Chairman.

201
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:55,634
You finally decided to choose love over business.

202
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:57,918
Thank you for all your hard work over the years.

203
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:00,100
If you don't want to stay in Zhen Tian Group anymore,

204
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,834
I can introduce you to my friend's company.

205
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:03,876
Don't worry.

206
00:17:03,876 --> 00:17:06,050
You won't have a lower position than what you have now.

207
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:09,917
Alright, thank you.

208
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:14,842
Uncle Liu, cheers.

209
00:17:14,842 --> 00:17:16,500
Cheers.

210
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:26,109
Chairman Yin.

211
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,250
Good luck, Chairman Yin.

212
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:57,209
Congratulations.

213
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:23,209
I come to your world now with empty hands.

214
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,134
Could you give me a chance to stay in your world?

215
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,083
From now onward,

216
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:58,959
I won't allow you to leave me.

217
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:11,259
<i>I don't have any more regrets.</i>

218
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:20,709
Will you regret

219
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,375
giving up Zhen Tian Group?

220
00:19:24,876 --> 00:19:28,417
I do regret it.

221
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,283
I regret not letting all this go earlier

222
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,718
to stay at your side.

223
00:19:41,626 --> 00:19:43,018
What's wrong?

224
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,476
I...

225
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,642
I'm tired.

226
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:57,876
Come on.

227
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:03,250
You plan to carry me back home?

228
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,317
Let's try. Come on.

229
00:20:15,626 --> 00:20:17,218
It's fine.

230
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:24,842
Can we do this every day from now on?

231
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,376
Yes.

232
00:20:27,376 --> 00:20:29,484
You just need to make me dumplings every day

233
00:20:29,484 --> 00:20:31,667
so that I have the energy to carry you.

234
00:20:33,826 --> 00:20:35,475
No problem.

235
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:39,475
You really want me to carry you all the way home?

236
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:40,925
Of course.

237
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:07,050
Don't move!

238
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:09,709
When am I getting the money?

239
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,442
Does your head hurt?

240
00:21:20,442 --> 00:21:23,925
My head hurts.

241
00:21:36,134 --> 00:21:39,409
My head hurts.

242
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:46,125
No.

243
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:53,000
If your head hurts, just pinch me.

244
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,542
Pinch me harder.

245
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:56,375
You will feel better.

246
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,792
Go away.

247
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,292
Leave me alone.

248
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:03,067
Don't come over here.

249
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:08,999
I don't want to hurt you.

250
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,975
Don't come over here.

251
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:18,450
<i>I'm so satisfied</i>

252
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:21,699
<i>to see him sleeping so well.</i>

253
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:28,400
<i>Happiness is just as simple as that.</i>

254
00:24:00,442 --> 00:24:06,067
<i>One, two, three.</i>

255
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:28,442
What do you think? Do you like it?

256
00:24:30,892 --> 00:24:32,334
I knew you loved your food.

257
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:34,200
Come on. Take a seat.

258
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:46,751
What do you want to drink?

259
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,159
A cup of coffee, please.

260
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,984
I wanted to make breakfast for you.

261
00:24:58,918 --> 00:25:01,999
Why did you pretend to be asleep?

262
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:03,492
I just like it.

263
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:07,250
You asked me to hold your hand while sleeping.

264
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,542
Sleeping next to you

265
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,599
makes me feel comfortable.

266
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:16,751
Why are you looking at me like that?

267
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,389
<i>Because I'm afraid of losing you</i>

268
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:33,576
<i>in just a blink of an eye.</i>

269
00:25:34,642 --> 00:25:37,309
We've been through so much together.

270
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:40,434
And now,

271
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:44,399
we won't be separated again.

272
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:54,000
I just learned what happiness is.

273
00:25:57,742 --> 00:25:58,926
Don't cry.

274
00:25:58,926 --> 00:26:01,584
I'll show you something that will bring you even more happiness.

275
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:06,751
What do you think?

276
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:08,667
What is this?

277
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,134
It's what I came up with overnight.

278
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,192
Let's leave Beijing.

279
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:18,551
We'll go to Yunnan and open a small teahouse.

280
00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:25,699
Do you like it? Boss.

281
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:50,600
♫ <i>An empty street</i> ♫

282
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,100
♫ <i>Breaking into an empty bridal shop</i> ♫

283
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:59,818
♫ <i>I put a white gown representing promise over you</i> ♫

284
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:04,392
♫ <i>The world has turned to ashes</i> ♫

285
00:27:04,392 --> 00:27:07,609
♫ <i>But love is still standing tall</i> ♫

286
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:14,542
♫ <i>Are you real or just my imagination?</i> ♫

287
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:18,042
♫ <i>Behind the times that we forgot</i> ♫

288
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:21,500
♫ <i>The dilapidated steps I sit on alone</i> ♫

289
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:27,750
♫ <i>Which troubled times don't end in parting?</i> ♫

290
00:27:28,317 --> 00:27:31,709
♫ <i>What's left between me and the sky</i> ♫

291
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:35,025
♫ <i>Are only downpours of longing</i> ♫

292
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:37,918
♫ <i>If we can only meet but not fall in love with each other</i> ♫

293
00:27:37,918 --> 00:27:43,550
It finally feels like you actually put it all behind you.

294
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:48,859
You should start to figure out how we're going to settle down in Yunnan.

295
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:50,542
♫ <i>Every step carries past moments</i> ♫

296
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:52,375

♫ <i>Walking past our past dreams with each step</i> ♫

301
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:12,842
Why does it show that my bank card was suspended?

302
00:28:13,751 --> 00:28:15,375
Let's check this one.

303
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:20,630
All four accounts were suspended.

304
00:28:21,142 --> 00:28:23,083
Is there a mistake?

305
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,792
Maybe it's a system error.

306
00:28:32,392 --> 00:28:33,909
Let's go down to see who it is.

307
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:40,592
Who is it?

308
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:43,834
You are...

309
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:45,334
Are you Yin Zheng?

310
00:28:45,334 --> 00:28:46,709
Yes.

311
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:51,809
You're suspected of economic crime.

312
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:53,709
The situation is critical,

313
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:55,709
so your assets are temporary suspended

314
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:57,392
according to court decision.

315
00:28:57,392 --> 00:28:58,751
Start implementation.

316
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:04,500
You're both here?

317
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,083
Sihan, what's happening?

318
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,959
Big Brother.

319
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,876
During your time as company representative,

320
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:12,292
you were suspected of tax evasion

321
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,083
and amending the company account without justification

322
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:16,783
so your assets are temporary suspended.

323
00:29:19,709 --> 00:29:21,834
I already gave Zhen Tian Group back to you.

324
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:23,083
Why are you still not letting me go?

325
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,934
Big Brother, don't misunderstand.

326
00:29:24,934 --> 00:29:27,225
This is between you and the company.

327
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:29,584
It has nothing to do with me.

328
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:32,225
You should know I didn't do any of this.

329
00:29:32,225 --> 00:29:33,500
You framed me.

330
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,876
Don't blindly accuse me.

331
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:39,792
You know what you did.

332
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:43,100
Let the judge decide.

333
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,934
Kang Sihan.

334
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:46,709
What do you want?

335
00:29:46,709 --> 00:29:48,684
We were going to leave Beijing.

336
00:29:48,684 --> 00:29:51,083
We have nothing to give you now.

337
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,267
I didn't ask for anything.

338
00:29:53,267 --> 00:29:54,375
We are good buddies.

339
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,918
Always having fun together.

340
00:29:57,918 --> 00:30:00,892
You want to leave Beijing so easily?

341
00:30:00,892 --> 00:30:02,183
Impossible.

342
00:30:02,183 --> 00:30:04,250
We have given in so much.

343
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:07,167
Do you really have to do this?

344
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:09,109
It's not me.

345
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:12,542
This is the court's decision.

346
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:15,375
It's not my decision.

347
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:17,818
Come on, let's get our things.

348
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:19,542
Hold on.

349
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:21,292
They're seizing all your assets.

350
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:24,142
It means you can't move anything in here,

351
00:30:24,142 --> 00:30:25,851
including a toothpick.

352
00:30:25,851 --> 00:30:28,180
You are a devil.

353
00:30:29,142 --> 00:30:31,792
Beijing opera has an idiom I think is quite appropriate.

354
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:35,970
No madness, no survival.

355
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:49,704
It's fine.

356
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,620
What's wrong?

357
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:20,796
I'm so stupid.

358
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:25,446
I thought that if you gave up Zhen Tian Group,

359
00:31:26,604 --> 00:31:29,662
it would resolve Sihan's anger

360
00:31:30,662 --> 00:31:32,738
and end all the hatred.

361
00:31:35,587 --> 00:31:37,412
I was wrong.

362
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,671
The human heart is complicated.

363
00:31:46,646 --> 00:31:48,754
I'm sorry.

364
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:53,329
I shouldn't have forced you.

365
00:31:57,212 --> 00:31:59,329
You didn't force me to do anything.

366
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,846
You just showed me the right way.

367
00:32:05,712 --> 00:32:07,129
No.

368
00:32:09,212 --> 00:32:12,162
Sihan has completely changed.

369
00:32:15,254 --> 00:32:20,829
I made you lose everything.

370
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:28,229
Don't say that.

371
00:32:28,229 --> 00:32:30,420
I didn't lose everything.

372
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,245
I still have you.

373
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,403
It doesn't matter if I lose everything

374
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:43,029
as long as you are with me.

375
00:32:47,254 --> 00:32:51,879
Sihan became the person he is now

376
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,250
because of my mistakes.

377
00:32:56,729 --> 00:33:00,395
So I don't blame him for doing this to me.

378
00:33:12,646 --> 00:33:15,420
Don't worry.

379
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:20,779
None of us wanted for this to happen.

380
00:33:21,871 --> 00:33:24,395
I'll go home and talk to Mom and Siyu tomorrow.

381
00:33:24,395 --> 00:33:26,379
We'll discuss this together.

382
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,696
Okay?

383
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:37,729
We won't be apart.

384
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:43,838
We'll be together forever.

385
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,838
Don't worry.

386
00:33:47,838 --> 00:33:50,562
We'll get to Yunnan.

387
00:33:54,087 --> 00:33:56,162
Also,

388
00:33:56,162 --> 00:33:59,119
I'll go learn to make tea starting from tomorrow.

389
00:33:59,646 --> 00:34:02,520
As a tea shop owner,

390
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,846
you would want someone who knows how to make tea, right?

391
00:34:12,979 --> 00:34:14,637
Boss.

392
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,838
Go to sleep.

393
00:34:30,312 --> 00:34:31,829
Stop crying.

394
00:34:46,212 --> 00:34:48,295
I'll call him to ask him to come home.

395
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:52,854
Let's discuss this together.

396
00:34:52,854 --> 00:34:56,604
Aunt Lan, I'm here.

397
00:34:56,604 --> 00:34:59,270
Sihan, you're just in time.

398
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,520
Tell me.

399
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,746
Why are you doing this?

400
00:35:02,746 --> 00:35:04,646
Your brother already gave you the company.

401
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:06,754
Why are you still doing this?

402
00:35:06,754 --> 00:35:10,604
Aunt Lan, the lawsuit didn't just come from nothing.

403
00:35:10,604 --> 00:35:12,620
I checked Zhen Tian Group's accounts

404
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,170
and found that there were many false accounts.

405
00:35:16,062 --> 00:35:19,404
These accounts were easy to be manipulated.

406
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:22,145
This is fact.

407
00:35:22,145 --> 00:35:24,254
I didn't frame him.

408
00:35:24,912 --> 00:35:26,812
Big Brother.

409
00:35:26,812 --> 00:35:30,437
There's something I don't understand.

410
00:35:30,437 --> 00:35:35,129
You always wanted to take everything of mine since we were young.

411
00:35:35,129 --> 00:35:37,854
Even if it was a small toy.

412
00:35:37,854 --> 00:35:42,120
Your principle for life is to be the winner.

413
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,187
So I was very doubtful.

414
00:35:44,187 --> 00:35:47,629
Why did you hand over Zhen Tian Group to me so easily?

415
00:35:47,629 --> 00:35:49,854
I checked the accounts the first day I started my new position.

416
00:35:49,854 --> 00:35:51,395
Once I checked,

417
00:35:51,395 --> 00:35:53,662
a lot of problems popped up.

418
00:35:53,662 --> 00:35:55,854
You emptied out our accounts.

419
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,771
This is a mess.

420
00:35:57,771 --> 00:36:01,145
Luckily, I thought to check the accounts.

421
00:36:01,145 --> 00:36:03,712
Otherwise, I would've been the scapegoat.

422
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,187
Big Brother.

423
00:36:06,187 --> 00:36:09,954
What did I do for you to treat me like this?

424
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:14,479
So that's what happened?

425
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:16,879
You still have the face to ask me to help you with this?

426
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:18,187
Mom, don't get mad.

427
00:36:18,187 --> 00:36:19,812
This might not be the true story.

428
00:36:19,812 --> 00:36:20,546
Think about it first.

429
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:23,796
It's quite obvious, isn't it?

430
00:36:23,796 --> 00:36:26,003
Don't you know them well enough?

431
00:36:26,003 --> 00:36:27,919
Who would you trust?

432
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,120
You are not my son.

433
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,320
I won't help you.

434
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,846
Mom.

435
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,054
Mom.

436
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:46,003
Big Brother, Second Brother.

437
00:36:46,562 --> 00:36:48,662
I just have one thing to say.

438
00:36:48,662 --> 00:36:50,103
No matter what,

439
00:36:50,103 --> 00:36:53,362
I hope you won't forget we are one family.

440
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:10,287
Sihan.

441
00:37:12,604 --> 00:37:14,838
It's just the two of us now.

442
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:17,629
You can tell the truth.

443
00:37:17,629 --> 00:37:21,437
I know you did this because you still hate me.

444
00:37:21,437 --> 00:37:23,062
I won't blame you.

445
00:37:23,771 --> 00:37:26,304
This is my fault.

446
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,729
I really want to make it up to you.

447
00:37:29,729 --> 00:37:31,660
Can you give me a chance?

448
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:34,346
Tell me, what can I do?

449
00:37:39,646 --> 00:37:41,754
Let me show you something.

450
00:37:58,919 --> 00:38:00,562
Look at this.

451
00:38:00,562 --> 00:38:02,504
I know you suffered a lot.

452
00:38:06,354 --> 00:38:09,687
Compared to those who live in the lap of luxury,

453
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,919
this is nothing.

454
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,829
And...

455
00:38:15,395 --> 00:38:17,796
I have a headache every day now.

456
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,395
Once it happens, I can't control myself at all.

457
00:38:20,395 --> 00:38:22,712
I feel like dying every day.

458
00:38:22,712 --> 00:38:23,838
I understand.

459
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:26,062
You don't understand.

460
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:30,329
I showed you these wounds because I want to tell you,

461
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:32,187
these are nothing.

462
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:34,812
Compared to the pain that you brought me,

463
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,929
these wounds were nothing.

464
00:38:38,312 --> 00:38:40,045
It's nothing compared to the feeling I had

465
00:38:40,045 --> 00:38:43,537
when I saw you coming out of there hugging Zhang Xiao.

466
00:38:43,537 --> 00:38:44,812
No amount of suffering can compare

467
00:38:44,812 --> 00:38:48,196
to my family and lover betraying me at the same time.

468
00:38:50,337 --> 00:38:51,930
Yin Zheng.

469
00:38:53,396 --> 00:38:56,771
You changed my entire life.

470
00:38:56,771 --> 00:38:59,504
I will let you pay the bill.

471
00:39:01,145 --> 00:39:05,996
You thought it was over when you handed over Zhen Tian Group?

472
00:39:05,996 --> 00:39:08,029
No way.

473
00:39:08,604 --> 00:39:10,395
And you want to leave here?

474
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:11,629
You want to elope?

475
00:39:11,629 --> 00:39:14,212
In your dreams.

476
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,562
Want me to let you off?

477
00:39:24,287 --> 00:39:26,754
Come on, figure it out for me.

478
00:39:26,754 --> 00:39:28,687
What should I do?

479
00:39:32,896 --> 00:39:34,595
No ideas?

480
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:52,354
This is the video from when I was in Ganlin.

481
00:39:52,354 --> 00:39:54,370
Have a look.

482
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,796
Feel it.

483
00:39:56,796 --> 00:40:01,862
Try to look for a reason as to why I should let you off.

484
00:40:03,062 --> 00:40:04,520
See you.

485
00:40:33,103 --> 00:40:34,904
<i>Black Cat Detective.</i>

486
00:40:36,354 --> 00:40:41,429
<i>I can't believe you've become so terrifying.</i>

487
00:40:43,671 --> 00:40:48,838
<i>What should I do to help you get back to your original self?</i>

488
00:41:15,354 --> 00:41:16,812
It's you.

489
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,320
Sihan is not here.

490
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,871
Yinuo.

491
00:41:25,646 --> 00:41:28,429
I didn't expect you to be here.

492
00:41:30,562 --> 00:41:33,220
Can I talk to you?

493
00:42:10,103 --> 00:42:12,619
Compared to last time we met,

494
00:42:13,746 --> 00:42:16,045
you look weak now.

495
00:42:18,479 --> 00:42:21,112
Take care of yourself.

496
00:42:28,938 --> 00:42:30,454
What's wrong?

497
00:42:35,604 --> 00:42:37,019
Yinuo.

498
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,945
Although we've only met a few times,

499
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:47,146
I feel like you're a kind person.

500
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:52,745
Maybe I'll scare you by saying this.

501
00:42:54,145 --> 00:42:55,846
But you feel...

502
00:42:57,162 --> 00:42:59,638
familiar to me.

503
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,179
It's like...

504
00:43:05,038 --> 00:43:07,404
you are my sister.

505
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,203
Then you can treat me as your sister.

506
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:20,887
Sister.

507
00:43:22,312 --> 00:43:25,895
What is it you want to say?
