<i>[Episode 23]</i>

3
00:01:45,642 --> 00:01:47,684
If you sleep here tonight,

4
00:01:47,684 --> 00:01:50,334
will your mom suspect us?

5
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:53,475
What would she suspect?

6
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:57,518
We used to sleep together when we were in college.

7
00:01:58,726 --> 00:02:02,575
I'm worried she might find out you're hiding something from her.

8
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,684
She's so busy.

9
00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:10,600
She doesn't have time to worry about me.

10
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:16,709
That's what you think.

11
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:20,892
But you actually can't hide anything from your parents.

12
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:23,175
They know their children the most.

13
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:37,400
Do you know why I'm keeping this baby?

14
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:43,725
Why?

15
00:02:44,684 --> 00:02:47,434
Before my mom had me,

16
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:50,510
she was pregnant before.

17
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:53,809
But they were not married at the time,

18
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,917
so my father asked her to get an abortion.

19
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:02,783
She had no choice but to do it.

20
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,017
After she came back, she changed.

21
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:12,934
I don't want to be like her.

22
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:16,292
She'll always have a scar on her heart that will never recover.

23
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:19,809
So because of that,

24
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,760
you want this baby to be born?

25
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:28,520
Piggy.

26
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,530
Stop laugh at me.

27
00:03:34,392 --> 00:03:39,080
I want to be a perfect mother.

28
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:44,959
Before I came back,

29
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,200
I enrolled in many parenting classes.

30
00:03:49,684 --> 00:03:52,767
Do you know that feeling

31
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:55,480
of getting to go to class with my baby?

32
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,530
It feels so amazing.

33
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:02,626
I have so much pride.

34
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:04,742
I never imagined

35
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:07,167
that it would bring me so much motivation and courage

36
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:09,534
to prompt me to come back to find Sihan.

37
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,800
I want to give him a home.

38
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:28,899
What are you crying?

39
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:34,434
I'm so touched.

40
00:04:42,142 --> 00:04:44,417
I'm scared.

41
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,142
I don't want him to be like my father.

42
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:48,659
No, he won't.

43
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:53,851
If he is like your father,

44
00:04:56,684 --> 00:04:58,860
I will definitely support you.

45
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:34,459
Xiaoxiao, listen to me.

46
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,100
I thought about everything.

47
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,620
I'm giving up everything and choosing you.

48
00:05:42,684 --> 00:05:45,199
I don't understand what you're saying.

49
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,650
I'm sorry, Director Kang. I'm running late

50
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,792
Xiaoxiao.

51
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:50,475
Let's leave.

52
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,620
Let's leave this place.

53
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,934
This is your decision,

54
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:00,667
not my decision.

55
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:03,592
I handed in my resignation.

56
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:14,100
It can't solve your problem.

57
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,325
I don't want anything.

58
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:20,042
I just want you.

59
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:24,475
We can't be together.

60
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:27,225
Let me prove to you that nothing's impossible.

61
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:28,492
We can't be together.

62
00:06:28,492 --> 00:06:29,934
Why don't you understand?

63
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:31,018
I don't understand.

64
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:32,283
You still love me.

65
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:33,918
Why are you doing this?

Xiaoxiao.

71
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,809
Let go of me.

72
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:53,325
I've made my decision.

73
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:55,067
No one can change my mind.

74
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:58,000
Xinyi can change your mind.

75
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:01,459
I've already sent her a message this morning.

76
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:03,367
I told her everything.

77
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,942
What did you say?

78
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,767
Say it again.

79
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,590
I've sent her a message

80
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:22,726
and told her everything.

Xinyi.

84
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:32,690
Xinyi is pregnant.

85
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:34,751
She is pregnant with your child.

Piggy.

92
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:17,659
I left my phone at your home.

93
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:20,099
Can you bring it to me?

94
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,659
I still have a meeting this morning.

You almost ruined it for everyone.

103
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:13,026
Do you know why she didn't tell you about the pregnancy?

104
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:21,183
She doesn't want to pressure you.

105
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:23,709
She doesn't want to force you to marry her.

106
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:28,509
She wants you to love her again through her own efforts.

107
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:34,209
She really loves you.

108
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,509
Say something, will you?

109
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:51,117
What do you want me to say?

110
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,142
Tell me what your plan is.

111
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,626
What do you want me to do?

112
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:04,876
It's not about me now.

113
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:07,384
It's what you should do.

114
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,892
Don't you think you should be responsible to Xinyi?

115
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:15,559
Do you think this responsibility can bring happiness to her?

116
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,950
There's no happiness without responsibility either.

117
00:10:18,892 --> 00:10:21,600
Do you want your kids to be like you

118
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,742
and never have a father-figure?

119
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:25,542
No, I...

120
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,292
Xinyi needs protection.

121
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,680
She needs you.

122
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:36,570
Xinyi can't lose you.

123
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:42,042
Then what about us?

124
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:49,992
Let's just let our relationship

125
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:55,540
become a secret forever.

126
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:10,300
That's our ending?

127
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,099
An hour ago,

128
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:20,234
I wanted to grab your hand and run away.

129
00:11:21,934 --> 00:11:24,767
One hour later, you're telling me

130
00:11:26,976 --> 00:11:29,680
to let it be our secret forever.

131
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,309
Our love just vanished in the air.

132
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:43,999
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:46,726 --> 00:11:48,618
This is my decision.

134
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:54,800
It hasn't been easy for me either.

135
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:58,751
I know my decision

136
00:12:00,142 --> 00:12:02,726
has hurt you deeply,

137
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:04,999
and hurt me as well.

138
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,880
But compared to what Xinyi is going through,

139
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:12,542
this is nothing.

140
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:16,975
This is what I've decided.

141
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:36,099
Sihan.

142
00:12:36,099 --> 00:12:39,610
What is the matter?

143
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,684
Stop looking at me like that.

144
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,520
I'm confused.

145
00:12:53,851 --> 00:12:55,220
Xinyi.

146
00:12:56,092 --> 00:12:59,260
When did you find out you were pregnant?

147
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:02,090
You...

148
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,750
How do you know?

149
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:08,130
That's not important.

150
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:12,850
I just want to know when you found out.

151
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:18,250
About a month ago.

152
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:21,700
How old is the baby now?

153
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:26,270
Four months.

154
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:36,440
Why didn't you tell me?

155
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:39,183
I don't want to burden you,

156
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:41,910
and I don't want to force you to marry me.

157
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,050
Don't I have burden now?

158
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:48,800
Sihan.

159
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:51,826
I know we have a barrier,

160
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:53,517
but I don't want to depend on the baby.

161
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:56,800
I think want to depend on myself to let you fall in love with me again.

162
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:03,280
Xinyi.

163
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:07,250
What do you plan to do with the baby?

164
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:10,590
What?

165
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:16,525
I mean how are you going to handle this?

166
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:23,080
Handle?

167
00:14:25,626 --> 00:14:27,809
He is a living being.

168
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:30,100
He is our child.

169
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,350
I am his mother.

170
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,851
I'm going to have this baby.

171
00:14:37,851 --> 00:14:41,584
He's not an object.

172
00:14:43,076 --> 00:14:45,309
Xinyi, listen to me.

173
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:47,809
The baby is just four months.

174
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:49,860
There's still time for an abortion.

175
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:52,617
I'm sorry, Sihan.

176
00:14:52,617 --> 00:14:54,626
I have nothing to say.

177
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:57,250
Xinyi.

178
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,375
Xinyi.

179
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:02,450
Xinyi, I'm sorry.

180
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,517
I'm not ready to be a father yet.

181
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:05,934
Please abort the baby.

182
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:08,099
I hope you can understand.

183
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:09,742
I don't understand.

184
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,042
I cannot understand.

185
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:12,642
Xinyi.

186
00:15:12,642 --> 00:15:15,367
We are not husband and wife, and we are not couple.

187
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:18,383
If the baby is born, how could he accept his life?

188
00:15:20,434 --> 00:15:23,559
Sihan, I get it.

189
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:26,759
You must have your reasons for saying this to me.

190
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:34,267
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry.

191
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,851
I don't want your apologies.

192
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:38,183
Xin...

193
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:42,875
Zhuo Yue.

194
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,584
Book me on tomorrow evening's flight.

195
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,100
I can go anywhere.

196
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,559
I just want to leave this place.

197
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:52,592
It's best that I can go overseas.

198
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:58,500
Okay, book me the ticket to Thailand.

199
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,920
Thank you.

200
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:20,684
I've looked at the resignation letter.

201
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:24,967
There's nothing good in this aside from your writing style.

202
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:28,600
I don't need your appraisal,

203
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,659
I need your approval.

204
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:35,684
When can you start to be more understanding?

205
00:16:35,684 --> 00:16:37,600
What is it?

206
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,309
You are my son.

207
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:41,959
You are the eldest in our family.

208
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,240
Do you know what that means?

209
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,350
Let me tell you.

210
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,034
It means that you are the future man of the house.

211
00:16:53,684 --> 00:16:56,976
Zhen Tian Group is our family business.

212
00:16:56,976 --> 00:16:58,392
You're the successor.

213
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,559
Your resignation means your betrayal to the family.

214
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:04,440
So I cannot accept your resignation.

215
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:08,559
Whether you accept it or not,

216
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,792
I really want to leave.

217
00:17:12,183 --> 00:17:15,576
I know you've been having some issues in your relationship.

218
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:20,583
I can give you two days leave to let you clear up your issue.

219
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:26,918
Chairman.

220
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:31,099
Director Kang, I've booked the ticket.

221
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:32,940
10 o'clock tonight.

222
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,250
Here's your passport.

223
00:18:04,642 --> 00:18:11,142
♫ <i>The whole room is empty</i> ♫

224
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:16,750
♫ <i>Even if you are here, right beside me</i> ♫

225
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:21,820
♫ <i>The window that was ajar</i> ♫

226
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,200
♫ <i>The dim glow of light</i> ♫

227
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:27,809
♫ <i>They couldn't light up the darkness in your heart</i> ♫

228
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:31,959
♫ <i>I couldn't forgive you</i> ♫

229
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:40,434
♫ <i>I gave you everything I had</i> ♫

230
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,392
You're here.

231
00:18:43,392 --> 00:18:45,050
A glass of whiskey.

232
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:54,018
♫ <i>Perhaps letting go of the entanglements will help clear the mind</i> ♫

233
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:55,317
Another.

234
00:19:01,434 --> 00:19:05,026
♫ <i>Love is not related to kindness</i> ♫

235
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:07,609
Another.

236
00:19:08,684 --> 00:19:13,183
♫ <i>Unfortunately, we have tons of desire</i> ♫

237
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:15,934
♫ <i>Turning love into aggressiveness</i> ♫

238
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:19,542
♫ <i>Hatred is not related to kindness</i> ♫

239
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:23,600
♫ <i>It doesn't matter who has greater courage</i> ♫

240
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,500
♫ <i>The pain still exists because of the longing memories</i> ♫

241
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,600
It's the third glass.

242
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:39,600
A mature man shouldn't come to a boy's bar to get drunk.

243
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,476
You're still mad at me.

244
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,559
Seems like I touched a sore spot that day.

245
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,517
What is your sore spot?

246
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:52,625
Meng Xinyi or Zhang Xiao?

247
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,309
When you button your clothes,

248
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:04,018
you already buttoned the first one wrong.

249
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:06,459
You didn't realize until the last button.

250
00:20:09,934 --> 00:20:12,467
A lot of things have been wrong from the start.

251
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:16,959
You can unbutton and re-button.

252
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:20,892
But there are some things that you can't start over.

253
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,350
Only one person can untie the dead knot here.

254
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,125
That person is you.

255
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:40,392
Princess, don't cry.

256
00:20:40,392 --> 00:20:41,517
What is going on?

257
00:20:41,517 --> 00:20:44,225
Just tell me, will you?

258
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:47,350
He is so cruel.

259
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,326
Cruel like my father.

260
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:53,083
Director Kang?

261
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:58,851
Yes, he doesn't want the baby.

262
00:20:58,851 --> 00:21:02,434
He doesn't want our baby.

263
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:04,099
That's impossible.

264
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:06,184
There must be some misunderstanding.

265
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,634
He said it, he said it so calmly.

266
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:20,559
Princess, go back and rest.

267
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,809
It's not good for you or the baby

268
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:25,084
to be like this.

269
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:31,059
Piggy.

270
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:34,150
Did you tell him?

271
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:38,242
Didn't I say not to tell?

272
00:21:40,742 --> 00:21:42,275
I'm sorry.

273
00:21:45,934 --> 00:21:49,267
It's okay, I don't blame you.

274
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,926
I should have let him know about it.

275
00:21:57,392 --> 00:21:59,475
I hate myself.

276
00:21:59,475 --> 00:22:02,667
I'm crying because of myself, not because of you.

277
00:22:04,642 --> 00:22:08,542
Princess, don't say that.

278
00:22:09,976 --> 00:22:11,809
Don't worry.

279
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:14,225
If he really is like your father,

280
00:22:14,225 --> 00:22:16,892
I will definitely support you.

281
00:22:16,892 --> 00:22:18,909
Piggy.

282
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,018
It's okay.

283
00:22:23,018 --> 00:22:26,051
Don't cry.

284
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,350
Kang Sihan.

285
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,342
Are you still human?

286
00:22:41,976 --> 00:22:44,475
Xiaoxiao, I...

287
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:46,584
Xinyi told me everything.

288
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:49,942
You've crossed the line.

289
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:53,334
I'm sorry.

290
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,684
I'm not ready.

291
00:22:56,684 --> 00:22:59,759
If the baby is born, it will do no benefit to anyone.

292
00:23:00,934 --> 00:23:02,667
Bastard!

293
00:23:07,475 --> 00:23:09,540
Keep yourself out of this business.

294
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:15,320
I have to stand in.

295
00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:19,099
Zhang Xiao.

296
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:21,559
Although I don't know Meng Xinyi,

297
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:24,030
but I feel that she's not that fragile as we think.

298
00:23:25,642 --> 00:23:29,300
Why don't you stay out of this and let them handle it?

299
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:48,700
Princess.

300
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,642
Why are you awake?

301
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:52,470
I've thought about it.

302
00:23:53,018 --> 00:23:55,140
I'm getting an abortion.

303
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,842
What did you say?

304
00:23:59,742 --> 00:24:01,634
Did he ask you to do it?

305
00:24:02,851 --> 00:24:04,851
I've thought about it clearly.

306
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:07,018
I will go to the hospital tomorrow.

307
00:24:07,018 --> 00:24:08,542
Princess.

308
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:21,834
Xinyi.

309
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:25,392
If you are not ready,

310
00:24:25,392 --> 00:24:27,384
we can come another day.

311
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,042
I'm ready.

312
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:33,142
But you are shivering.

313
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:39,125
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

314
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:46,625
I'll be here with you.

315
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:54,309
Sihan, after this,

316
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:56,680
can we start again?

317
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:59,575
You must trust me,

318
00:24:59,575 --> 00:25:01,409
I will change.

319
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,559
Hello, are you Meng Xinyi?

320
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:12,542
I need to take your blood pressure before the operation.

321
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:13,942
Thank you.

322
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,392
Sihan.

323
00:25:23,726 --> 00:25:26,851
Are you cold? Your hands are cold.

324
00:25:26,851 --> 00:25:27,976
No.

325
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:29,642
I just feel a little nervous.

326
00:25:29,642 --> 00:25:31,117
It's going to be fine.

327
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,551
Princess.

328
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,034
Are you sure?

329
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:44,892
Your blood pressure is high.

330
00:25:44,892 --> 00:25:45,867
Systolic pressure at 170,

331
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:47,267
and diastolic pressure at 115.

332
00:25:47,267 --> 00:25:49,950
Are you sure you want to do it today?

333
00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:58,559
I don't want to wait anymore.

334
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,909
Princess.

335
00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:02,309
If your body can't take it, let's do it another day.

336
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:04,409
We can't force these things.

337
00:26:05,434 --> 00:26:06,851
I've made up my mind.

338
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:08,767
No one can change it.

339
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,183
I must do it today.

340
00:26:10,183 --> 00:26:12,976
This depends whether your blood pressure can go back to normal.

341
00:26:12,976 --> 00:26:17,918
Why don't I let the doctor do a diagnosis first?

342
00:26:17,918 --> 00:26:19,642
Okay, thank you.

343
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,559
Princess, it's your body.

344
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,492
What if something happens to you?

345
00:26:30,142 --> 00:26:31,434
It won't.

346
00:26:31,434 --> 00:26:33,500
I know I won't have any problems.

347
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:43,918
Xinyi.

348
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:45,267
Mom.

349
00:26:45,267 --> 00:26:47,999
Xinyi.

350
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:50,751
I'm alright, why are you here?

351
00:26:53,892 --> 00:26:56,434
If I hadn't found this report,

352
00:26:56,434 --> 00:26:58,642
were you going to keep hiding this from me?

353
00:26:58,642 --> 00:27:00,542
Were you going to keep this from me until something happened to you?

354
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:01,809
No, Mom.

355
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:03,225
This is my business.

356
00:27:03,225 --> 00:27:04,175
I didn't want you to worry.

357
00:27:04,175 --> 00:27:05,884
What do you mean it's your business?

358
00:27:05,884 --> 00:27:08,267
Your business is my business.

359
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:11,183
You always discussed everything with me.

360
00:27:11,183 --> 00:27:13,242
What is it today?

361
00:27:14,892 --> 00:27:16,409
Tell me.

362
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:19,767
Did he ask you to do it?

363
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,892
No, Mom.

364
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,918
I'm doing this willingly.

365
00:27:25,918 --> 00:27:28,517
Whether you're doing this willingly or not,

366
00:27:28,517 --> 00:27:29,809
we can't do it today.

367
00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:30,999
Go home with me.

368
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:35,183
Mom, I can't leave.

369
00:27:35,183 --> 00:27:37,375
Let me decide, will you?

370
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,751
I can't have this baby.

371
00:27:39,751 --> 00:27:42,050
I can't keep this baby.

372
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:47,326
You go home first, Mom.

373
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:49,517
Kang Sihan.

374
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:50,784
She's suffering.

375
00:27:50,784 --> 00:27:53,767
You're a man. Why aren't you saying anything?

376
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:58,726
Mom, listen.

377
00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:01,709
This has nothing to do with anyone else.

378
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:03,267
It's all my fault.

379
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,809
Don't force him please, please.

380
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,699
- Go home first.
- Xinyi.

381
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:08,867
Xinyi, come home with me.

382
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:10,726
I will handle things from here.

383
00:28:10,726 --> 00:28:13,400
- Go home.
- Xinyi.

384
00:28:14,142 --> 00:28:16,559
Do you still think of me as your mother?

385
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,559
Princess.

386
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,018
Why don't you go back with Auntie?

387
00:28:21,018 --> 00:28:24,167
I can't go back.

388
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:26,642
Piggy, I can't have this baby.

389
00:28:26,642 --> 00:28:29,225
- I can't.
- Xinyi, let's go home.

390
00:28:29,225 --> 00:28:30,350
I can't have this baby.

391
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,434
- Go home.
- Come home with me.

392
00:28:32,434 --> 00:28:33,834
Listen to me.

393
00:28:35,892 --> 00:28:36,726
Xinyi.

394
00:28:36,726 --> 00:28:38,267
- Xinyi.
- Princess.

395
00:28:38,267 --> 00:28:39,809
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

396
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:41,375
Doctor.

397
00:28:41,976 --> 00:28:43,417
Xinyi.

398
00:28:53,726 --> 00:28:57,940
Why don't you go home first?

399
00:29:04,225 --> 00:29:05,642
Okay.

400
00:29:07,934 --> 00:29:10,200
When she's awake,

401
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,899
just let me know.

402
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,999
Okay.

403
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:35,892
<i>Mom, listen.</i>

404
00:29:35,892 --> 00:29:38,892
<i>This has nothing to do with anyone else</i>

405
00:29:38,892 --> 00:29:40,392
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

406
00:29:40,392 --> 00:29:43,600
<i>You can unbutton and re-button.</i>

407
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,250
<i>But there are some things that you can't start over.</i>

408
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,183
<i>She came into my life</i>

409
00:29:49,183 --> 00:29:52,076
<i>seven years earlier than you.</i>

410
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:54,309
<i>She's my best friend.</i>

411
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:57,459
<i>Only one person can untie the dead knot here.</i>

412
00:29:58,225 --> 00:29:59,517
<i>That person is you.</i>

413
00:29:59,517 --> 00:30:02,775
<i>Between you and Xinyi, I choose Xinyi.</i>

414
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:05,900
<i>If you must tell her,</i>

415
00:30:06,517 --> 00:30:08,809
<i>I will never forgive you,</i>

416
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,080
<i>and never forgive myself.</i>

417
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:14,642
<i>I will disappear from your life forever.</i>

418
00:30:22,626 --> 00:30:23,999
Director Meng.

419
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,851
There's no one else here.

420
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:29,709
You don't need to call me director.

421
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:35,283
Auntie.

422
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:39,934
I don't know how to explain any of this.

423
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:44,434
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

424
00:30:44,434 --> 00:30:46,517
Stop.

425
00:30:46,517 --> 00:30:48,584
It already happened.

426
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:53,392
You should be thinking about what to do next.

427
00:30:53,392 --> 00:30:55,818
That's what you need to decide.

428
00:30:56,876 --> 00:30:59,350
If you love Xinyi,

429
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,392
you must think for her,

430
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:06,775
and be responsible for what you've done.

431
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:12,976
I...

432
00:31:12,976 --> 00:31:14,751
No need to explain.

433
00:31:14,751 --> 00:31:18,726
You should think about what to say to her

434
00:31:18,726 --> 00:31:21,059
when she wakes up.

435
00:31:23,726 --> 00:31:27,259
Sihan.

436
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:28,900
Don't leave.

437
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,392
Xinyi.

438
00:31:30,392 --> 00:31:32,083
I'm here.

439
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,434
I'm scared.

440
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,700
Don't be scared, I won't leave.

441
00:31:41,684 --> 00:31:44,099
Stay with her.

442
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:45,900
I'll be back.

443
00:32:02,018 --> 00:32:05,659
Sihan.

444
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,551
Please don't leave me.

445
00:32:09,492 --> 00:32:11,434
I will change.

446
00:32:11,434 --> 00:32:13,475
Can we start again?

447
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:16,367
Sihan.

448
00:32:17,225 --> 00:32:18,776
Sihan.

449
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:29,250
Xinyi.

450
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,751
Xinyii, you are awake.

451
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,018
Sihan.

452
00:32:35,018 --> 00:32:37,099
You were asleep for six hours.

453
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:38,876
You scared us.

454
00:32:48,142 --> 00:32:52,092
You still have the baby.

That's it.

470
00:35:29,851 --> 00:35:32,851
You dropped this earring at dinner last time.

471
00:35:32,851 --> 00:35:34,826
I fixed it for you.

472
00:35:47,892 --> 00:35:49,242
Thank you.

473
00:35:57,283 --> 00:35:58,459
Come.

474
00:36:02,892 --> 00:36:04,500
Drink with me.

475
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:11,059
Slow down, be careful.

476
00:36:22,534 --> 00:36:23,918
Xinyi.

477
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:29,775
It was a mistake to ask you to abort the baby.

478
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:31,809
I'm sorry.

479
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,999
Sihan.

480
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,042
I never knew what it was like to have a father-figure.

481
00:36:38,659 --> 00:36:41,350
I don't know what it means to be a father.

482
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:45,442
So I wasn't confident in being a good father.

483
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:48,350
That's why...

484
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:51,434
Sihan, stop talking.

485
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,684
I know I'm not perfect.

486
00:36:54,684 --> 00:36:58,418
And I know I made you upset many times before.

487
00:36:59,225 --> 00:37:04,434
Maybe this baby came into our lives too suddenly.

488
00:37:04,434 --> 00:37:07,675
I get why you can't accept it.

489
00:37:11,225 --> 00:37:13,600
Sihan, please don't be like this.

490
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,375
I don't blame you.

491
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:23,392
Xinyi, will you marry me?

492
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:29,875
Did I hear you wrong?

493
00:37:31,976 --> 00:37:33,584
Will you marry me?

494
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,000
I don't want my child to be born without a father.

495
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:40,851
Marry me.

496
00:37:40,851 --> 00:37:44,026
Let's give him a happy family.

497
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:54,559
Can you say it again?

498
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:56,099
Will you marry me?

499
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,992
Please marry me.

500
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,776
Princess, you are awake.

501
00:38:33,776 --> 00:38:34,959
Piggy.

502
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:37,976
Make sure to watch what you eat now.

503
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,742
Why?

504
00:38:40,742 --> 00:38:43,976
I do not want a fat bridesmaid.

505
00:38:43,976 --> 00:38:46,018
Bridesmaid?

506
00:38:46,018 --> 00:38:47,918
Still don't get it?

507
00:38:47,918 --> 00:38:51,192
Sihan proposed to me tonight.

508
00:38:53,684 --> 00:38:55,292
Really?

509
00:38:56,142 --> 00:38:59,099
Great! Congratulations!

510
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:02,726
Remember the promise we made in college.

511
00:39:02,726 --> 00:39:06,250
Whoever gets married first, the other has to be the bridesmaid.

512
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,767
Don't break your promise.

513
00:39:07,767 --> 00:39:10,018
I won't break it.

514
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:12,000
I'm very happy.

515
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,617
If you are free tomorrow, come try on dresses with me.

516
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:19,084
Okay, no problem.

517
00:39:19,934 --> 00:39:22,934
You should get some rest. See you tomorrow.

518
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,142
Hello, Miss Meng.

519
00:39:41,142 --> 00:39:43,100
She is the famous wedding gown designer, Lan Yu.

520
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,784
Miss Meng.

521
00:39:43,784 --> 00:39:44,892
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

522
00:39:44,892 --> 00:39:46,076
There are a lot of designs here.

523
00:39:46,076 --> 00:39:47,209
You can choose here.

524
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:48,667
Okay.

525
00:39:55,809 --> 00:39:58,125
Will Sihan like it?

526
00:39:58,934 --> 00:40:00,726
I think it's pretty good.

527
00:40:00,726 --> 00:40:02,417
It suits you.

528
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:03,617
Not me.

529
00:40:03,617 --> 00:40:06,392
Will Sihan like it?

530
00:40:06,392 --> 00:40:08,059
I'm not him.

531
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:09,834
How would I know?

532
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,992
I asked you to come to help me choose.

533
00:40:14,992 --> 00:40:19,600
Miss Meng, a wedding gown is the most important gown in a girl's life.

534
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,118
Every gown has its special love story and legend.

535
00:40:23,118 --> 00:40:26,099
If you didn't want the most special one, you wouldn't have come to me.

536
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:31,267
So what does the most special one look like to you?

537
00:40:31,267 --> 00:40:35,099
Why don't you choose one that suits you best?

538
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,517
Because if the husband is the sun,

539
00:40:37,517 --> 00:40:39,100
then then wife is the moon.

540
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,934
The moon must surround the sun.

541
00:40:41,934 --> 00:40:44,434
So I must choose what my husband likes.

542
00:40:44,434 --> 00:40:49,025
Then I think if you like it, your husband will like it as well.

543
00:40:49,784 --> 00:40:50,726
But...

544
00:40:50,726 --> 00:40:54,567
Don't hesitate, let's start picking from what you want.

545
00:40:55,517 --> 00:41:00,367
Do you have gowns that can hide the tummy?

546
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:03,600
We will alter the dress according to special circumstances.

547
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,350
We have a lot of samples here for you.

548
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,076
Why don't you try them on?

549
00:41:07,076 --> 00:41:08,642
Okay.

550
00:41:08,642 --> 00:41:11,000
Hold this, I'll go try them.

551
00:41:13,434 --> 00:41:16,267
Princess, do you need help?

552
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:18,100
No, thanks.

553
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,459
Okay.

554
00:41:27,767 --> 00:41:28,742
Look.

555
00:41:28,742 --> 00:41:31,292
The plane to Indonesia today crashed.

556
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:33,684
Do you think I should call the travel agency?

557
00:41:33,684 --> 00:41:35,475
It's so dangerous now.

558
00:41:35,475 --> 00:41:39,000
I think I should just stay at home.

559
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,367
Yes.

560
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,851
What were you saying?

561
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:45,283
No, we didn't say anything.

562
00:41:45,283 --> 00:41:47,034
About some plane crash.

563
00:41:47,034 --> 00:41:49,100
Yes, the plane flying to Indonesia crashed.

564
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,767
They were forced to land.

565
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:52,283
Check your Weibo.

566
00:41:57,492 --> 00:41:58,892
Piggy.

567
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,242
What is it?

568
00:42:00,242 --> 00:42:02,934
Something happened to Sihan.

569
00:42:02,934 --> 00:42:04,826
Miss, the gown.

570
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:08,800
Sihan.

571
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:13,076
Sihan, you're safe.

572
00:42:13,076 --> 00:42:14,375
You were not on the plane.

573
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:16,120
Thank God!

574
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:19,617
<i>Luckily it's just a false alarm.</i>

575
00:42:19,617 --> 00:42:22,559
<i>Xinyi loves Sihan with her whole heart.</i>

576
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:28,042
<i>I understand that I have to go back to my life.</i>

577
00:42:28,042 --> 00:42:31,517
Sister, I didn't come here to learn to clean the floor.

578
00:42:31,517 --> 00:42:32,767
Why are you asking me to do this?

579
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:34,099
Stop grumbling.

580
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:36,050
Do you want to learn to make cocktails?

581
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:40,242
Do you have stronger alcohol?

582
00:42:43,267 --> 00:42:45,867
Xiaoxiao, why are you here?

583
00:42:45,867 --> 00:42:49,350
My boss set a rule that girls cannot order spirits.

584
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:52,183
I will have to ask my boss.

585
00:42:52,183 --> 00:42:53,784
Boss said no.

586
00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:57,425
Drinking isn't a good release.

587
00:42:57,425 --> 00:42:59,100
Follow me.

588
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,792
Where are we going?

589
00:43:02,892 --> 00:43:05,059
She's gone again.

590
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:07,018
Give me a beer.

591
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:09,420
What beer? Drink this.

592
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,100
It's not as strong as a beer.

593
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,059
Yes. And you won't smell funny.

594
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:29,099
Stop interfering.

595
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:30,767
Leave me alone.

596
00:43:30,767 --> 00:43:32,617
They are getting married.

597
00:43:32,617 --> 00:43:34,883
Black Cat Detective does not exist anymore.

598
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:40,099
I just want to let you know that you have many friends.

599
00:43:40,934 --> 00:43:43,300
And me.

600
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,099
As long as you're willing to let us in,

601
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:47,175
we are all by your side.

602
00:43:50,325 --> 00:43:51,626
Thank you.
