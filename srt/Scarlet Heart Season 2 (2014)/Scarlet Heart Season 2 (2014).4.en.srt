00:01:45,674 --> 00:01:47,649
Hello!

4
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:52,139
Your hair is perfect today.

5
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:56,458
You might be wearing a hat, but it can't hide the beauty within you.

6
00:01:59,165 --> 00:02:02,774
Here, I'll give you a drumstick today.

7
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:04,207
Thank you.

8
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:10,674
Did you see my charm?

9
00:02:10,674 --> 00:02:12,049
You don't appreciate me.

10
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,215
You have such a big appetite.

11
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:16,174
It's congenital.

12
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:22,549
Seat's taken.

13
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:24,257
Sorry.

14
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,249
Come.

15
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,965
Aren't I great?

16
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:33,939
I'm being serious.

17
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,940
You change the topic so quickly.

18
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,782
I think you better not get entangled with that matter.

19
00:02:42,123 --> 00:02:46,074
Do you think she is your previous life?

20
00:02:46,074 --> 00:02:49,749
What goes on in your head?

21
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:53,257
Don't you believe in past and present lives?

22
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,607
No, I don't.

23
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,899
It's a superstition.

24
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:00,215
It looks like I have to adapt

25
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:02,107
with the current Zhang Xiao.

26
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:05,607
I'm gradually losing the previous Zhang Xiao.

27
00:03:07,315 --> 00:03:13,040
You're talking about my lost memories?

28
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,499
Why are you so stupid?

29
00:03:16,499 --> 00:03:19,582
Think about it from a different angle.

30
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:28,349
She might be your long lost sister.

31
00:03:31,232 --> 00:03:33,215
I should ask my father.

32
00:03:33,215 --> 00:03:35,065
Don't surprise him please.

33
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:37,365
I may be the one in for a surprise.

34
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,507
He's not within the service area.

35
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,090
I think your father is at the desert

36
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,691
barbequing his lamb.

37
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:57,258
I can even smell it.

38
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,716
Director Yin.

39
00:04:00,716 --> 00:04:01,407
Director is here.

40
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,199
Hello Director Yin.

41
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,532
Director Yin.

42
00:04:05,532 --> 00:04:11,882
Hello Director Yin.

43
00:04:13,115 --> 00:04:14,791
- Director Yin.
- I have a feeling

44
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,415
that Director Yin likes Lan Lan.

45
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:18,749
That's right.

46
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:22,474
They were born to be together.

47
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:24,374
If you really like him,

48
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:26,315
I bet you can't compare with her.

49
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:28,357
What are you talking about?

50
00:04:28,357 --> 00:04:30,807
There's no way I'd like someone as cold as him.

51
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:32,490
Are you sure?

52
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,357
I'm sure.

53
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:39,249
I will remember your words.

54
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:42,357
♪ In my dream, in my heart ♪

55
00:04:42,357 --> 00:04:46,090
♪ And in my song ♪

56
00:04:46,758 --> 00:04:48,691
You're crazy.

57
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,816
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:38,016
Director Yin asked me to deliver the flowers to you.

59
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,082
Thank you. Next time please knock.

60
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:44,749
I did knock.

61
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:46,232
Maybe you didn't hear it.

62
00:05:46,232 --> 00:05:47,691
No, I didn't hear you.

63
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:49,732
But it's impolite for you to come in like that.

64
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:51,340
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,499
Why don't I help you arrange the flowers.

66
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,649
Miss Lan.

67
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:09,966
Can I call you Lan Lan?

68
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,507
Lan Lan.

69
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,315
You grew up in Australia.

70
00:06:16,315 --> 00:06:18,674
How can you speak Chinese so fluently?

71
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:22,232
Why are you so interested in me?

72
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:27,182
I'm just curious.

73
00:06:27,182 --> 00:06:29,332
I've watched this one movie before,

74
00:06:29,332 --> 00:06:32,315
where there were two girls who looked exactly the same,

75
00:06:32,315 --> 00:06:33,774
but grew up in two different places

76
00:06:33,774 --> 00:06:35,840
and were not at all related.

77
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,749
The movie is "Double Life".

78
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:41,732
If you think

79
00:06:41,732 --> 00:06:45,490
that we are like the two girls in the movie,

80
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:51,724
do you think it would be me

81
00:06:51,724 --> 00:06:53,915
or you who dies in the end?

82
00:06:57,107 --> 00:07:01,107
I didn't mean that.

83
00:07:01,107 --> 00:07:03,566
Stop whatever you are thinking.

84
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:06,515
We are definitely not related.

85
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:08,340
Please leave if there is nothing else.

86
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,882
This is my personal break room.

87
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,474
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,315
Are you alright?

89
00:07:39,315 --> 00:07:41,665
I'm sorry.

90
00:07:49,923 --> 00:07:51,215
Watch out!

91
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:52,940
Be careful with the glass pieces.

92
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,358
- Okay.
- Here.

93
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:09,323
Are you alright?

94
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:13,082
I'm sorry for scaring you.

95
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:16,424
I even dirtied your scarf.

96
00:08:17,816 --> 00:08:19,440
Thank you.

97
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,049
Do you live in the community next door?

98
00:08:23,724 --> 00:08:25,482
Did we disturb you?

99
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:27,382
We've been moving the past couple of days.

100
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:33,832
Does this car belong to you?

101
00:08:33,832 --> 00:08:35,132
Yes.

102
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,107
I'm sorry.

103
00:08:39,107 --> 00:08:41,566
I scraped your car just now.

104
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:43,632
It's okay. I can't blame you.

105
00:08:43,632 --> 00:08:47,107
Our lorry did block your way.

106
00:08:47,107 --> 00:08:48,165
But...

107
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:49,758
It's alright.

108
00:08:49,758 --> 00:08:50,982
It's the company's car.

109
00:08:50,982 --> 00:08:52,790
The insurance will pay for it.

110
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:56,199
Won't your boss scold you?

111
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:57,482
No, he won't.

112
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:59,807
He's quite a nice guy.

113
00:09:00,732 --> 00:09:01,899
Thank you.

114
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:03,424
You're welcome.

115
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:06,223
Not to forget,

116
00:09:07,332 --> 00:09:10,207
this is a small gift to the neighbors from our company.

117
00:09:10,207 --> 00:09:12,816
Our renovation must have caused a lot of troubles.

118
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,758
Your boss is too kind.

119
00:09:15,758 --> 00:09:17,190
We're sorry for the inconvenience.

120
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,215
I will put it here.

121
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:21,674
Thank you.

122
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:25,257
I must get going now.

123
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,023
<i>So this is the undiscovered gem</i>

124

<i>I like this smell.</i>

126
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:14,007
This perfume costs 126 euro.

127
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,399
Is he out of his mind?

128
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:56,899
I'm here... The perfume!

129
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:59,207
What's wrong with perfume?

130
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:00,399
Nothing is wrong with the perfume,

131
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,323
but something is wrong with the price.

132
00:11:04,082 --> 00:11:05,732
What I mean is...

133
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,174
I have one question.

134
00:11:07,174 --> 00:11:09,340
Do all of our neighbors

135
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,624
get this perfume as a gift?

136
00:11:11,624 --> 00:11:12,799
I can't say everyone,

137
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,390
but we'll try to give it to everyone in your residential community.

138
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,540
I think our renovation caused a lot of inconvenience.

139
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,690
It's what our boss told us to do.

140
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:24,858
Your boss is so generous.

141
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:27,007
Then I will keep it.

This is my home now.

147

I think so.

You can call me Black Cat Detective.

156
00:12:04,965 --> 00:12:07,320
Black Cat Detective?

157
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,307
Your username?

158

We're neighbors now.

159

We're all a part of the Beijing drifters tribe.

162
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:19,691
I'll get out of your way.

163
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:22,674
I'll get going now. Bye.

191
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,690
What do you mean?

192
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:59,399
Our relationship as employer and employee.

193
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,265
I don't really care how others see me.

194
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:06,232
But after yesterday,

195
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,899
I realized that I do care about how one person sees me.

196
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:17,023
Don't misunderstand.

197
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:20,407
I just want to have a fresh start with you.

198
00:16:22,332 --> 00:16:24,649
I didn't give it much thought.

199
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:26,524
Please forgive me

200
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:28,257
if I hurt your feelings.

201
00:16:28,257 --> 00:16:30,739
I'm not used to you being frank.

202
00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:35,215
But I don't hate it either.

203
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,682
Did you say our relationship as employer and employee?

204
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,540
I promise you.

205
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,740
Are you willing to eat with your boss now?

206
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:50,565
Of course.

207
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,482
Enjoy your meal.

208
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:04,649
Why do you wear one earring?

209
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,049
Because I only have one.

210
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:10,332
Can you tell me its story?

211
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:13,090
I don't feel like telling it now.

212
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,190
Maybe next time.

213
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:20,374
I left my phone in the car.

214
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:21,920
I'll go and get it.

215
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,340
You can start eating first.

216
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:28,466
- Sir, table for two?
- Yes.

217
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:29,840
Please come in.

218
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,674
Please.

219
00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:34,882
Please come in.

220
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:38,007
- You're here too?
- Chairman.

221
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:39,274
Let me introduce to you.

222
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:40,982
He is my son, Yin Zheng.

223
00:17:40,982 --> 00:17:43,816
He is our group's vice president.

224
00:17:43,816 --> 00:17:45,107
Madam Meng Yinan,

225
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:47,632
chairman of Yin Feng Group.

226
00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:50,457
You can call me Aunty Meng.

227
00:17:50,457 --> 00:17:51,939
You look so young,

228
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:54,307
I can't call you aunty.

229
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:57,315
I've heard about you.

230
00:17:57,315 --> 00:18:00,274
I've heard you're very capable and eloquent.

231
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:01,732
You're great with your words.

232
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:03,882
They were right about that.

233
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:07,939
Like they say, like father like son.

234
00:18:07,939 --> 00:18:09,524
Aunty Meng, you are right.

235
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:12,349
Our chairman is just like a tiger.

236
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:16,439
But I'm a cat living in with a group of tigers.

237
00:18:17,674 --> 00:18:18,940
See, you're so humorous

238
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,290
and so humble.

239
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,858
Even though he says that,

240
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:23,632
that's not how he feels.

241
00:18:23,632 --> 00:18:26,466
Which young person does not take themselves seriously?

242
00:18:26,466 --> 00:18:27,899
Why don't you join us?

243
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,999
We can talk about the auction tomorrow.

244
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:33,939
Mr. Chairman can speak to you about the auction.

245
00:18:33,939 --> 00:18:36,707
I need to leave now.

246
00:18:36,707 --> 00:18:38,432
Excuse me.

247
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:45,249
I'm sorry. He's being impolite.

248
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,165
Please follow me.

249
00:18:49,482 --> 00:18:51,832
Let's go somewhere else.

250
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:52,882
What's wrong?

251
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,932
Nothing. Come.

252
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,440
What happened?

253
00:19:04,691 --> 00:19:07,023
You can tell me

254
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:09,332
if something upset you.

255
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:13,249
There's nothing to talk about.

256
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:15,632
Then why are you so angry?

257
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:21,115
Even if I tell you, you might not understand.

258
00:19:26,357 --> 00:19:27,982
It's okay.

259
00:19:27,982 --> 00:19:30,274
As long as you are willing to tell me,

260
00:19:30,274 --> 00:19:33,049
I'm willing to listen.

261
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:44,832
When I was young,

262
00:19:44,832 --> 00:19:47,165
my father had an accident.

263
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:49,665
My mother remarried Kang Zhentian.

264
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:54,540
Kang Zhentian and my father were very good friends.

265
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,840
They went on an expedition together.

266
00:19:57,499 --> 00:19:59,832
Everyone died on that expedition

267
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,899
but only he came back alive.

268
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:05,382
Then he married with my mom,

269
00:20:05,382 --> 00:20:08,015
and inherited all of my father's money.

270
00:20:10,223 --> 00:20:12,258
From then on,

271
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:15,807
I've been regarding the enemy as my father.

272
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,023
I wanted to escape from that home,

273
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:21,007
escape as far as I can.

274
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:29,657
You say I don't understand the feeling of being underestimated.

275
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:33,599
Actually I understand it very well.

276
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:38,482
So I left home when I was 19

277
00:20:38,482 --> 00:20:40,658
and moved out on my own.

278
00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:48,115
Just now I bumped into Kang Zhentian and a client at the restaurant.

279
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,816
That client didn't know my relationship with him,

280
00:20:51,816 --> 00:20:54,791
and used me to flatter him.

281
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,966
It was disgusting.

282
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:04,040
You rarely smile.

283
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:08,540
Turns out it's because of all you've gone through.

284
00:21:10,274 --> 00:21:12,591
Is it directly related?

285
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:15,274
Even if I smile now,

286
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,391
it doesn't change my reality.

287
00:21:18,732 --> 00:21:21,157
And I don't like smiling anyways.

288
00:21:25,415 --> 00:21:26,816
Yes.

289
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,939
Things can't be changed

290
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:31,707
once they happen.

291
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,565
You can only protect yourself.

292
00:21:38,107 --> 00:21:40,332
For example,

293
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,540
I once had a neighbor

294
00:21:44,123 --> 00:21:47,710
who was raped by her stepfather when she was 14.

295
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,582
She went crazy that day.

296
00:21:50,582 --> 00:21:52,482
She came to my house,

297
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:54,607
and hid under my bed.

298
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:56,799
She wouldn't come out.

299
00:21:59,065 --> 00:22:03,482
Do you think she's very unfortunate?

300
00:22:07,065 --> 00:22:08,580
Yin Zheng,

301
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,820
there are so many unfortunate people in the world.

302
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:25,290
Unfortunate.

303
00:22:26,691 --> 00:22:29,870
Shall we leave now?

304
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,466
What's up with you?

305
00:23:22,466 --> 00:23:24,516
You are super sexy today.

306
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,274
Did you use perfume?

307
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:30,839
What's wrong?

308
00:23:33,332 --> 00:23:36,357
Your perfume smells sexy.

309
00:23:36,357 --> 00:23:38,324
Remember to take your medicine.

310
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:40,566
I had my medicine.

311
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:42,365
You had too much of it.

312
00:23:42,365 --> 00:23:43,674
Wait.

313
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,649
That is your room.

314
00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:49,265
I know.

315
00:23:56,624 --> 00:23:59,049
Reality is harsh.

316
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:38,123
Chairman Kang.

317
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:40,440
Don't wake her up. Let her rest.

318
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,023
But madam asked me to wake her up when you came back.

319
00:24:44,023 --> 00:24:46,916
Just tell her I told you not to.

320
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:48,415
Tidy up the guest room.

321
00:24:48,415 --> 00:24:50,482
I will sleep there tonight.

322
00:24:50,482 --> 00:24:52,107
Yes.

323
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:53,357
Have some gingko soup.

324
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:54,899
Madam cooked it for you.

325
00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:56,707
Let me get you a bowl.

326
00:24:56,707 --> 00:24:59,007
Just do what I told you to do.

327
00:24:59,007 --> 00:25:00,482
Yes.

328
00:25:28,107 --> 00:25:30,107
Drinking again?

329
00:25:30,107 --> 00:25:32,832
You don't care about your health at all.

330
00:25:33,624 --> 00:25:35,874
Is your leg numb again?

331
00:25:35,874 --> 00:25:37,760
Yes.

332
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,290
My leg has been getting numb every time I sit down for a while.

333
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,632
I'll go to the hospital with you tomorrow and do a check up.

334
00:25:44,632 --> 00:25:46,258
I can't make it tomorrow.

335
00:25:46,258 --> 00:25:48,758
I have three important meetings.

336
00:25:48,758 --> 00:25:51,874
I need to meet with a foreign business group in the afternoon,

337
00:25:51,874 --> 00:25:54,624
- and in the evening-
- Alright.

338
00:25:54,624 --> 00:25:56,707
Every time I tell you to go in for a check up,

339
00:25:56,707 --> 00:25:59,816
you give me thousands of reasons for not going.

340
00:25:59,816 --> 00:26:01,607
But think about it.

341
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:03,666
If you become too exhausted,

342
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:06,107
you can't do anything anyways.

343
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:08,507
Besides, Zheng'er is an adult now.

344
00:26:08,507 --> 00:26:12,332
You can hand some business to him.

345
00:26:12,332 --> 00:26:15,039
Zheng'er is indeed really capable.

346
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,657
But the problem is, he can never be loyal to me.

347
00:26:21,432 --> 00:26:23,190
What did he do?

348
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,820
Did he do something to make you angry again?

349
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,357
I know there's a barrier between you two.

350
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:35,840
But no matter what, he knows what he's doing.

351
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,939
If he knew what he was doing,

352
00:26:37,939 --> 00:26:42,549
he wouldn't have said such terrible things in front of Yin Feng's chairman.

353
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:50,615
Did you all have dinner together tonight?

354
00:26:51,249 --> 00:26:54,482
We bumped into each other at the restaurant.

355
00:26:55,207 --> 00:26:59,599
We're lucky Meng Yinan understands our situation so she didn't say anything about it.

356
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:03,882
It's been so long.

357
00:27:03,882 --> 00:27:06,858
I thought that time can heal everything.

358
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,958
After all, we are a family.

359
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:14,932
But today I realized it's not possible.

360
00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:19,907
Zhentian.

361
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:24,465
You've done so much for me and Zheng'er.

362
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,707
But no matter what,

363
00:27:27,707 --> 00:27:30,691
you must take good care of yourself.

364
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,940
You've worked hard for so long.

365
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,240
It's time to pass your work onto your children.

366
00:27:37,566 --> 00:27:39,839
Don't you think I want to?

367
00:27:45,939 --> 00:27:50,132
But now, you only have Zheng'er and Siyu.

368
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:54,732
Siyu is not into business.

369
00:27:54,732 --> 00:27:58,623
Why don't you ask Sihan to come back?

370
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:02,340
You think so too?

371
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,207
Will it work?

372
00:28:04,207 --> 00:28:06,082
Why not?

373
00:28:06,082 --> 00:28:08,532
Sihan is your son as well.

374
00:28:08,532 --> 00:28:10,899
You sent him overseas back then

375
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,916
for me and Zheng'er.

376
00:28:12,916 --> 00:28:15,282
Don't you think I know?

377
00:28:16,374 --> 00:28:21,166
I thought that separating them could calm everything.

378
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:25,082
But it turns out that wasn't a good idea.

379
00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:27,240
Yes.

380
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,330
I feel sorry for Sihan.

381
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,957
If he can come back, I will make it up to him.

382
00:28:36,774 --> 00:28:38,758
Time flies.

383
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:42,099
The kids have grown up now.

384
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:45,791
I really hope that Zheng'er can become more mature

385
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,616
and understand all you've done for him.

386
00:28:49,991 --> 00:28:52,482
You understanding is enough.

387
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:54,023
Okay.

388
00:28:55,023 --> 00:28:56,674
Then listen to me.

389
00:28:56,674 --> 00:29:00,207
Let's go for a check up tomorrow.

390
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:03,357
Okay. I'll listen to you.

391
00:29:03,357 --> 00:29:05,440
Let me arrange my time.

392
00:29:06,374 --> 00:29:08,499
If you are free tomorrow,

393
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:10,432
please talk to Zheng'er.

394
00:29:10,432 --> 00:29:12,649
See if he has a girlfriend.

395
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:14,399
How did you find out?

396
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,082
We bumped into them at the restaurant.

397
00:29:17,082 --> 00:29:19,340
If he has a girlfriend,

398
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,415
ask him to bring her to meet us.

399
00:29:22,415 --> 00:29:23,607
This child.

400
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:26,174
I'm always worried about him.

401
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,691
Mom.

402
00:29:47,691 --> 00:29:49,123
Can I come in?

403
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:51,391
It's your son's home. Of course you can come in.

404
00:29:51,391 --> 00:29:54,149
It's different when my son has grown up.

405
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:55,774
Come in.

406
00:30:03,107 --> 00:30:05,691
Your place is tidy.

407
00:30:05,691 --> 00:30:08,499
You have not been here for four months.

408
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:11,149
I came while you and your girlfriend were arguing last time.

409
00:30:11,149 --> 00:30:13,224
How could I dare come again?

410
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,790
I think you came to probe for some information.

411
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,482
My son really knows me well.

412
00:30:21,939 --> 00:30:23,982
Do you want coffee or tea?

413
00:30:23,982 --> 00:30:25,374
Coffee, please.

414
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:36,049
Zheng'er,

415
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:39,599
I heard that you got a girlfriend recently.

416
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,357
Not girlfriend yet.

417
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:44,799
We just went for dinner and a movie.

418
00:30:45,758 --> 00:30:48,107
That what is it this time?

419
00:30:48,107 --> 00:30:49,882
Is it serious?

420
00:30:50,524 --> 00:30:51,939
Don't be so worried.

421
00:30:51,939 --> 00:30:53,674
I will tell you when everything is firm.

422
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:57,416
You should find a serious girlfriend.

423
00:30:57,416 --> 00:31:00,240
You are 30 years old and you aren't even serious in a relationship.

424
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,065
How can I not be worried?

425
00:31:03,065 --> 00:31:04,566
No matter what,

426
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:06,023
you are still the Kangs' eldest son.

427
00:31:06,023 --> 00:31:07,939
Everyone is looking at you.

428
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:10,057
It's time to get serious.

429
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:13,482
I'm not from Kang family.

430
00:31:13,482 --> 00:31:14,939
My surname is Yin.

431
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:18,274
Listen to me, Zheng'er.

432
00:31:18,274 --> 00:31:20,207
Don't be so stubborn.

433
00:31:20,207 --> 00:31:22,123
You should try to understand Zhentian.

434
00:31:22,123 --> 00:31:24,466
He's been good to you all these years.

435
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,607
Zheng'er, it's been so many years.

436
00:31:26,607 --> 00:31:29,065
You should let go of your hatred.

437
00:31:29,065 --> 00:31:32,899
No matter what, he is your father now.

438
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,290
I don't want to talk about this right now.

439
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,674
We'll just end up arguing.

440
00:31:39,674 --> 00:31:40,982
I know it's not easy for you

441
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,082
to stand between me and him.

442
00:31:43,082 --> 00:31:45,207
But have you thought

443
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:47,758
about how my father died 25 years ago?

444
00:31:47,758 --> 00:31:51,732
I don't believe he can come back alone alive while all the others died.

445
00:31:52,249 --> 00:31:54,107
And he even took over my father's assets.

446
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:55,957
Enough!

447
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:59,999
Do you know what you are talking about?

448
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:02,457
I don't even know where you got these theories from.

449
00:32:02,457 --> 00:32:05,415
I thought you would become more understanding now that you're all grown up.

450
00:32:05,415 --> 00:32:08,140
But now you're lacking even wisdom.

451
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,049
I'm disappointed in you.

452
00:32:12,858 --> 00:32:14,639
Do you want sugar?

453
00:32:17,107 --> 00:32:19,249
Do you want sugar?

454
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,991
Forget it. I don't want to drink it anymore.

455
00:32:28,415 --> 00:32:29,940
Zheng'er,

456
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,940
please think about what I said.

457
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,507
Your father would not want to see you like this.

458
00:32:37,524 --> 00:32:39,649
If you can't let it go,

459
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:42,407
you'll end up hurting just two people.

460
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:44,457
Me and you.

461
00:32:55,357 --> 00:32:56,932
Director Yin.

462
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,170
<i>[Zhen Tian Group Headquarters]</i>

463
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:07,190
Have a seat.

464
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,582
I can stand.

465
00:33:09,582 --> 00:33:13,707
Just now I saw the budget report for the survival show.

466
00:33:13,707 --> 00:33:16,374
It exceeded our budget.

467
00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:18,249
How do you explain it?

468
00:33:18,249 --> 00:33:20,249
That's the amount we were supposed to spend.

469
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:22,432
It was in our previous budget as well.

470
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,249
But you cut down on the budget,

471
00:33:24,249 --> 00:33:26,082
and that's why we overspent.

472
00:33:26,082 --> 00:33:28,023
You don't work according to the rules.

473
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:29,940
How are you going to explain this to the board?

474
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,415
How are you going to explain this to the employees?

475
00:33:32,415 --> 00:33:34,982
Since all of us agreed on the proposal,

476
00:33:34,982 --> 00:33:36,607
if we did not reach the expected outcome

477
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:38,457
because of budgeting problem,

478
00:33:38,457 --> 00:33:40,691
why didn't we just leave the proposal out?

479
00:33:40,691 --> 00:33:41,758
Yin Zheng,

480
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:45,691
do you think we're being too conservative?

481
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,666
But we have experience.

482
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:51,415
Our experiences have reference value.

483
00:33:51,415 --> 00:33:53,049
You follow the beaten track.

484
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:54,591
It's a different generation now.

485
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:58,982
I think we should believe in young people.

486
00:33:58,982 --> 00:34:00,974
Zhentian,

487
00:34:00,974 --> 00:34:03,732
I think you should give him more space.

488
00:34:03,732 --> 00:34:06,340
Just for this project,

489
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,440
why don't you let him try?

490
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,090
No?

491
00:34:11,357 --> 00:34:12,507
I...

492
00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:17,999
You went off-course.

493
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:20,165
I'm worried you'll cause everyone trouble.

494
00:34:20,165 --> 00:34:22,332
Anyone could say that.

495
00:34:22,332 --> 00:34:24,040
Don't worry.

496
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,065
I will make sure that I excel in this project.

497
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,315
I'll take responsibility for all my actions.

498
00:34:29,315 --> 00:34:30,499
Yin Zheng.

499
00:34:30,499 --> 00:34:32,649
We watched you grow up.

500
00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:35,891
Why are you backing yourself into a corner?

501
00:34:36,939 --> 00:34:39,939
Uncle Liu, don't worry.

502
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:42,332
I will not let people take

503
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:44,658
what I've worked on for so long.

504
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:50,632
Mr. Chairman,

505
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:53,390
I know you don't like the way I do things.

506
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,791
But this time,

507
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,791
I hope you can give me some time

508
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:59,274
to finish up this project properly.

509
00:35:02,724 --> 00:35:05,832
I hope you don't disappoint us.

510
00:35:05,832 --> 00:35:07,549
I will not disappoint you.

511
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,290
<i>[Private Lounge]</i>

512
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,740
Baby.

513
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:21,716
Why are you here?

514
00:35:21,716 --> 00:35:24,165
I told you Lan Lan doesn't like outsiders.

515
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,290
Go now.

516
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,899
I'm so curious.

517
00:35:26,899 --> 00:35:30,674
I have to see if she really looks just like you.

518
00:35:30,674 --> 00:35:31,958
I told you before.

519
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:35,174
She's way better than me in both temperament and appearance.

520
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,716
I don't believe you.

521
00:35:36,716 --> 00:35:38,190
Just let me see.

522
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,074
I'm already here.

523
00:35:43,165 --> 00:35:45,090
Why are you lurking

524
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,374
around the door?

525
00:35:46,374 --> 00:35:48,190
Are you trying to steal?

526
00:35:48,774 --> 00:35:51,457
Lan Lan, I'm sorry.

527
00:35:51,457 --> 00:35:52,758
She is my colleague.

528
00:35:52,758 --> 00:35:56,582
She admires you, so she wanted to see you.

529
00:35:56,582 --> 00:35:59,299
I heard my colleagues say that you're very pretty,

530
00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:02,382
so I wanted to meet you.

531
00:36:03,557 --> 00:36:06,799
Stop talking, wait for me here.

532
00:36:06,799 --> 00:36:08,132
Lan Lan,

533
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,899
let me bring the flowers in for you.

534
00:36:09,899 --> 00:36:11,916
Leave after you put down the flowers.

535
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:14,365
I don't want to be disturbed.

536
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:24,074
Go!

537
00:36:26,123 --> 00:36:27,591
Why is she so angry?

538
00:36:27,591 --> 00:36:30,357
I don't think she looks like you at all.

539
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:32,357
You're way prettier than her.

540
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,524
Let's go!

541
00:36:47,991 --> 00:36:49,666
Director Yin.

542
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,939
Lan Lan.

543
00:36:50,939 --> 00:36:52,916
Are you free tonight?

544
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:55,215
Can I know why?

545
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:58,557
Would you like to have dinner with me?

546
00:36:58,557 --> 00:37:00,557
Then I have to think about it.

547
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:03,815
Please come in.

548
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,923
Just the two of us?

549
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:21,899
I don't want anyone to disturb us when I'm with you.

550
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:05,591
Lan Lan.

551
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,116
Hug me please.

552
00:38:11,766 --> 00:38:13,365
What's wrong?

553
00:38:15,482 --> 00:38:17,182
Hug me.

554
00:39:13,415 --> 00:39:14,940
Thank you

555
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,107
for arranging all this for me.

556
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:21,491
I'm sorry about earlier.

557
00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:24,058
Did you really like it?

558
00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:28,424
This is the first time I'm seeing this kind of expression from someone who likes it.

559
00:39:29,899 --> 00:39:34,074
I'm impressed and touched.

560
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:38,624
I like to look into people's eyes.

561
00:39:38,624 --> 00:39:41,249
You can see a lot of things from their eyes.

562
00:39:42,232 --> 00:39:45,139
But your expression,

563
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:48,139
I can't tell what emotion you had.

564
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:54,507
Is it that hard?

565
00:39:55,691 --> 00:40:00,599
Then I would be a good actor in the future.

566
00:40:04,582 --> 00:40:07,749
Should I invest in a movie for you?

567
00:40:07,749 --> 00:40:10,507
Whatever you want.

568
00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:13,949
But I have one condition.

569
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:17,240
Tell me.

570
00:40:18,607 --> 00:40:22,499
Can you have someone else deliver the flowers?

571
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,924
Zhang Xiao.

572
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:28,765
You don't like her?

573
00:40:30,107 --> 00:40:31,774
No.

574
00:40:31,774 --> 00:40:33,607
She pretends to understand me,

575
00:40:33,607 --> 00:40:35,732
and she's full of herself.

576
00:40:35,732 --> 00:40:40,140
She even brings strangers to my lounge.

577
00:40:41,724 --> 00:40:43,816
She is a little full of herself,

578
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,207
but I don't think she's that bad.

579
00:40:47,707 --> 00:40:50,807
Everyone feels differently.

580
00:40:50,807 --> 00:40:54,807
I don't want to see her again.

581
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:13,432
Let's eat.

582
00:41:25,374 --> 00:41:27,299
Thank you for dinner.

583
00:41:27,299 --> 00:41:28,899
See you tomorrow.

584
00:41:37,607 --> 00:41:39,149
What?

585
00:41:39,149 --> 00:41:41,482
You aren't going to invite me in?

586
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,250
No.

587
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:49,165
I told you, you have to get to know me again.

588
00:41:49,165 --> 00:41:50,923
I'm serious.

589
00:41:57,774 --> 00:41:59,899
I'm serious as well.

590
00:42:00,858 --> 00:42:02,882
I just want to talk to you for a bit longer.

591
00:42:02,882 --> 00:42:04,440
Is that alright?

592
00:42:06,116 --> 00:42:07,649
Yes.

593
00:42:09,482 --> 00:42:11,524
Then if we're not chatting in your room,

594
00:42:11,524 --> 00:42:13,340
where shall we go?

595
00:42:17,149 --> 00:42:18,632
Here?

596
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:23,374
If you think it's inconvenient,

597
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,424
we can talk tomorrow.

598
00:42:29,415 --> 00:42:31,582
Okay.

599
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:34,932
I actually wanted to hear more about your story.

600
00:42:37,249 --> 00:42:39,182
My story?
