<i>[Episode 39]</i>

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,500
Sihan.

4
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:54,884
Sihan.

5
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:58,742
Kang Sihan.

6
00:02:00,784 --> 00:02:02,425
Sihan.

7
00:02:08,142 --> 00:02:11,642
Sihan.

8
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:16,209
Don't come near me.

9
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:23,938
Sihan, come back please.

10
00:02:23,938 --> 00:02:26,020
Could you please come back?

11
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,838
Come back please.

12
00:02:27,838 --> 00:02:32,019
I want to go with her to another world.

13
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,419
Do you want your baby to go with you?

14
00:02:37,454 --> 00:02:38,854
What?

15
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:41,112
Yinuo is pregnant.

16
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:45,004
My sister is carrying your baby.

17
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,962
Instead of dying with her,

18
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:53,379
can't you take good care of her, Sihan?

19
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:55,087
Sihan.

20
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:01,620
No.

21
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:37,095
Yinuo.

22
00:03:43,854 --> 00:03:46,938
Patient is in danger. We need a blood transfusion immediately.

23
00:03:46,938 --> 00:03:49,562
Both of your blood types are unique.

24
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,460
The blood bank doesn't have any more supply.

25
00:03:53,203 --> 00:03:56,395
Doctor, I can donate my blood to my sister.

26
00:03:56,395 --> 00:04:00,629
<i>In normal circumstances, blood donations can't exceed more than 200ml.</i>

27
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:02,629
<i>Your sister is bleeding a lot.</i>

28
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:05,796
<i>200ml is not sufficient.</i>

29
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:09,646
<i>I can donate as much as I can to save my sister.</i>

30
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:14,379
<i>This is harmful to your health.</i>

31
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,754
<i>Moreover, you were seriously injured last time.</i>

32
00:04:17,754 --> 00:04:19,462
<i>This is dangerous.</i>

33
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:22,712
<i>Doctor, I understand.</i>

34
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:27,079
<i>As long as we can save my sister's life, I am willing to take the risk.</i>

35
00:04:42,687 --> 00:04:47,420
Sister, you must recover soon.

36
00:04:48,604 --> 00:04:53,410
These magnolia earrings will keep us safe.

37
00:05:28,312 --> 00:05:30,145
Brother.

38
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:32,062
Be strong.

39
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:34,337
Zhang Xiao is now donating blood to her.

40
00:05:34,337 --> 00:05:36,712
There's still a chance.

41
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,571
Don't overthink it.

42
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:12,137
Sister.

43
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:15,754
Sister, you awake?

44
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:19,340
Doctor! My sister is awake.

45
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,045
Sister.

46
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:30,712
Sister.

47
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:34,187
Somebody, please!

48
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:36,920
Sister. Anyone there?

49
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,980
How is my sister?

50
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,420
Sister.

51
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:43,287
Sister.

52
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:47,371
Hang in there.

53
00:06:56,145 --> 00:06:57,895
Sihan.

54
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,220
Sihan.

55
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,919
Sister.

56
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:28,045
Sister.

57
00:07:39,337 --> 00:07:41,754
Why did this happen?

58
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:51,796
Why?

59
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,803
This isn't what I wanted.

60
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,254
It's not what I wanted.

61
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,487
What did you want then?

62
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:04,479
Kang Sihan.

63
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:08,845
Ma Yinuo is dead.

64
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:12,620
My sister is dead.

65
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,554
You are the murderer.

66
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:21,187
And Yin Zheng becomes your scapegoat.

67
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:28,920
Do you think it's any use being like that now?

68
00:08:30,504 --> 00:08:33,129
Do you think I'd feel sorry for you?

69
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:37,337
I won't.

70
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:40,960
I won't forgive you.

71
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:46,240
Why aren't you the one who's dead?

72
00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:54,180
Yes, why am I not the one who's dead?

73
00:08:55,045 --> 00:08:57,254
Why am I not the one who's dead?

74
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:17,562
I killed Yinuo.

75
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:06,237
Sihan.

76
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:50,546
You're marrying Sihan?

77
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:54,187
Sihan lost his legs because of me.

78
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:00,860
I need to take care of him.

79
00:11:08,354 --> 00:11:09,995
Sorry.

80
00:11:13,604 --> 00:11:16,546
This is our fate. Isn't it?

81
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:35,295
<i>Why is my ending in this life</i>

82
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,254
<i>the same as the ending in my dream?</i>

83
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:43,295
<i>Missing the chance to see my lover before I die.</i>

84
00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:46,629
<i>The three inches of sunlight I failed to borrow before sunset.</i>

85
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:53,350
<i>Wait, aren't I dead?</i>

86
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:57,512
<i>Why can I still see Yin Zheng crying in front of my bed?</i>

87
00:12:12,796 --> 00:12:14,420
Xiaoxiao.

88
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:19,420
Xiaoxiao.

89
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:38,803
<i>It was just a dream.</i>

90
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:44,412
<i>Although I can see him one last time in this ending,</i>

91
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:48,829
<i>I still have to be apart from him for the rest of my life.</i>

92
00:12:56,671 --> 00:12:58,504
Doctor.

93
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,229
How is my sister?

94
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:04,687
Baby is safe.

95
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:07,679
She is still in a coma.

96
00:13:08,437 --> 00:13:09,520
Don't worry.

97
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,730
She's stable now. Don't worry.

98
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:12,003
Yinuo.

99
00:14:15,712 --> 00:14:18,140
Let's pray together.

100
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:21,650
Zhang Xiao will overcome this.

101
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:30,587
This is our baby.

102
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:35,030
Can you feel that?

103
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:50,037
I really wish you can wake up now.

104
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:55,129
But I know

105
00:14:56,838 --> 00:14:59,260
I should not see you all anymore.

106
00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:04,203
I can't ask for your forgiveness.

107
00:15:08,838 --> 00:15:12,660
Yinuo, I understand.

108
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,340
I have to correct my mistakes.

109
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:24,420
I understand.

110
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:32,540
Brother, how's Yinuo doing?

111
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,020
Same as yesterday.

112
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:46,646
Zhang Xiao is out of danger.

113
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:50,279
I'll come see her again after I go home to get something.

114
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:14,046
They're both suffering now

115
00:16:15,712 --> 00:16:17,754
because of me.

116
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:21,879
I harmed myself and others.

117
00:16:24,662 --> 00:16:26,920
There is always hope

118
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:29,979
as long as take good care of them,

119
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:31,890
and as long as they're still alive.

120
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:39,395
Siyu, could you do me a favor?

121
00:16:39,395 --> 00:16:41,512
Help me take care of Yinuo.

122
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:48,504
I'm going to turn myself into the police

123
00:16:49,504 --> 00:16:52,187
and accept legal punishment.

124
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:54,590
Then Yin Zheng can come back.

125
00:16:56,045 --> 00:16:58,496
Zhang Xiao will have someone to take care of her.

126
00:17:06,337 --> 00:17:08,087
As for Yinuo,

127
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,270
please take care of her for me.

128
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:22,790
I'll go with you.

129
00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:37,546
Mom.

130
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:38,671
Zheng'er.

131
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:40,160
Sorry.

132
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,646
Let's go home.

133
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:47,812
I made you food.

134
00:18:47,812 --> 00:18:51,062
Mom, I want to go see Zhang Xiao first.

135
00:18:51,062 --> 00:18:53,260
I'll bring her home for dinner.

136
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:56,896
Siyu.

137
00:18:56,896 --> 00:18:59,003
Do you know where Zhang Xiao is?

138
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:04,079
Brother, there's something I haven't told you.

139
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,154
Did something happen to Zhang Xiao?

140
00:19:10,212 --> 00:19:13,020
Zhang Xiao is in a coma at the hospital

141
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,460
from trying to save Yinuo.

142
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,045
Zheng'er.

143
00:19:19,045 --> 00:19:20,420
Mom, let's go to the hospital.

144
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,454
- Okay, let's go.
- Come on.

145
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:25,854
Come on.

146
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:27,838
Come on.

147
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:40,554
Sorry.

148
00:20:02,504 --> 00:20:04,087
Zhang Xiao.

149
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,546
Zhang Xiao.

150
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:11,079
Zhang Xiao.

151
00:20:11,754 --> 00:20:13,762
You must wake up.

152
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,238
You can't just sleep here.

153
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:20,620
I need you to help me to change my slippers every day.

154
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,312
I need you to make dumplings for me every day.

155
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:27,354
Do you hear me?

156
00:20:27,354 --> 00:20:29,045
Wake up please.

157
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,687
Wake up please.

158
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:35,245
♫ <i>Only then can I see the faint existence of you</i> ♫

159
00:20:35,245 --> 00:20:42,262
♫ <i>I was just like the star that is far apart from you</i> ♫

160
00:20:42,262 --> 00:20:45,787
♫ <i>White clouds always rely on the blue sky</i> ♫

161
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:49,145
♫ <i>My love exists for you</i> ♫

162
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:55,129
♫ <i>Even if you don't understand my feelings and waiting</i> ♫

163
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,245
If you are tired,

164
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,962
just sleep a while.

165
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,037
I'll be here with you.

166
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:10,440
Waiting for you to wake up.

167
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:14,780
You just have a good sleep.

168
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:21,145
Yin Zheng.

169
00:21:30,604 --> 00:21:34,454
Xiaoxiao is suffering

170
00:21:35,354 --> 00:21:38,210
because of me.

171
00:21:39,229 --> 00:21:42,960
I did this to her. I'm sorry.

172
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,038
As long as you can recover,

173
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:50,929
what she did was worth it.

174
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:53,738
By the way,

175
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:56,962
what's your plan now?

176
00:21:56,962 --> 00:22:01,460
I want to wait for Sihan.

177
00:22:04,162 --> 00:22:06,054
Now that I'm awake,

178
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,812
I hope his sentence can be shortened.

179
00:22:11,871 --> 00:22:13,562
Don't worry.

180
00:22:13,562 --> 00:22:16,003
I will get the best lawyer for him.

181
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:18,312
Take care of yourself.

182
00:22:18,312 --> 00:22:22,203
I hope Sihan gets released before his baby is born.

183
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:28,512
Did Zhang Xiao's doctor say anything about her condition?

184
00:22:29,354 --> 00:22:31,079
The doctor said...

185
00:23:06,838 --> 00:23:08,671
You are here.

186
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:13,295
Let's go home.

187
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,946
This is our baby.

188
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:47,012
Let's go home.

189
00:24:05,796 --> 00:24:10,337
<i>Is Yin Zheng the one who comes to take care of me every day?</i>

190
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:16,100
<i>It's Yin Zheng. It must be him.</i>

191
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:19,020
<i>I can feel it.</i>

192
00:24:35,646 --> 00:24:37,680
I will visit you again tomorrow.

193
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:13,104
Are you leaving?

194
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:17,604
Yin Zheng.

195
00:25:18,962 --> 00:25:23,803
Xiaoxiao.

196
00:25:27,437 --> 00:25:29,687
You're finally awake.

197
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:46,430
I want to look at you clearly.

198
00:25:47,437 --> 00:25:49,746
Where are my glasses?

199
00:25:55,462 --> 00:25:57,129
Here.

200
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,904
Did I gain weight?

201
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,410
You lost weight.

202
00:26:15,295 --> 00:26:16,920
Xiaoxiao.

203
00:26:19,087 --> 00:26:22,410
Your glasses are at home.

204
00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:31,679
Sister.

205
00:26:33,212 --> 00:26:35,254
I'll let you guys catch up first.

206
00:26:35,254 --> 00:26:37,337
Siyu, let's go find the doctor.

207
00:26:37,337 --> 00:26:39,154
Come on, Brother.

208
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:06,920
Go.

209
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,220
Brother.

210
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:35,629
Do you know how long you were asleep?

211
00:27:35,629 --> 00:27:38,054
I may not have been able to deliver my baby safely

212
00:27:39,838 --> 00:27:43,290
if you didn't donate your blood to me.

213
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:48,020
Xiaoxiao, thank you.

214
00:27:49,854 --> 00:27:51,771
Sister.

215
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,745
The baby is doing great.

216
00:27:56,546 --> 00:28:00,500
Mom is taking care of the baby.

217
00:28:07,629 --> 00:28:12,210
Sihan was just released from prison.

218
00:28:21,354 --> 00:28:22,920
Xiaoxiao.

219
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,554
I'm sorry.

220
00:28:37,712 --> 00:28:39,203
Yinuo.

221
00:28:39,754 --> 00:28:42,579
I've handled Xiaoxiao's check-out procedures.

222
00:28:45,229 --> 00:28:49,650
Sister, is Yin Zheng not here yet?

223
00:28:52,437 --> 00:28:55,650
He's on a business trip.

224
00:28:58,754 --> 00:29:00,504
He told me

225
00:29:02,312 --> 00:29:04,740
that he would come pick me up from the hospital when I get discharged.

226
00:29:12,546 --> 00:29:15,003
He's really on a business trip.

227
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,960
Don't overthink it.

228
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,419
Sister.

229
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:22,103
I feel...

230
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:25,700
that Yin Zheng has been avoiding me recently.

231
00:29:27,395 --> 00:29:29,962
Did something happen?

232
00:29:34,629 --> 00:29:38,440
No such thing. Truly.

233
00:29:39,229 --> 00:29:41,829
Let's go.

234
00:29:50,962 --> 00:29:53,360
Can I borrow your phone?

235
00:30:02,754 --> 00:30:06,640
Brother, Second Brother and Yinuo already helped Zhang Xiao check out.

236
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,145
Don't worry.

237
00:30:08,145 --> 00:30:11,110
There's something I haven't told you.

238
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:16,780
When he came to see you a year ago,

239
00:30:17,896 --> 00:30:21,504
Han Qing came out of nowhere

240
00:30:21,504 --> 00:30:23,760
and hurt his eyes.

241
00:30:26,212 --> 00:30:28,254
He is blind now.

242
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,019
Hello?

243
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:50,412
Yin Zheng.

244
00:30:51,812 --> 00:30:56,030
Where are you? I've been discharged from the hospital.

245
00:30:57,379 --> 00:30:59,504
I'm in Shanghai on a business trip.

246
00:30:59,504 --> 00:31:01,295
It's quite busy.

247
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:03,170
I can't leave just yet.

248
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,840
Xiaoxiao.

249
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,696
Yinuo.

250
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,890
Let them have a good chat.

251
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,879
When are you coming back?

252
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:29,595
I don't know yet.

253
00:31:30,229 --> 00:31:34,630
I can only go back after I settle everything here first.

254
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:39,870
Don't wait for me. Go home and rest.

255
00:31:43,312 --> 00:31:45,962
You promised to pick me up.

256
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,212
- Watch where you're going. We're at the hospital.
- Sorry.

257
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:53,045
- Brother.
- Siyu.

258
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:55,162
Help me get a car. I need to go home.

259
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,990
Hello?

260
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,480
Hello?

261
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,570
Hello?

262
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,354
Sister Yinuo.

263
00:32:16,354 --> 00:32:18,603
Is Yin Zheng with you now?

264
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,587
Yes.

265
00:32:20,587 --> 00:32:22,245
Where are you now?

266
00:32:22,245 --> 00:32:24,129
We are just in front of hospital.

267
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:26,854
Wait for me.

268
00:32:28,562 --> 00:32:30,479
Who were you talking to?

269
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:31,919
It was Sister Yinuo.

270
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,462
It was Zhang Xiao.

271
00:32:34,312 --> 00:32:36,210
It was Zhang Xiao, right?

272
00:32:36,712 --> 00:32:38,703
- Brother...
- Am I right?

273
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:40,796
Yes.

274
00:32:40,796 --> 00:32:42,062
Don't say anything.

275
00:32:42,062 --> 00:32:44,062
Go stop her.

276
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:44,646
Brother.

277
00:32:44,646 --> 00:32:46,395
I can't let her see me like this.

278
00:32:46,395 --> 00:32:47,170
Brother, you...

279
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,179
Go stop her!

280
00:32:50,187 --> 00:32:51,896
I've never asked you for anything before.

281
00:32:51,896 --> 00:32:53,062
I'm begging you now.

282
00:32:53,062 --> 00:32:54,462
Please help me stop her.

283
00:32:54,462 --> 00:32:56,671
I can't let her see me like this.

284
00:32:56,671 --> 00:32:58,471
Go.

285
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,354
Sorry.

286
00:33:10,145 --> 00:33:11,754
Where is Yin Zheng?

287
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:17,003
Where is he?

288
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:20,112
Where is he?

289
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,496
He left.

290
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,438
Where did he go?

291
00:33:34,938 --> 00:33:36,820
He did not tell me.

292
00:33:39,312 --> 00:33:42,562
Why would you let him leave on his own?

293
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,012
He can't see.

294
00:33:45,729 --> 00:33:48,620
Don't you know how dangerous that is?

295
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,487
Why would you let him leave on his own?

296
00:33:55,854 --> 00:33:57,870
Where could he go?

297
00:33:59,979 --> 00:34:01,720
Where could he go?

298
00:34:03,587 --> 00:34:05,870
Where could he go?

299
00:34:19,687 --> 00:34:22,096
Let's go back first.

300
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,870
Big Brother will be okay.

301
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:31,337
He also really wants to see you.

302
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,845
I asked you to wait for me.

303
00:34:35,462 --> 00:34:38,062
I asked you to wait for me!

304
00:34:38,062 --> 00:34:41,004
Why did you let him leave?

305
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:51,337
Why did you let him leave?

306
00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:11,587
<i>Zhang Xiao, I left.</i>

307
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:13,112

I almost

329
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:50,670
lost you.

330
00:38:05,754 --> 00:38:08,062
You still found me.

331
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:16,629
But so what if you found me?

332
00:38:24,604 --> 00:38:26,729
I said before,

333
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:32,090
as long as you're still on the horizon,

334
00:38:33,604 --> 00:38:36,960
you'll always be in my line of sight.

335
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:45,590
But now even if you're just an arm's length away,

336
00:38:46,546 --> 00:38:48,829
I still wouldn't be able to find you.

337
00:38:55,646 --> 00:38:57,929
Where are you trying to run to then?

338
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,471
When I ran away before,

339
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:12,919
you came to find me.

340
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,220
Now no matter how far you go, I will still find you.

341
00:39:38,671 --> 00:39:40,462
As you said before,

342
00:39:43,103 --> 00:39:44,579
this ring

343
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:50,379
represents a man's promise to his beloved lady.

344
00:39:53,938 --> 00:39:56,420
You promised me before.

345
00:40:02,212 --> 00:40:04,695
So, from now onward,

346
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,500
you can't leave me

347
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:12,670
without my permission.

348
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:28,946
If you can't come to my world,

349
00:40:34,562 --> 00:40:36,490
I will go to your world to find you.

363
