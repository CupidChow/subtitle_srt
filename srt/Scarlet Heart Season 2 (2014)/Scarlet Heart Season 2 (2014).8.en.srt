00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,610
<i>[Scarlet Heart 2]</i>

2
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:43,020
<i>[Episode 8]</i>

3
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,612
Director Yin.

4
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:54,370
Director Yin, I reserved your seat.

5
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,103
Do you like Sichuanese cuisine?

6
00:01:56,103 --> 00:01:57,646
Just get me an employee meal.

7
00:01:57,646 --> 00:01:59,619
Yes, this way.

8
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:05,362
You may go now

9
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:13,546
Didn't we say we'd never meet again?

10
00:02:14,437 --> 00:02:16,129
What?

11
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:18,520
Are you reluctant to leave

12
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,587
because our food is too good?

13
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:22,812
Yes.

14
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:24,854
It's too good,

15
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:26,629
so I can't bear to leave.

16
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:28,437
Let me warn you.

17
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:31,019
Don't make any mistakes.

18
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:33,579
It's not that easy to get a meal out of us.

19
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,820
Thank you for your advice.

20
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:43,395
You should eat more

21
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:44,838
while you still have the chance.

22
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:57,354
Next week is the annual international cosmetics convention.

23
00:02:57,354 --> 00:03:00,019
Jack, how is your department coming along?

24
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:01,562
We are ready.

25
00:03:01,562 --> 00:03:02,796
Really?

26
00:03:03,646 --> 00:03:07,871
Remember that Yue-Sai's latest items,

27
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:12,062
the snow ear moisturizing series, must be outstanding.

28
00:03:12,062 --> 00:03:14,019
Don't worry, Director Yin.

29
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:15,254
At the core of the exhibition area,

30
00:03:15,254 --> 00:03:18,579
we will have a demo of the snow ear polysaccharides' moisturizing power five times that of hyaluronic acid.

31
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:23,646
From the entrance to our booth,

32
00:03:23,646 --> 00:03:27,919
there will be signs that say "Witness the Moisturizing King".

33
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,854
We will capture our customers with our product

34
00:03:30,854 --> 00:03:33,620
as soon as they enter the hall.

35
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,546
I organized the booth setup and displays.

36
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:40,312
I can guarantee that there will be no problems.

37
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:41,871
Very good.

38
00:03:43,771 --> 00:03:45,979
Who can tell me

39
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:50,479
Z&X's philosophy and style?

40
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,396
Who can promise me that our booth will outperform theirs?

41
00:03:55,437 --> 00:03:57,629
Do you have that confidence?

42
00:04:00,312 --> 00:04:03,187
Shouldn't you be aware of all this?

43
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:03,979
This...

44
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:06,187
Is this your guarantee?

45
00:04:06,187 --> 00:04:07,520
No, Director Yin.

46
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,562
I'm telling you.

47
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:12,479
Only by knowing your enemies can you win them.

48
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,229
I think we should have someone check out their booth,

49
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:18,687
to understand Z&X,

50
00:04:18,687 --> 00:04:22,020
their creativity and their weaknesses.

51
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:25,496
Who is willing to do it?

52
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,062
Director Yin, I can't do it.

53
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:38,354
I'm so pretty and attractive.

54
00:04:38,354 --> 00:04:40,771
I'll get noticed immediately.

55
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:43,838
Yes, you're too pretty to do it.

56
00:04:43,838 --> 00:04:45,520
Should I do it then?

57
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,003
Or should I ask the chairman to do it?

58
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:50,479
No, that's not what I meant.

59
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,512
I'll do it.

60
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:56,520
Jack.

61
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,012
Get me their information no matter what.

62
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:03,120
Otherwise,

63
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:07,550
you will know the consequences.

64
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,229
You get it.

65
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:11,520
Yes.

66
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,920
Dismissed.

67
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,312
What? You want me to be a spy?

68
00:05:31,312 --> 00:05:33,229
Don't say it like that.

69
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:35,329
It's called collecting business intelligence.

70
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:36,646
I don't care.

71
00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:38,312
I'm not doing it.

72
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:41,329
Zhang Xiao, don't be ungrateful.

73
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:43,796
There are so many people in this department,

74
00:05:43,796 --> 00:05:46,479
but why do you think I chose you?

75
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,962
It's because I value you.

76
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:55,495
I hate villains and spies the most.

77
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:57,854
You should choose someone else.

78
00:05:57,854 --> 00:05:59,646
Do you want me to do it myself?

79
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:02,062
Should I ask the chairman to come with me too?

80
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:07,312
Get me Z&X's booth setup for the new product launch event.

81
00:06:07,312 --> 00:06:10,096
Otherwise,

82
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:14,003
you will know the consequences. Understand?

83
00:06:14,003 --> 00:06:17,404
What did you say? Z&X?

84
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:18,587
Yes.

85
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,520
I can't do it.

86
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,395
Trust yourself, you can.

87
00:06:23,395 --> 00:06:25,979
No, I really can't.

88
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,103
Come in.

89
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:29,537
Jack, please sign here.

90
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:43,245
Thank you.

91
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:45,212
Wait.

92
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:46,587
What is it?

93
00:06:50,546 --> 00:06:51,870
Huang Di.

94
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,919
I don't think you've worked with Zhang Xiao before.

95
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,896
No.

96
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:59,345
Should I give you a chance?

97
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:00,312
Okay.

98
00:07:00,312 --> 00:07:03,354
Zhang Xiao, you'll work on this task together.

99
00:07:03,354 --> 00:07:04,646
What?

100
00:07:04,646 --> 00:07:05,829
What task?

101
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:07,270
I have a meeting in a bit.

102
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,771
Please discuss this outside.

103
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:10,646
Jack.

104
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:12,262
Good luck.

105
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:14,812
We'll get it done.

106
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:16,612
Zip it.

107
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:18,896
Tell me what the task is.

108
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,629
What a vulgar woman.

109
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,238
A spy?

110
00:07:24,938 --> 00:07:26,812
This is so dangerous.

111
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:28,103
Listen to me.

112
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:30,479
It's fine if we succeed.

113
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,520
But if we get caught,

114
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,062
we'll get beat up.

115
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:36,687
The problem

116
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:39,920
is that they want us to spy on Z&X.

117
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:43,462
Z&X?

118
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:47,829
The company that gave us the face masks and perfumes?

119
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:49,203
Yes.

120
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:52,019
No way.

121
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:53,145
As the saying goes,

122
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:56,129
you can't betray those that are good to you.

123
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,687
But my bag is still at Zhen Tian.

124
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:04,620
I can't do it.

125
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,329
You can go ahead if you want to.

126
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:10,712
Jack told us to do it together.

127
00:08:10,712 --> 00:08:12,819
I'm not doing it.

128
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:18,796
What should I do then?

129
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:21,145
At the end of the day,

130
00:08:21,145 --> 00:08:23,938
I'm still your ex-boyfriend.

131
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:26,779
Do you have the heart to throw me under the bus?

132
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:29,419
Let's do it together.

133
00:08:31,395 --> 00:08:34,471
Come on.

134
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,687
Black Cat Detective.

135
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,712
Are you asking me to a meal?

136
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:03,129
No.

137
00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:07,838
What happened?

138
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:12,212
I came

139
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,854
to tell you some confidential information.

140
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:17,829
Confidential information?

141
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:22,604
It's hard for me to talk about this.

142
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,479
But after some thought,

143
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,979
I think I should let you know.

144
00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:29,354
Please tell your boss

145
00:09:29,354 --> 00:09:32,162
that Zhen Tian Group's Yue-Sai has secretively developed a product

146
00:09:32,162 --> 00:09:34,795
that targets the younger generation to compete with you.

147
00:09:34,795 --> 00:09:37,495
For the international cosmetics convention next week,

148
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:41,787
they will send a spy to check out your booth.

149
00:09:42,437 --> 00:09:45,879
Please prepare some backup plans.

150
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:49,312
That way you can handle it if anything happens.

151
00:09:49,312 --> 00:09:51,062
Are you sure?

152
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:53,280
That's all I can tell you.

153
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:57,620
You decide whether to believe it or not.

154
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,412
I believe you. Thank you.

155
00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:04,395
I'll get going now.

156
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,938
Let's have a meal.

157
00:10:07,996 --> 00:10:09,940
It's okay.

158
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,840
I have no appetite.

159
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:41,120
My heart is beating so fast.

160
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,103
Me too. It's about to jump out.

161
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,562
I forgot to buy insurance.

162
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:51,229
You have to take responsibility if anything happens to me.

163
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:52,720
You deserve it.

164
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,160
Check the time.

165
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:58,196
Where is your phone?

166
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:03,079
Okay, let's move.

167
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:05,395
This way, idiot.

168
00:11:05,395 --> 00:11:06,954
Why didn't you say so earlier?

169
00:11:06,954 --> 00:11:09,579
Cut the crap.

170
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:44,395
Move.

171
00:11:50,812 --> 00:11:52,687
You are so clumsy.

172
00:11:52,687 --> 00:11:53,962
Let me do this.

173
00:11:58,437 --> 00:12:00,254
You're awesome.

174
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,403
Come on.

175
00:12:05,354 --> 00:12:06,954
Me?

176
00:12:15,495 --> 00:12:16,671
It's done.

177
00:12:16,671 --> 00:12:18,245
What are you doing?

178
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:19,354
Come on.

179
00:12:19,354 --> 00:12:20,946
What's going on?

180
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:25,054
You're such an idiot.

181
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:29,179
What are you doing here?

182
00:12:30,203 --> 00:12:32,395
Xiaoxiao, I'm here!

183
00:12:32,395 --> 00:12:33,871
Stop right there.

184
00:12:33,871 --> 00:12:35,829
Who are you?

185
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:38,762
My mom said to not others in the face.

186
00:12:38,762 --> 00:12:40,254
Get him!

187
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:44,787
You're such an idiot!

188
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:47,746
Why didn't you silence your phone?

189
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:50,604
Black Cat Detective.

190
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,479
What are you doing here?

191
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:55,919
I...

192
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,560
Are you here to lay out your booth?

193
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:03,854
I told my boss about the information you told me last time.

194
00:13:03,854 --> 00:13:06,287
He sent me here to keep watch,

195
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:09,219
but I haven't seen anyone from Zhen Tian.

196
00:13:09,219 --> 00:13:13,145
I'm sorry, Black Cat Detective.

197
00:13:13,812 --> 00:13:16,038
I'm actually the one Zhen Tian sent.

198
00:13:16,038 --> 00:13:18,479
You?

199
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,245
I am sorry.

200
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:24,345
Give me your phone.

201
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:43,838
See what you can use.

202
00:13:49,838 --> 00:13:53,287
This is all your information.

203
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:55,145
- You...
- You helped me.

204
00:13:55,145 --> 00:13:56,854
I have to help you.

205
00:13:56,854 --> 00:13:59,162
I don't want you to get scolded by your boss.

206
00:13:59,162 --> 00:14:01,245
No, you can't.

207
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:02,562
How can you betray your own boss?

208
00:14:02,562 --> 00:14:06,604
You betrayed your boss, so I have to do the same.

209
00:14:06,604 --> 00:14:07,687
I...

210
00:14:07,687 --> 00:14:10,329
We are on the same boat now.

211
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:12,979
We have to help each other.

212
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:13,979
But...

213
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,562
It's alright, just take a look.

214
00:14:15,562 --> 00:14:17,771
Take what you can use.

215
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:26,938
This is great.

216
00:14:26,938 --> 00:14:29,270
It's no wonder my boss is scared of you.

217
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,246
Then you should calm him down.

218
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,187
Can I really take this?

219
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:39,119
Of course.

220
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,996
Don't worry. My boss made backup plans.

221
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:45,954
He won't lose too much.

222
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,019
What are you doing?

223
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:00,687
Deleting it.

224
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:02,704
This is so unfair.

225
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:08,437
It's so shameless just to steal what someone else worked so hard to create.

226
00:15:08,437 --> 00:15:09,996
I'm a designer myself.

227
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:11,287
I can't do this.

228
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:13,479
What are you going to tell your boss?

229
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,954
If I do this, I will look down on myself.

230
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:21,145
I should just be honest.

231
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:22,587
What do you think?

232
00:15:24,604 --> 00:15:26,120
ZX,

233
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,979
you're very kind.

234
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:31,162
I'm touched.

235
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:33,954
You are beautiful.

236
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,295
Black Cat Detective.

237
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:41,187
Thank you for helping me.

238
00:15:41,187 --> 00:15:44,338
And thank you for not looking down on me.

239
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:09,119
Sorry.

240
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:11,604
Did they hurt you?

241
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,229
How can you abandon me?

242
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:14,938
You're heartless.

243
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:16,670
Look.

244
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,129
They did that to you?

245
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:23,454
They went too far.

246
00:16:23,454 --> 00:16:26,829
How can they be so cruel in broad daylight?

247
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:29,720
Does anyone even care about me?

248
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:34,270
Sorry.

249
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,103
I'll take you to the hospital.

250
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:37,495
I'm not going.

251
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:44,354
How about we get some bittern flapjack?

252
00:16:44,354 --> 00:16:46,129
Add in two extra sausages.

253
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:51,570
Cheater Huang.

254
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,987
What do you want?

255
00:16:56,312 --> 00:16:57,996
Fine, be mad then.

256
00:16:57,996 --> 00:16:59,437
I'm leaving.

257
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,896
I accept your offer.

258
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:06,062
I also want three months of unlimited online gaming.

259
00:17:06,062 --> 00:17:07,312
No problem.

260
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:10,370
And three months of not washing the dishes.

261
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,671
Fine.

262
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:13,812
I also want free breakfast

263
00:17:13,812 --> 00:17:16,019
and have it sent to my room.

264
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,270
Fine.

265
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,262
And lastly I want...

266
00:17:40,562 --> 00:17:41,887
President Kang.

267
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:45,629
Ask the client about this.

268
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:46,979
President Kang.

269
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:48,837
Two colleagues called from the exhibition hall.

270
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:51,045
They said there were two people sneaking photos of our booth.

271
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:52,620
They caught one of them

272
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,687
and they said they were from Zhen Tian Group.

273
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,329
Okay, I got it.

274
00:17:56,329 --> 00:17:59,620
Zhen Tian's Yue-Sai is our competitor.

275
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,437
They've been really interested in our products recently.

276
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:06,162
We just signed contracts with some of their big clients.

277
00:18:06,162 --> 00:18:08,646
It make sense for them to target us.

278
00:18:08,646 --> 00:18:10,996
I still think they have ill intentions.

279
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:13,329
Should we change to a backup plan?

280
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:15,687
No need.

281
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:18,154
Okay.

282
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,079
Director Yin, we have Z&X's information.

283
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,587
We went through many hurdles.

284
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:40,212
Look at Huang Di, he got hurt.

285
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:45,020
Thank you.

286
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,287
Don't worry.

287
00:18:46,287 --> 00:18:49,871
I'll remember this during the annual performance evaluation.

288
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:51,454
You will get your bonuses.

289
00:18:51,454 --> 00:18:53,162
Director Yin.

290
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:55,187
The bonus isn't what's important.

291
00:18:55,187 --> 00:18:57,170
It's a pleasure to serve you.

292
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,187
We're lucky to work for you.

293
00:18:59,187 --> 00:19:00,771
Stop flattering me.

294
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:02,437
Give me the information.

295
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:03,787
Come.

296
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:06,003
Director Yin.

297
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:17,654
Jack.

298
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:19,787
I don't think you've seen this.

299
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:22,454
Of course not. They're trade secrets.

300
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:25,071
You worked so hard to get this information.

301
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:26,603
You should take a look.

302
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,880
<i>[They're Awesome]</i>

303
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,119
- Zhang Xiao.
- Don't talk.

304
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:39,896
Explain.

305
00:19:39,896 --> 00:19:41,687
What's going on?

306
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:43,287
There's nothing to explain.

307
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:44,938
That's all I have to say.

308
00:19:44,938 --> 00:19:46,579
They're awesome.

309
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:47,920
What else?

310
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,145
We need competition if we want to be successful.

311
00:19:51,145 --> 00:19:54,095
Because then we'll put more effort into our work.

312
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:59,145
But that doesn't mean we have to do the wrong thing

313
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:01,145
in order to succeed.

314
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:03,646
I asked you to collect information.

315
00:20:03,646 --> 00:20:05,771
I didn't ask you to steal.

316
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:09,187
How is that doing the wrong thing?

317
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:12,103
Are you telling me how to be a good person?

318
00:20:12,103 --> 00:20:14,620
I'm just a mere graphic designer.

319
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,120
I don't have the right to tell you what to do.

320
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:21,062
Zhang Xiao, you work under me now.

321
00:20:21,062 --> 00:20:24,287
Don't think that you're all that just because the chairman hired you.

322
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:27,919
I won't ask you to leave and I won't fire you.

323
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,520
Opposite actually.

324
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,729
I'll give you the freedom to spread your positive energy.

325
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:36,271
Let me see how capable you are.

326
00:20:39,062 --> 00:20:41,729
Zhang Xiao, you should say thank you.

327
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:44,996
Then take this and get out of here.

328
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,504
We should all get out of here.

329
00:20:50,504 --> 00:20:51,850
Sorry, Director Yin.

330
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,879
Go.

331
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,295
Let's go.

332
00:21:17,454 --> 00:21:19,045
We haven't seen each other in so long.

333
00:21:21,145 --> 00:21:23,245
Director Yin.

334
00:21:23,245 --> 00:21:26,203
I've been meaning to ask what you've been up to.

335
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:28,562
I don't run into you at the office

336
00:21:28,562 --> 00:21:30,687
and you don't answer my calls.

337
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:34,029
And when I sent you a message, you responded with "in a meeting" after a long time.

338
00:21:35,979 --> 00:21:38,250
I've been really busy.

339
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:41,395
If I'm not mistaken,

340
00:21:41,395 --> 00:21:44,279
I think your attention is with someone else.

341
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,379
I only like magnolias.

342
00:21:55,787 --> 00:21:58,379
These photos are nice.

343
00:21:58,379 --> 00:21:59,962
Thank you.

344
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:05,254
I am just fulfilling the conditions of my contract.

345
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,120
Was what happened that night also written in the contract?

346
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,637
It seems those nights are pretty normal for you.

347
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:22,437
If you're counting the breakfast in the morning and the hairpin,

348
00:22:22,437 --> 00:22:25,020
then it's actually pretty rare for me.

349
00:22:26,454 --> 00:22:30,395
I've been thinking about what to say to you when I saw you again.

350
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:32,287
If I told you I admired you,

351
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:34,604
you might not think I'm being sincere.

352
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:37,437
If I said let's be together forever,

353
00:22:37,437 --> 00:22:39,504
you might think it's a lie.

354
00:22:40,771 --> 00:22:42,896
So after thinking about it for a long time,

355
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:45,019
I decided to tell you,

356
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:48,270
while we're still not bored of each other,

357
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,012
let's be together.

358
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,629
Are you being serious?

359
00:22:55,203 --> 00:22:56,854
I know you're worried.

360
00:22:56,854 --> 00:22:58,770
No.

361
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,600
I'm not worried.

362
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,979
You don't understand me.

363
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:06,396
I'm not as perfect as you might think.

364
00:23:07,662 --> 00:23:12,562
I hate the word "perfect".

365
00:23:12,562 --> 00:23:14,020
Why?

366
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:19,270
Did you know I had a step-brother?

367
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,229
His name is Kang Sihan.

368
00:23:22,103 --> 00:23:26,437
He's always been what others see as the perfect poster child.

369
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:33,854
<i>Hurry.</i>

370
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,354
<i>Let me help you.</i>

371
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:54,619
<i>Thank you.</i>

372
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,354
<i>I have good news to announce.</i>

373
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:02,020
<i>Here!</i>

374
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,290
<i>Yin Zheng, you again?</i>

375
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:08,119
<i>You don't do your homework and sleep in class.</i>

376
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:10,312
<i>And now you're late.</i>

377
00:24:10,312 --> 00:24:12,079
<i>Go stand at the door.</i>

378
00:24:14,671 --> 00:24:19,020
<i>If any of you behave in this way,</i>

379
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,896
<i>you will have to stand.</i>

380
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:24,838
<i>Where was I?</i>

381
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,812
<i>Good news.</i>

382
00:24:26,812 --> 00:24:31,287
<i>Yes, we have good news.</i>

383
00:24:31,287 --> 00:24:36,454
<i>Kang Sihan has won first place</i>

384
00:24:36,454 --> 00:24:39,587
<i>in the English language competition.</i>

385
00:24:39,587 --> 00:24:41,919
<i>This brings honor to our school</i>

386
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,412
<i>and glory to our class.</i>

387
00:24:44,412 --> 00:24:46,738
<i>Let's clap for him.</i>

388
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:53,938
<i>I didn't expect for such a carefree boss</i>

389
00:24:53,938 --> 00:24:57,062
to have such an sad childhood.

390
00:24:58,896 --> 00:25:01,145
I just want to let you know

391
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:03,270
that I'm not perfect.

392
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:09,312
Perfect is so superficial thinking.

393
00:25:09,312 --> 00:25:12,938
Where is Kang Sihan now?

394
00:25:14,604 --> 00:25:19,354
Twenty years ago, the old man sent him overseas for school.

395
00:25:19,354 --> 00:25:22,403
I rarely saw him afterwards.

396
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:25,120
But now he's back,

397
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,400
and is once again working against me.

398
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,704
You think he's back for you?

399
00:25:29,704 --> 00:25:31,154
I think so.

400
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:34,229
The old man is getting old.

401
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:37,454
Zhen Tian Group can't go a day without a leader.

402
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:41,820
He came back just in time.

403
00:25:42,604 --> 00:25:45,845
But I'm surprised with the old man.

404
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:48,329
He told me to work against Kang Sihan.

405
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:52,287
I don't know what he is up to.

406
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:57,103
Why are you telling me this?

407
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:03,219
Aren't you worried that I'll tell people about this?

408
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,687
I would tell you anything you want to hear.

409
00:26:07,687 --> 00:26:10,120
Don't lose faith in yourself.

410
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,646
Everyone has their own story.

411
00:26:12,646 --> 00:26:14,910
Your past has nothing to do with me,

412
00:26:15,704 --> 00:26:18,020
but now you mean a lot to me.

413
00:26:23,437 --> 00:26:25,354
Think about it.

414
00:26:25,354 --> 00:26:30,212
Two imperfect people can be perfect together.

415
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,712
Let's get dinner tonight.

416
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:54,919
Director Yin.

417
00:26:59,604 --> 00:27:03,120
Lan Lan, here are your flowers.

418
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,638
Come in.

419
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:12,587
Why do you still work here?

420
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:18,246
If I were you, I wouldn't be here anymore.

421
00:27:20,312 --> 00:27:23,638
It's my business whether to stay or not.

422
00:27:45,454 --> 00:27:48,962
Are you trying to steal?

423
00:27:48,962 --> 00:27:52,162
Why would you say that?

424
00:27:52,162 --> 00:27:54,262
If I didn't catch you,

425
00:27:54,262 --> 00:27:56,829
this would probably be in your pocket by now.

426
00:27:56,829 --> 00:27:58,729
I just wanted to take a look at it.

427
00:27:58,729 --> 00:28:01,220
You should've still asked for my permission.

428
00:28:05,938 --> 00:28:07,562
Wait.

429
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:10,712
Do you want me to throw away these flowers myself?

430
00:28:11,771 --> 00:28:13,604
Sorry.

431
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:17,395
Director Yin asked me to deliver the flowers to you, not throw them away.

432
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:42,295
<i>Where have I seen that earring before?</i>

433
00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:47,162
<i>In my hometown when I was a kid?</i>

434
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:49,290
<i>Darn it.</i>

435
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,730
<i>My memory has gotten worse since I got electrocuted.</i>

436
00:28:53,896 --> 00:28:56,412
<i>Why can't I remember?</i>

437
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:08,412
<i>ZX, did your boss scold you?</i>

438
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,495
<i>It was inevitable.</i>

439
00:29:11,495 --> 00:29:13,145
<i>But it's okay.</i>

440
00:29:13,145 --> 00:29:15,019
<i>I have a clean conscience.</i>

441
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,395
<i>I told my boss about this.</i>

442
00:29:18,395 --> 00:29:20,420
<i>He likes you.</i>

443
00:29:21,562 --> 00:29:23,812
<i>Your boss is a good man.</i>

444
00:29:23,812 --> 00:29:25,995
<i>Thank him for praising me.</i>

445
00:29:27,646 --> 00:29:31,187
<i>He asked if you wanted to work for us.</i>

446
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:38,579
<i>I haven't thought about that before.</i>

447
00:29:43,587 --> 00:29:45,145
<i>You can think about it.</i>

448
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:47,604
<i>My boss is a great man.</i>

449
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:55,150
<i>Thank you. I'll consider it.</i>

450
00:30:07,587 --> 00:30:08,896
Director Yin.

451
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,938
Jack didn't tell you that your bonus will get cut if you're on your phone during work?

452
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:14,379
Sorry.

453
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:20,712
I think your salary and bonuses for this month have been cut quite a lot.

454
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:23,646
Don't get me wrong.

455
00:30:23,646 --> 00:30:25,812
I'm not trying to force you to quit.

456
00:30:25,812 --> 00:30:30,495
I hope you can stay and work harder.

457
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,679
If it comes to that day when you don't work for me anymore,

458
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,687
I will be so bored in this office.

459
00:30:40,662 --> 00:30:42,719
I want to see how long you can bear it.

460
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,420
I'll play with you.

461
00:31:05,103 --> 00:31:07,079
Strange.

462
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:09,304
Why is she everywhere?

463
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,079
She's here.

464
00:31:23,746 --> 00:31:26,145
At least wear something else.

465
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:29,796
Your outfit is so old-fashioned.

466
00:31:29,796 --> 00:31:33,254
The woman I like...

467
00:31:40,587 --> 00:31:43,687
You and Ling Dang would be a great match,

468
00:31:43,687 --> 00:31:48,095
but I prefer kind and intellectual.

469
00:31:56,646 --> 00:31:58,145
Also,

470
00:31:58,145 --> 00:32:00,379
cute and innocent.

471
00:32:08,854 --> 00:32:13,020
I like college girls.

472
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,103
But my mom might not like it.

473
00:32:15,103 --> 00:32:19,554
She prefers gentlewomen.

474
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:29,320
Why am I thinking of you?

475
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,287
Calm down.

476
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:38,054
It's no problem.

477
00:32:44,019 --> 00:32:46,371
Calm down.

478
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,530
<i>[Give me back my money]</i>

479
00:33:03,312 --> 00:33:07,054
Is he for real?

480
00:33:16,103 --> 00:33:17,687
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

481
00:33:17,687 --> 00:33:20,187
<i>Welcome to today's hotline.</i>

482
00:33:20,187 --> 00:33:24,354
<i>We received a call today from Mr. Kang.</i>

483
00:33:24,354 --> 00:33:26,329
<i>He said that Miss Zhang</i>

484
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:29,671
<i>owes him 3,000 yuan and refuses to repay him.</i>

485
00:33:29,671 --> 00:33:32,729
<i>We are here to remind Miss Zhang</i>

486
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:36,329
<i>that being honest and trustworthy are our moral values.</i>

487
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:39,662
<i>You should pay back what you owe.</i>

488
00:33:39,662 --> 00:33:44,238
<i>We hope that Miss Zhang can pay back the money soon.</i>

489
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:47,862
Crazy.

490
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,395
Are you Miss Zhang Xiao?

491
00:33:59,395 --> 00:34:00,187
Yes.

492
00:34:00,187 --> 00:34:02,604
This is your mail, please sign.

493
00:34:02,604 --> 00:34:03,938
Thank you.

494
00:34:06,103 --> 00:34:07,420
Thank you.

495
00:34:27,287 --> 00:34:29,103
<i>It's been so long. Why haven't you paid me back yet?</i>

496
00:34:29,103 --> 00:34:30,729
<i>Here is a list of the details.</i>

497
00:34:30,729 --> 00:34:33,704
<i>Please prepare the money as stated in the details and bring it to Hero Bar.</i>

498
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,187
<i>The full amount.</i>

499
00:34:35,187 --> 00:34:37,287
<i>Otherwise, you know the consequences.</i>

500
00:34:41,854 --> 00:34:44,619
You must be kidding.

501
00:35:35,604 --> 00:35:37,287
What are you doing?

502
00:35:37,287 --> 00:35:38,587
What are you doing here?

503
00:35:38,587 --> 00:35:40,537
Are you trying to kill me?

504
00:35:40,537 --> 00:35:43,562
Why are you following me?

505
00:35:43,562 --> 00:35:47,812
I just want to make sure my interest is safe.

506
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,429
I received your text message, mail, and e-mail.

507
00:35:50,429 --> 00:35:53,245
Please don't do this again.

508
00:35:53,245 --> 00:35:54,537
Why didn't you reply?

509
00:35:54,537 --> 00:35:56,303
I was worried all night.

510
00:35:56,303 --> 00:35:57,946
Why?

511
00:35:58,938 --> 00:36:00,245
Worried that...

512
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:02,337
Worried that you weren't going to pay me back.

513
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:04,187
Don't worry.

514
00:36:04,187 --> 00:36:07,879
I don't break my promises.

515
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,254
It's difficult to say.

516
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:11,329
What are you trying to say?

517
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:14,437
You're an older woman with no car, no house, and no boyfriend.

518
00:36:14,437 --> 00:36:15,912
You're capable of anything.

519
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:18,629
Didn't you want to kill me just now?

520
00:36:19,203 --> 00:36:20,829
I just owe you some money.

521
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:22,919
Do you have to say those things about me?

522
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:25,546
Here, my money and cards are in there.

523
00:36:25,546 --> 00:36:27,771
Have it all!

524
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:28,729
I was just kidding.

525
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:30,871
Listen carefully, Mr. Horseshit.

526
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:32,329
I paid you back the money.

527
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:35,137
We are strangers now.

528
00:36:38,437 --> 00:36:39,729
I was just kidding.

529
00:36:39,729 --> 00:36:42,287
Why are you getting mad?

530
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:44,154
But I like it.

531
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:54,919
IC card.

532
00:36:57,162 --> 00:37:00,271
She even put a deep-fried dough stick in her bag?

533
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:06,019
Her journal.

534
00:37:18,312 --> 00:37:20,954
August personal expenses.

535
00:37:20,954 --> 00:37:22,662
700 for food.

536
00:37:22,662 --> 00:37:24,646
<i>1,900 for rent and utilities.</i>

537
00:37:24,646 --> 00:37:26,312
<i>200 for transportation.</i>

538
00:37:26,312 --> 00:37:27,979
<i>1,000 for my dad.</i>

539
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:31,170
<i>300 for the kids in primary school.</i>

540
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,537
<i>I'm still left with 900.</i>

541
00:37:33,537 --> 00:37:36,020
<i>What should I spend it on?</i>

542
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,687
<i>How annoying.</i>

543
00:37:37,687 --> 00:37:39,620
She doesn't know where to spend 900?

544
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,379
So poor.

545
00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:45,162
<i>September personal expenses.</i>

546
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,729
<i>All above amounts are fixed.</i>

547
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:49,403
<i>I'm left with 900.</i>

548
00:37:49,403 --> 00:37:51,746
<i>Added onto the 900 from last month,</i>

549
00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:54,162
<i>I have 1,800 in total.</i>

550
00:37:54,162 --> 00:37:59,838
<i>But I can't buy new clothes or makeup</i>

551
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:07,495
<i>because of an idiot Mr. Horseshit.</i>

552
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:10,671
Why is she badmouthing me in her journal?

553
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:16,979
Zhen Tian Group.

554
00:38:16,979 --> 00:38:19,571
I got you.

555
00:38:21,287 --> 00:38:25,987
Z&X stole the show at the annual convention.

556
00:38:26,896 --> 00:38:28,687
If this continues,

557
00:38:28,687 --> 00:38:33,245
they could have a share of the market soon.

558
00:38:33,245 --> 00:38:34,787
Once they are stable,

559
00:38:34,787 --> 00:38:37,146
it will be hard for us to get rid of them.

560
00:38:39,038 --> 00:38:42,354
So I suggest you don't find problems for yourselves.

561
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:43,919
Got it.

562
00:38:46,896 --> 00:38:48,245
Jack.

563
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:51,979
Your department must work with the daily necessities department.

564
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:56,062
We have to increase Yue-Sai's advertisements for the time being,

565
00:38:56,062 --> 00:38:59,229
and also increase the spokesperson's exposure.

566
00:38:59,229 --> 00:39:00,819
We must do this well.

567
00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:02,395
No problem.

568
00:39:02,395 --> 00:39:05,145
We should make some adjustments to our strategies.

569
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:08,996
Z&X is focused on the new generation

570
00:39:08,996 --> 00:39:12,462
while our popular ganoderma vitality series

571
00:39:12,462 --> 00:39:16,437
targets the 25-30 age group.

572
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,229
If we can overwhelm Z&X,

573
00:39:18,229 --> 00:39:23,212
we have to increase the promotion of the snow ear moisturizing series.

574
00:39:23,854 --> 00:39:27,354
This series mainly targets young ladies.

575
00:39:27,354 --> 00:39:32,820
We have to set a price that is within the newer generations' expectations.

576
00:39:33,312 --> 00:39:36,687
Do what you can

577
00:39:36,687 --> 00:39:40,119
to break established patterns of promotion.

578
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:44,504
Hit Z&X's market and get back the shares they have taken.

579
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:47,829
Don't let them have the chance to breathe.

580
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:50,145
Director Yin, I don't understand.

581
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:52,979
They're just a small company.

582
00:39:52,979 --> 00:39:56,045
They're not our competition.

583
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,270
Don't worry about this.

584
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,896
You can count on me.

585
00:40:00,896 --> 00:40:06,395
As long as I'm involved, Z&X will run far away.

586
00:40:06,395 --> 00:40:08,420
Never to return.

587
00:40:09,562 --> 00:40:12,803
I'm glad you have such passion.

588
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:14,896
Go now.

589
00:40:14,896 --> 00:40:16,187
Yes.

590
00:40:19,337 --> 00:40:22,145
Director Yin, don't pull the long face.

591
00:40:22,145 --> 00:40:25,529
It hurts me to see you upset.

592
00:40:26,103 --> 00:40:28,812
I'll have nothing to worry about as long as you guys hit the sales targets.

593
00:40:28,812 --> 00:40:30,100
No problem.

594
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,420
I'll go then.

595
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,646
How much perfume does he have on?

596
00:40:41,646 --> 00:40:43,729
Let's open the window.

597
00:40:44,812 --> 00:40:46,412
That's just how he is.

598
00:40:46,412 --> 00:40:50,312
He's strange, but trustworthy.

599
00:40:50,312 --> 00:40:53,796
Director Yin, I have a question.

600
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:54,812
Go ahead.

601
00:40:54,812 --> 00:40:58,771
Kang Sihan is your brother and the chairman's son.

602
00:40:58,771 --> 00:41:02,454
Will it be alright

603
00:41:02,454 --> 00:41:04,537
for us to knock Z&X down so hard?

604
00:41:04,537 --> 00:41:08,854
The chairman ordered me to take down Z&X.

605
00:41:08,854 --> 00:41:11,170
We just have to do what we can.

606
00:41:11,746 --> 00:41:13,354
As for Kang Sihan,

607
00:41:13,354 --> 00:41:17,019
I have a lot to settle without because he's my brother.

608
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:19,337
Brother.

609
00:41:27,604 --> 00:41:29,495
You never show up when I invite you.

610
00:41:29,495 --> 00:41:32,762
What are you doing here today?

611
00:41:33,912 --> 00:41:36,520
I missed you.

612
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,287
Missed me?

613
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:41,662
Where were you on my birthday?

614
00:41:41,662 --> 00:41:45,145
Where were you when I was robbed earlier this year?

615
00:41:45,145 --> 00:41:48,120
Where were you when I was sick a few days ago?

616
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,938
You missed me?

617
00:41:49,938 --> 00:41:52,637
Brother, why did so many unfortunate things happen to you?

618
00:41:53,896 --> 00:41:55,270
Just tell me.

619
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,195
What do you want?

620
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,012
I actually have a small request.

621
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,887
I want to work here.

622
00:42:06,395 --> 00:42:08,704
You want to work here?

623
00:42:08,704 --> 00:42:10,520
Did the old man ask you to come?

624
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,020
No, I wanted to come.

625
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,604
You all tell me I don't have a real job.

626
00:42:14,604 --> 00:42:18,610
As a member of the Kangs, I also hold responsibility for the company.

627
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:19,896
So...

628
00:42:19,896 --> 00:42:23,471
It's great that you think that way.

629
00:42:24,495 --> 00:42:25,938
But...

630
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:30,020
I have little authority now.

631
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,820
I can't help you grow in your career.

632
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:37,145
How about this?

633
00:42:37,145 --> 00:42:39,395
You can tell the old man yourself.

634
00:42:39,395 --> 00:42:43,520
I think he'll be very happy to hear you want to work at the company.

635
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,345
No way, I can't let him know.

636
00:42:45,345 --> 00:42:48,145
My plans will fall through if I tell him.

637
00:42:48,145 --> 00:42:49,479
What plans?

638
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:51,662
Tell me.

639
00:42:51,662 --> 00:42:53,938
I don't want to go to another department.

640
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:57,729
I want to work as a chef in the kitchen.

641
00:42:57,729 --> 00:42:59,019
Are you kidding me?

642
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:02,845
If even you think it's a joke, Dad will definitely not let me do it.

643
00:43:03,896 --> 00:43:05,479
Brother.

644
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:07,062
Please.

645
00:43:07,062 --> 00:43:08,487
Help me.

646
00:43:08,487 --> 00:43:11,980
You are the best.

647
00:43:12,938 --> 00:43:16,245
I have a feeling you're doing this for love.

648
00:43:16,245 --> 00:43:20,754
Only those in love do such crazy things.

649
00:43:22,145 --> 00:43:24,638
I am not that kind of person.

650
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:28,696
Who is the girl?

651
00:43:30,771 --> 00:43:32,920
You're getting shy?

652
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:35,354
Is she your first love?

653
00:43:35,354 --> 00:43:37,587
No, impossible.

654
00:43:37,587 --> 00:43:40,662
Fine, just keep it a secret.

655
00:43:40,662 --> 00:43:42,103
But let me warn you.

656
00:43:42,103 --> 00:43:45,771
You can like anyone in the office except one girl.

657
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:47,420
Her name is Lan Lan.

658
00:43:48,187 --> 00:43:51,520
Thank you, Brother.

659
00:44:16,379 --> 00:44:19,619
<i>I ran into her on my first day.</i>

660
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:23,012
After you.
