00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,580
<i>[Scarlet Heart 2]</i>

2
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:42,950
<i>[Episode 37]</i>

3
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:54,292
Yin Zheng and I would like to leave this place

4
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:58,183
and open a tea stall in Yunnan.

5
00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:01,409
We won't be involved with Zhen Tian's affairs

6
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:04,610
and will not disturb Sihan.

7
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:09,099
I came here today

8
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:12,167
to try to talk to Sihan.

9
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:17,067
I didn't expect to see you here.

10
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:22,034
Sister.

11
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:28,140
Sihan might listen to you.

12
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:31,509
Can you help us

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,142
talk to him?

14
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:42,299
Don't worry.

15
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:45,883
I will try my best.

16
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:52,050
Thank you.

17
00:02:54,434 --> 00:02:56,259
Your hand.

18
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,142
Your injuries.

19
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:06,467
That...

20
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:11,876
There's some things you don't know about.

21
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:16,083
When Sihan was kidnapped,

22
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,375
he suffered quite a lot.

23
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:23,225
Then after he managed to escape,

24
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:26,418
he totally changed.

25
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,918
He's been having a lot of nightmares.

26
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:32,759
When he wakes up,

27
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:37,209
he would hurt himself.

28
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:42,125
These injuries are nothing

29
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,234
compared to his.

30
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:48,592
Sister.

31
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:56,459
The Gods above are testing me.

32
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:02,918
The one suffering is actually Sihan.

33
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:06,384
He is suffering

34
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,334
from all kinds of torments.

35
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,800
So I hope that you

36
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:15,218
can understand him.

37
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:16,892
Do not blame him.

38
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,926
I will try my best to help you.

39
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,709
Thank you.

40
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:34,250
You don't need to thank me.

41
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:37,167
Actually it's for myself.

42
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:44,083
But I really hope that he can put this behind him.

43
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:56,334
Then...

44
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:02,700
I shall leave now.

45
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:08,242
Let me see you out.

46
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,659
Xiaoxiao.

47
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:19,083
Don't think about it too much.

48
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:22,559
Let fate decide everything.

49
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:27,350
One day, all of this will be over.

50
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:42,709
Take care.

51
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,542
Sister.

52
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:55,434
Sihan is lucky to have you.

53
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:42,084
<i>Goodbye, Sister.</i>

54
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:54,150
Okay, that's all for today.

55
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:59,000
I would like to inform everyone about something.

56
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,584
Recently the company has been checking the accounts.

57
00:07:01,584 --> 00:07:03,542
We found a lot of flaws.

58
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:06,417
So our company's previous executive chairman, Yin Zheng,

59
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:10,140
has been put in prison.

60
00:07:10,818 --> 00:07:12,667
Okay. Thank you.

61
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:15,899
Sihan.

62
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:17,325
Uncle Liu.

63
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,892
Is there some misunderstanding?

64
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:22,834
We have valid proof.

65
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:24,142
There isn't any misunderstanding.

66
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:26,776
I don't mean that, Chairman Kang.

67
00:07:26,776 --> 00:07:30,334
Yin Zheng was the executive chairman of the group.

68
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:33,466
Now we have managed to polish the image of our company,

69
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:36,632
but it's said that our executive chairman made some financial mistakes.

70
00:07:36,632 --> 00:07:41,190
Wouldn't our company be impacted by this incident?

71
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,149
Can we solve this another way?

72
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:47,499
Uncle Liu, he broke the law.

73
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,374
What else can I do?

74
00:07:49,374 --> 00:07:51,574
I can't cover up for him.

75
00:08:09,774 --> 00:08:11,940
Sihan, it's just us now.

76
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,165
Can you tell me what's going on with Yin Zheng?

77
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:18,090
Zhuo Yue, what do you want to know?

78
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,332
I will answer every question.

79
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,039
Although I never liked Yin Zheng either,

80
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,482
but from what I know,

81
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:26,991
he would not abuse his power.

82
00:08:29,065 --> 00:08:31,232
Don't be so subjective.

83
00:08:31,232 --> 00:08:35,082
You don't even know what Yin Zheng had done.

84
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:38,674
Are you still fighting with him?

85
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:40,832
Brother, you're overthinking it.

86
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:43,165
I'm just doing the right thing.

87
00:08:43,832 --> 00:08:45,749
Is there anything else?

88
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:33,999
Are you Yin Zheng?

89
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,182
Yes, I am.

90
00:09:36,182 --> 00:09:37,707
We are from the police station.

91
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:39,274
We came to take Yin Zheng.

92
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:41,132
Please follow us.

93
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:57,758
Can I talk to him?

94
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,799
It's on you.

95
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:18,740
How does it feel?

96
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:21,165
Let me secretly tell you.

97
00:10:21,165 --> 00:10:24,707
This is how I felt when I was in Ganlin.

98
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:29,507
Spend your time inside.

99
00:10:30,082 --> 00:10:34,065
Justice will be on my side because I never did it.

100
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:36,940
Big Brother, this again?

101
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,965
Like I said,

102
00:10:37,965 --> 00:10:41,374
you know what you did.

103
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,015
Let's stop arguing here.

104
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:49,774
Sihan, I watched the disk you gave me.

105
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,315
How did you feel?

106
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:53,315
I've thought about it.

107
00:10:53,315 --> 00:10:55,315
If the wedding incident didn't happen,

108
00:10:55,315 --> 00:10:57,107
you wouldn't have gone to Ganlin,

109
00:10:57,107 --> 00:10:59,240
and you wouldn't have been kidnapped.

110
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:02,232
So it makes sense for you to hate me.

111
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:06,240
I know the feeling of being tortured by hatred.

112
00:11:06,982 --> 00:11:08,965
I knew it better than anyone.

113
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:15,607
If this is what it takes to make you happy,

114
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:17,507
then I'm happy to be here.

115
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:20,732
You have to be careful.

116
00:11:20,732 --> 00:11:24,420
Hold on.

117
00:11:24,982 --> 00:11:28,549
You're calmer than I expected.

118
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:31,299
You are in good shape.

119
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:34,357
You should be crying and apologizing to me.

120
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:36,357
What is wrong with you?

121
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:39,632
If I'm set to suffer from this undeserved catastrophe,

122
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:43,499
then I shall treat it as some kind of redemption.

123
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:46,816
Keep pretending.

124
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:48,566
Pretend to be calm.

125
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:51,524
You can continue pretending.

126
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:52,882
Sihan.

127
00:11:54,082 --> 00:11:56,291
You have lost yourself.

128
00:11:57,524 --> 00:11:59,923
I lost myself?

129
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:04,174
Yes, Yin Zheng, I admit it.

130
00:12:04,174 --> 00:12:06,540
Then in the coming years,

131
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:09,599
it's time for you to lose yourself.

132
00:12:10,232 --> 00:12:11,707
Take care.

133
00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:35,507
When I'm not around,

134
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:38,382
please take care of yourself.

135
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:53,082
When you come back,

136
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:55,015
I will make breakfast for you.

137
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,807
Justice will be on your side

138
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:02,024
if you hadn't done it.

139
00:13:19,357 --> 00:13:21,357
You trust him that much?

140
00:13:21,357 --> 00:13:23,899
You sure that he never did it?

141
00:13:24,691 --> 00:13:26,907
I will never suspect him.

142
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:32,023
Then wait 20 years for him.

143
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:36,299
I'm willing to wait for him for the rest of my life.

144
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,839
<i>I have a baby now.</i>

145
00:13:59,624 --> 00:14:03,432
<i>Sihan, we have a baby now.</i>

146
00:14:06,774 --> 00:14:10,549
<i>Yinuo, you have a baby.</i>

147
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:13,832
<i>You have your own baby.</i>

148
00:14:13,832 --> 00:14:19,057
<i>You will never be alone again.</i>

149
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:25,958
<i>Why?</i>

150
00:14:28,832 --> 00:14:30,940
Sihan, what is it?

151
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,058
Stop disturbing me.

152
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,691
I have only one thought now.

153
00:14:39,691 --> 00:14:42,816
I want to let Yin Zheng suffer.

154
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,374
He's going to jail.

155
00:14:44,374 --> 00:14:46,307
But he's so calm.

156
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:50,107
I don't want anything else.

157
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:52,624
I just want him to admit to what he had done.

158
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:54,816
Admit to his evil practices, and I will let him off.

159
00:14:54,816 --> 00:14:57,165
But he has no reaction.

160
00:14:57,165 --> 00:14:59,232
He has no reaction.

161
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,240
I want him to suffer.

162
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,774
Suffer!

163
00:15:03,774 --> 00:15:05,649
Sihan.

164
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:06,999
I beg you.

165
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:08,399
Please don't be like this.

166
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,940
Don't worry about me. I have a headache.

167
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,832
My head hurts.

168
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:16,382
Yin Zheng!

169
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,923
Sister, are you alright?

170
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,332
Why are you here?

171
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:31,316
You came to plead.

172
00:15:37,123 --> 00:15:38,566
Let's talk outside.

173
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:42,374
Want to go somewhere else? Fine.

174
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:05,016
Are you still the Black Cat Detective that I knew?

175
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,082
Black Cat Detective?

176
00:16:16,732 --> 00:16:19,224
A name that I knew.

177
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:22,524
But he's dead.

178
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,549
He died in that desert far away.

179
00:16:41,315 --> 00:16:43,915
Look into my eyes and tell me.

180
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,732
Seeing Yin Zheng get punished,

181
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:50,682
and separating us.

182
00:16:52,123 --> 00:16:54,291
Is that going to make you happy?

183
00:16:57,315 --> 00:17:01,040
Seeing Yin Zheng get punished won't make me happy.

184
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,107
Separating you two won't make me happy.

185
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:07,724
I just want you to feel the pain I'm suffering.

186
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:14,639
If Xinyi sees you like this now,

187
00:17:16,507 --> 00:17:18,399
what will she think?

188
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,891
Can't you go back to the old you?

189
00:17:30,939 --> 00:17:32,724
ZX.

190
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:39,239
We can never go back.

191
00:17:43,065 --> 00:17:45,439
It's all thanks to you and Yin Zheng

192
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,057
that I have become like this.

193
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:56,716
No.

194
00:17:59,249 --> 00:18:03,190
If you can let go of the hate,

195
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,474
you're still you.

196
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:08,357
I'm asking for pay back.

197
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:10,482
Yin Zheng made so many mistakes.

198
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:12,939
He should be punished.

199
00:18:15,624 --> 00:18:17,357
I beg you.

200
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:20,732
For the Black Cat Detective we knew.

201
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:23,591
Please?

202
00:18:24,374 --> 00:18:25,840
ZX.

203
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:32,339
Do you know why I hate Yin Zheng so much?

204
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:36,607
It's all because of you.

205
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:40,958
When I was kidnapped,

206
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,307
in my most painful moment,

207
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:46,223
you abandoned me.

208
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,107
And you turned to him.

209
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,691
That's why I took revenge on him.

210
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:57,899
But we already broke up.

211
00:18:57,899 --> 00:18:59,415
Stop talking!

212
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:01,149
We were still in love with each other.

213
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:04,039
How could you turn to him in such short time?

214
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,057
Then I apologize to you.

215
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:14,490
But I once was deeply in love with you.

216
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:18,923
I had to let you go

217
00:19:19,674 --> 00:19:21,940
because of Xinyi.

218
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:28,516
I'm sorry.

219
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:32,599
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

220
00:19:33,332 --> 00:19:35,832
I don't need an apology.

221
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:40,916
What do you want me to do

222
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:43,482
for you to leave this behind?

223
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,791
It's very simple.

224
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,107
I have everything now.

225
00:19:47,107 --> 00:19:51,232
I want you, ZX.

226
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,691
You asked me to let Yin Zheng go.

227
00:19:53,691 --> 00:19:55,840
It's not a problem.

228
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:58,040
Leave him

229
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:02,015
and come to me.

230
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,139
Then...

231
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,440
You set Yin Zheng up.

232
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,982
He sacrificed his career for a woman.

233
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:13,749
Now his career is mine.

234
00:20:13,749 --> 00:20:15,607
He's now my pet.

235
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:19,665
I can play with him. I can do whatever I want.

236
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:23,332
What if I don't agree?

237
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,165
The evidence I have in my hands

238
00:20:29,932 --> 00:20:32,140
can get him 20 years.

239
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:36,274
20 years.

240
00:20:36,274 --> 00:20:39,524
Does he have many 20 years?

241
00:20:39,524 --> 00:20:43,590
When he is released, he'll be an old man.

242
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:47,274
It's such a pity.

243
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:51,349
What do you want me to do?

244
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:02,566
Look for yourself.

245
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:05,232
You struggled so much I can't even see your face.

246
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:07,790
How can I trust you?

247
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:12,065
You want me to let Yin Zheng go.

248
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:14,999
Come on.

249
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:28,115
Hug me.

250
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:35,507
Hug me tightly.

251
00:21:38,858 --> 00:21:42,440
Look at the camera and smile.

252
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,923
Show your teeth.

253
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,916
That's right.

254
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,249
Yin Zheng would be very happy to see this photo.

255
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:57,207
I'll be happy too.

256
00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:01,107
Kang Sihan.

257
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,140
I know you love Ma Yinuo now.

258
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,690
This is the last time I'm begging you.

259
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:11,758
Please stop.

260
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:15,816
Please stop hurting Yin Zheng and Ma Yinuo, will you?

261
00:22:15,816 --> 00:22:17,866
Who said I don't love you?

262
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:20,874
When I was kidnapped,

263
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:22,023
when I was in pain,

264
00:22:22,023 --> 00:22:24,440
I had been hoping that you would come to rescue.

265
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,357
But what did I get?

266
00:22:26,357 --> 00:22:29,582
I heard that you and Yin Zheng were together.

267
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:31,290
I don't get it.

268
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,832
Why didn't you think about how you were hurting me at the time?

269
00:22:34,832 --> 00:22:37,099
I was torn by the pain.

270
00:22:38,415 --> 00:22:45,557
♫ <i>I was just like the star that is far apart from you</i> ♫

271
00:22:45,557 --> 00:22:48,999
♫ <i>White clouds always rely on the blue sky</i> ♫

272

276

♫ <i>Who stills remember the confession made in heavy rain? ♫</i>

278
00:23:41,215 --> 00:23:42,866
Yinuo.

279
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:47,923
Tomorrow you can see Yin Zheng suffering.

280
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,740
I've waited so long for this day.

281
00:23:56,123 --> 00:24:03,107
♫ <i>No longer expecting anything from anyone, is this considered freedom?</i> ♫

282
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:10,165

♫ <i>Don't want to wander around in solitude ♫</i>

286
00:24:57,499 --> 00:24:59,374
Give this photo to him,

287
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:00,774
and tell him what I said.

288
00:25:00,774 --> 00:25:04,166
Remember, don't leave out any words.

289
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:18,316
Mr. Yin.

290
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,907
I came to verify the details of the case with you.

291
00:25:23,332 --> 00:25:26,399
Chairman Kang asked me to bring his words.

292
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,907
Regarding the details about the change in Chairman,

293
00:25:31,207 --> 00:25:34,107
I'm going to tell you everything.

294
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,049
<i>Yin Zheng.</i>

295
00:25:39,065 --> 00:25:41,839
<i>What do you feel when you see the photo?</i>

296
00:25:43,607 --> 00:25:46,315
<i>You are trapped inside.</i>

297
00:25:46,315 --> 00:25:49,399
<i>Your woman is in my arms.</i>

298
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:51,358
<i>I look forward to sharing</i>

299
00:25:52,315 --> 00:25:55,982
<i>this kind of feeling with you.</i>

300
00:25:57,607 --> 00:26:01,040
<i>Zhang Xiao was my love.</i>

301
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,082
<i>But you took her away from my life.</i>

302
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:07,416
<i>So you deserved it.</i>

303
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:15,232
<i>You still don't know about our love story?</i>

304
00:26:15,232 --> 00:26:19,566
<i>I'm very interested in sharing with you from the beginning.</i>

305
00:26:19,566 --> 00:26:21,791
<i>I can tell you all the details.</i>

306
00:26:22,732 --> 00:26:27,999
<i>Zhang Xiao and I met at the courtyard houses,</i>

307
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:30,832
<i>then we were online friends for quite some time.</i>

308
00:26:30,832 --> 00:26:32,632
<i>She called me Black Cat Detective.</i>

309
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:36,082
<i>I called her ZX.</i>

310
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,082
<i>We talked about almost everything.</i>

311
00:26:39,082 --> 00:26:41,982
<i>Then we fell in love.</i>

312
00:26:43,466 --> 00:26:45,207
<i>We went to Hong Kong.</i>

313
00:26:46,357 --> 00:26:51,332
<i>We held hands and leaned on each other.</i>

314
00:26:51,332 --> 00:26:55,907
<i>She gave me everything.</i>

315
00:27:18,415 --> 00:27:19,791
What was his reaction?

316
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:21,907
Did he cry?

317
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:28,482
Chairman Kang asked me to tell you

318
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:31,566
that considering Zhang Xiao has betrayed you,

319
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:35,457
he understands the feeling of being betrayed.

320
00:27:35,457 --> 00:27:39,607
As long as you plead guilty,

321
00:27:39,607 --> 00:27:42,090
he will show mercy.

322
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,023
If you want to scold him,

323
00:27:44,023 --> 00:27:45,940
or even scold Zhang Xiao,

324
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,290
he can understand.

325
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,758
If you have anything to say,

326
00:27:50,758 --> 00:27:53,416
I can bring your words to him.

327
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:10,874
Go back and tell Chairman Kang

328
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,682
that by doing this,

329
00:28:16,023 --> 00:28:18,649
he helped me learn more about Zhang Xiao.

330
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:22,482
She's such a kind person.

331
00:28:24,982 --> 00:28:27,190
She will not change her mind easily

332
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:30,840
about who she loves.

333
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,682
The one thing that makes me sad

334
00:28:42,082 --> 00:28:44,566
after seeing this photo,

335
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,732
is that I can't bear to part from her.

336
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:57,858
I know she has her reasons for doing this.

337
00:28:57,858 --> 00:29:00,082
You just wanted to provoke him.

338
00:29:00,082 --> 00:29:03,799
I won't relay your words to him anymore.

339
00:29:18,774 --> 00:29:21,023
Why are you all here?

340
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,999
You set Yin Zheng up.

341
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:28,457
<i>He wanted his woman, not his career.</i>

342
00:29:28,457 --> 00:29:29,774
<i>Now his career is mine.</i>

343
00:29:29,774 --> 00:29:31,123
<i>He's now my pet.</i>

344
00:29:31,123 --> 00:29:32,540
<i>I can play with him.</i>

345
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,999
<i>I can do whatever I want.</i>

346
00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:39,666
Sihan.

347
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,632
Why did you do this?

348
00:29:46,707 --> 00:29:50,816
Xiaoxiao, you set me up.

349
00:29:50,816 --> 00:29:53,599
You have grown up.

350
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,382
I should praise you.

351
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:58,382
Sihan.

352
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,758
The people that stand in front of you

353
00:30:02,374 --> 00:30:04,582
are concerned about you.

354
00:30:04,582 --> 00:30:06,566
Please stop it.

355
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:09,657
Just like what Yin Zheng said,

356
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:13,040
you have lost yourself.

357
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,249
But if this continues,

358
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:17,840
you will let yourself suffer in great pain.

359
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,023
I became like this

360
00:30:21,023 --> 00:30:24,040
all thanks to you and Yin Zheng.

361
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,624
Now we are playing a game.

362
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,816
And I will definitely continue playing with you

363
00:30:28,816 --> 00:30:31,157
until the end of the game.

364
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,599
Second Brother.

365
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:56,274
Chairman Kang.
<i>[Resignation Letter]</i>

366
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:01,257
Uncle Liu, what are you doing?

367
00:31:03,207 --> 00:31:06,707
You have been so supportive since I was young.

368
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:10,423
But now you want to leave when Zhen Tian Group is finally mine?

369
00:31:11,632 --> 00:31:13,365
Yes.

370
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:18,123
I watched Sihan grow up.

371
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:23,699
He's so smart and understanding.

372
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,232
In my point of view,

373
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:32,832
Sihan is the best candidate to inherit Zhen Tian Group.

374
00:31:33,499 --> 00:31:37,816
Seeing him as the chairman of the group,

375
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:41,107
I thought my wish came true.

376
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,791
I can finally help this good boy

377
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:47,874
expand the group's business.

378
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:55,174
But I didn't expect this.

379
00:31:55,174 --> 00:32:00,707
I'm getting old now and my judgement in people is getting worse.

380
00:32:00,707 --> 00:32:06,916
Chairman Kang, please allow an old employee like me

381
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:09,858
to retire now.

382
00:32:16,965 --> 00:32:18,315
Okay.

383
00:32:19,482 --> 00:32:20,999
Uncle Liu.

384
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:25,123
Since you have decided,

385
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:27,199
then I will not persuade you to stay.

386
00:32:28,732 --> 00:32:31,482
Goodbye.

387
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,624
Sihan.

388
00:32:33,624 --> 00:32:36,632
I have one last piece of advice for you.

389
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:42,291
Don't leave no room for yourself.

390
00:32:56,749 --> 00:32:58,357
Zhuo Yue, I'm glad you came.

391
00:32:58,357 --> 00:32:59,332
I'm in a bad mood.

392
00:32:59,332 --> 00:33:01,232
Come, drink with me.

393
00:33:08,349 --> 00:33:09,832
Zhuo Yue.

394
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:11,482
What is wrong with you?

395
00:33:11,482 --> 00:33:12,649
We are brothers now.

396
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:13,791
And you are leaving?

397
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,165
What is the meaning of this?

398
00:33:15,165 --> 00:33:18,232
Don't you understand what Director Liu said just now?

399
00:33:18,232 --> 00:33:22,566
The old Sihan and the Chairman Kang now are not the same person.

400
00:33:22,566 --> 00:33:25,149
My good brother Sihan died in Ganlin.

401
00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:27,165
He has his characteristics, he knows his feelings.

402
00:33:27,165 --> 00:33:29,290
But he would never be like you to get what he wants

403
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,840
without consideration for the consequences.

404
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:48,865
Chairman Kang, we have different paths to take.

405
00:33:49,557 --> 00:33:52,182
Let's just part here.

406
00:34:30,332 --> 00:34:31,816
Siyu, bring the alcohol.

407
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:33,615
Drink with me.

408
00:34:34,874 --> 00:34:36,390
I don't have time.

409
00:34:37,749 --> 00:34:41,123
What is it?

410
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:43,666
They can ignore me but you can't.

411
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:46,040
You know exactly what happened to me.

412
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,858
You know I'm the victim.

413
00:34:47,858 --> 00:34:50,899
It's all Yin Zheng's fault.

414
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:53,107
Yes, you are the victim.

415
00:34:53,107 --> 00:34:54,599
But is that an excuse for you to be aggressive?

416
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:57,515
Is that an excuse for you to force people into a dead end?

417
00:35:01,707 --> 00:35:03,791
What's wrong with the world?

418
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:06,691
Yin Zheng made mistakes, so he should bear the responsibility.

419
00:35:06,691 --> 00:35:07,791
What's wrong with that?

420
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:09,099
You are so stubborn.

421
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:09,916
Let me ask you one last time.

422
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:11,932
Are you going to stop this time?

423
00:35:13,874 --> 00:35:17,140
What if I said no?

424
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:20,540
This is proof that you falsified evidence.

425
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,540
If you insist on blaming Yin Zheng, then I have no choice

426
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,849
but to hand the evidence to the court.

427
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:33,123
You did your homework.

428
00:35:33,123 --> 00:35:36,374
Siyu, if you do this,

429
00:35:36,374 --> 00:35:39,540
you are forcing me to cut off our ties.

430
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,890
Yes.

431
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,640
Because you're not the brother that I knew anymore.

432
00:35:44,165 --> 00:35:47,649
Everyone can go against me.

433
00:35:47,649 --> 00:35:50,007
But I'm not afraid.

434
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:07,691
What are you doing?

435
00:36:12,457 --> 00:36:14,499
I have something to tell you.

436
00:36:15,415 --> 00:36:16,907
Tell me.

437
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:26,190
I'm sure you know what kind of person I am.

438
00:36:26,832 --> 00:36:29,039
When I was Lan Lan,

439
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:32,515
I could make up my mind to get things I wanted.

440
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,524
When I'm Ma Yinuo,

441
00:36:35,524 --> 00:36:39,958
I can make up my mind to sacrifice everything.

442
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:43,357
I'm Lan Lan, I'm Ma Yinuo.

443
00:36:43,357 --> 00:36:46,474
I have my pride and determination.

444
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:52,482
But I can swallow my pride to be your woman.

445
00:36:53,707 --> 00:36:55,915
Or even bear your temper.

446
00:37:01,315 --> 00:37:03,215
Do you know why?

447
00:37:04,566 --> 00:37:07,332
Because I love you.

448
00:37:07,332 --> 00:37:11,207
I believe that once you stop seeking for revenge,

449
00:37:11,832 --> 00:37:14,657
we can start a new life together.

450
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:20,624
But you wanted to take revenge on Yin Zheng

451
00:37:20,624 --> 00:37:23,515
and go back to Zhang Xiao.

452
00:37:24,165 --> 00:37:26,766
Have you thought about my feelings?

453
00:37:33,357 --> 00:37:36,290
You still haven't told me what you want.

454
00:37:38,499 --> 00:37:40,674
You have two choices now.

455
00:37:42,107 --> 00:37:45,466
First, is that I leave

456
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,732
and you can continue with your revenge.

457
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,232
You have nothing to do with me.

458
00:37:50,232 --> 00:37:54,274
Second, is to let Yin Zheng

459
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:56,507
and Zhang Xiao leave.

460
00:37:58,374 --> 00:38:01,032
Then we can continue on with our life.

461
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,724
After all this, are you asking me to free Yin Zheng?

462
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:18,023
Everyone is helping him.

463
00:38:18,023 --> 00:38:20,082
Everyone went against me.

464
00:38:20,082 --> 00:38:22,940
You threatened me with our love.

465
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,249
Who do you think I am?

466
00:38:25,249 --> 00:38:28,399
I crawled back from hell.

467
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:31,432
Do you think I can be threatened?

468
00:38:31,432 --> 00:38:33,282
If you want to leave...

469
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:38,039
Fine!

470
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:47,874
But I must remind you.

471
00:38:47,874 --> 00:38:50,466
If you keep doing this,

472
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:53,716
I will go to the court

473
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,474
and expose everything.

474
00:38:57,874 --> 00:39:01,757
Yin Zheng and Zhang Xiao will still be together.

475
00:39:02,858 --> 00:39:04,340
And you,

476
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:07,532
will live with your hatred for the rest of your life.

477
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,890
Yinuo.

478
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,674
Listen to me, Yinuo.

479
00:39:15,674 --> 00:39:17,499
Hold on.

480
00:39:17,499 --> 00:39:19,340
Yinuo.

481
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,315
Yinuo, listen to me.

482
00:39:23,082 --> 00:39:25,332
I thought about it.

483
00:39:25,332 --> 00:39:28,616
I can't continue fighting Yin Zheng like this.

484
00:39:29,482 --> 00:39:32,557
Zhen Tian Group is mine now.

485
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:35,982
I can let Yin Zheng go.

486
00:39:36,816 --> 00:39:39,749
You can?

487
00:39:39,749 --> 00:39:42,249
Should I trust you?

488
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:43,566
You must trust...

489
00:39:43,566 --> 00:39:45,290
Yinuo, listen to me.

490
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:48,523
Yinuo.

491
00:39:50,482 --> 00:39:52,099
Listen to me.

492
00:39:53,232 --> 00:39:55,982
The kidnapping incident changed my life.

493
00:39:57,107 --> 00:39:58,549
You've seen my situation now.

494
00:39:58,549 --> 00:40:00,440
I have nothing.

495
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,290
You're the only one I have.

496
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,082
If you leave as well, what shall I do?

497
00:40:05,874 --> 00:40:07,249
Yinuo.

498
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:10,624
You can't go.

499
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:18,458
Are you serious?

500
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,007
Come home with me.

501
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,858
We can live the life that you want.

502
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,624
Are you still mad at me?

503
00:41:01,624 --> 00:41:03,499
I have something to tell you.

504
00:41:03,499 --> 00:41:04,907
Tell me.

505
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,939
Forget it.

506
00:41:07,939 --> 00:41:10,216
I'll tell you in a few days.

507
00:41:17,582 --> 00:41:19,749
Don't touch me.

508
00:41:49,566 --> 00:41:52,440
<i>You all betrayed me.</i>

509
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,290
<i>It's okay.</i>

510
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,660
<i>It's okay even if the whole world betrayed me.</i>

511
00:41:58,274 --> 00:42:00,007
<i>Yin Zheng.</i>

512
00:42:00,007 --> 00:42:04,032
<i>I must let you feel the real pain.</i>

513
00:42:04,774 --> 00:42:08,607
<i>I will let those who betrayed me pay the price.</i>

514
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:56,440
<i>[Newborn]</i>

515
00:43:04,399 --> 00:43:05,949
Baby.

516
00:43:06,716 --> 00:43:10,374
If your father holds this bottle,

517
00:43:11,232 --> 00:43:13,174
I bet it would be very funny.

518
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,130
This is suitable.

519
00:43:23,749 --> 00:43:26,257
I think your father will like it.

520
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:40,290
You haven't been sleeping well.

521
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:42,449
Do you want to get some tea?

522
00:43:43,165 --> 00:43:44,691
No.

523
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:46,874
I'm worried about Sihan.

524
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,374
Although he dropped the charges under pressure,

525
00:43:50,374 --> 00:43:53,557
I think he will not give up just like that.

526
00:43:54,082 --> 00:43:58,049
His previous actions showed that it's a kind of illness.

527
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,232
I'm worried that he's ruined.

528
00:44:02,232 --> 00:44:07,107
Sihan didn't let us off willingly this time.

529
00:44:07,107 --> 00:44:09,874
But on a positive note,

530
00:44:09,874 --> 00:44:14,982
he did listen to what Yinuo had to say.

531
00:44:14,982 --> 00:44:20,982
This tolerance shows that love plays a big part in his life, and exceeds his hatred.

532
00:44:21,899 --> 00:44:25,499
So I think as long as Yinuo stays with him,

533
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:29,582
he will wake up to reality one day.

534
00:44:30,123 --> 00:44:31,740
I hope so.

535
00:44:39,749 --> 00:44:41,839
We will be fine.
