3
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:51,145
It's so ugly.

4
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:53,119
I thought you knew how to do it.

5
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,729
It's good.

6
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:56,979
It's what I remember from my childhood.

7
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,104
Don't have such high expectations.

8
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,879
It'll break if you do it like that.

9
00:02:14,062 --> 00:02:15,871
It won't.

10
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:17,854
Just go wash your hands. You're not helping.

11
00:02:17,854 --> 00:02:19,212
Wait.

12
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:21,637
You have something on your face.

13
00:02:22,662 --> 00:02:24,254
Let me wipe it for you.

14
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,237
No one has ever dared to do this to me.

15
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:05,420
You're so petty.

16
00:03:06,495 --> 00:03:07,812
Then don't eat my dumplings.

17
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,479
You wouldn't dare.

18
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,312
Why wouldn't I dare?

19
00:03:13,103 --> 00:03:15,620
If you can't eat my dumplings,

20
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,546
you'll regret it.

21
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:26,604
If you're mad at me,

22
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:28,437
then just leave.

23
00:03:34,604 --> 00:03:37,362
What's this woman made of?

24
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,145
<i>I've never felt this way before.</i>

25
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:57,019
<i>Why do I feel so calm just from a shadow?</i>

26
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:22,645
The dumplings are ready.

27
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:54,912
Sorry.

28
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:56,795
Did I hit you too hard?

29
00:04:57,854 --> 00:04:59,504
Are you okay?

30
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:04,230
Yes.

31
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,604
Even if you're mad at me,

32
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:09,695
you shouldn't have hit me so hard.

33
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:13,387
I was still half asleep.

34
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:22,619
Don't cry.

35
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:31,754
I'm not crying.

36
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,137
I'm just dropping tears.

Reaching the end of the water flow,

42
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,379
I sit and watch the cloud float.

43
00:05:58,812 --> 00:06:00,887
Why did you only write these two sentences?

44
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,371
Does it have some special meaning?

45
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,129
A friend said it to me

46
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:21,396
a long time ago.

47
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:27,579
There is no special meaning.

48
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,003
What kind of friend?

49
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,604
Your boyfriend?

50
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,520
Or the person that you mentioned before?

51
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,537
Yes.

52
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:51,871

00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:56,295

56
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,329
But it's in the past now.

57
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:13,679
I was going to tidy these up.

58
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,079
But I haven't had the time to do so.

59
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,412
You read books on the Qing Dynasty?

60
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:39,371
I just read for fun.

61
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,479
Let's eat dumplings.

62
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:48,329
It won't be good when it gets cold.

63
00:07:57,787 --> 00:07:59,120
Eat.

64
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:19,854
What do you think?

65
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:37,162
What's wrong?

66
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:42,204
Is it bad?

67
00:08:50,287 --> 00:08:51,838
Very delicious.

68
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:01,720
You wouldn't understand.

For me,

00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:12,346
it's not easy

71
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:16,095

Don't try to take it.

82
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:06,203
If you promise to make these for me from now on,

83
00:11:06,203 --> 00:11:08,129
I'll let you have this one.

84
00:11:16,162 --> 00:11:17,546
You eat it.

85
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:21,812
You mean,

86
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:26,204
you won't make dumplings for me ever again?

87
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:34,838
We won't be together.

88
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,587
Is it that hard for you to accept me?

89
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:46,903
That's not the problem.

90
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:52,579
But I don't want to talk about our feelings right now.

91
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:56,437
I'm just asking whether you can accept me or not.

92
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:57,929
You said it before.

93
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:01,996
You won't force me to say anything I don't want to.

94
00:12:01,996 --> 00:12:04,246
When did I say that?

95
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:09,637
I don't remember that at all.

96
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:15,095
I was being presumptuous.

97
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:21,429
I thought you were blunt.

98
00:12:24,312 --> 00:12:26,162
But as you know,

99
00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:31,695
my memory isn't too great.

100
00:12:40,746 --> 00:12:42,337
I'm full.

101
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,012
Have a cup of tea.

102
00:13:22,203 --> 00:13:25,229
Why do you make that face

103
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:27,171
every time you see this ring?

104
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:35,579
Maybe I read about it in a book before.

105
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:40,020
Do you know what the Manchu script on here says?

106
00:13:43,187 --> 00:13:44,754
No.

107
00:13:47,103 --> 00:13:51,619
I wasn't interested in what was written on this ring before.

108
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:55,454
But after I visited you in the hospital that time,

109
00:13:56,454 --> 00:14:01,112
your facial expression was the same as it is now.

110
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:05,171
It's as if you saw a familiar relative.

111
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:11,362
After that, I found out what's written on here.

112
00:14:12,729 --> 00:14:15,571
I was shocked when I found out.

113
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:19,754
If you can't come to my world,

114
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:23,379
then I'll go to your world to find you.

115
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:31,220
I think the original owner of this ring

116
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:36,729
had someone he loved very much.

117
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:45,145
Why are you crying again?

118
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:47,287
You love crying.

119
00:14:47,912 --> 00:14:50,612
You've been crying since the first time I met you.

126
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:29,754
Big Brother, what are you doing here?

127
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,062
Nothing much.

128
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:35,020
I just came to eat dumplings.

129
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,646
Eat dumplings?

130
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,562
I invited him.

131
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:45,120
Brother, delicacies suit you better.

132
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,304
Dumplings aren't for you.

133
00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:49,979
You don't understand me.

134
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:52,545
Only I know what I like.

135
00:15:54,604 --> 00:15:58,787
Yin Zheng, I'll go down with you.

136
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:15,479
Did you hear?

137
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:17,519
She called him Yin Zheng.

138
00:16:24,662 --> 00:16:28,904
I hope you didn't have an unhappy dinner.

139
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:33,771
Their response is very normal.

140
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:36,587
Don't worry, I'm not upset.

141
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:44,612
But this meal closes the distance between us.

142
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:53,845
Can you be my girlfriend?

143
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:58,270
If you're willing to be my girlfriend,

144
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,796
even if all the people in the world dislike me,

145
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:02,803
I wouldn't mind.

146
00:17:05,162 --> 00:17:07,871
Can you stay by my side forever?

147
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,870
It's not appropriate for us to talk about this right now.

148
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:22,245
Is this your punishment for me?

149
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:35,812
The wind is strong. Don't just stand there.

150
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:37,295
Go upstairs.

151
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:53,329
Xiaoxiao.

152
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:56,729
I told you before that Yin Zheng is a very dangerous man.

153
00:17:56,729 --> 00:17:58,720
Why are you still getting close to him?

154
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,154
I can't explain this to you right now.

155
00:18:03,454 --> 00:18:06,720
I know you care about me.

156
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:09,579
But...

157
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:11,287
There's no but.

158
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:13,979
I shouldn't be talking about my brother like this.

159
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:16,896
But you'll have a hard time if you get with him.

160
00:18:18,145 --> 00:18:19,945
Stop it.

161
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:23,054
I want to be alone.

162
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:46,920

163
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,919
<i>His character, his demeanor.</i>

164
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:53,470
<i>It shakes my soul.</i>

165
00:18:54,662 --> 00:19:00,154
<i>But is this the right time for me to be with Yin Zheng?</i>

166
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:02,954
<i>I'm here.</i>

167
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:41,019
See if there's anything valuable.

168
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:42,270
Come.

169
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,579
- What's this?
- Come take a look.

170
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:47,812
Xiao Li, I'll leave this to you.

171
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,087
- Do a good job.
- No problem.

172
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,520
Hello, Zhen Tian Group.

173
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,671
Hello.

174
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:55,520
I want to speak to Kang Zhentian.

175
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,871
Did you make an appointment?

176
00:19:57,871 --> 00:19:59,729
What?

177
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:03,671
Sorry, Chairman doesn't speak to anyone who doesn't have an appointment.

178
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:06,229
What the hell?

179
00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:07,671
Listen.

180
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:09,312
Tell Chairman Kang.

181
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:13,062
His son, Kang Sihan, is with me and injured.

182
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:15,996
Tell him to bring some money to save his son.

183
00:20:15,996 --> 00:20:19,203
Sir, we get hundreds of these calls every day.

184
00:20:19,203 --> 00:20:21,437
They're all trying to talk to the chairman directly.

185
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:22,620
Sorry.

186
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,229
Chairman is very busy.

187
00:20:24,229 --> 00:20:26,270
Shut up!

188
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,120
I'm telling the truth.

189
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,771
You want to see your boss die?

190
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:33,654
Then you'll be happy, right?

191
00:20:35,203 --> 00:20:36,145
Die?

192
00:20:36,145 --> 00:20:38,604
Okay, I'll let him know.

193
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,354
Xiao Zhang, what's the matter?

194
00:20:40,354 --> 00:20:43,796
Director Wang, someone just called to say Vice President Kang got into an accident.

195
00:20:43,796 --> 00:20:44,771
Really?

196
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:46,537
Yes, I'll go inform Chairman.

197
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,479
Wait. Why are you panicking?

198
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:49,940
I'll make a call.

199
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,950
<i>[Kang Sihan]</i>

200
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,920
Hello?

201
00:21:06,454 --> 00:21:08,546
Did Sihan visit you?

202
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:10,103
Yes, he came yesterday.

203
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,679
But I got him to leave the same day.

204
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:16,587
Ask Sihan to come to the phone.

205
00:21:21,187 --> 00:21:23,337
Okay.

206
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,437
Alright, I got it.

207
00:21:25,437 --> 00:21:27,295
You'll come back in a couple of days?

208
00:21:27,295 --> 00:21:30,504
Okay.

209
00:21:31,412 --> 00:21:35,270
Vice President Kang is with clients in Lancheng.

210
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,212
How do you still not know how to filter out these spam calls?

211
00:21:38,212 --> 00:21:39,854
You're a receptionist.

212
00:21:39,854 --> 00:21:43,412
Make sure to stop these kinds of calls when you get them, okay?

213
00:21:43,412 --> 00:21:44,187
Got it.

214
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:45,662
Get back to work.

215
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:21,119
Xiaoxiao.

216
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,238
Xiaoxiao.

217
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,096
Xiaoxiao.

218
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,637
Xiaoxiao.

219
00:22:39,838 --> 00:22:41,971
Xiaoxiao.

220
00:22:44,487 --> 00:22:46,495
Xiaoxiao.

221
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,412
Xiaoxiao.

222
00:22:56,938 --> 00:22:58,629
Drink up.

223
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,362
Let's drink.

224
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:01,879
Cheers.

225
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:04,787
Thank you for your hard work.

226
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:06,187
It's nothing.

227
00:23:06,187 --> 00:23:07,912
Cheers.

228
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:10,270
Come on.

229
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,270
Pass the meat.

230
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,420
Okay.

231
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,896
Pour it up.

232
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:16,979
Don't stop.

233
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,670
Eat some vegetables.

234
00:23:20,746 --> 00:23:21,812
Okay.

235
00:23:21,812 --> 00:23:23,187
Cheers.

236
00:23:23,187 --> 00:23:25,579
Bottoms up.

237
00:23:29,629 --> 00:23:32,238
It was just a dream.

238
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,646
Brother, he woke up.

239
00:23:36,646 --> 00:23:38,720
He's awake?

240
00:23:42,437 --> 00:23:44,245
Vice President Kang woke up.

241
00:23:44,245 --> 00:23:45,920
Do you see?

242
00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:48,854
Are you awake, Vice President Kang?

243
00:23:48,854 --> 00:23:50,229
Let me tell you.

244
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:52,103
Listen up.

245
00:23:52,103 --> 00:23:54,379
Your life doesn't belong to you anymore.

246
00:23:54,379 --> 00:23:56,170
It's mine.

247
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,103
If I want you alive, you stay alive.

248
00:23:59,103 --> 00:24:01,146
If I want you dead,

249
00:24:01,829 --> 00:24:04,329
then you're dead.

250
00:24:04,329 --> 00:24:05,862
Understand?

251
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,719
Are you going to make the call?

252
00:24:11,771 --> 00:24:13,703
Did you hear that?

253
00:24:30,187 --> 00:24:32,604
I wanted to take you to work today.

254
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,045
Get in the car.

255
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,145
Thank you.

256
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,587
But I don't want you to take me to the office.

257
00:24:44,103 --> 00:24:45,587
Why not?

258
00:24:47,162 --> 00:24:49,212
Is this your way of rejecting me?

259
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,219
I think...

260
00:24:53,979 --> 00:24:58,138
This isn't the right time for us to get together.

261
00:25:01,287 --> 00:25:03,170
Let's talk about it in the car.

262
00:25:14,062 --> 00:25:16,195
I can't accept you.

263
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:20,412
It's not because I don't like you.

264
00:25:23,604 --> 00:25:26,712
But because I'm too confused right now.

265
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:30,596
There's too much going on.

266
00:25:33,395 --> 00:25:34,979
Besides,

267
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:39,703
my sister.

268
00:25:43,996 --> 00:25:45,470
Sorry.

269
00:25:48,762 --> 00:25:50,100
It's okay.

270
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,750
You're right.

271
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:57,254
This might not be the right time.

272
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:04,112
But I don't want to miss the right person for me

273
00:26:04,746 --> 00:26:08,246
because of the wrong timing.

274
00:26:13,345 --> 00:26:16,154
No one around us will give us their blessings.

275
00:26:19,387 --> 00:26:21,638
But I still want to tell you.

276
00:26:22,495 --> 00:26:24,212
I like you.

277
00:26:35,103 --> 00:26:37,012
I have to go to work now.

278
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:39,654
Are we still friends?

279
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:47,354
My mom's birthday is in two days.

280
00:26:49,871 --> 00:26:52,545
Can you help me pick out a present for her?

281
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,129
Water.

282
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:20,129
I want water.

283
00:27:54,329 --> 00:27:56,587
You're such a fool.

284
00:27:56,587 --> 00:27:59,562
Why aren't you calling home?

285
00:27:59,562 --> 00:28:04,129
Xiaoxiao, don't worry.

286
00:28:05,203 --> 00:28:08,504
I can find a way out.

287
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,387
I can find a way out.

288
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,854
It's you.

289
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:41,504
All of our jewelry is unique.

290
00:28:41,504 --> 00:28:43,604
You can customize to your liking.

291
00:28:44,537 --> 00:28:46,437
Miss, it looks beautiful on you.

292
00:28:46,437 --> 00:28:48,562
Sir, buy one for your girlfriend.

293
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:50,662
I'm not his girlfriend.

294
00:28:52,287 --> 00:28:53,896
Are you done?

295
00:28:58,454 --> 00:28:59,920
I want to buy this necklace.

296
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,337
Okay.

297
00:29:03,329 --> 00:29:06,520
Please help me make a customized necklace of the same style.

298
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,012
Okay.

299
00:29:17,662 --> 00:29:19,162
I'm very satisfied with the present.

300
00:29:19,162 --> 00:29:21,746
I'll treat you to a meal to show my thanks.

301
00:29:21,746 --> 00:29:23,145
No need.

302
00:29:23,145 --> 00:29:25,045
It's just a favor.

303
00:29:25,704 --> 00:29:27,996
If you don't want to,

304
00:29:27,996 --> 00:29:30,504
then come with me somewhere else.

305
00:29:31,454 --> 00:29:32,979
Where?

306
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,720
You'll know when we get there.

307
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,329
Why did you bring me here?

308
00:29:52,637 --> 00:29:56,062
This museum is quite special for us.

309
00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:00,270
Our fate started here.

310
00:30:04,162 --> 00:30:06,062
I hope you like it.

311
00:30:07,912 --> 00:30:11,587
Thank you, but I can't accept this.

312
00:30:14,162 --> 00:30:16,871
I knew you would say that.

313
00:30:16,871 --> 00:30:19,920
But can you decide after I finish what I have to say?

314
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,338
Can you draw a clear distinction

315
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:30,679
between me and Lan Lan?

316
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:40,887
I used to not believe in fate.

317
00:30:42,537 --> 00:30:44,712
But after I met Lan Lan,

318
00:30:45,287 --> 00:30:47,379
I changed my way of thinking.

319
00:30:48,704 --> 00:30:51,112
When I first met Lan Lan,

320
00:30:52,746 --> 00:30:57,662
I thought she was the girl I met at the museum.

321
00:30:57,662 --> 00:30:59,979
But that day when you asked me,

322
00:31:01,312 --> 00:31:03,745
"Are you the person I know?"

323
00:31:05,979 --> 00:31:07,646
I then realized

324
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,212
that I mistook Lan Lan for you.

325
00:31:19,412 --> 00:31:22,887
After, you got into your accident at the studio and ended up in the hospital.

326
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,787
When I visited you in the hospital,

327
00:31:26,787 --> 00:31:28,738
you held onto my hand.

328
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:34,079
Although I was surprised by your actions,

329
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:38,154
I had a strange feeling in that moment.

330
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,637
I knew there were subtle changes in my heart.

331
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:49,512
At first, I thought you were the old man's spy.

332
00:31:50,203 --> 00:31:52,350
So I was always wary of you.

333
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,287
I kept reminding myself

334
00:31:55,287 --> 00:31:57,412
to stay away from you.

335
00:31:59,871 --> 00:32:01,787
But for some reason,

336
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:06,654
I wanted to mess with you and get you in trouble.

337
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:11,646
I still can't explain it even now.

338
00:32:13,537 --> 00:32:18,103
It's like you left a shadow in the corner of my heart.

339
00:32:23,954 --> 00:32:27,230
From the moment we met,

340
00:32:27,871 --> 00:32:30,054
we've been walking down a winding road.

341
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:34,019
But now,

342
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:38,587
I'm sure you're my last partner.

343
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:46,396
Is this considered fate?

344
00:32:48,245 --> 00:32:50,162
I don't know

345
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:54,954
if you still miss that person you can't forget.

346
00:32:54,954 --> 00:32:56,887
But I want to say,

347
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,603
I love you.

348
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:12,204
If you mistake me for him,

349
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,962
then take me as him.

350
00:33:23,938 --> 00:33:29,029
<i>Can I really fall in love with him?</i>

351
00:33:33,854 --> 00:33:35,537
Don't cry.

352
00:33:38,912 --> 00:33:40,679
I don't want to force you.

353
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:47,479
It's very tiring to be tangled in your emotions.

354
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,596
I brought you here today

355
00:33:55,829 --> 00:33:58,687
to let you know how I feel about you.

356
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:04,129
I know I'm not perfect.

357
00:34:07,454 --> 00:34:09,512
If you decide to be with me,

358
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:12,337
you might have a tough time.

359
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:18,095
But I will protect you

360
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:22,129
and love you the way I know.

361
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,871
If you want to stay away from me,

362
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,919
you can go.

363
00:34:56,537 --> 00:34:58,987
While I can't you,

364
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,604
go.

365

♫ <i>Happiness is always one step away from being lonely</i> ♫

♫ <i>Our footsteps eventually reached the road of no return</i> ♫

370
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:44,370
♫ <i>We eventually lost our way</i> ♫

371
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:49,537
♫ <i>I don't care if we suffer on this road together</i> ♫

372
00:35:49,537 --> 00:35:52,746
♫ <i>At least I can embrace your warmth</i> ♫

375
00:35:58,395 --> 00:36:02,287
♫ <i>I don't care how much suffering I go through</i> ♫

376
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:05,520
♫ <i>I'm satisfied with our journey</i> ♫

377
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:12,062
♫ <i>At least you have my blessing</i> ♫

378
00:36:12,062 --> 00:36:15,245
♫ <i>I refuse to accept, uncertainties don't count</i> ♫

379
00:36:15,245 --> 00:36:17,254
If you don't go now,

380
00:36:18,771 --> 00:36:20,962
I won't let you go again.

381
00:36:25,245 --> 00:36:27,119
Without my command,

382
00:36:28,162 --> 00:36:30,354
I won't allow you to leave me.

383
00:36:32,203 --> 00:36:35,537
♫ <i>At least I can embrace your warmth</i> ♫

384
00:36:35,537 --> 00:36:38,287
♫ <i>Even if it means being exiled</i> ♫

385
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:41,103
♫ <i>Even if we're one step away from happiness</i> ♫

386
00:36:41,103 --> 00:36:43,270
♫ <i>I don't care how much suffering I go through</i> ♫

387
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,587
We won't be apart anymore.

388
00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:48,979
If you run away from me,

389
00:36:48,979 --> 00:36:50,919
I will get you back.

390
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,696
As long as you're still in this world,

391
00:36:57,954 --> 00:37:00,829
you're always in my view.

392
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:31,662
Where is he?

393
00:41:33,512 --> 00:41:35,162
What happened?

394
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,746
Where is he?

395
00:41:39,454 --> 00:41:40,796
He ran away.

396
00:41:44,812 --> 00:41:46,710
Go after him.

397
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,810
Go.

398
00:41:57,854 --> 00:42:02,438
Brother, he ran!

399
00:42:14,896 --> 00:42:16,712
Where did he go?

400
00:42:16,712 --> 00:42:18,045
Over there!

401
00:42:18,045 --> 00:42:21,870
Go!

402
00:42:26,003 --> 00:42:27,950
That way!

403
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,187
Go!

404
00:42:29,187 --> 00:42:30,670
Don't run!

405
00:42:37,062 --> 00:42:38,580
Stop right there!

406
00:42:41,354 --> 00:42:43,537
Stop running.

407
00:42:43,537 --> 00:42:45,879
Where are you trying to go?

408
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:50,520
Trying to run?

409
00:42:52,896 --> 00:42:54,245
Trying to run?
