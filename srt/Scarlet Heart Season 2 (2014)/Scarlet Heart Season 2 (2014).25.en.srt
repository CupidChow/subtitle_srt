<i>[Episode 25]</i>

3
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:50,771
Friends.

4
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:54,120
Let's revisit the happy moments

5
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,562
from the moment this couple met

6
00:01:56,562 --> 00:01:59,596
to the moments they fell in love.

7
00:03:00,162 --> 00:03:01,562
Xinyi.

8
00:03:01,562 --> 00:03:04,312
Xinyi!

9
00:03:04,312 --> 00:03:05,354
This...

10
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:06,687
Princess.

11
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,637
Why did this happen?

12
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:17,862
Xinyi.

13
00:03:18,787 --> 00:03:21,512
Xinyi. Move! Xinyi!

14
00:03:22,312 --> 00:03:24,120
Xinyi.

15
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,720
Princess.

16
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:29,345
Princess!

17
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:32,570
Xinyi!

18
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,879
- Princess!
- Xinyi!

19
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:39,871
Xinyi!

20
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,287
Princess!

21
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:44,962
Watch out!

22
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:46,662
Xinyi.

23
00:03:46,662 --> 00:03:49,187
Let me explain. It's not what you think.

24
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:53,420
Xinyi.

25
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,646
Let me explain, okay?

26
00:03:58,954 --> 00:04:00,837
Xinyi!

27
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,403
Xinyi!

28
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:18,646
Xinyi.

29
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:21,354
Call an ambulance!

30
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:24,495
- She's in danger.
- Xinyi!

31
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:26,103
Call an ambulance.

32
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:27,854
Ambulance!

33
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:40,662
Hurry, start the car.

34
00:05:08,103 --> 00:05:12,170
Chairman Kang, please go home.

35
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,545
I don't want to see some of you here.

36
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:21,087
We will go back after Xinyi wakes up.

37
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:25,679
Even if she wakes up, she's won't want to see your family.

38
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,896
Please go home.

39
00:05:27,896 --> 00:05:30,620
Director Meng, we are responsible for this.

40
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,862
But I believe that Sihan and Zhang Xiao are innocent.

41
00:05:35,454 --> 00:05:38,245
Xinyi is lying inside.

42
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:41,562
And you're telling me who's innocent?

43
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:44,019
I don't want to argue with you.

44
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:46,020
Please go home.

45
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:51,687
Please go home!

46
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,537
Let's go.

47
00:06:04,537 --> 00:06:07,412
Brother, leave with us.

48
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:11,787
I want to wait for Xinyi.

49
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:27,562
Director Meng.

50
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:29,812
We'll leave then.

51
00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:32,162
Don't get too worried.

52
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:35,245
We just want to let you know

53
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:39,612
that we already see Xinyi as our daughter.

54
00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:46,746
Let's go.

55
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:57,037
Come on, let's go home first.

56
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,079
Xiaoxiao.

57
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,270
Let's go home to wait for updates.

58
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:11,787
Let's go.

59
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:27,087
You all go first.

60
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:30,212
I must stay here.

61
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:34,412
I can only feel at ease

62
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,254
when I see Xinyi is alright.

63
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:39,787
Let me stay here, please.

64
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,412
Siyu.

65
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:46,829
Take the old man and mom back home first.

66
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:49,546
I'll stay here.

67
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:51,019
Alright.

68
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:52,620
You should go help.

69
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:19,329
I told you to go.

70
00:08:19,954 --> 00:08:21,979
Why are you still here?

71
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:25,120
Don't you understand?

72
00:08:27,345 --> 00:08:29,112
Answer me!

73
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:37,020
Let me wait for her.

74
00:08:38,454 --> 00:08:40,537
I beg you.

75
00:08:40,537 --> 00:08:41,979
What for?

76
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,019
What do you want to prove?

77
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:47,145
To prove that you still care about Xinyi?

78
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:50,738
If you really cared about her, why did you do that?

79
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,520
Even if she wakes up, she wouldn't want to see you.

80
00:08:56,854 --> 00:09:00,137
I know it is meaningless to explain anything now.

81
00:09:01,495 --> 00:09:03,096
I'm sorry.

82
00:09:05,354 --> 00:09:07,962
I'm really sorry.

83
00:09:07,962 --> 00:09:10,820
- What is being sorry going to do?
- I'm sorry!

84
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,979
You have no right to be here.

85
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:18,003
Go away.

86
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,087
I want to wait for Xinyi to come out.

87
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,520
Let me wait for her.

88
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,104
Keep kneeling. Keep kneeling just like that.

89
00:09:34,912 --> 00:09:40,250
If anything happens to Xinyi,

90
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:43,479
I don't want to be alive either.

91
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,812
Doctor.

92
00:09:50,812 --> 00:09:52,437
Are you Meng Xinyi's family members?

93
00:09:52,437 --> 00:09:53,920
Yes, I am.

94
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:59,671
Doctor, please don't say it.

95
00:10:00,537 --> 00:10:02,612
Please don't say anything.

96
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:03,504
Got it?

97
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:04,754
Don't say anything.

98
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:06,395
I'm sorry.

99
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:09,020
We tried our best.

100
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,071
I'm really sorry.

101
00:10:26,437 --> 00:10:28,996
Xinyi!

102
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:31,571
Xinyi.

103
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:51,796
Baby...

104
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:57,820
My darling...

105
00:11:04,754 --> 00:11:07,220
Xinyi.

106
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,312
Don't touch her.

107
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:14,937
Princess.

108
00:11:16,554 --> 00:11:18,829
I said don't touch her!

109
00:11:22,287 --> 00:11:24,412
She's dead.

110
00:11:24,412 --> 00:11:27,438
You still won't leave her alone?

111
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:33,354
She's my only daughter.

112
00:11:34,162 --> 00:11:36,537
She's my life.

113
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:40,029
My everything.

114
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,379
I'm sorry.

115
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:46,012
Give her back to me.

116
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:48,395
Give her back to me!

117
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:56,103
Baby...

118
00:11:56,103 --> 00:11:58,854
Baby, Mom will bring you home.

119
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:00,854
Okay, baby?

120
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,854
Mom cannot live without you.

121
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:05,504
Mom cannot live without you!

122
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,479
Please don't take her away.

123
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,412
Dont take her away.

124
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:13,312
Xinyi!

125
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:20,246
Doctor!

126
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:32,479
Let me take you home.

127
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:40,546
I need to answer a call.

128
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,470
Second Uncle.

129
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:05,629
Where are you going?

130
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:10,412
I want to buy champagne.

131
00:14:10,412 --> 00:14:11,920
Why?

132
00:14:12,771 --> 00:14:14,903
I want to buy champagne.

133
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:18,771
Let me help you.

134
00:14:18,771 --> 00:14:21,020
You just go into the car and get some rest.

135
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,496
Okay?

136
00:14:29,437 --> 00:14:30,871
Promise to stay in the car.

137
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:33,120
Don't go anywhere.

138
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,820
I will come back soon.

139
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,212
Hurry!

140
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:22,212
Princess, why you are running so fast?

141
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:25,504
I am tired. Let's get some rest.

142
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,162
Piggy, let's have a bet.

143
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,687
Who reaches there first will get married first.

144
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:36,604
Princess, you're so eager to get married.

145
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:38,329
You don't understand the situation now.

146
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:40,412
Now the millennials are trying to get a share of the market too.

147
00:15:40,412 --> 00:15:43,020
If you don't hurry it up, you might have to go to the Mountain of Flower and Fruits.

148
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,312
Being The Monkey King isn't so bad.

149
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:46,646
I can fight the White Bone Demon,

150
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,270
I can mess with the Tang Monk,

151
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,129
and visit various deities to get some free meals.

152
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:52,087
Life would be so easy!

153
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,820
Do you want to bet or not?

154
00:15:56,454 --> 00:15:58,290
Okay, okay.

155
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,203
The countdown starts now.

156
00:16:00,203 --> 00:16:03,879
One, two, three, go!

157
00:16:09,787 --> 00:16:12,754
Piggy, why didn't you run?

158
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:18,319
I want to let you get married first.

159
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,562
See how nice I am to you.

160
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:24,504
I want to let you get married first.

161
00:16:24,504 --> 00:16:27,103
See how nice I am to you.

162
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:29,512
Alright, let's make a deal then.

163
00:16:29,512 --> 00:16:30,971
When I get married,

164
00:16:30,971 --> 00:16:32,437
I want you to be my bridesmaid.

165
00:16:32,437 --> 00:16:36,229
Definitely.

166

167
00:16:39,646 --> 00:16:43,220
♫ <i>Only then can I see the faint existence of you</i> ♫

176
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,170
I bought you the champagne you wanted.

177
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,562
Princess.

178
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:55,062
This is my promise to you.

179
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:59,787
To give you a wedding with champagne rain.

180
00:19:09,704 --> 00:19:11,829
Xinyi already passed away.

181
00:19:12,387 --> 00:19:13,903
Do you understand?

182
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,838
Passed away?

183
00:19:19,203 --> 00:19:20,979
No way.

184
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:27,395
She passed away this afternoon in the hospital.

185
00:19:29,637 --> 00:19:32,570
Her life came to an end.

186
00:19:34,054 --> 00:19:36,096
But we are still alive.

187
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,504
We still need to continue with our lives, don't we?

188
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,579

192

<i>Xinyi!</i>

371
00:37:00,812 --> 00:37:04,170
<i>Xinyi!</i>

372
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,219
Xinyi.

373
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:24,962
Everything I owe you in this life,

374
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:28,504
I'll pay you back in my next life.

375
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,712
Yin Zheng.

376
00:38:45,437 --> 00:38:46,887
You slept all day.

377
00:38:46,887 --> 00:38:48,529
Are you feeling better now?

378
00:38:51,303 --> 00:38:53,479
I slept for the entire day?

379
00:38:56,529 --> 00:38:58,329
You got wet from the rain last night.

380
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:00,287
You had a fever.

381
00:39:00,287 --> 00:39:01,754
Have a seat.

382
00:39:25,762 --> 00:39:28,512
<i>The Yin Zheng in front of me.</i>

383
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:31,229
<i>Is he the Fourth Prince I know?</i>

384
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:35,103
<i>His eye contact and simple conversation.</i>

385
00:39:35,103 --> 00:39:37,520
<i>It touched my heart.</i>

386
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:43,554
He... He...

387
00:40:01,887 --> 00:40:05,195
What's wrong? You're scared to eat?

388
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,887
Then eat it while it's still warm.

389
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:19,045
Why are you doing this?

390
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,903
Why do you think I'm doing this?

391
00:40:32,162 --> 00:40:36,119
I have no appetite. I have to go now.

392
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:37,437
Wait.

393
00:40:39,154 --> 00:40:40,929
Finish the porridge before you go.

394
00:40:41,887 --> 00:40:43,919
The door is still locked.

395
00:40:52,038 --> 00:40:54,319
Your fever is just getting better.

396
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,637
Have some porridge to keep your stomach warm.

397
00:40:57,387 --> 00:40:59,619
You can't have an empty stomach.

398
00:41:09,604 --> 00:41:12,229
Are you Yin Zheng?

399
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:16,662
Or are you the person I know?

400
00:41:17,787 --> 00:41:19,812
It's so strange for you to say that.

401

♫ <i>Light comes after dark</i>♫

402

403

404

00:41:41,929 --> 00:41:43,880
<i>You recognize me.</i>

406
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:46,580
<i>I thought...</i>

407
00:41:47,646 --> 00:41:50,180
<i>You were the person I know.</i>

408
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:52,771
I remember now.

409
00:42:01,537 --> 00:42:05,887
You were the one at the museum, right?

410
00:42:12,787 --> 00:42:14,919
I always thought it was Lan Lan.

411
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,796
It's you.

Look at me.

416
00:43:02,245 --> 00:43:04,712
You said I looked like someone you know.

417
00:43:05,938 --> 00:43:07,929
Can you tell me who he is?

418
00:43:11,395 --> 00:43:14,954

It's okay if you don't want to tell me.

422
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:29,395
I won't force you.

423
00:43:34,096 --> 00:43:36,846
But you have to listen to me right now.

424
00:43:36,846 --> 00:43:39,579
Finish the porridge.

425
00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:41,454
Then I'll let you leave.

426
00:43:42,779 --> 00:43:44,095
Okay?
