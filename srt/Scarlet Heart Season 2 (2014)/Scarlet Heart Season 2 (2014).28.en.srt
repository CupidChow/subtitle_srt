3
00:01:50,312 --> 00:01:53,287
Miss Zhang, our Madam would like to see you.

4
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:56,096
Your Madam? Which Madam?

5
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:12,262
Auntie, about Xinyi...

6
00:02:20,938 --> 00:02:24,920
It's in the past. Don't talk about it again.

7
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,887
She is no longer here.

8
00:02:28,537 --> 00:02:31,562
You are Xinyi's best friend.

9
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:35,787
You know her biggest dream in life

10
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:38,337
is to organize a personal art exhibition.

11
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:42,012
I am now helping her make her dream come true.

12
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:44,370
During the exhibition ceremony,

13
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,019
I hope you can bring your friends

14
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,504
along for a visit.

15
00:02:50,787 --> 00:02:53,145
I think XinYi will feel very happy in heaven

16
00:02:53,145 --> 00:02:56,670
if she knew that you were coming to her exhibition.

17
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,546
She will definitely be glad to see that.

18
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:15,746
Auntie.

19
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,871
I'll definitely be there.

20
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:21,846
Hope to

21
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:25,462
see you and your friends on that day.

22
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:29,470
Auntie.

23
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,919
Please take care yourself.

24
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,370
Start the car.

25
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:13,203
I've asked my Second Uncle in Bangkok, Thailand

26
00:04:13,203 --> 00:04:15,829
to help investigate this Revenge Company.

27
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:19,787
He says that he doesn't know about this company.

28
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:21,437
Therefore,

29
00:04:21,437 --> 00:04:24,787
I suspect that the company being registered in Thailand is just a cover.

30
00:04:24,787 --> 00:04:27,787
I also investigated their latest cash flow.

31
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:29,537
It's just as I expected.

32
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:31,479
Chairman, take a look.

33
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,229
These few transactions flow into the country.

34
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:36,579
It's just the exact locations that are still unclear.

35
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,637
I suspect that their registration in Thailand is just to divert our focus.

36
00:04:41,637 --> 00:04:44,662
The actual leader of this shell company

37
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:46,587
should be around us.

38
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,537
What do you plan to do next?

39
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:53,019
I'll go to the Industrial and Commercial Tax Department to check.

40
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:55,038
And see the trend of the cash flows.

41
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:56,520
But I still need a little bit more time.

42
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,120
Okay, please get it done soon.

43
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,270
Yes.

44
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,437
Meng Xinyi's mother has a subsidiary which is a capital management company.

45
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:10,829
They're specialized in providing financing services to many firms.

46
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:14,812
If we could obtain capital turnover from them,

47
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:19,020
we don't need to keep selling our shares to get liquid cash.

48
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,329
Our company can be revived if so.

49
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:25,412
In other words,

50
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:27,787
we don't need to beware of those small companies to get liquid cash.

51
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:29,695
Chairman.

52
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:34,404
The pain of losing a daughter is not easy to forget.

53
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,612
After Sihan comes back,

54
00:05:38,612 --> 00:05:43,562
let's find an opportunity to meet with Mrs. Meng to explain and apologize to her sincerely.

55
00:05:43,562 --> 00:05:47,104
Perhaps, there's still room to make amends.

56
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:51,671
It'll just take time that we don't necessarily have.

57
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:57,020
This was sent by Mrs. Meng today.

58
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,320
She's organizing an art exhibition for her daughter?

59
00:06:06,662 --> 00:06:09,896
Since she is willing to organize an exhibition for her daughter,

60
00:06:09,896 --> 00:06:14,229
and invites us to the opening ceremony,

61
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:19,120
this shows that she's already forgiven us.

62
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,812
I hope that through this exhibition,

63
00:06:21,812 --> 00:06:24,087
we can resolve our misunderstandings.

64
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:27,120
Of course, if Sihan is able to rush back

65
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,979
and get on her good side,

66
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,471
we can be more confident in getting the financing.

67
00:06:40,871 --> 00:06:44,637
Secretary Hou, please check Sihan's traveling schedule.

68
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:45,787
I want to contact him.

69
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,029
Yes.

70
00:06:57,787 --> 00:06:59,420
<i>What are you doing?</i>

71
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:12,996
Xiaoxiao, what are you looking at?

72
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:14,254
Nothing.

73
00:07:14,254 --> 00:07:16,495
Nothing?

74
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:19,120
It must be something. You are smiling so sweetly.

75
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,662
Your facial expression shows you're in a relationship.

76
00:07:22,662 --> 00:07:26,279
Tell me. Are you back together with Vice President Kang?

77
00:07:27,871 --> 00:07:29,429
Xiaohe.

78
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:32,345
We can never be together again.

79
00:07:32,345 --> 00:07:34,562
Don't say that again.

80
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:37,545
You can never be together again?

81
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,687
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:46,604
How can I think you would be dating again during these times?

83
00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:50,162
You just experienced a tremendous change with Vice President Kang.

84
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:56,612
You would be so heartless to start another relationship at this time.

85
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:01,945
I'll go make a cup of coffee.

86
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:10,237
Make coffee? Something's up.

87
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:16,796
Okay, I got it.

88
00:08:19,803 --> 00:08:22,203
Chairman.

89
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:23,729
Okay, I'll check it out immediately.

90
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:26,487
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Please sign here.

91
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,720
Zhang Xiao.

92
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,119
Chairman just assigned me an important task.

93
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:36,062
Can you please pick out his packages and take it to his office?

94
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:38,229
- Sure.
- Thank you.

95
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,829
Director Wang, you have a package.

96
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:46,379
Let me see.

97
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:48,245
Director Wang, your package.

98
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:50,462
This is another package for Chairman.

99
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:53,260
Thank you, Director Wang.

101
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:18,912

102

Xiaoxiao.

103
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,203
Uncle Wang.

104
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:34,354
Okay, I'm coming over now.

105
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,062
- I'm sorry.
- How can you be so careless?

106
00:09:37,062 --> 00:09:38,520
I'm sorry.

107
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,979
Hurry up.

108
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,879
Help her tidy up.

109
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,287
Thank you, Director Wang.

110
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:07,303
<i>Call us back within three days of the package being sent out.</i>

111
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:11,229
<i>Or else, you will receive your Vice President's dead body very soon.</i>

112
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:21,495
<i>Come on! Scream for help!</i>

113
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,112
<i>Scream! Say something!</i>

114
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:29,037
<i>Vice President Kang, you don't want to live anymore?</i>

115
00:10:29,646 --> 00:10:31,003
<i>Come on! Scream!</i>

116
00:10:31,003 --> 00:10:34,503
<i>Scream for help.</i>

117
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:36,370
<i>Weren't you acting all bossy just now?</i>

118
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:50,087
Today is the third day.

119
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:06,470
Chairman, I got into contact with the factory in Ganlin.

120
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,170
They said Sihan left a few days ago.

121
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,787
A few days ago?

122
00:11:10,787 --> 00:11:12,495
Where did he go?

123
00:11:12,495 --> 00:11:14,046
Chairman.

124
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:16,329
Chairman.

125
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:18,546
Are you asking about Sihan?

126
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:21,019
He was just on the phone with me.

127
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:22,203
He called you?

128
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:23,146
Yes.

129
00:11:23,146 --> 00:11:27,495
He asked me about the details for our contract with the supplier in Lancheng.

130
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:28,495
Here's the situation.

131
00:11:28,495 --> 00:11:31,019
The supplier doesn't want to deliver the products on time.

132
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,454
Sihan is handling this now.

133
00:11:33,454 --> 00:11:35,646
Then why is his phone switched off?

134
00:11:35,646 --> 00:11:36,370
Yes.

135
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,687
I wanted to talk to him for longer.

136
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:39,579
But I could tell he wasn't in a good mood.

137
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:41,445
He didn't want to say much.

138
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,145
As you know, the wedding was a mess.

139
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:48,245
It's understandable that he's in a bad mood.

140
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:51,300
I think his trip is for work first and foremost,

141
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,345
but secondly, he might just want to be in a new environment for a few days.

142
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:56,996
To get some fresh air and relax.

143
00:11:58,662 --> 00:12:02,537
I should understand how he feels.

144
00:12:02,537 --> 00:12:04,162
I should give him some more space.

145
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:05,654
Yes.

146
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:21,454
<i>Wait for me in the parking lot.</i>

147
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:23,346
<i>Let's have lunch together.</i>

148
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,038
Xiaoxiao, don't leave.

149
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:33,812
Let's go enjoy our welfare together.

150
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:35,646
What welfare?

151
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:37,912
Unbelievable. You have been here for so long.

152
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:40,179
Don't you know there is a welfare day?

153
00:12:44,812 --> 00:12:47,203
I'll tell you. Director Yin-

154
00:12:47,203 --> 00:12:49,019
No, Supervisor Yin.

155
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,312
He comes to the staff canteen for lunch every week at this time.

156
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:55,103
This is the best and most reliable opportunity

157
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:59,354
for grass roots like us to see him in person.

158
00:12:59,354 --> 00:13:01,938
Perhaps he's in a good mood today

159
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:04,854
and we can see a smile on his face.

160
00:13:04,854 --> 00:13:06,262
How unfortunate.

161
00:13:06,262 --> 00:13:07,679
My friend is here.

162
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,103
I'm getting lunch with him.

163
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:11,812
I can't get lunch with you.

164
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:20,437
Her friend is definitely a guy.

165
00:13:20,437 --> 00:13:21,871
Here's your order.

166
00:13:21,871 --> 00:13:23,245
Thank you.

167
00:13:30,096 --> 00:13:33,287
I forgot to ask.

168
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:36,812
What was your attitude in the office today?

169
00:13:39,495 --> 00:13:41,362
I personally think,

170
00:13:42,996 --> 00:13:45,120
at least in the office,

171
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,871
we should keep things the way they are.

172
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,720
Otherwise it's not a good look.

173
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,112
You want to keep this underground?

174
00:13:56,262 --> 00:13:59,395
I don't think we need to care what others think.

175
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:02,537
I wish for us to show that we're together

176
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:04,587
anytime, anywhere.

177
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:14,940
Hello?

178
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,437
Such a bad luck. Supervisor Yin did not turn up today

179
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:22,604
I couldn't even enjoy my welfare for this week.

180
00:14:22,604 --> 00:14:25,787
If I had known about this earlier, I would've gotten lunch with you.

181
00:14:25,787 --> 00:14:28,270
There's still next week.

182
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,329
I remember Supervisor Yin only broke his routine

183
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,545
when he was dating Lan Lan.

184
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,354
Do you think he's already dating someone?

185
00:14:41,354 --> 00:14:43,695
You're overthinking it.

186
00:14:43,695 --> 00:14:46,954
He will turn out in front of you sooner or later.

187
00:14:48,062 --> 00:14:50,212
What happened to your voice?

188
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:55,020
Are you really on a date?

189
00:14:55,787 --> 00:14:58,579
No, it's just a personal matter.

190
00:14:58,579 --> 00:14:59,854
No.

191
00:14:59,854 --> 00:15:01,938
I can smell the male scent

192
00:15:01,938 --> 00:15:04,971
all the way from across this phone line.

193
00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:08,938
Your friend is a handsome guy, right?

194
00:15:08,938 --> 00:15:11,520
As handsome as Supervisor Yin?

195
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,537
What did you say? I can't hear you.

196
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:16,062
Bye.

197
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:20,296
Xiaoxiao, this...

198
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:24,012
Are you planning on doing this forever?

199
00:15:25,487 --> 00:15:29,137
What did you say? I can't hear you.

200
00:15:41,912 --> 00:15:45,612
Xinyi's mom gave me this this morning.

201
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:48,370
I think

202
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,546
she already forgave me.

203
00:15:51,954 --> 00:15:54,412
She organized an art exhibition for Xinyi.

204
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,603
She asked me to bring my friends.

205
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:00,829
When that time comes...

206
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:02,662
We'll talk about it later.

207
00:16:04,345 --> 00:16:05,796
Let's have our meal first.

208
00:16:08,038 --> 00:16:09,812
Come on.

209
00:16:09,812 --> 00:16:11,196
It's been three days already.

210
00:16:11,196 --> 00:16:14,038
His father still hasn't called us.

211
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:17,379
Seems like they don't want to pay up.

212
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,019
Hello?

213
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:42,912
Say something.

214
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:44,479
Are you from the Kang family?

215
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:46,100
Listen.

216
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,380
Hello?

217
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,729
Hello?

218
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:51,820
Kang Sihan.

219
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,538
Your life better end there.

220
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:01,479
What's wrong with your family?

221
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,087
They hang up just like that?

222
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:07,262
<i>No way.</i>

223
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,629
<i>My dad wont abandon me again.</i>

224
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,170
I am extremely angry.

225
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,420
Beat him!

226
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,003
Stop.

227
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:23,219
Forget about that.

228
00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:30,495
The video tape was sent three days ago.

229
00:17:30,495 --> 00:17:32,704
Your family still does not want to rescue you.

230
00:17:32,704 --> 00:17:34,112
Right?

231
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:39,954
You're not going to help us call your father to get the money.

232
00:17:40,746 --> 00:17:42,119
Right?

233
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:49,838
Alright, let me help you.

234
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,754
Send Vice President Kang to hell.

235
00:17:57,754 --> 00:17:59,062
Beat him.

236
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,754
You may choose your favorite wine.

237
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:08,020
This is your mom's favorite.

238
00:18:09,746 --> 00:18:11,662
Today is your mom's birthday.

239
00:18:11,662 --> 00:18:14,119
Don't talk about the company.

240
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:17,096
I want her to enjoy her birthday.

241
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,746
I always thought you were amazing.

242
00:18:27,746 --> 00:18:29,812
So I hacked into your computer a few days ago.

243
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:31,479
I wanted to challenge myself.

244
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:35,429
Do you think this is funny?

245
00:18:36,454 --> 00:18:38,929
Don't you know this is illegal?

246
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:42,912
Big Brother, you're right. I shouldn't have done that.

247
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:44,620
But I need to know.

248
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,987
Why did you have the photos at Second Brother's wedding on your computer?

249
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:55,162
I'm investigating the shell company from Thailand.

250
00:18:55,162 --> 00:18:58,229
I suspect they were the ones who switched the photos.

251
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:01,454
As an attack on Zhen Tian Group and to drive down the share prices.

252
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:04,203
Therefore, I got a copy of those photos.

253
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:06,962
What's wrong? Is that an issue?

254
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:11,119
No, it's not an issue.

255
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,787
This just proves how amazing you are.

256
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:16,696
Madam invites you both to dinner upstairs.

257
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:52,887
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

258
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:01,746
This is for you. Do you like it?

259
00:20:03,812 --> 00:20:05,462
Thank you, Zhentian.

260
00:20:05,462 --> 00:20:06,754
Mom.

261
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:10,604
My girlfriend and I chose this for you.

262
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:12,587
Hope you like it.

263
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,912
It is beautiful.

264
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:19,454
Why didn't you ask your girlfriend to come?

265
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:22,838
I will, but not today.

266
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,095
Alright, Mom. Enough about his girlfriend.

267
00:20:25,095 --> 00:20:27,646
Look at the present I bought for you.

268
00:20:27,646 --> 00:20:29,454
Siyu, you have such good taste.

269
00:20:29,454 --> 00:20:31,287
I like it very much.

270
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:34,370
Make a wish first.

271
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,912
Okay, give me your hand.

272
00:20:37,912 --> 00:20:39,720
Hold your brother's hand.

273
00:20:42,162 --> 00:20:43,996
Today is my birthday.

274
00:20:43,996 --> 00:20:47,303
Let's make a wish together as a family.

275
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,912
I hope you all can work together hand in hand at Zhen Tian Group

276
00:20:53,912 --> 00:20:56,912
to overcome all the difficulties and hassles smoothly.

277
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,454
Great.

278
00:21:10,454 --> 00:21:13,254
Mom, you know.

279
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:19,329
I'm very touched.

280
00:21:20,162 --> 00:21:22,579
No matter how hard life is,

281
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:25,287
none of you overlook me.

282
00:21:25,287 --> 00:21:26,912
Zhen Tian Group is struggling financially.

283
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,829
Money is a constraint.

284
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,103
If I'm still having a birthday party and receiving gifts,

285
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:33,420
that's not right.

286
00:21:33,996 --> 00:21:37,329
The company isn't struggling that much yet.

287
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,829
Don't worry.

288
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:40,919
Just accept the birthday presents.

289
00:21:42,245 --> 00:21:45,629
Okay, they're well received.

290
00:21:47,162 --> 00:21:50,370
Zhentian, remember.

291
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,119
If you need my help,

292
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,638
I can make my little contribution.

293
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:04,303
It would be best if Sihan were back as well.

294
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:07,912
Sihan already said Happy Birthday to me before he left.

295
00:22:07,912 --> 00:22:09,787
I am very satisfied.

296
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,796
Come on. Let's cut the cake.

297
00:22:12,796 --> 00:22:14,604
- Okay.
- Come.

298
00:22:14,604 --> 00:22:16,370
Time to cut the cake.

299
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,019
I'm hungry anyways, so I can finish Second Brother's portion.

300
00:22:19,646 --> 00:22:20,620
Mom, here.

301
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,620
You cut.

302
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,179
No, Mom, you cut it.

303
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:24,746
Come on.

304
00:22:24,746 --> 00:22:26,187
Pair of Jacks.

305
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,537
Pair of Queens.

306
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,212
Anyone?

307
00:22:30,212 --> 00:22:31,604
No, pass.

308
00:22:31,604 --> 00:22:32,896
Come on.

309
00:22:32,896 --> 00:22:35,619
My turn. One Three.

310
00:22:36,812 --> 00:22:38,562
Let's stop playing.

311
00:22:38,562 --> 00:22:40,145
<i>No.</i>

312
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:43,587
<i>Maybe there's a delay in getting here.</i>

313
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,303
<i>Perhaps Dad...</i>

314
00:22:46,812 --> 00:22:49,879
<i>Is already preparing the ransom.</i>

315
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:53,020
<i>But this is a large sum of money.</i>

316
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,479
<i>It takes time to pool all that money.</i>

317
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:59,312
<i>That's why Dad hasn't called yet.</i>

318
00:23:00,162 --> 00:23:02,254
<i>That must be the case.</i>

319
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,640
<i>[Meng Xinyi]</i>

320
00:23:20,303 --> 00:23:23,829
Xiaoxiao, you said you were going to introduce a friend to us.

321
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:26,103
Is he here?

322
00:23:26,103 --> 00:23:27,437
Why are you so eager?

323
00:23:27,437 --> 00:23:31,654
Xiaoxiao will introduce us when it's the right time.

324
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:43,929
Sorry.

325
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:47,496
He may not come today.

326
00:23:50,412 --> 00:23:54,279
Who is he though?

327
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,279
So secretive.

328
00:23:57,846 --> 00:24:00,203
What are you talking about?

329
00:24:00,203 --> 00:24:01,195
I'm a handsome guy.

330
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:04,119
Such an important and mysterious guy in front of you and you don't even care.

331
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:06,871
Seems like you haven't seen much of the world.

332
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:11,112
Zheng'er, any movement from Kang Zhentian lately?

333
00:24:11,887 --> 00:24:14,120
I've successfully hid the truth from him.

334
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,662
He's now focused in other areas.

335
00:24:16,662 --> 00:24:19,679
We've successfully gained some time.

336
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,938
Not bad.

337
00:24:20,938 --> 00:24:25,103
But we don't need any more time.

338
00:24:25,103 --> 00:24:28,871
Listen. Today,

339
00:24:28,871 --> 00:24:32,854
I have something great in store for Kang Zhentian today at Meng Xinyi's exhibition.

340
00:24:32,854 --> 00:24:36,579
He won't have time to pay attention to the company in Thailand anymore.

341
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:40,454
The great move you mentioned last time is Meng Xinyi's art exhibition?

342
00:24:40,454 --> 00:24:43,254
It'll be a great show.

343
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,950
Hello?

344
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:58,704
Hello?

345
00:24:58,704 --> 00:25:00,704
Zhang Xiao, where are you?

346
00:25:00,704 --> 00:25:02,971
I am outside of the exhibition hall.

347
00:25:02,971 --> 00:25:05,312
Too bad you aren't coming.

348
00:25:05,312 --> 00:25:08,470
Is anything unusual happening?

349
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,620
Unusual?

350
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,670
What is so unusual?

351
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:17,245
If Xinyi could see that her art exhibition was held as per schedule

352
00:25:17,245 --> 00:25:19,787
and that there were so many visitors,

353
00:25:19,787 --> 00:25:21,604
she would be very happy.

354
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:23,703
Wait for me. I'll be there soon.

355
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,662
Excuse me.

356
00:25:31,662 --> 00:25:34,370
- Chairman, this way please.
- Chairman, Madam.

357
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,038
- Chairman, this way.
- Chairman Kang, please look at the camera. Thank you.

358
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:38,287
Chairman Kang, look here.

359
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,162
- Chairman Kang.
- Chairman Kang.

360
00:25:49,912 --> 00:25:51,162
Chairman Kang, please look over here.

361
00:25:51,162 --> 00:25:52,737
Please look over here.

362
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:02,662
Come on.

363
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,219
<i>Princess.</i>

364
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:11,045
<i>I'm at your art exhibition.</i>

365
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:15,662
<i>Looking at Xinyi's artwork,</i>

366
00:26:15,662 --> 00:26:19,304
<i>I can feel the traces of her life over the past few years.</i>

367
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:23,395
<i>She kept so much to herself.</i>

368
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:25,679
<i>A lot of which I wasn't aware of.</i>

369
00:26:48,203 --> 00:26:51,520
<i>You're displaying this at your exhibition too?</i>

370
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,771
<i>Of course.</i>

371
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:54,262
<i>You are my best friend.</i>

372
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:56,179
<i>How can I not include you?</i>

373
00:26:57,537 --> 00:26:59,329
<i>I am so lucky.</i>

374
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:01,387
<i>To have you as my best friend,</i>

375
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:04,746
<i>and to marry a guy who loves me.</i>

376
00:27:04,746 --> 00:27:06,019
<i>I have no more regrets in life.</i>

377
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:08,754
<i>Okay, I'll give you a big lobster hug.</i>

378
00:27:25,203 --> 00:27:26,145
What happened?

379
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,229
- Why did the light switch off?
- Right?

380
00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:36,012
What happened?

381
00:27:37,754 --> 00:27:40,162
Aren't these from the wedding?

382
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,229
What's going on?

383
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,646
- Why is this playing?
- Who put this on?

384
00:27:46,646 --> 00:27:48,245
What's going on?

385
00:27:50,096 --> 00:27:51,938
Why is this playing?

386
00:27:54,012 --> 00:27:55,704
Xiaoxiao, there are a lot of reporters here.

387
00:27:55,704 --> 00:27:57,662
Let's go first.

388
00:27:57,662 --> 00:27:59,203
Xiaoxiao.

389
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,120
<i>[Who is the murderer who killed my daughter?]</i>

390
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,170
Who is the murderer who killed my daughter?

391
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,579
<i>[Zhang Xiao]</i>

392
00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:07,720
Zhang Xiao.

393
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,996
Xiaoxiao.

394
00:28:08,996 --> 00:28:11,019
- Who's Zhang Xiao?
- It's her!

395
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:12,479
Zhentian.

396
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:14,829
Zhang Xiao, please give us a few words.

397
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:16,754
Stop filming her.

398
00:28:16,754 --> 00:28:18,229
Zhang Xiao, could you explain?

399
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:19,938
What was that all about? Zhang Xiao?

400
00:28:19,938 --> 00:28:21,219
Please say something.

401
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:21,929
Stop filming.

402
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:23,010
Don't go, Zhang Xiao.

403
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,020
Please say something.

404
00:28:27,595 --> 00:28:29,820
Can you all see now?

405
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,420
She is the murderer who killed my daughter.

406
00:28:45,454 --> 00:28:50,095
This is Xinyi's diary.

407
00:29:03,996 --> 00:29:05,695
In this diary,

408
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,162
she wrote down her dreams.

409
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,296
She loved her life.

410
00:29:18,954 --> 00:29:22,837
Did she need to die because she fell in love with the wrong person?

411
00:29:27,262 --> 00:29:31,729
She wished to plant trees by the Yellow River.

412
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:38,987
She wanted to be a teacher in a small village.

413
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:44,345
She wished for her life to be more meaningful.

414
00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:50,879
Everything is gone. Everything is gone now.

415
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,138
She passed away.

416
00:30:03,704 --> 00:30:05,979
Yes.

417
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,062
Sorry.

418
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:14,910
Sorry means nothing.

419
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,880
Sorry does not mean anything!

420
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,329
She's kneeling.

421
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:27,879
Xiaoxiao.

422
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,546
Sorry.

423
00:30:34,954 --> 00:30:37,103
Sorry.

424
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:40,546
Sorry.

425
00:30:42,395 --> 00:30:44,437
Sorry.

426
00:30:44,437 --> 00:30:46,520
Stop pretending.

427
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,012
Auntie Meng.

428
00:30:59,787 --> 00:31:02,162
Regarding Xinyi's accident,

429
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:04,470
we all feel very sad.

430
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,945
But it's a thing of the past.

431
00:31:09,096 --> 00:31:13,279
I hope you never bother Zhang Xiao again.

432
00:31:15,354 --> 00:31:17,587
I am her boyfriend now.

433
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,970
Come after me.

434
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,745
Don't follow us. I will take care of her.

435
00:31:36,912 --> 00:31:38,320
Xiaoxiao.

436
00:31:39,237 --> 00:31:40,879
It's your turn.

437
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:43,554
Are you going or not?

438
00:31:43,554 --> 00:31:45,495
Stop playing.

439
00:31:45,495 --> 00:31:47,420
Look at this.

440
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,495
<i>Sorry.</i>

441
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:53,604
<i>- Stop pretending.
- Auntie Meng.</i>

442
00:31:55,912 --> 00:31:58,412
<i>Regarding Xinyi's accident,</i>

443
00:31:58,412 --> 00:32:00,679
<i>we all feel very sad.</i>

444
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:03,119
<i>But it's a thing of the past.</i>

445
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,420
<i>I hope you never bother Zhang Xiao again.</i>

446
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,162
<i>I am her boyfriend now.</i>

447
00:32:08,162 --> 00:32:10,820
<i>Come after me.</i>

448
00:32:11,337 --> 00:32:12,860
<i>No way.</i>

449
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,454
Look at him.

450
00:32:14,454 --> 00:32:19,319
- He thinks he's her Mr. Right.
<i>- There's no way.</i>

451
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:23,912
<i>I always thought what Xiaoxiao and I had was true love.</i>

452
00:32:24,454 --> 00:32:29,219
<i>I didn't even think she would get with Yin Zheng within such a short time.</i>

453
00:32:30,812 --> 00:32:33,912
<i>The thing I've been holding on to...</i>

454
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:36,729
<i>It's just a joke.</i>

455
00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:39,912
<i>I even thought of her as my motivation to keep going.</i>

456
00:32:44,746 --> 00:32:46,720
<i>What a joke.</i>

457
00:32:47,704 --> 00:32:49,079
Meng Yinan!

458
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:52,579
I always thought that you were an open-minded business woman.

459
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:57,329
I didn't think you'd use your daughter's exhibition as a revenge tactic.

460
00:32:57,329 --> 00:32:59,038
You are so cruel.

461
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:00,287
Of course I have to seek revenge.

462
00:33:00,287 --> 00:33:02,096
Of course I have to!

463
00:33:02,096 --> 00:33:05,145
You're here talking about ethics?

464
00:33:05,145 --> 00:33:08,203
Let me tell you. Your company's share price is now at its lowest.

465
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:11,812
You better get ready to clean up the mess!

466
00:33:11,812 --> 00:33:15,287
I am so happy that you have to pay for your cheating son.

467
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:17,020
You...

468
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,412
Don't you think it's strange?

469
00:33:19,412 --> 00:33:21,245
Based on my power alone,

470
00:33:21,245 --> 00:33:24,245
how can I cause so much trouble for your company?

471
00:33:24,245 --> 00:33:26,162
Don't you think it's strange?

472
00:33:26,162 --> 00:33:30,954
I really have to thank your good buddy Yin Chenggui.

473
00:33:32,812 --> 00:33:34,938
Zhentian!

474
00:33:34,938 --> 00:33:36,520
Zhentian, hang in there.

475
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,450
Zhentian!

476
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,210
Call an ambulance!

477
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:42,512
Get into the car.

478
00:33:43,662 --> 00:33:46,829
I want to be alone. You can go.

479
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:48,537
Let me take you home.

480
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,370
I really want to be alone.

481
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:58,395
There's no point in thinking about this.

482
00:33:58,395 --> 00:34:00,287
Can't you just listen to me once?

483
00:34:00,287 --> 00:34:02,471
Go home for some rest and have a good sleep.

484
00:34:04,495 --> 00:34:06,654
I killed Xinyi.

485
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,404
I'll never have a good night's sleep.

486
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,019
You didn't kill Xinyi.

487
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:17,629
It was my uncle.

488
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,579
What?

489
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:28,045
My uncle planned all of this.

490
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,787
He showed your and Sihan's photos at the wedding.

491
00:34:36,145 --> 00:34:37,820
So you're saying,

492
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:41,054
the message and phone call...

493
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,579
Sorry.

494
00:34:46,495 --> 00:34:48,437
I lied to you.

495
00:34:54,854 --> 00:34:57,270
So you knew about this plan

496
00:34:58,379 --> 00:35:00,962
before the wedding ceremony?

497
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,687
You're involved, right?

498
00:35:11,038 --> 00:35:12,945
Please forgive me.

499
00:35:17,495 --> 00:35:20,545
I can't believe you played so dirty.

500
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,019
I tried to stop it.

501
00:35:27,454 --> 00:35:29,245
Don't explain anymore.

502
00:35:30,354 --> 00:35:32,738
You all killed Xinyi.

503
00:35:34,145 --> 00:35:36,704
My uncle just wanted to provoke Xinyi.

504
00:35:36,704 --> 00:35:39,470
He just wanted to mess up the wedding ceremony.

505
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,245
Then we could stop Zhen Tian and Yin Feng from collaborating

506
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:44,492
and in turn take down Zhen Tian Group.

507
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:46,826
You want to take down Zhen Tian Group?

508
00:35:46,826 --> 00:35:49,284
I want to avenge my father.

509
00:35:51,334 --> 00:35:53,999
He died an unjust death.

510
00:35:54,617 --> 00:35:56,242
This is my only chance.

511
00:35:56,242 --> 00:35:58,018
I have no choice.

512
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:02,434
Shouldn't you think about someone else's life before taking action?

513
00:36:02,434 --> 00:36:05,092
I have to avenge him.

514
00:36:11,018 --> 00:36:13,476
You only have hatred in your heart.

515
00:36:16,892 --> 00:36:18,492
You're not me.

516
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:22,199
You would never understand my pain.

517
00:36:47,726 --> 00:36:49,760
Doctor, how is he?

518
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,959
Zhentian.

519
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,417
Zhentian, open your eyes please.

520
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:54,892
Zhentian, please wake up.

521
00:36:54,892 --> 00:36:56,292
- Open your eyes and look at me.
- Dad, what happened to you?

522
00:36:56,292 --> 00:36:57,475
- Zhentian!
- Please calm down.

523
00:36:57,475 --> 00:36:59,250
Please keep calm.

524
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,767
Come here.

525
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,334
Mom, what happened to Dad?

526
00:37:03,334 --> 00:37:05,267
He fainted from agitation.

527
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:07,392
Doctor, how is he?

528
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,642
Mr. Kang had a stroke.

529
00:37:09,642 --> 00:37:12,559
We have to run further tests before making conclusions.

530
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:15,183
Our hospital will try our best to rescue our patients.

531
00:37:15,183 --> 00:37:18,099
Please be patient.

532
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:21,000
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Okay.

533
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:25,942
Mom, don't be too upset.

534
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:31,434
Dad was so excited to reconcile with the Mengs yesterday.

535
00:37:31,434 --> 00:37:33,942
I can't believe this happened to him today.

536
00:37:34,726 --> 00:37:38,392
He must've gotten a stroke because of his mood swings.

537
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:46,851
Phone.

538
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:48,542
I want to make a call.

539
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:51,083
What do you want?

540
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,309
I want to make a call.

541
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,242
Make a call?

542
00:37:59,142 --> 00:38:01,167
Who do you want to call?

543
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,317
I want to call my dad.

544
00:38:02,317 --> 00:38:04,651
I've been waiting for you to say that, you know?

545
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:06,734
You stupid fool.

546
00:38:06,734 --> 00:38:08,475
You should've called earlier.

547
00:38:08,475 --> 00:38:11,025
You wouldn't have gotten beaten so hard.

548
00:38:11,025 --> 00:38:12,010
Right.

549
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,959
What is the phone number?

550
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:18,509
138 8899

551
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:21,126
6543.

552
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,300
It's going through.

553
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,999
- Hello?
- Hello?

554
00:38:36,999 --> 00:38:38,834
I'm Sihan.

555
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:40,909
Sihan?

556
00:38:42,517 --> 00:38:44,542
Sihan, where are you?

557
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:45,859
When will you be back?

558
00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:47,850
I was kidnapped.

559
00:38:48,684 --> 00:38:49,509
Kidnapped?

560
00:38:49,509 --> 00:38:53,434
Please give them money to save me.

561
00:38:53,434 --> 00:38:55,892
Tell my dad to come to the phone.

562
00:38:55,892 --> 00:38:57,500
Your dad had a stroke.

563
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,283
He fainted.

564
00:38:59,283 --> 00:39:00,400
Sihan, where are you?

565
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,600
What?

566
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,100
Second Brother, listen to me.

567
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,000
I'll save you.

568
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,517
Don't worry.

569
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:09,142
No way.

570
00:39:09,142 --> 00:39:11,226
No way!

571
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,851
Stop moving.

572
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,751
Don't move.

573
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:17,567
No way!

574
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:20,599
- Second Brother, don't worry.
- No way!

575
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,500
Yin Zheng.

576
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,784
You hurt my father.

577
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:30,517
It must've been you!

578
00:39:30,517 --> 00:39:31,726
Second Brother, please calm down.

579
00:39:31,726 --> 00:39:34,792
Listen to me. Second Brother, calm down.

580
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:37,292
I won't let you get away with this.

581
00:39:38,392 --> 00:39:40,976
I want revenge!

582
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:42,317
Second Brother, keep calm.

583
00:39:42,317 --> 00:39:43,667
Keep calm please.

584
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:45,417
We will save you.

585
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:46,109
Brother!

586
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:48,000
Listen up.

587
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,167
First, prepare 100 million cash immediately to save your Vice President Kang.

588
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:53,709
Or else, we will kill him.

589
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:57,390
Second, don't hang up on me anymore.

590
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,883
Hello?

591
00:39:58,883 --> 00:40:00,620
Talk to me.

592
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,000
Hello?

593
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,100
Son of a bitch!

594
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,350
How dare they kidnap my Second Brother?

595
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:15,350
Mom, don't be too upset.

596
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,567
Second Brother is in danger.

597
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:19,475
It's understandable for him to get emotional and say something stupid.

598
00:40:19,475 --> 00:40:21,776
Please don't take it to heart, Mom.

599
00:40:21,776 --> 00:40:23,918
I'm not taking it to heart.

600
00:40:23,918 --> 00:40:25,717
I'm just worried about Sihan.

601
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:28,934
Son, what do we do? 100 million cash.

602
00:40:28,934 --> 00:40:30,350
The group doesn't have that much money right now.

603
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,876
What do we do?

604
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:35,026
What do I do?

605
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,934
Give Yin Zheng a call.

606
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:39,392
Perhaps he can pool the money.

607
00:40:39,392 --> 00:40:41,576
No matter what, we have to rescue Sihan.

608
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,542
Hello?

609
00:40:49,542 --> 00:40:51,999
Zheng'er, Sihan was kidnapped.

610
00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:53,792
Please come back.

611
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:08,776
Yin Zheng.

612
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:12,667
Yin Zheng.

613
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:19,634
I won't let you get away with this.

614
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:40,876
Miss.

615
00:41:42,851 --> 00:41:45,183
Why are you crying?

616
00:41:45,976 --> 00:41:48,542
What are you crying for?

617
00:41:54,392 --> 00:41:56,076
You are right.

618
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:05,199
There is nothing worth me crying for anymore.

619
00:42:08,642 --> 00:42:11,334
Were you the one who took care of me

620
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:19,051
the second day I was locked in here?

621
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:30,125
The handkerchief was yours?

622
00:42:43,475 --> 00:42:46,226
We don't know each other.

623
00:42:48,018 --> 00:42:50,517
Why are you helping me?

624
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:07,010
Everyone is suffering.

625
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:09,010
I just do what I can do.

626
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:15,125
We are in the same situation now.

627
00:43:16,225 --> 00:43:17,809
Besides,

628
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,692
I understand your pain.

629
00:43:29,417 --> 00:43:31,159
Miss.

630
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:34,034
Miss.

631
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:37,600
You are so kind.

632
00:43:40,267 --> 00:43:42,400
So kind.

633
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,299
If I make it out of here alive,

634
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,875
I'll take you with me.

635
00:43:58,059 --> 00:44:00,434
If I die,

636
00:44:04,417 --> 00:44:11,225
at least there will be someone

637
00:44:11,225 --> 00:44:13,834
who feels sad for me.

638
00:44:15,834 --> 00:44:20,400
Someone who feels sad for me.

639
00:44:32,475 --> 00:44:34,425
You won't die.

640
00:44:35,475 --> 00:44:38,292
God will bless all of us.

641
00:44:39,534 --> 00:44:42,300
We will survive and get out of here.

642
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,834
We will survive and get out of here.
