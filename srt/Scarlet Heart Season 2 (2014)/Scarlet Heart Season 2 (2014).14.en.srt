<i>[Scarlet Heart 2]</i>

2
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:43,010
<i>[Episode 14]</i>

3
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,751
Starting from tomorrow, you have to come see me happily.

4
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:58,209
Who do you think you are?

5
00:01:58,209 --> 00:01:59,934
Of course I am somebody.

6
00:01:59,934 --> 00:02:02,792
I am now officially your boyfriend.

7
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:05,434
Black Cat Detective.

8
00:02:05,434 --> 00:02:08,667
Why do you like me?

9
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,751
Because you are ZX.

10
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,876
Then tell me.

11
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:18,183
Why is your perfume called Z&X?

12
00:02:18,183 --> 00:02:19,417
Because of you.

13
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:20,925
Impossible.

14
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:25,309
We didn't even know each other when you created this brand.

15
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:26,851
Not necessarily.

16
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:30,392
Maybe we have knew each other centuries ago.

17
00:02:30,392 --> 00:02:32,375
You were the brick on the bridge,

18
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,892
I was the stone under you.

19
00:02:34,892 --> 00:02:38,375
We watched each other in silence for centuries.

20
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:44,934
Alright, I'll stop.

21
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:46,642
Back to business.

22
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:51,999
ZX are me and my mom's initials.

23
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:53,417
My name is Zachary.

24
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,517
My mom's name is Xu Ruijiao.

25
00:02:55,517 --> 00:02:59,083
That's where I got Z&X.

26
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,417
I see.

27
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:03,517
What's more interesting,

28
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:07,500
there is a girl that I really like.

29
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:11,134
Her name is Zhang Xiao

30
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:23,142
So my initials are ZX.

31
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:24,799
What else?

32
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:34,000
The first time I saw you,

33
00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:37,542
I thought you were really friendly.

34
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:41,709
Then we lit firecrackers together.

35
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:46,834
I was already a bit attracted to you after that.

36
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:49,559
After we watched the first snow in Beijing together,

37
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:53,525
I was smitten.

38
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:58,867
When you agreed

39
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:02,292
to pretend to be my girlfriend,

40
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,267
my defense system

41
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,126
crashed completely.

42
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:17,742
When you said you never wanted to see me again,

43
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:20,910
I was really worried.

44
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,380
I...

45
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:26,792
I thought,

46
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:33,200
what if I never get to see this girl again?

47
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:36,600
What do I do?

48
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:39,900
Then...

49
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,742
What about you?

50
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,209
When did you fall for me?

51
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:55,600
Since I first laid eyes on you,

52
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,467
I thought...

53
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:01,583
If this person dislikes me...

54
00:05:02,642 --> 00:05:04,500
What do I do?

55
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:15,876
Are you okay?

56
00:05:20,242 --> 00:05:25,350
♫ <i>I don't care if we suffer on this road together</i> ♫

57
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,600
♫ <i>At least I can embrace your warmth</i> ♫

58

♫ <i>I'm satisfied with our journey</i> ♫

62
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:46,375
You want to ambush me again.

63
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:49,392
Wait.

64
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:54,809
♫ <i>I refuse to accept, uncertainties don't count</i> ♫

65
00:05:54,809 --> 00:06:02,909
♫ <i>Love is willing to lose, I would rather be failed</i> ♫

66
00:06:03,892 --> 00:06:05,350
Let's go.

67
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:08,059
Be careful.

68
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:11,218
♫ <i>At least I can embrace your warmth</i> ♫

69
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:14,609
Go in.

70
00:06:16,018 --> 00:06:16,934
Bye.

71
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:20,751
♫ <i>I don't care how much suffering I go through</i> ♫

72
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:24,100

00:06:30,584 --> 00:06:41,217
♫ <i>I'll protect you from afar</i> ♫

75
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,826
Are you trying to scare me?

76
00:07:04,826 --> 00:07:06,642
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

77
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:14,976
Are you hungry?

78
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,518
Let me buy you supper.

79
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:22,876
I really didn't mean to keep it from you.

80
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,492
But it all happened too quickly.

81
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:28,025
I can't even believe it myself.

82
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,767
What do you want to know?

83
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:32,683
I will tell you everything.

84
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:42,892
Don't make things difficult.

85
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:44,976
Why the long face?

86
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:49,617
Alright, you want to play mute.

87
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:52,209
Then don't talk to me for the month.

88
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,576
Keep a closer watch.

89
00:07:58,099 --> 00:07:59,551
What did you say?

90
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:08,799
Keep a closer watch.

91
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:11,475
Don't be like the last time.

92
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:13,609
Didn't even realize you were cheated on.

93
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,392
Here.

94
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:33,267
I bought you coffee and a sandwich.

95
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:34,726
What did you buy for me?

96
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:37,292
Pancakes and soya milk.

97
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:39,976
- If you don't like it...
- Who said I don't like it?

98
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:41,725
Let's exchange.

99
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:48,350
This feels nice.

100
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,876
And breakfast is better than usual.

101
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:58,392
This tastes good.

102
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:00,559
I haven't had pancakes in a while.

103
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,800
And these are pancakes you bought me.

104
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:07,417
If this goes on, we will both get fat.

105
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:09,183
Big fat pigs?

106
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:11,350
That's not terrible.

107
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,834
We can be lifeguards.

108
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:13,767
Why?

109
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:14,784
Think about it.

110
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:19,542
When people are drowning, you and I jump into the pool.

111
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:21,334
Splash World.

112
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:25,083
I don't want to.

113
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:32,059
You two are so comfortable with PDA early in the morning.

114
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:34,234
Don't overdo it.

115
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:39,183
Director Yin, you are really strict.

116
00:09:39,183 --> 00:09:41,059
I don't want to be either.

117
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:44,559
But I have worked here for more than ten years.

118
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,225
I can't just not do my job.

119
00:09:48,225 --> 00:09:53,475
By the way, I heard the stories of your romance in the restaurant.

120
00:09:53,475 --> 00:09:57,267
I now warn you as the Vice President of Zhen Tian Group.

121
00:09:57,851 --> 00:10:00,517
Zhen Tian Group has its rules.

122
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,834
All who are involved in office relationships will be fired.

123
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:06,084
Don't say I didn't warn you.

124
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:08,684
Watch out.

125
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:13,826
Please take care of your own issues with Miss Lan Lan first.

126
00:10:13,826 --> 00:10:15,809
When that is done, then you can lecture us.

127
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:17,476
- Black Cat Detective.
- Let's go.

128
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:20,725
I'll bring you to breakfast.

129
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,100
Why so early today?

130
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,475
To send you to your office.

131
00:10:30,475 --> 00:10:32,042
I am not in kindergarten.

132
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:34,559
I don't need to be sent to the gate.

133
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,626
I wanted to see you for a bit longer.

134
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:41,851
Have you had breakfast?

135
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:42,584
No.

136
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:44,326
Let's go out to eat.

137
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Don't make too many people jealous.

138
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,959
You will make enemies.

139
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,059
Hello?

140
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:03,359
Miss Lan, good day.

141
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:09,067
What's wrong?

142
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:11,700
Let's go.

143
00:11:35,642 --> 00:11:39,242
You say you don't care about looks and wealth,

144
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:43,309
but you got Mr. Kang so effortlessly.

145
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:47,434
I didn't know he was Kang Sihan when I met him.

146
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:49,559
Plus,

147
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:52,851
I think I'm happier being with Black Cat Detective.

148
00:11:52,851 --> 00:11:54,159
Unlike now.

149
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:56,459
Getting unwanted attention everywhere I go.

150
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:57,934
Alright.

151
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:00,200
Don't push it.

152
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,934
You're still not satisfied?

153
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:03,659
Then what about women like us?

154
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:05,959
We might as well go jump off a building.

155
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,770
I am so jealous.

156
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,910
Different lives.

157
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:15,334
Which magnifying glass did you use

158
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,834
to find such a perfect super rich and handsome man?

159
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:23,518
Want to know my secret?

160
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,392
Don't use any magnifying glass.

161
00:12:28,392 --> 00:12:31,284
Use your own eyes.

162
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:35,099
But unfortunately,

163
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:39,517
I didn't realize that he was such a good catch either at first.

164
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:48,759
Do you mean there are many good men hidden among us?

165
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:51,675
Maybe.

166
00:12:54,992 --> 00:12:58,192
From now on I need to sharpen my eyesight

167
00:12:58,192 --> 00:13:00,050
and find myself a great man.

168
00:13:04,976 --> 00:13:06,575
Xiaoxiao.

169
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:11,100
Yes?

170
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,059
Nothing. I just miss you.

171
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,225
Go for coffee with me.

172
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:17,600
Are you mad?

173
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,992
We just saw each other two hours ago.

174
00:13:19,992 --> 00:13:23,059
This is the good thing about office relationships.

175
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:24,892
Let's go.

176
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:27,183
Bad influence.

177
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:28,876
Let's go.

178
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,250
Director Kang.

179
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,826
Assistant Qiao.

180
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,590
<i>[Lan Lan's Birthday is the Day After Tomorrow]</i>

181
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:53,251
Director Yin.

182
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:56,517
I booked your flight for the international advertisement conference.

183
00:13:56,517 --> 00:13:57,976
It's tomorrow at 5pm.

184
00:13:57,976 --> 00:13:59,309
How many days will that be?

185
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:01,059
Five days.

186
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:02,309
Can I not go?

187
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,267
It happens once every four years.

188
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:06,392
It is a conference with international leaders.

189
00:14:06,392 --> 00:14:09,600
Isn't it a bit weird if we don't attend?

190
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,242
Why not let Director Kang attend?

191
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:14,999
It's okay, I will go.

192
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:17,450
Lan Lan's birthday is the day after tomorrow.

193
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,225
Plan a party for her.

194
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,934
Make it big.

195
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:22,992
Don't let her be upset because I am not around.

196
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,800
No problem.

197
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,559
By the way, Kang Sihan and Zhang Xiao have been really high profile about their relationship.

198
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,099
Isn't that inappropriate?

199
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:33,359
Should we let Chairman know?

200
00:14:33,934 --> 00:14:36,099
That is their personal affair.

201
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:38,199
Stay out of it.

202
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:41,059
I understand. I will leave now.

203
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,342
Write this down for me.

204
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:51,934
Assistant Qiao.

205
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,751
Are you looking for Director Yin?

206
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:56,283
Go in.

207
00:14:56,283 --> 00:14:57,692
Thanks.

208
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:03,167
Director Yin.

209
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,709
Yes?

210
00:15:06,992 --> 00:15:09,142
Your laundry is done.

211
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,726
How much is it?

212
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:13,700
Don't bother. It's not much.

213
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,018
Come back.

214
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:21,225
I don't spend any woman's money beside my mom's.

215
00:15:21,225 --> 00:15:23,083
Don't break my rule.

216
00:15:24,517 --> 00:15:26,209
I don't have change.

217
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:27,892
It's okay.

218
00:15:27,892 --> 00:15:30,026
I should be giving you tips anyway.

219
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,584
Wait.

220
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,959
I am sorry for this morning.

221
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:41,018
Anything else to say?

222
00:15:41,018 --> 00:15:42,417
No.

223
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:46,059
I am not that narrow-minded.

224
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:47,509
Bye.

225
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,118
Zhang Xiao.

226
00:15:55,951 --> 00:15:59,225
Director Yin wants a birthday party for Miss Lan.

227
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:03,459
I think you are best suited for the job.

228
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,534
Why me?

229
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:08,892
Are you unwilling to do such a small task?

230
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:11,659
No.

231
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:14,118
It's just that she doesn't seem to like me very much.

232
00:16:14,118 --> 00:16:15,934
If I plan it,

233
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,434
will it have a reverse effect?

234
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:21,409
Don't you think this is a great chance to improve your relationship?

235
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:24,517
Zhang Xiao.

236
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:28,542
No matter who you are dating now, you are still Director Yin's employee.

237
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:31,209
I understand.

238
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,700
When is Lan Lan's birthday?

239
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,125
The day after tomorrow.

240
00:16:37,892 --> 00:16:39,292
Alright.

241
00:16:44,726 --> 00:16:46,600
Xiaoxiao.

242
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,417
Are you bringing flowers to Lan Lan?

243
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:51,099
Yes.

244
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:53,267
I have a parcel for her.

245
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:55,475
Can you help me give it to her?

246
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:59,617
You know I don't want to see her.

247
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:02,392
Alright, I will help you.

248
00:17:02,392 --> 00:17:05,792
Thanks. Let's go.

249
00:17:10,742 --> 00:17:12,217
Come in.

250
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:18,375
Lan Lan, there's mail for you.

251
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:47,334
Anything else?

252
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:50,684
We have a last minute shooting this afternoon.

253
00:17:50,684 --> 00:17:54,934
The photographers asked you to be at the studio at 5pm sharp.

254
00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:56,334
Alright.

255
00:17:57,283 --> 00:17:59,267
Be on time.

Let me tell you.

00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:50,392
I taught that witch a lesson.

275

00:21:57,684 --> 00:22:00,118
Let me bring you to a concert.

279
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,851
What concert?

280
00:22:01,851 --> 00:22:03,309
You will find out.

283
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:18,242
Thank you everyone for coming to listen to me sing.

284
00:22:18,876 --> 00:22:23,959
So the next song is not for me.

285
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:29,559
But for a girl here.

286
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:32,059
I hope it makes her happy.

287
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,667
And I hope everyone enjoys it.

288
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:36,475
Alright!

00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,267
This is for you.

291
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:46,417

292
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,709
Thank you.

293
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:53,976
When did he start singing here?

294
00:22:53,976 --> 00:22:57,459
Immediately after you started dating Kang Sihan.

295
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,542
News got out fast.

296
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:01,517
Even you know.

297
00:23:01,517 --> 00:23:03,409
Dejected men are scary.

298
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:06,117
They'll do anything.

299
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:16,309
How has the business been since he started singing?

300
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:18,292
It's a downward plunge.

301
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:24,509
I am sorry.

302
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:36,726

Hi, Siyu.

309
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:24,325
You used to call me Mr. Horseshit.

310
00:24:24,325 --> 00:24:27,083
I'm not used to this change.

311
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,225
But this is good too.

312
00:24:29,225 --> 00:24:31,642
The past was my fault.

313
00:24:31,642 --> 00:24:33,309
I owed you money, yet I was unfriendly to you.

314
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:34,976
I really shouldn't have.

315
00:24:34,976 --> 00:24:37,018
Looks like my brother has been saying good things about me.

316
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:40,475
I went from being Mr. Horseshit to a philanthropist.

00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:49,225
we can sit down and talk.

320
00:24:49,225 --> 00:24:50,792
Of course I don't mind.

321
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:52,067
Come on.

322
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:56,334
You left early at the family gathering.

323
00:24:56,334 --> 00:24:58,250
Were you okay?

324
00:24:59,018 --> 00:25:00,559
It's nothing.

325
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,876
It's alright now.

326
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,059
Okay then.

327
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:04,726
Zhen Tian Group is a family business.

328
00:25:04,726 --> 00:25:06,434
It has very complicated interpersonal relationships.

329
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:09,417
It is normal to have some problems.

330
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:11,000
I understand.

331
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,225
Zhen Tian Group is actually not as scary as you say.

332
00:25:14,225 --> 00:25:16,200
Especially now.

333
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,784
My work life and love life is there.

334
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,418
And free cakes and pizza.

335
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,767
What pizza is this?

336
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:27,976
It's so ugly.

337
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:29,851
It can't taste good.

338
00:25:29,851 --> 00:25:32,367
This is not just pizza.

339
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:34,726
Every time I am sad or down,

340
00:25:34,726 --> 00:25:38,142
I will receive treats from a mysterious person.

341
00:25:38,142 --> 00:25:40,720
Mysterious person? Who?

342
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:42,709
I don't know.

343
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,626
But there's a note on the pizza, "I am here".

344
00:25:46,626 --> 00:25:50,434
I suppose it's a crazy admirer or a mad person.

345
00:25:50,434 --> 00:25:52,234
Don't say that.

346
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:56,542
I'm actually really thankful for him.

347
00:25:57,809 --> 00:26:00,125
I'm all alone in this city.

348
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:04,525
It's really lucky to have someone who secretly cares for you.

349
00:26:05,392 --> 00:26:09,142
These treats are like Popeye's spinach.

350
00:26:09,142 --> 00:26:13,542
No matter what trouble I'm in, they always make me feel better.

351
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:15,309
Really?

352
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:17,083
Of course.

353
00:26:29,475 --> 00:26:30,584
It tastes alright.

354
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:32,325
Do you want to try?

355
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:33,884
Alright.

356
00:26:37,876 --> 00:26:39,183
How is it?

357
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:41,584
Not as bad as you thought?

358
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,434
My arms are getting fat.

359
00:26:45,434 --> 00:26:47,083
Really fat.

360
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:49,084
Nonsense.

361
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,475
Boss.

362
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:11,350
You're here early.

363
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,350
I'm making a strawberry one.

364
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,809
You're still going to be Zhang Xiao's shadow lover?

365
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:20,059
Yes. Ten points for you.

366
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:22,542
Are you drunk?

367
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:24,459
She already has a boyfriend.

368
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:26,200
That person is your brother.

369
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,225
So what?

370
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:29,209
I can still like her.

371
00:27:29,209 --> 00:27:31,283
What are you talking about?

372
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,267
The ultimate philosophy of the universe is quite simple.

373
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:39,200
If you never had it, you have nothing to lose anyway.

374
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,600
Like a pot of flowers.

375
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,700
If you want it to stay alive forever,

376
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,099
you have to give it silent love.

377
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:47,325
Once you want fruits from it,

378
00:27:47,325 --> 00:27:49,584
the flower will wilt.

379
00:27:50,183 --> 00:27:52,434
You are still young so you don't understand.

380
00:27:52,434 --> 00:27:54,267
Wait until you're older.

381
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:55,742
Yes.

382
00:27:55,742 --> 00:28:00,700
I only know two people caring for each other is love.

383
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,242
One person caring for the other, that's being cheap.

384
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:09,717
She said I was cheap.

385
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:16,167
This time, Yue-Sai launched the first of its kind, customized skincare.

386
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:18,834
It is a series inspired by Chinese medication.

387
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:21,784
A new way to diagnose skin problems.

388
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:23,751
Through one on one consultation,

389
00:28:23,751 --> 00:28:26,851
determining a unique solution for every customer.

390
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:32,684
The content will be different concentrations of ginseng, snow ear and female ginseng.

391
00:28:32,684 --> 00:28:35,826
Everyone's formula is unique and special.

392
00:28:35,826 --> 00:28:40,559
Yes, all products are formulated and produced on the spot.

393
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,417
It is completely customized.

394
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:46,475
Just like how the rainbow looks different to everyone.

395
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:51,392
Chariman, we can also call this product customized rainbow jar.

396
00:28:51,392 --> 00:28:55,225
This is Zhen Tian's greatest achievement in ten years of research.

397
00:28:55,225 --> 00:29:00,826
From this year onwards, it will also be our main focus in marketing.

398
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:05,992
This is what we achieved after many years of research.

399
00:29:05,992 --> 00:29:09,726
Therefore this is Yue-Sai's groundbreaking product.

400
00:29:09,726 --> 00:29:12,392
The usual methods of marketing probably won't work.

401
00:29:12,392 --> 00:29:15,809
We need a whole new way of promoting.

402
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:21,559
I know Director Yin already has a great idea, right?

403
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,659
Yes.

404
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:26,183
The trend in the media now is making microfilms.

405
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:30,392
So let's also use microfilms as our main tool for marketing this time.

406
00:29:30,392 --> 00:29:32,492
We will make a series of microfilms

407
00:29:32,492 --> 00:29:35,283
with the subject "Appreciate yourself".

408
00:29:35,283 --> 00:29:36,892
Let's make ten stories,

409
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:39,959
all with ancient Imperial China as setting.

410
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:41,892
Why ancient China?

411
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:44,667
This is to let people understand more visually

412
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:49,767
that our concept came from Chinese medication.

413
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:55,018
All the princesses in the palace enjoy customized skin care.

414
00:29:55,018 --> 00:30:01,018
This can help people understand more about the concept of customized skin care.

415
00:30:01,018 --> 00:30:04,559
The production crew for making the series will be the best in the country.

416
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,684
And the female lead will be the female artist that Zhen Tian Group

417
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:12,076
has signed with, Miss Lan Lan.

418
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:15,225
If Miss Lan Lan becomes famous with this series,

419
00:30:15,225 --> 00:30:19,667
then it is also good for Zhen Tian Group.

420
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:21,600
Do you have any opinions?

421
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
I don't agree.

422
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,250
He doesn't agree?

423
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,167
Why?

424
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:30,684
Many companies have already been using microfilms in place of advertisements.

425
00:30:30,684 --> 00:30:32,409
We are late in using the tactic.

426
00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:34,392
So there's no advantage for us.

427
00:30:34,392 --> 00:30:38,059
Plus, ancient China settings are expensive.

428
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:41,642
Although Miss Lan Lan is a famous model,

429
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:45,434
but she's still new to acting.

430
00:30:45,434 --> 00:30:49,059
Investing so much in a rookie

431
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:51,059
seems very risky.

432
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:55,909
Director Kang, you haven't even tried.

433
00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:57,100
How do you know she can't do it?

434
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,575
Director Yin, we are discussing a creative proposal.

435
00:31:01,575 --> 00:31:05,392
Not creating a motivational folktale for Miss Lan Lan.

436
00:31:05,392 --> 00:31:08,392
I think you are just biased.

437
00:31:08,392 --> 00:31:11,167
I don't even know Miss Lan Lan.

438
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:13,350
I am not the one dating her.

439
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,751
I am the last person to be biased.

440
00:31:17,867 --> 00:31:21,892
Alright, stop fighting.

441
00:31:23,726 --> 00:31:27,242
I personally feel this idea is good.

442
00:31:27,242 --> 00:31:31,083
But Director Kang has a point too.

443
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:33,359
Director Yin.

444
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,059
Lan Lan alone probably isn't compelling enough.

445
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:42,225
I agree we should sign a few more famous actors to help her.

446
00:31:42,225 --> 00:31:45,283
This is a huge investment.

447
00:31:45,283 --> 00:31:47,576
We should be extra careful.

448
00:31:50,851 --> 00:31:52,834
I understand.

449
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:55,459
I will not disappoint you, Chairman.

450
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:56,992
Alright.

451
00:31:56,992 --> 00:31:58,999
Let's talk about something else.

452
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:00,375
Alright.

453
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,090
Ma Wa,

454
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:04,617
why haven't you taken action yet?

455
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,059
I am waiting for a chance.

456
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:09,475
Chance doesn't come by waiting.

457
00:33:09,475 --> 00:33:11,409
You have to fight for it.

458
00:33:11,409 --> 00:33:13,076
I'm warning you.

459
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:15,142
Don't try anything funny.

460
00:33:15,142 --> 00:33:16,934
By next week,

461
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:20,834
if I still don't see Kang Sihan lying in your bed,

462
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:23,500
don't blame me for what I'll do.

463
00:33:26,283 --> 00:33:29,392
Isn't it just exposing my past?

464
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,183
I am not afraid.

465
00:33:32,183 --> 00:33:33,951
You are stubborn.

466
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:39,142
No, I just have a heart of stone.

467
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:43,318
I made the decision to leave you and I'm not going back.

468
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,967
Don't waste your time.

469
00:33:47,976 --> 00:33:50,709
You can expose me.

470
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:54,600
I can also tell Yin Zheng everything about you.

471
00:33:58,325 --> 00:33:59,700
Lan Lan.

472
00:34:10,142 --> 00:34:11,592
Lan Lan.

473
00:34:13,283 --> 00:34:14,642
Good news.

474
00:34:14,642 --> 00:34:17,976
Chairman has approved the microfilm project.

475
00:34:17,976 --> 00:34:19,951
You will be the female lead.

476
00:34:19,951 --> 00:34:23,726
Really? That's great.

477
00:34:23,726 --> 00:34:26,859
Kang Sihan almost ruined it.

478
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:31,834
You don't have to do so much for me.

479
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:33,683
What's wrong?

480
00:34:33,683 --> 00:34:35,909
You don't look happy.

481
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,999
It's not that.

482
00:34:38,851 --> 00:34:41,200
It's just I'd rather be a common person

483
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,367
than be famous.

484
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:46,099
A life with just you and me.

485
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:49,600
Peacefully and quietly.

486
00:34:50,684 --> 00:34:53,876
We'll live that life. Don't worry.

487
00:34:57,492 --> 00:34:59,600
This will be your first time acting,

488
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,375
but I am sure you can do it.

489
00:35:06,892 --> 00:35:10,350
Let's celebrate together tonight.

490
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,667
Wait for me after work.

491
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:13,018
Alright.

492
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:19,059
Yin Zheng,

493
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:23,309
I have been using tarot cards to see your luck.

494
00:35:23,309 --> 00:35:29,309
The cards say that you will have an enemy returning from overseas.

495
00:35:29,309 --> 00:35:30,751
I don't believe in these.

496
00:35:30,751 --> 00:35:33,740
But it's really accurate.

497
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,475
Don't worry.

498
00:35:35,475 --> 00:35:37,667
I will watch out for Kang Sihan.

499
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:54,500
Han Qing.

500
00:35:55,642 --> 00:35:59,326
Shouldn't you be meeting your old lover?

501
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,550
Pass a message for me and ask her.

502
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:06,417
Has she been living as Lan Lan for too long

503
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:10,009
that she has forgotten what kind of person I am?

504
00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:14,726
What happens to people

505
00:36:14,726 --> 00:36:17,792
that go against me?

506
00:36:18,534 --> 00:36:20,534
You know best.

507
00:36:23,018 --> 00:36:24,751
Go advise her.

508
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:27,809
It's not too late to turn back.

509
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:30,292
I will give her a chance, or else.

510
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,851
You understand.

511
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:37,225
Yes.

512
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,209
Miss Lan, you're early.

513
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:37,999
Yes, what a coincidence.

514
00:37:38,684 --> 00:37:41,225
Miss Lan, you don't look well.

515
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:42,992
Remember to have more fruits.

516
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:45,909
Miss Lan, your magazine shoot for this issue is really good.

517
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:48,042
So feminine.

518
00:38:02,475 --> 00:38:04,199
Act cooler.

519
00:38:07,751 --> 00:38:10,726
Stop. Lan Lan, what's wrong?

520
00:38:10,726 --> 00:38:13,350
We are shooting a strong career woman, not a grumpy old lady.

521
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,434
Can you focus?

522
00:38:15,434 --> 00:38:16,834
I am sorry.

523
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:18,959
I'm not myself today.

524
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:21,626
Then we will do it tomorrow.

525
00:38:21,626 --> 00:38:23,899
That's all for today?

526
00:38:23,899 --> 00:38:25,750
Didn't we just start?

527
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,200
We'll do it again tomorrow.

528
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:39,350
Zhang Xiao, are you free?

529
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,292
I want to talk to you.

530
00:38:41,992 --> 00:38:44,751
We have nothing to talk about.

531
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,642
I need to explain to you about that day.

532
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:52,742
I misunderstood you.

533
00:38:52,742 --> 00:38:54,492
I apologize.

534
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,783
Let's talk in my room.

535
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:15,950
Claustrophobia?

536
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:21,251
I thought that only happens in fictions.

537
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:24,542
I've had it for many years

538
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:28,125
I know I should not be afraid of the dark.

539
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:31,899
I tell myself all the fears are unreal.

540
00:39:32,992 --> 00:39:35,418
But I can't control myself.

541
00:39:36,726 --> 00:39:38,851
It's that serious?

542
00:39:38,851 --> 00:39:41,534
Have you seen a doctor?

543
00:39:41,534 --> 00:39:45,634
My parents took me to the best psychiatrist in Australia a long time ago.

544
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:47,918
But it was no use.

545
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:50,976
Then I became a model.

546
00:39:50,976 --> 00:39:53,909
My manager thought it would have a negative impact on me,

547
00:39:53,909 --> 00:39:55,918
so I stopped my treatment.

548
00:39:57,434 --> 00:39:59,367
So...

549
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:01,100
Why are you telling me this?

550
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:06,126
I have hurt you too much because of this.

551
00:40:06,934 --> 00:40:09,450
Especially on my birthday.

552
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,375
I embarrassed you in front of so many people.

553
00:40:12,934 --> 00:40:16,225
You don't know how much I regret it.

554
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:19,334
If I don't tell you,

555
00:40:20,617 --> 00:40:22,592
I would feel really bad.

556
00:40:23,575 --> 00:40:26,059
It's all in the past now.

557
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:27,934
We don't need to keep talking about it.

558
00:40:27,934 --> 00:40:29,951
Zhang Xiao.

559
00:40:29,951 --> 00:40:32,400
Are you not willing to forgive me?

560
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:42,300
I knew it.

561
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:45,592
You all think I'm a weirdo.

562
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:58,475
Lan Lan, don't misunderstand.

563
00:40:58,475 --> 00:41:00,834
I don't think you're weird.

564
00:41:01,517 --> 00:41:05,459
I know you couldn't control yourself.

565
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:10,399
If anyone has to apologize, it's me.

566
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:14,500
I was too careless.

567
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,500
I didn't check in advance.

568
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:21,125
Everyone says I'm a supermodel.

569
00:41:23,018 --> 00:41:25,292
Only I understand

570
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,892
that I am an abnormal pathetic person.

571
00:41:30,892 --> 00:41:35,034
Lan Lan, don't say that.

572
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:39,559
I know it's hard being a public figure.

573
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:42,183
You should be nicer to yourself.

574
00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:44,600
Get to know more friends.

575
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,851
Tell them your worries sometimes.

576
00:41:47,851 --> 00:41:50,042
You will feel less stress.

577
00:41:57,042 --> 00:41:58,959
You are so kind.

578
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,434
Can we be friends?

579
00:42:06,434 --> 00:42:08,409
Of course.

580
00:42:08,409 --> 00:42:13,350
But you have to promise me to stop crying.

581
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,334
Your makeup is running.

582
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:19,200
Look at me.

583
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,542
How ridiculous I am when I talk about my disease.

584
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:25,100
I'm sorry.

585
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,309
Aren't we friends already?

586
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:29,175
Why are you saying that?

587
00:42:46,475 --> 00:42:49,099
This is the latest style from New York.

588
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,584
Take it as a token of our friendship.

589
00:42:52,584 --> 00:42:54,851
No, this is too expensive.

590
00:42:54,851 --> 00:42:56,892
I can't take it.

591
00:42:56,892 --> 00:42:58,684
If you don't want to,

592
00:42:58,684 --> 00:43:01,709
it means you are still angry with me.

593
00:43:01,709 --> 00:43:04,225
Here, go try it on.

594
00:43:04,225 --> 00:43:07,184
If it fits, it's yours.

595
00:43:51,909 --> 00:43:53,967
You look good.

596
00:43:54,517 --> 00:43:56,959
You should dress up more.

597
00:44:01,059 --> 00:44:03,684
You are really giving this to me?

598
00:44:03,684 --> 00:44:05,534
Of course.

599
00:44:05,534 --> 00:44:08,200
We're good friends now.

600
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,167
You can't reject my gift.

601
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:12,867
Alright.

602
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,834
What do you like?

603
00:44:15,834 --> 00:44:17,250
Me?

604
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:19,726
I don't need anything.

605
00:44:19,726 --> 00:44:20,934
You don't have to give me anything.

606
00:44:20,934 --> 00:44:22,709
No.

607
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:25,700
My gift won't be as expensive,

608
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,667
but it's the thought that counts.

609
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:30,867
Alright.

610
00:44:30,867 --> 00:44:33,309
I gave you my jacket,

611
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:35,850
so I'll take your jacket too.

612
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:37,610
I really like it.

613
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,475
Alright.

614
00:44:40,475 --> 00:44:43,076
I bet you're busy.

615
00:44:43,076 --> 00:44:46,684
You can go. We will talk another day.

616
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:50,167
Alright. I will leave now.

617
00:44:51,934 --> 00:44:53,999
Don't be sad.

618
00:44:56,726 --> 00:44:58,167
Bye.
