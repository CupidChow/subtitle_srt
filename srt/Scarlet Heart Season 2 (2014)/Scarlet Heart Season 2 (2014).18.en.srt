<i>[Scarlet Heart 2]</i>

2
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,495
<i>[Episode 18]</i>

3
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:45,187
She went missing?

4
00:01:45,187 --> 00:01:46,938
Since yesterday.

5
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:48,754
Did she leave any clues?

6
00:01:52,203 --> 00:01:54,003
One more thing.

7
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:57,454
Lan Lan is my sister.

8
00:02:05,395 --> 00:02:07,229
Does she know that?

9
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:08,919
I don't think so.

10
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:12,579
I heard from my father yesterday.

11
00:02:13,312 --> 00:02:15,062
It still feels like a dream.

12
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:18,162
Xiaoxiao, just from this photo alone...

13
00:02:18,162 --> 00:02:20,320
Not just the photo.

14
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:24,495
Also the magnolia earring I told you about before.

15
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:26,620
I have the same one.

16
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:29,454
It belonged to my mother.

17
00:02:30,187 --> 00:02:34,554
I did suspect that she was my sister,

18
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,919
but she doesn't seem to really like me

19
00:02:38,454 --> 00:02:42,020
nor she doesn't want anything to do with me.

20
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:48,603
She is just scared of her identity getting exposed.

21
00:04:04,187 --> 00:04:08,140
<i>Lan Lan, where are you?</i>

22
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:12,479
<i>I don't care what's going on.</i>

23
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,537
<i>I just want you back.</i>

24
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:34,354
When I gave Yin Zheng the information on Lan Lan,

25
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:36,229
he said he already knew about it.

26
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:38,562
He still loves her.

27
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:39,912
Unbelievable.

28
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:43,562
I've never seen Big Brother so in love with a woman.

29
00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:47,729
Love is like a drug.

30
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:51,803
Once you addicted to it, it's hard to quit.

31
00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:57,395
I looked into the file that Lan Lan's computer sent to Zhen Tian's website.

32
00:04:57,395 --> 00:04:59,520
The data was tampered with.

33
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,062
I think there was something in there that someone was afraid to get out.

34
00:05:03,062 --> 00:05:07,512
Why wasn't the person who stole Lan Lan's computer captured on the cameras?

35
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:09,412
That person is smart.

36
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:13,562
That apartment's security system was under maintenance the day he stole the computer.

37
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,479
Then...

38
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,037
It might've been an insider.

39
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,671
Who could it be?

40
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:39,112
- This way.
- Zheng'er.

41
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:41,854
Second Uncle.

42
00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:43,771
Han Qing, you can go ahead.

43
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:46,419
Okay.

44
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:49,187
You may serve the dishes.

45
00:05:49,187 --> 00:05:50,646
Okay.

46
00:06:05,312 --> 00:06:09,646
Zheng'er, I heard about the situation.

47
00:06:09,646 --> 00:06:12,387
I can't believe it.

48
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:15,270
I asked someone to look into Lan Lan's background.

49
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,646
She left Australia when she was nineteen.

50
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:21,571
It's most likely she went to Thailand.

51
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:24,187
So I wanted to ask for your help.

52
00:06:24,187 --> 00:06:25,771
Look into her background in Thailand.

53
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:27,238
No problem.

54
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:30,645
I'll ask everyone I know in Thailand.

55
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:34,254
Thank you.

56
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:37,787
But I have something to tell you.

57
00:06:37,787 --> 00:06:40,162
Don't get mad.

58
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:43,129
You should focus on your career.

59
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:46,854
I don't want to see you like this.

60
00:06:46,854 --> 00:06:51,437
I believe that your father wouldn't want to see you like this either.

61
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:53,229
I understand.

62
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,562
Be strong.

63
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:57,979
If you fall down,

64
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:00,996
you're giving others what they want.

65
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:04,546
I'll readjust myself.

66
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:08,771
I'm actually analyzing the accident myself.

67
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:13,995
I think the person who hurt Lan Lan actually wants to target you.

68
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:17,429
What do you mean?

69
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,270
You're a smart one.

70
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,419
I don't need to say it.

71
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:26,838
Kang Sihan?

72
00:07:26,838 --> 00:07:28,212
Yes.

73
00:07:28,212 --> 00:07:30,520
He was not in Beijing when it happened.

74
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,562
Where was he?

75
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:36,395
His assistant Zhuo Yue was also not in Beijing.

76
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:40,129
Zheng'er, to see the problem you have to connect all of the pieces.

77
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:43,420
Only then will the truth be uncovered.

78
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,245
You can't just focus on one thing.

79
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:49,337
Otherwise you'll be blinded by the lies.

80
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:53,019
I understand.

81
00:07:53,537 --> 00:07:55,920
I will continue to look into it.

82
00:07:56,854 --> 00:07:58,938
Great.

83
00:07:58,938 --> 00:08:01,962
You can look into it,

84
00:08:01,962 --> 00:08:04,979
but you have to be careful.

85
00:08:44,162 --> 00:08:47,437
Director Yin, I heard from Hong Kong.

86
00:08:47,437 --> 00:08:49,270
Miss Lan Lan isn't there.

87
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,562
I've sent people to guard the cafe and club you two often go to.

88
00:08:53,562 --> 00:08:56,003
But there's no sign of her there either.

89
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,687
Continue to look for her.

90
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:01,170
I will.

91
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:06,262
Director Yin, Chairman will be back next Monday.

92
00:09:06,771 --> 00:09:09,620
I've stopped the news from getting out from the crew.

93
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,237
Think about how to explain this to the chairman before he gets back.

94
00:09:15,912 --> 00:09:18,704
There's nothing I can explain.

95
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:23,095
This is a serious matter.

96
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,462
He'll hold me responsible.

97
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:30,829
The situation with the hairpin is already giving us a hard time.

98
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:33,312
If someone tries to use this incident against us,

99
00:09:33,312 --> 00:09:35,270
I can't even imagine the consequences.

100
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,612
I can't do anything about it.

101
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:42,846
Go on with your day.

102
00:09:42,846 --> 00:09:44,203
Okay.

103
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,554
This way.

104
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,479
Miss.

105
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:08,120
- Sir, please take a look at the menu.
- No need.

106
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,796
Just serve the five dishes I usually order.

107
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:13,462
Do you want to order any drinks?

108
00:10:14,495 --> 00:10:16,420
Do you want anything to drink?

109
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:21,671
Give her a low-alcohol beverage.

110
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:23,919
Okay, please wait.

111
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:28,520
Why did you ask me to come?

112
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,095
Just say it.

113
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,296
I hope that you can continue to act as Lan Lan and finish shooting the drama.

114
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,919
Are you kidding me, Director Yin?

115
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,504
Does it look like I'm kidding?

116
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:43,720
No way.

117
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,420
I shouldn't even have agreed to stand in for Lan Lan in the first place.

118
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:52,120
I can't even act.

119
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,119
I don't think you understand how serious this is.

120
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,562
The company lost a lot because of this incident.

121
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:02,687
Aside from the financial losses,

122
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:07,537
our reputation has also declined because of this accident.

123
00:11:08,554 --> 00:11:10,687
I'm sure you know the chairman well.

124
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:14,838
He cares a lot about the company's reputation and image.

125
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,879
Have you forgotten about the hairpin incident?

126
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,629
I almost lost my job because of that.

127
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:30,245
I can't take another blow.

128
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:37,071
I know this is hard for you.

129
00:11:38,412 --> 00:11:42,487
But if Lan Lan also wished for you to help,

130
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:45,071
would you help her?

131
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:51,495
That's all I have to say.

132
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:53,146
You should think about it.

133
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,812
But I don't know how to act.

134
00:11:58,812 --> 00:12:01,979
That's not our biggest concern.

135
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:05,087
You just have to let the chairman believe that you are Lan Lan.

136
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:07,954
I will help you in any way I can.

137
00:12:07,954 --> 00:12:09,879
Let me think about it.

138
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,771
The food isn't here yet.

139
00:12:15,504 --> 00:12:16,945
No thanks.

140
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:20,479
I don't have an appetite anymore after listening to you.

141
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:24,487
Finishing this meal will be like selling myself.

142
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,162
That's not why I'm treating you to a meal.

143
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:34,120
It's because I still owe you a thank you.

144
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:38,554
Sit down.

145
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:49,612
Did you forget when I got drunk and slept on your sofa?

146
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,379
Why did you get so drunk last time?

147
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:57,479
If I took a photo to show you,

148
00:12:57,479 --> 00:13:00,019
you would be scared of yourself too.

149
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:02,187
Was I that terrifying?

150
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:03,630
Yes.

151
00:13:04,662 --> 00:13:06,020
Fine.

152
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:11,062
You can't tell anyone about it after you finish this meal.

153
00:13:12,312 --> 00:13:15,771
So you're not trying to say thank you,

154
00:13:15,771 --> 00:13:17,512
but instead trying to keep my mouth shut?

155
00:13:18,354 --> 00:13:20,330
You can consider it that.

156
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:37,979
Please enjoy.

157
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:39,562
Try it.

158
00:13:39,562 --> 00:13:44,103
This restaurant serves the best mushroom truffle soup in this city.

159
00:13:44,103 --> 00:13:50,038
You should also drink a low-alcohol cocktail if you want to drink.

160
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,520
I don't want to carry a drunk person home later.

161
00:14:11,062 --> 00:14:13,620
Is there something else you want to ask me?

162
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:20,612
Do you still blame me for what happened to my sister?

163
00:14:24,537 --> 00:14:28,420
I actually never blamed you.

164
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,879
I know it's not your fault.

165
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:36,387
I was just so worried.

166
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,750
Hello?

167
00:14:41,938 --> 00:14:43,912
Let Zhao Xiao take her place.

168
00:14:44,646 --> 00:14:47,103
Don't let others know about it.

169
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:49,604
You must say she is Lan Lan.

170
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:52,362
You guys have to treat her as Lan Lan.

171
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:58,671
Please be careful while shooting.

172
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:01,245
Call me if you need any help.

173
00:15:01,245 --> 00:15:02,145
Okay.

174
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:04,020
Director Kang.

175
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,079
What are you trying to do?

176
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:07,095
Why can't you leave Zhang Xiao alone?

177
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:12,054
Sorry, I'll call you back later.

178
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:23,529
Don't you think it's best for the company

179
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:27,379
to have Zhang Xiao finish the drama for Lan Lan?

180
00:15:28,203 --> 00:15:30,479
You're saying it's for the company,

181
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:33,803
but you're actually doing this to avoid responsibility.

182
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:38,020
I don't deny that.

183
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:42,420
But I've told Zhang Xiao everything she needs to know.

184
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,854
She doesn't know how dangerous this is.

185
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:48,187
Zhang Xiao is her own person.

186
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,103
She can make her own decisions.

187
00:15:51,103 --> 00:15:53,520
She's not your accessory.

188
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,395
She can make her own decisions.

189
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:58,562
You're keeping her in the dark.

190
00:15:58,562 --> 00:16:02,054
You're taking advantage of her kindness to share your responsibility.

191
00:16:02,054 --> 00:16:04,646
I'm not capable of that.

192
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:06,838
She made her decision.

193
00:16:06,838 --> 00:16:08,919
You don't need to be involved.

194
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:13,370
If anything happens to her, I won't let you off.

195
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:25,354
How was your trip to America?

196
00:16:25,354 --> 00:16:28,629
I settled all our business.

197
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:32,938
How has the company been?

198
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:37,000
Zheng'er, is the filming going well?

199
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:39,646
Everything is fine.

200
00:16:39,646 --> 00:16:41,495
That's good.

201
00:16:41,495 --> 00:16:43,019
I'm not in a rush to go home.

202
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,420
Bring me to the filming site.

203
00:16:47,203 --> 00:16:50,520
Chairman, you just got off a 12-hour flight.

204
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,938
You must be tired.

205
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:54,120
You still haven't gotten used to the time difference.

206
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,245
Why don't you rest before going?

207
00:16:56,245 --> 00:16:59,754
I started flying all over the world at the age of 34.

208
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:02,212
I fly at least once a month.

209
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:04,879
Time difference is nothing to me.

210
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:07,437
But the crew has been filming off-site.

211
00:17:07,437 --> 00:17:09,504
It's a bad environment.

212
00:17:09,504 --> 00:17:10,729
Yes.

213
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,254
I was there two days ago.

214
00:17:12,254 --> 00:17:14,587
It was pretty bad.

215
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:18,462
It's fine.

216
00:17:18,462 --> 00:17:20,103
Let's go now.

217
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:21,270
Fine.

218
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,019
I'll call them to make an appointment.

219
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:25,962
I'm just going for a short visit.

220
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,037
Don't disturb their work.

221
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,230
Hello?

222
00:17:36,387 --> 00:17:38,504
Chairman is coming to visit.

223
00:17:38,504 --> 00:17:40,420
He'll be there in an hour.

224
00:17:41,554 --> 00:17:42,846
What?

225
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:46,420
Lan Lan caught the flu yesterday?

226
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,562
She lost her voice?

227
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:50,454
Okay.

228
00:17:50,454 --> 00:17:54,620
Chairman, they said they're not shooting Lan Lan's scenes today because she's sick.

229
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,479
Let's visit her next time.

230
00:17:57,996 --> 00:17:59,370
No.

231
00:18:01,454 --> 00:18:03,854
Let's make sure she's okay.

232
00:18:03,854 --> 00:18:05,390
Okay.

233
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,920
Go to the shooting site.

234
00:18:28,412 --> 00:18:29,229
Chairman.

235
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:30,454
Miss Lan.

236
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:33,354
I heard you were sick, so I came to visit you.

237
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:36,754
Thank you, please come in.

238
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:46,003
Are you feeling better?

239
00:18:47,062 --> 00:18:49,337
I still feel a bit sick.

240
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,987
But the doctor gave me some medicine so I should recover in the next couple of days.

241
00:18:51,987 --> 00:18:55,996
You should take care of yourself no matter what.

242
00:18:56,562 --> 00:19:01,120
Miss Lan, I heard you did ballet in Australia,

243
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,895
and that you danced well.

244
00:19:04,604 --> 00:19:07,270
Yes, I did ballet for a bit.

245
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,604
That's great.

246
00:19:08,604 --> 00:19:10,846
We're having guests over in a few days.

247
00:19:10,846 --> 00:19:14,295
The client's wife is a ballet dancer.

248
00:19:14,295 --> 00:19:18,419
I want to invite you to my house to dance for us.

249
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:22,354
But I currently have the flu.

250
00:19:22,354 --> 00:19:23,879
I'm not telling you to perform now.

251
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:26,087
You'll be better when the time comes.

252
00:19:28,754 --> 00:19:30,779
I haven't danced in a while.

253
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:34,787
I'm sure you still know the basics, right?

254
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:39,637
Are you going to keep rejecting me?

255
00:19:41,854 --> 00:19:43,304
Chairman.

256
00:19:43,938 --> 00:19:45,671
Miss Lan Lan is sick.

257
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:47,062
She won't be able to dance well.

258
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:50,112
I'm not testing her dance skills.

259
00:19:50,812 --> 00:19:53,879
She twisted her leg two days ago.

260
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:55,295
Is your leg better now?

261
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:56,979
Not yet.

262
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:58,562
She can't dance then.

263
00:19:58,562 --> 00:20:01,020
I wanted to see if she could do ballet.

264
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:06,229
How long were you planning on lying to me?

265
00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:08,620
Yin Zheng,

266
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,754
did you think you could trick me because I'm old now?

267
00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:11,495
Chairman.

268
00:20:11,495 --> 00:20:14,054
Stop.

269
00:20:14,054 --> 00:20:16,812
I hate lies.

270
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:18,696
You disappoint me.

271
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,838
Xiaoxiao.

272
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:40,337
Chairman.

273
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:42,662
Why are you avoiding me?

274
00:20:43,787 --> 00:20:44,912
Sorry.

275
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:47,938
I don't blame you completely.

276
00:20:47,938 --> 00:20:50,312
Sihan told me.

277
00:20:50,312 --> 00:20:53,629
I know Lan Lan's accident caused you a lot of distress.

278
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:57,604
I would've never thought she was actually your sister.

279
00:20:57,604 --> 00:21:00,912
I'm sorry about what happened to her.

280
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:05,019
I can understand why you wanted to help Yin Zheng.

281
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:09,462
But you still have to stand on principle.

282
00:21:09,462 --> 00:21:13,062
Did Director Kang tell you everything?

283
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:16,912
Yes, he knows you well.

284
00:21:16,912 --> 00:21:19,103
I believe in him.

285
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:23,437
Don't push yourself too hard.

286
00:21:23,437 --> 00:21:25,462
Thank you.

287
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:39,295
Morning, Xiaoxiao.

288
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:44,019
Did you tell the chairman?

289
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:44,729
What?

290
00:21:44,729 --> 00:21:46,919
Did you tell him about me standing in for Lan Lan?

291
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,270
Why would I do that?

292
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,062
To force Yin Zheng out of the company.

293
00:21:51,062 --> 00:21:53,203
I didn't do that.

294
00:21:53,203 --> 00:21:55,287
I just explained to my father why you agreed to pretend to be Lan Lan

295
00:21:55,287 --> 00:21:58,720
after he found out about everything.

296
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,170
I didn't expect

297
00:22:07,954 --> 00:22:10,370
for you to think of me like that.

298
00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:34,229
This is you.

299
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:58,938
That's the situation in America.

300
00:22:58,938 --> 00:23:02,954
Let's talk about the filming.

301
00:23:02,954 --> 00:23:07,187
I believe everyone knows about the car accident.

302
00:23:07,187 --> 00:23:10,604
Miss Lan Lan was injured and disfigured.

303
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:12,938
And she's missing now.

304
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:18,504
This incident almost resulted in big losses for the company.

305
00:23:18,504 --> 00:23:21,819
As the person in charge,

306
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:25,337
Yin Zheng is fully responsible.

307
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:29,896
I have decided to downgrade his position

308
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:32,354
and transfer him to the Logistics Department as the supervisor.

309
00:23:32,354 --> 00:23:34,387
Chairman.

310
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:37,712
That's such a heavy punishment.

311
00:23:37,712 --> 00:23:40,938
What happened to Lan Lan was an accident.

312
00:23:40,938 --> 00:23:43,546
And the police are already investigating.

313
00:23:43,546 --> 00:23:48,245
We should make a decision after the report is out.

314
00:23:48,245 --> 00:23:51,495
- Yes.
- An accident is not an excuse to escape responsibility.

315
00:23:51,495 --> 00:23:55,919
I'm not angry because of the accident itself,

316
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,787
but because Yin Zheng's response to it was terrible.

317
00:23:59,787 --> 00:24:03,270
He tried to keep me in the dark to escape responsibility.

318
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,971
I can't tolerate this.

319
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:07,754
But the company can't go without a leader.

320
00:24:07,754 --> 00:24:08,754
Yes.

321
00:24:08,754 --> 00:24:11,437
That's what I'm going to address next.

322
00:24:11,437 --> 00:24:16,087
Kang Sihan reacted well in this matter.

323
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:19,396
He minimized the company's losses.

324
00:24:19,396 --> 00:24:20,854
I'm extremely satisfied.

325
00:24:20,854 --> 00:24:25,120
So I decided to let him take over Yin Zheng's position

326
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,579
as the acting vice president.

327
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,462
Chairman, that's a wise decision.

328
00:25:19,562 --> 00:25:22,796
Director Yin, let me help you.

329
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:26,604
It's okay, I'm pretty much done.

330
00:25:26,604 --> 00:25:30,203
I'm not the vice president anymore.

331
00:25:30,203 --> 00:25:32,312
Don't address me as so.

332
00:25:32,312 --> 00:25:33,537
We'll get through this together.

333
00:25:33,537 --> 00:25:35,920
I'm joining you in the Logistics Department.

334
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:40,896
You have to hang in there.

335
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:42,979
Stay here and do your job.

336
00:25:42,979 --> 00:25:45,604
But you can't just let it be.

337
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:48,038
The chairman was in America all this time.

338
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:51,270
There was no way for him to find out about this.

339
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,812
It must've been Kang Sihan who told the chairman.

340
00:25:53,812 --> 00:25:56,554
Yes, we can't just let this be.

341
00:25:57,954 --> 00:26:00,204
So you have to stay here.

342
00:26:01,262 --> 00:26:03,387
Keep an eye on him.

343
00:26:03,387 --> 00:26:05,729
Let me know if you find anything.

344
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:07,119
Got it.

345
00:26:07,954 --> 00:26:12,354
I won't let him sit too comfortably in your chair.

346
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:18,671
Let's go.

347
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,119
Do you need my help?

348
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,479
No thanks.

349
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:31,687
This is Assistant Qiao.

350
00:26:31,687 --> 00:26:34,270
She is very good at her job,

351
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,854
and an excellent assistant.

352
00:26:36,854 --> 00:26:39,771
Zhuo Yue, learn from Assistant Qiao.

353
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:41,195
I will.

354
00:26:43,829 --> 00:26:47,019
Assistant Qiao, be a good assistant to Director Kang.

355
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:47,919
Don't let me down.

356
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,896
Don't worry, I will do my best.

357
00:26:50,896 --> 00:26:55,637
Yin Zheng, you can learn something from your time at the Logistics Department.

358
00:26:55,637 --> 00:26:58,003
I hope you'll like it there.

359
00:26:58,537 --> 00:27:02,029
Of course.

360
00:27:02,796 --> 00:27:04,662
One more thing,

361
00:27:04,662 --> 00:27:09,370
Don't ask Zhang Xiao to do any favors for you anymore.

362
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,871
She's kind and naive.

363
00:27:10,871 --> 00:27:12,546
Stop harassing her.

364
00:27:12,546 --> 00:27:14,671
Thank you for your advice.

365
00:27:23,412 --> 00:27:25,687
Cleverness may overreach itself.

366
00:27:28,103 --> 00:27:31,671
Assistant Qiao, I hope you're different from him.

367
00:27:31,671 --> 00:27:33,687
Do your best.

368
00:27:33,687 --> 00:27:36,246
Zhuo Yue, bring our stuff in.

369
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:47,103
He still ends up taking responsibility for the actress' accident.

370
00:27:47,103 --> 00:27:50,895
It's because he isn't the chairman's biological son.

371
00:28:03,562 --> 00:28:05,604
Director Yin, let me help you.

372
00:28:05,604 --> 00:28:06,812
No thanks.

373
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:09,187
You don't have to call me Director Yin anymore.

374
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,687
Don't say that, Director Yin.

375
00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:13,229
You'll just be in the Logistics Department for a few days.

376
00:28:13,229 --> 00:28:15,337
You'll go back to being Vice President soon.

377
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,379
What's with the act?

378
00:28:24,812 --> 00:28:26,920
Congratulations.

379
00:28:31,729 --> 00:28:33,896
I have good news.

380
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:35,712
Director Yin has been transferred to another department,

381
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:39,762
and Director Kang is now taking his position as Vice President.

382
00:28:39,762 --> 00:28:42,729
You'll be Vice President's wife.

383
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:46,429
Remember me if anything good comes your way.

384
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:52,754
Listen up.

385
00:28:52,754 --> 00:28:54,604
Let's go karaokeing tonight.

386
00:28:54,604 --> 00:28:55,896
My treat.

387
00:28:55,896 --> 00:28:58,129
Great!

388
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,329
Jack.

389
00:29:00,996 --> 00:29:02,020
Are you alright?

390
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,604
No.

391
00:29:03,604 --> 00:29:06,020
I am happy for you.

392
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,712
Let's hug.

393
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,687
No thanks.

394
00:29:08,687 --> 00:29:10,962
I have nothing to be happy about.

395
00:29:10,962 --> 00:29:14,187
You can find Director Kang if you are happy.

396
00:29:14,187 --> 00:29:16,395
Director Kang?

397
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:18,771
Director Kang, great timing.

398
00:29:18,771 --> 00:29:19,979
Congratulations on your promotion.

399
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:22,354
I always knew you were outstanding.

400
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:24,879
I'm sure you'll become the chairman in the future.

401
00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:26,629
I was just discussing with Zhang Xiao

402
00:29:26,629 --> 00:29:28,671
if we should go to the baths or...

403
00:29:28,671 --> 00:29:31,329
Xiaoxiao, I have something to tell you.

404
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:33,103
What is it?

405
00:29:33,103 --> 00:29:36,029
Let's go somewhere else.

406
00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:41,354
Director Kang, you didn't answer me yet.

407
00:29:41,354 --> 00:29:43,395
I'm so jealous.

408
00:29:43,395 --> 00:29:45,287
Not only has Zhang Xiao found the perfect man,

409
00:29:45,287 --> 00:29:47,379
but he's also the blue chip among perfect men.

410
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:48,920
You know nothing.

411
00:29:52,537 --> 00:29:55,437
Every man is a blue chip.

412
00:29:55,437 --> 00:29:56,896
All stocks can earn money.

413
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:59,938
There are just people who don't know how to invest.

414
00:29:59,938 --> 00:30:00,854
Get to work.

415
00:30:00,854 --> 00:30:03,612
If you can't finish, you don't have to come into work tomorrow.

416
00:30:05,229 --> 00:30:08,019
Congratulations on your promotion.

417
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:11,312
Xiaoxiao, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

418
00:30:11,312 --> 00:30:14,162
Please trust that I wasn't the one who told.

419
00:30:14,162 --> 00:30:15,604
I'm sorry.

420
00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:17,912
I shouldn't have said that to you.

421
00:30:17,912 --> 00:30:20,354
It was all a blur.

422
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:21,595
Sorry.

423
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:25,646
I don't want our relationship to be influenced by others.

424
00:30:25,646 --> 00:30:27,340
I get that.

425
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,038
I'm really sorry.

426
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:30,579
It's fine.

427
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,771
Stop saying sorry.

428
00:30:32,771 --> 00:30:36,579
I just want you to trust me.

429
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:40,979
There's still something I don't understand.

430
00:30:40,979 --> 00:30:42,346
Go on.

431
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:45,245
How did the chairman find out?

432
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:47,395
It's impossible to keep everything hidden.

433
00:30:47,395 --> 00:30:50,145
Dad has eyes all over the company.

434
00:30:50,145 --> 00:30:53,062
He was bound to find out sooner or later.

435
00:30:53,062 --> 00:30:58,919
That's why I tried to stop you.

436
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,103
Dad hates lies the most.

437
00:31:02,103 --> 00:31:06,954
Yin Zheng received a heavy punishment because he crossed the line.

438
00:31:09,646 --> 00:31:11,245
I see.

439
00:31:15,979 --> 00:31:18,212
Are you worried about him?

440
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:20,938
No.

441
00:31:20,938 --> 00:31:25,145
We should have celebrate your promotion tonight.

442
00:31:25,145 --> 00:31:30,687
No, we should celebrate our reconciliation tonight.

443
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:32,037
Okay.

444
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,700
<i>[Yin Zheng]
[Logistics Department Minister]</i>

445
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:49,954
I need you to give me a report by tomorrow afternoon.

446
00:31:49,954 --> 00:31:53,187
Give me a detailed report of your current work

447
00:31:53,187 --> 00:31:55,245
and any drawbacks.

448
00:31:55,245 --> 00:31:57,370
I want an effective plan

449
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:00,270
on how to offset these drawbacks.

450
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:04,671
Of course, if you think there are any rules that are unreasonable,

451
00:32:04,671 --> 00:32:06,562
please also write that down.

452
00:32:06,562 --> 00:32:08,103
What's there to write?

453
00:32:08,103 --> 00:32:09,912
Ridiculous.

454
00:32:09,912 --> 00:32:12,245
We are just a useless department.

455
00:32:12,245 --> 00:32:14,246
Why is he taking this so seriously?

456
00:32:17,287 --> 00:32:21,312
I know this department doesn't have sales targets,

457
00:32:21,312 --> 00:32:23,938
but that doesn't mean we aren't important.

458
00:32:23,938 --> 00:32:29,620
This department is an important safeguard for all the various departments to excel in various projects.

459
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,229
It affects the immediate interests of each employee,

460
00:32:32,229 --> 00:32:37,020
which affects their efficiency and work progress.

461
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,612
These are all interrelated.

462
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:44,204
I know most of you might have already gotten used to slow progress.

463
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,287
But from today onwards,

464
00:32:47,287 --> 00:32:49,629
please wake up.

465
00:32:51,812 --> 00:32:56,619
I am here today to change the attitude of this department.

466
00:32:56,619 --> 00:32:58,337
Understand?

467
00:32:58,337 --> 00:33:00,119
Yes.

468
00:33:02,412 --> 00:33:05,145
Are all the people in charge of the logistics department all here?

469
00:33:05,145 --> 00:33:07,579
The person in charge of the restaurant is not here.

470
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:09,103
It's lunch time soon.

471
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:11,354
I think he's busy.

472
00:33:12,662 --> 00:33:14,979
I will talk with him later on.

473
00:33:14,979 --> 00:33:16,854
Listen up.

474
00:33:16,854 --> 00:33:19,812
Hand me your reports by tomorrow afternoon.

475
00:33:19,812 --> 00:33:22,687
It's also fine if you don't want to.

476
00:33:22,687 --> 00:33:24,790
Just hand in your resignation letters.

477
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,590
- Resignation letter?
- Meeting dismissed.

478
00:33:34,354 --> 00:33:37,029
- He's here.
- Let's go.

479
00:33:44,145 --> 00:33:46,103
Waiter.

480
00:33:46,103 --> 00:33:47,312
Director Yin.

481
00:33:47,312 --> 00:33:49,038
It's Supervisor Yin now.

482
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:51,646
I'm still used to calling you Director Yin.

483
00:33:51,646 --> 00:33:53,354
Is the person in charge of the restaurant here?

484
00:33:53,354 --> 00:33:54,520
I saw him just now.

485
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,354
I'll get him for you.

486
00:33:55,354 --> 00:33:56,896
It's okay.

487
00:33:56,896 --> 00:33:58,646
Get him after I finish eating.

488
00:33:58,646 --> 00:34:01,229
Okay, I'll tell him.

489
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,729
<i>Yin Zheng agreed to go to the logistics department.</i>

490
00:34:12,729 --> 00:34:14,337
<i>I don't know what's going on with him.</i>

491
00:34:14,337 --> 00:34:16,162
I got it.

492
00:34:20,245 --> 00:34:23,812
This useless kid has been transferred to the logistics department.

493
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,287
I don't know what's going on in his head.

494
00:34:26,287 --> 00:34:27,954
Stupid.

495
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:30,604
Han Qing.

496
00:34:30,604 --> 00:34:31,996
Help me do something.

497
00:34:31,996 --> 00:34:32,896
What is it?

498
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:36,229
Have Lan Lan jump into the river.

499
00:34:36,229 --> 00:34:39,690
Boss, Ma Wa is missing.

500
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,604
That's exactly why.

501
00:34:42,604 --> 00:34:45,879
My Zheng'er misses her

502
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:47,687
and is just focused on finding her.

503
00:34:47,687 --> 00:34:48,996
Just like...

504
00:34:48,996 --> 00:34:51,137
Just like how you were back then.

505
00:34:53,954 --> 00:34:56,938
I want him to know that bitch is dead now

506
00:34:56,938 --> 00:34:58,687
so he can give up on her.

507
00:34:58,687 --> 00:35:01,145
This is our new sales counter.

508
00:35:01,145 --> 00:35:04,020
This mall opened at the beginning of the new year.

509
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,479
Our best seller is Yue-Sai's rainbow bottle.

510
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,354
The spokesperson is Miss Lan Lan.

511
00:35:12,746 --> 00:35:16,103
Miss, can I have a few minutes of your time?

512
00:35:16,912 --> 00:35:18,537
Lan Lan?

513
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,562
No need to call Yin Zheng.

514
00:35:25,562 --> 00:35:28,287
She is not Lan Lan.

515
00:35:28,287 --> 00:35:31,729
Do you want to learn more about Yue-Sai's customized essence serum?

516
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:34,062
What do you mean by customized?

517
00:35:34,062 --> 00:35:35,671
There are customized products for skin?

518
00:35:35,671 --> 00:35:37,337
Yes, you are right.

519
00:35:37,337 --> 00:35:40,312
Through our unique traditional Chinese medicine consultations,

520
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:44,145
we focus on the three major skin issues that Chinese women are most concerned about

521
00:35:44,145 --> 00:35:46,562
to provide exclusive skincare solutions.

522
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:47,879
Sounds interesting.

523
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,796
Give me a consultation then.

524
00:35:49,796 --> 00:35:51,619
This way.

525
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:59,395
Who approved of those sentences?

526
00:35:59,395 --> 00:36:01,129
Director Yin.

527
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:03,029
No wonder.

528
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:05,587
He's always bragging about himself.

529
00:36:06,938 --> 00:36:09,787
He's not bragging about himself.

530
00:36:09,787 --> 00:36:11,687
He's referring to Lan Lan.

531
00:36:11,687 --> 00:36:13,896
He might seem like a playboy,

532
00:36:13,896 --> 00:36:16,312
but he's actually extremely loyal.

533
00:36:16,312 --> 00:36:17,771
Unlike some people,

534
00:36:17,771 --> 00:36:19,871
who appear to be a gentleman,

535
00:36:19,871 --> 00:36:24,062
but is actually a playboy.

536
00:36:25,704 --> 00:36:30,520
Assistant Qiao, you should mind your words in the workplace.

537
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,579
Otherwise you'll lose out.

538
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:34,754
Also you don't know Yin Zheng.

539
00:36:34,754 --> 00:36:36,729
I've known him for ten years.

540
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:40,687
I think you're the one who doesn't understand him.

541
00:36:40,687 --> 00:36:41,938
In that case,

542
00:36:41,938 --> 00:36:46,687
you'll get to know Director Kang's good points after working with him for longer.

543
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:51,020
Compared to those who only know how to act and use women to get to their position-

544
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,954
Zhuo Yue, talk less, do more.

545
00:37:00,254 --> 00:37:04,729
Supervisor Yin, you fired six chefs and two cleaners this afternoon.

546
00:37:04,729 --> 00:37:07,354
Your efficiency is scary.

547
00:37:07,354 --> 00:37:10,019
Although they say a new leader makes a lot of changes,

548
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:14,087
but these changes may come back to hurt you.

549
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,103
Are you worried I'm setting myself up for failure?

550
00:37:17,103 --> 00:37:17,712
No.

551
00:37:17,712 --> 00:37:19,354
Thank you for your concern.

552
00:37:19,354 --> 00:37:21,854
I know what I am doing.

553
00:37:21,854 --> 00:37:24,554
I have two things to tell you.

554
00:37:24,554 --> 00:37:29,329
First, our restaurant has poor hygiene.

555
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:31,896
Organize a team to do some deep cleaning this afternoon.

556
00:37:31,896 --> 00:37:32,854
Yes.

557
00:37:32,854 --> 00:37:36,437
Second, the company has a lot of employees from Jiangzhe.

558
00:37:36,437 --> 00:37:41,812
But I found that the dishes are more focused on Hunan and Northeastern cuisine.

559
00:37:41,812 --> 00:37:45,546
I hope you can add some of the local cuisine,

560
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:48,437
and add seafood to the ingredients.

561
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:49,787
This...

562
00:37:49,787 --> 00:37:52,395
We can do the cleaning,

563
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:56,479
but it won't be easy to add the new dishes.

564
00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:59,504
You can hire some good chefs from Jiangzhe.

565
00:37:59,504 --> 00:38:02,729
The company has strict rules for the number of chefs we can hire.

566
00:38:02,729 --> 00:38:06,019
We're at capacity.

567
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:08,946
Didn't you see that I just fired six chefs?

568
00:38:10,412 --> 00:38:13,354
You were just worried that I caused trouble for myself.

569
00:38:13,354 --> 00:38:15,329
Now you understand why.

570
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:16,354
Yes.

571
00:38:16,354 --> 00:38:18,145
Get on it then.

572
00:38:18,145 --> 00:38:21,671
I want all the new chefs here by tomorrow afternoon.

573
00:38:21,671 --> 00:38:23,145
Yes, Supervisor Yin.

574
00:38:23,145 --> 00:38:24,546
Go on.

575
00:38:34,287 --> 00:38:36,170
Brother, are you alright?

576
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:39,145
You are too cruel.

577
00:38:39,145 --> 00:38:42,120
I think it's fine.

578
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,387
It hasn't even been three hours.

579
00:38:44,387 --> 00:38:47,546
But I'm finding myself liking this department already.

580
00:38:47,546 --> 00:38:51,062
I finally understand why you like staying in the kitchen so much.

581
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,454
Stop making jokes.

582
00:38:52,454 --> 00:38:54,179
I know the punishment is heavy.

583
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:57,312
It's a waste of your talents for them to send you here.

584
00:38:57,312 --> 00:38:59,938
I think there's too much stress that comes with being the Vice President anyways.

585
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:02,687
I'm considering this a vacation.

586
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:04,019
This isn't how you take a vacation.

587
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:06,537
You already fired so many people.

588
00:39:06,537 --> 00:39:09,229
It's fun to do a good job.

589
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,520
You better do your job well.

590
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,229
Don't disappoint me.

591
00:39:13,229 --> 00:39:15,654
Otherwise, you're my next target.

592
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,838
This is not his style at all.

593
00:39:28,979 --> 00:39:31,462
Now you can open your eyes.

594
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:41,837
You reopened Z&X.

595
00:39:43,245 --> 00:39:44,546
When is the grand opening?

596
00:39:44,546 --> 00:39:46,096
Tomorrow.

597
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,829
Congratulations.

598
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:52,103
You finally did it.

599
00:39:52,103 --> 00:39:53,595
Thank you.

600
00:39:54,162 --> 00:40:00,520
I promised my mother that I would open a perfume shop using our names.

601
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,270
My mother loved using perfume when she was alive.

602
00:40:07,103 --> 00:40:10,837
You have a great relationship with your mother.

603
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,454
But my mother left me too soon.

604
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,820
I still remember her smell.

605
00:40:24,938 --> 00:40:27,119
She would be proud of you.

606
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,771
Black Cat Detective.

607
00:40:33,771 --> 00:40:37,062
Since you're working for Zhen Tian now,

608
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:40,204
you should try to make amends with Yin Zheng.

609
00:40:53,354 --> 00:40:56,412
Do you hate him?

610
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:02,612
I would be lying if I said I don't hate him.

611
00:41:03,262 --> 00:41:07,162
But I also think he's quite miserable.

612
00:41:07,162 --> 00:41:09,120
I guess it's retribution.

613
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,212
So I don't think much of it.

614
00:41:12,662 --> 00:41:17,954
His demotion must be really difficult for him.

615
00:41:17,954 --> 00:41:20,471
I guess it's a punishment.

616
00:41:22,604 --> 00:41:28,996
But if you can work alongside him at Zhen Tian,

617
00:41:28,996 --> 00:41:32,779
it's good news for the chairman.

618
00:41:34,771 --> 00:41:40,062
Can we kick Yin Zheng out of our world?

619
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:42,187
Let's just be the two of us.

620
00:41:48,812 --> 00:41:50,045
Let's go.

621
00:41:50,045 --> 00:41:51,379
Okay.

622
00:41:56,562 --> 00:41:57,812
I'm so hungry.

623
00:41:57,812 --> 00:42:01,212
I hope there's pork chops at the restaurant.

624
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:08,020
So tell me how far along you are in your relationship with Director Kang.

625
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,420
Have you guys...

626
00:42:14,354 --> 00:42:16,103
What?

627
00:42:16,103 --> 00:42:18,796
Have you taken him down?

628
00:42:18,796 --> 00:42:21,229
What are you talking about?

629
00:42:21,229 --> 00:42:22,229
Listen.

630
00:42:22,229 --> 00:42:24,929
Don't take too long.

631
00:42:24,929 --> 00:42:27,829
You should find some time to go out with him.

632
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:32,587
When you two are alone and you feel the passion, take him down.

633
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:37,520
But it's best if you don't go to the mountains now.

634
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,354
Why?

635
00:42:39,354 --> 00:42:41,203
Let me read it for you.

636
00:42:41,203 --> 00:42:46,604
Mr. Zhang from Beijing went on a trip to the mountains with his family.

637
00:42:46,604 --> 00:42:52,154
They found a terrifying disfigured woman nearby the temple.

638
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:55,245
Sounds terrifying.

639
00:42:55,854 --> 00:42:58,712
Look, there's even a picture.

640
00:42:58,712 --> 00:43:03,529
Why do people always do things to gross themselves out?
