<i>[Episode 10]</i>

3
00:01:57,305 --> 00:01:59,622
Why did you leave without saying goodbye?

4
00:02:01,098 --> 00:02:02,589
Stop asking.

5
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,514
As you can see,

6
00:02:05,514 --> 00:02:07,863
we're different people.

7
00:02:08,747 --> 00:02:11,280
You can't give me the life I currently live.

8
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:13,656
Just go.

9
00:02:16,664 --> 00:02:20,072
Han Qing, come here.

10
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:26,039
Zheng'er.

11
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,914
Keep Miss Lan company.

12
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,163
Han Qing will take care of me.

13
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:32,789
Please enjoy tonight.

14
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:35,347
Okay, don't worry.

15
00:02:35,347 --> 00:02:39,272
I'll make sure to enjoy your father's wine collection.

16
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:41,389
I'll go then.

17
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:42,698
Go ahead.

18
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,263
Lan Lan.

19
00:02:47,263 --> 00:02:49,172
Sorry for leaving you alone all night.

20
00:02:50,222 --> 00:02:51,847
It's time to give my present.

21
00:02:51,847 --> 00:02:53,597
Let's go meet my parents.

22
00:02:53,597 --> 00:02:55,114
I...

23
00:02:55,847 --> 00:02:57,979
I'm nervous.

24
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:00,539
Can you introduce me next time?

25
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:03,914
It's fine. My mom is very kind.

26
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:05,890
They won't hurt you.

27
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,150
Come on.

28
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:17,180
Give me my present.

29
00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:25,314
Come on.

30
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:37,122
Happy Birthday, Chairman.

31
00:03:37,122 --> 00:03:39,931
Mom, this is Lan Lan.

32
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:42,414
Happy Birthday, Chairman.

33
00:03:42,414 --> 00:03:44,155
Hi, Mrs. Kang.

34
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:48,830
Chairman, do you think she looks like Zhang Xiao?

35
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,706
Yes.

36
00:03:51,706 --> 00:03:53,522
I thought that too.

37
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:55,372
Who is Zhang Xiao?

38
00:03:55,372 --> 00:03:57,555
A new employee at the company.

39
00:03:57,555 --> 00:03:59,764
Everyone thinks we look alike,

40
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:03,622
but we're actually completely different people.

41
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:05,475
Please have a seat.

42
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:07,375
Have a seat.

43
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:12,342
Lan Lan is our model for the spring auction.

44
00:04:12,342 --> 00:04:14,350
She just got back from Australia,

45
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,759
and we signed her on as our model.

46
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:20,951
Do your parents live in Australia?

47
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:22,400
Yes.

48
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:27,784
You guys continue.

49
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:31,826
You're alone in Beijing.

50
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:33,600
Do they feel at ease?

51
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,059
No.

52
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:37,200
So they always call me.

53
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,867
But I don't want to stay with them forever.

54
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:42,517
Or else I'll become a spoiled princess who never grows up.

55
00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:45,518
It's good to challenge yourself while you're still young.

56
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:49,909
Chairman, this is your present.

57
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:51,584
What's this?

58
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,267
It's a pocket watch.

59
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:56,209
It's a Botwright made in 1893.

60
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,409
The French minister gave Li Hongzhang this gift

61
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:01,099
on his seventieth birthday.

62
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:03,325
It must be very expensive.

63
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:05,867
Thank you.

64
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:07,309
Take a look.

65
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,680
<i>[Murderer]</i>

66
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:22,620
Chairman.

67
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,709
I'll be right back.

68
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:25,175
Chairman.

69
00:05:34,475 --> 00:05:37,800
Chairman.

70
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:41,300
Do you not like the present I got you?

71
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:43,909
Why are you keeping quiet?

72
00:05:46,018 --> 00:05:47,976
What did I do now?

73
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:50,042
You should at least give me a reason for being angry.

74
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:52,026
Why aren't you saying anything?

75
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:55,475
Chairman.

76
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:58,784
I spent all this time organizing a birthday party for you and this is what I get?

77
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:03,125
You want to hear the truth, right?

78
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,367
Okay, I'll tell you.

79
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:07,751
Don't think I'm trying to flatter you.

80
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:11,209
Do you know why I organized this for you and got you a present?

81
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:15,450
I did it for my mom.

82
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,934
I don't want to put her in an awkward position between us.

83
00:06:17,934 --> 00:06:20,417
I'm patient and tolerant with you.

84
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:22,434
What else do you want me to do?

85
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:23,434
Listen.

86
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:25,600
You have no right to treat me this way.

87
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,670
You murdered my father.

88
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:29,842
Bastard!

89
00:06:29,842 --> 00:06:33,183
Why can't you put what happened 25 years ago in the past?

90
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:36,550
Will you only be happy when I die?

91
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:50,367
Take it over there first.

92
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:55,851
Why are you two here?

93
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:57,183
It's time to cut cake.

94
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,976
Remember how you treated me.

95
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:03,142
Zheng'er.

96
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:05,409
Zhentian.

97
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:07,267
Are you two arguing again?

98
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:09,509
Are you arguing with him over that again?

99
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:11,042
Zhentian.

100
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:12,851
Zhentian, what's going on?

101
00:07:12,851 --> 00:07:15,600
Zheng'er organized such a great party for you.

102
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,892
He got you a gift too.

103
00:07:16,892 --> 00:07:18,500
Are you still mad at him for that?

104
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Zhentian!

105
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:48,100
Chairman!

106
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,492
Where are you going?

107
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:51,267
Anywhere, as far away as possible.

108
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:52,542
Okay.

109
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,400
<i>[Murderer]</i>

110
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,350
Hello?

111
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,509
My dear.

112
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:14,225
I've done what you wanted me to do.

113
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:16,309
Please stay away from me.

114
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:18,700
Don't disturb me again.

115
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,517
Don't forget we're on the same boat.

116
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:25,583
You did great today.

117
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,475
Same as Ma Wa.

118
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:30,820
Very good, I like it.

119
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,250
Good night.

120
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:37,751
Wait a minute.

121
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:44,475
Director Yin.

122
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:46,450
Just leave me alone.

123
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,950
Director Yin, you're injured.

124
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,310
Lan Lan.

125
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:13,240
Bring me home.

126
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,542
Bring me home.

127
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:21,383
Let's go.

128
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,299
Huang Di.

129
00:11:44,475 --> 00:11:46,792
Why did you bring him here?

130
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,250
Disgusting! I just mopped!

131
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,834
Cut the crap and come help.

132
00:11:54,951 --> 00:11:56,183
Hurry up.

133
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,626
Alright.

134
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:00,792
Please count my work into the rent.

135
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:03,509
You're so stingy.

136
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:08,242
He is too heavy.

137
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:12,726
It said online that he was 65 kg.

138
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:14,542
He's weighs way more than that.

139
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:15,684
Cut the crap.

140
00:12:15,684 --> 00:12:16,976
Get me a hot towel

141
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:18,392
and mop the floor.

142
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,859
You're ruining my life.

143
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:28,417
Here.

144
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:31,684
Get to work.

145
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,325
Lan Lan.

146
00:12:51,475 --> 00:12:54,426
Huang Di, come help.

147
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,992
Huang Di!

148
00:12:57,992 --> 00:12:59,684
Come help.

149
00:12:59,684 --> 00:13:01,209
I'm so tired. I don't want to help.

150
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:03,359
I'm taking a shower then sleeping.

151
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:06,809
He's your boss too!

152
00:13:08,018 --> 00:13:11,167
Lan Lan.

153
00:13:12,018 --> 00:13:14,918
Director Yin.

154
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:17,309
I didn't do it.

155
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:22,350
Help me prove it.

156
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,959
I really didn't do it.

157
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:29,399
No matter how much I hate him,

158
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:35,099
I wouldn't mess with him on his birthday.

159
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:37,399
You have to believe me.

160
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:42,542
I believe you.

161
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:51,210
I'm so upset.

162
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,534
<i>I thought he was cold and heartless.</i>

163
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:20,380
<i>I didn't expect for him to cry.</i>

164
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,542
Lan Lan.

165
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:34,918
Lan Lan.

166
00:14:40,392 --> 00:14:42,600
Director Yin, I'm Zhang Xiao.

167
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,225
I'm not Lan Lan.

168
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:46,134
Zhang Xiao.

169
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:51,083
Zhang Xiao.

170
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:57,734
Are you Chairman's spy?

171
00:15:00,492 --> 00:15:02,183
What?

172
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:06,417
Tell me the truth.

173
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:07,925
Are you...

174
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:32,384
Director Yin, your phone.

175
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,834
Director Yin.

176
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,600
Hello?

177
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,642
Lan Lan.

178
00:15:46,642 --> 00:15:48,176
Who are you?

179
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:50,759
I'm Zhang Xiao.

180
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,167
Why do you have Director Yin's phone?

181
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,876
Director Yin is drunk.

182
00:15:56,876 --> 00:15:59,100
He's at my home.

183
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,199
Give me your home address.

184
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,809
He's been asleep for more than half an hour.

185
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:21,892
You can wake him up.

186
00:16:21,892 --> 00:16:24,099
You really know to pretend to be kind.

187
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:26,225
What did you do to him?

188
00:16:26,225 --> 00:16:29,242
I didn't do anything.

189
00:16:29,242 --> 00:16:32,992
He was drunk when I bumped into him on the road.

190
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:36,892
Don't give me excuses.

191
00:16:36,892 --> 00:16:38,417
I'm not.

192
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:42,334
If anything happens to Director Yin,

193
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,250
I won't let you off.

194
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:53,517
Yin Zheng, wake up.

195
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:55,159
I'm Lan Lan.

196
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:57,892
Lan Lan.

197
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,459
Wake up. Let's go home.

198
00:17:08,684 --> 00:17:10,551
Where am I?

199
00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:14,934
Zhang Xiao said she bumped into you on the road.

200
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,667
It's up to you if you want to believe me.

201
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:19,642
Yin Zheng.

202
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:21,892
Do you remember anything?

203
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,976
Did she do anything to you?

204
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:27,225
What are you trying to say?

205
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:29,118
I don't trust you.

206
00:17:29,826 --> 00:17:31,267
Whatever.

207
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:33,018
Just get out.

208
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,999
I need to go to bed soon.

209
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,125
Yin Zheng, what happened to your hand?

210
00:17:48,726 --> 00:17:50,475
What did you do to him?

211
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:52,700
What happened to his hand?

212
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:00,600
Let's go.

213
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:47,384
You can go to bed first.

214
00:19:34,183 --> 00:19:35,742
<i>Give me it.</i>

215
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:38,018
<i>Give it to me!</i>

216
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:48,651
<i>A life for a life!</i>

217
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:50,692
<i>Chenggui!</i>

218
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:52,834
<i>- Chenggui!
- Heaving sand.</i>

219
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:54,309
<i>Xiao Hua!</i>

220
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:57,318
<i>Xiao Hua!</i>

221
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,567
<i>Xiao Hua!</i>

222
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:25,675
<i>Zheng'er.</i>

223
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,834
<i>I'm marrying Uncle Kang.</i>

224
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:33,742
<i>He'll be your father from now on.</i>

225
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:36,517
<i>Don't worry.</i>

226
00:20:36,517 --> 00:20:38,883
<i>He will take care of us.</i>

227
00:20:39,826 --> 00:20:42,351
<i>We will have a new family.</i>

228
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:47,790
<i>Congratulations.</i>

229
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,083
<i>Thank you.</i>

230
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,834
<i>- Cheers.
- Congratulations.</i>

231
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,350
<i>Congratulations.</i>

232
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,810
<i>Thank you.</i>

233
00:22:01,918 --> 00:22:03,342
<i>Zheng'er.</i>

234
00:22:11,392 --> 00:22:14,259
<i>Zheng'er, what's wrong?</i>

235
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:17,834
<i>Zheng'er!</i>

236
00:23:23,726 --> 00:23:26,792
A stepfather is just a phony.

237
00:23:29,434 --> 00:23:32,976
He'll pretend in front of others,

238
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:35,334
worried that they can tell.

239
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:40,740
But he'll never be your real father.

240
00:23:43,492 --> 00:23:48,542
You will never get a father's love from him.

241
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,660
Yes, I know.

242
00:23:57,884 --> 00:23:59,734
When I see you,

243
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:04,617
I think of my neighbor.

244
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:09,575
Your childhood is similar to hers.

245
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:16,709
I can understand your pain.

246
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,742
<i>Zheng'er.</i>

247
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,409
<i>Zheng'er, what's wrong?</i>

248
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:16,934
<i>Zheng'er!</i>

249
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,209
<i>It's alright.</i>

250
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:20,600
<i>He's just being stubborn.</i>

251
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,450
<i>Let him be alone for a bit.</i>

252
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,100
<i>He'll come back after he clears his mind.</i>

253
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,851
<i>Even if you get him now,</i>

254
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:31,670
<i>his heart isn't here with us.</i>

255
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,900
<i>Leave him be.</i>

256
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:44,042
<i>Madam.</i>

257
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,726
<i>We looked in all the places Xiao Zheng usually goes,</i>

258
00:25:45,726 --> 00:25:47,242
<i>but we didn't see him.</i>

259
00:25:47,242 --> 00:25:51,099
<i>Where could he have gone?</i>

260
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:54,392
<i>Zhentian, where are you going?</i>

261
00:25:54,392 --> 00:25:55,475
<i>I'm going out to find him.</i>

262
00:25:55,475 --> 00:25:58,083
<i>But Aunt Rong said she couldn't find him.</i>

263
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,900
<i>There's one more spot.</i>

264
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,192
<i>Zheng'er!</i>

265
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:07,150
<i>Zheng'er, where are you?</i>

266
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,100
<i>Zheng'er!</i>

267
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,125
<i>Zheng'er, where are you?</i>

268
00:26:13,225 --> 00:26:14,909
<i>Zheng'er!</i>

269
00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:20,667
<i>Zheng'er!</i>

270
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,517
<i>Help!</i>

271
00:26:22,517 --> 00:26:25,267
<i>- Help!
- Zheng'er!</i>

272
00:26:25,267 --> 00:26:26,209
<i>Zheng'er!</i>

273
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,459
<i>I'm here! Help me!</i>

274
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:33,375
<i>I'm here!</i>

275
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:34,834
<i>We're coming.</i>

276
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:36,492
<i>Zheng'er!</i>

277
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:40,159
<i>Zheng'er!</i>

278
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,951
<i>- Zheng'er.
- Give me your hand.</i>

279
00:26:44,475 --> 00:26:47,142
<i>Zheng'er, give me your hand.</i>

280
00:26:48,684 --> 00:26:50,500
<i>Zheng'er!</i>

281
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,051
<i>Zhentian.</i>

282
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,142
Zhentian, you still haven't had dinner.

283
00:27:00,142 --> 00:27:01,976
I made supper for you.

284
00:27:01,976 --> 00:27:04,059
Please eat some.

285
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:05,700
Just put it there.

286
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:35,167
Are you asleep?

287
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:56,009
Blow the candle and make a wish.

288
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:20,959
Don't worry about what happened today.

289
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,584
It's my fault.

290
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:24,675
I got too angry.

291
00:28:24,675 --> 00:28:26,299
Zhentian.

292
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:30,159
Thank you for your cake.

293
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:34,675
Sorry for putting you through this.

294
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:38,992
Sorry, please forgive me.

295
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:44,199
I'll talk to Xiao Zheng tomorrow.

296
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:49,934
Do you know what I wished for just now?

297
00:28:49,934 --> 00:28:52,325
What?

298
00:28:52,325 --> 00:28:54,809
A harmonious family.

299
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:00,675
Zhentian.

300
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,459
Second Uncle, I didn't put the photo in there.

301
00:29:31,459 --> 00:29:33,526
I'm being framed.

302
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:37,084
I understand.

303
00:29:37,084 --> 00:29:40,867
Whoever did it wants Zhentian to hate you.

304
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:43,775
Who is he?

305
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:46,934
I'm sure you know.

306
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:54,567
Second Uncle.

307
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,292
I can't stand this anymore.

308
00:29:57,292 --> 00:29:59,600
You must be patient.

309
00:30:00,475 --> 00:30:02,642
For the Yins.

310
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,942
For your father who was killed unjustly.

311
00:30:05,942 --> 00:30:09,651
For the assets that should've belonged to you.

312
00:30:09,651 --> 00:30:12,310
You must be patient.

313
00:30:15,684 --> 00:30:17,417
I feel terrible.

314
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:19,783
I know.

315
00:30:20,334 --> 00:30:24,410
You don't have it easy.

316
00:30:25,434 --> 00:30:27,609
But think about it.

317
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:31,792
You're getting closer to success.

318
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:34,720
You're almost there.

319
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,034
Hang in there.

320
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:43,100
Hang in there.

321
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,292
- Second Uncle.
- Hang in there.

322
00:30:54,475 --> 00:30:55,876
Lan Lan.

323
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,183
Stop it, Han Qing!

324
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:13,183
Why did you leave me?

325
00:31:13,183 --> 00:31:15,259
What can you give me?

326
00:31:18,183 --> 00:31:22,559
I love you.

327
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,199
But I don't love you anymore.

328
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:27,434
Han Qing, just wake up.

329
00:31:27,434 --> 00:31:29,350
I'm Lan Lan.

330
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,209
Ma Wa has disappeared.

331
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:33,092
I'm Lan Lan.

332
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:36,626
You don't love me anymore?

333
00:31:41,434 --> 00:31:43,309
Please get out.

334
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:45,317
Otherwise, I will call the police.

335
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,309
Ma Wa.

336
00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:48,934
Stop it.

337
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:50,951
There's nothing to say.

338
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,459
I won't go back.

339
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:55,742
Ma Wa.

340
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:58,876
Ma Wa.

341
00:32:18,225 --> 00:32:20,600
I did so much for you.

342
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,876
Is this how you're treating me?

343
00:32:30,851 --> 00:32:32,842
There is no justice

344
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,167
in this world.

345
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:38,892
I know you've done a lot for me.

346
00:32:38,892 --> 00:32:42,925
I know you spent a lot of time looking for me.

347
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:47,342
But...

348
00:32:47,992 --> 00:32:50,542
We don't belong to the same world.

349
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,300
Don't push me.

350
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,834
If you force me again,

351
00:33:00,475 --> 00:33:02,667
I will disappear again.

352
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,200
What are you talking about?

353
00:33:10,626 --> 00:33:14,975
If you don't let me go, I'll start shouting.

354
00:33:22,392 --> 00:33:24,759
If I didn't run into you tonight,

355
00:33:27,018 --> 00:33:29,200
I really would've believed you passed away.

356
00:33:31,225 --> 00:33:34,509
But now that I found you,

357
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:42,834
I swear I won't let you disappear again.

358
00:34:16,642 --> 00:34:18,809
Chairman, you're in the wrong office.

359
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:21,542
I came to talk to you.

360
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:22,876
What's up?

361
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:25,784
You want to give me your office?

362
00:34:25,784 --> 00:34:29,600
I was too impulsive last night.

363
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,742
I hope you don't take it to heart.

364
00:34:32,742 --> 00:34:35,475
It doesn't matter.

365
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:37,820
I didn't put that photo in there.

366
00:34:38,475 --> 00:34:40,675
I think there is a mole in our company.

367
00:34:40,675 --> 00:34:42,684
This person knows about our relationship

368
00:34:42,684 --> 00:34:44,542
so he wanted to mess with us.

369
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:47,951
He wants you to hate me.

370
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:49,450
Based on my current analysis,

371
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:54,076
the only one who has the power to do such a thing is Director Liu.

372
00:34:54,076 --> 00:34:56,809
But I don't think he's the mastermind behind this.

373
00:34:56,809 --> 00:34:59,510
Forget about this.

374
00:35:00,283 --> 00:35:02,099
I don't mind it.

375
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,309
That's good.

376
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,100
I don't mind it either.

377
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,350
Many people dislike me.

378
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,876
And many people try to taint my name.

379
00:35:09,876 --> 00:35:12,892
I don't care.

380
00:35:12,892 --> 00:35:14,409
Good.

381
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:21,767
Please finish up your work with Z&X.

382
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:23,517
I want to see the results as soon as possible.

383
00:35:23,517 --> 00:35:26,926
Don't worry. I'll make sure you're satisfied.

384
00:35:39,767 --> 00:35:41,267
Break up?

385
00:35:41,267 --> 00:35:45,618
Xiao Mei, is that house more important than our relationship of ten years?

386
00:35:46,142 --> 00:35:49,450
Are you sure it's me who's being unreasonable and not you?

387
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:52,670
I'm marrying you, not your mom.

388
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,910
Hello?

389
00:36:04,617 --> 00:36:06,626
Are you Mr. Zhuo Yue?

390
00:36:06,626 --> 00:36:07,710
Yes, I am.

391
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,083
And you are?

392
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,590
I'm Qiao Qi.

393
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:14,142
I'm the personal assistant of Zhen Tian Group's Creative Director.

394
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:16,100
What do you want from me?

395
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,934
I'm here on behalf of Director Yin.

396
00:36:17,934 --> 00:36:20,626
Who is Director Yin? I don't know him.

397
00:36:20,626 --> 00:36:21,984
I'll cut to the chase.

398
00:36:21,984 --> 00:36:25,534
Director Yin is Vice President of Zhen Tian Group, Mr. Yin Zheng.

399
00:36:25,534 --> 00:36:27,726
Zheng Tian is in need of talent,

400
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:30,642
especially talented people like you.

401
00:36:30,642 --> 00:36:34,892
If you're willing to do for Zhen Tian what you do for Z&X,

402
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:38,100
Director Yin is willing to pay you more than three times your current salary.

403
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,099
I think you have the wrong person.

404
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:41,434
Go back and tell your director,

405
00:36:41,434 --> 00:36:44,059
I'm not that kind of unscrupulous person.

406
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:45,459
Please do not insult me.

407
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:48,250
Mr. Zhuo, we're living in a different time now.

408
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,475
Wanting to move up in the ladder isn't a shameful thing.

409
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,375
I hope you can think about it.

410
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:56,100
I have nothing to consider.

411
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,559
Take it.

412
00:36:58,225 --> 00:37:00,099
What is this?

413
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:02,642
It's a greeting gift from Director Yin.

414
00:37:02,642 --> 00:37:04,159
If you change your mind,

415
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:06,576
come to find me at Zhen Tian anytime.

416
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,867
Hey! Come back here.

417
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:21,934
How was it?

418
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:24,851
I already met up with the backbones of Z&X.

419
00:37:24,851 --> 00:37:27,076
I also gave them your greeting gifts.

420
00:37:27,076 --> 00:37:31,559
But most of them are still hesitant to join Zhen Tian.

421
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:33,434
Just let them offer their conditions.

422
00:37:33,434 --> 00:37:36,534
We'll try to fulfill it.

423
00:37:37,142 --> 00:37:40,292
Director Yin, I don't think that's the problem.

424
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:44,492
The backbones of Z&X are Kang Sihan's friends who started this business from scratch.

425
00:37:44,492 --> 00:37:47,375
They have a deep connection with Kang Sihan,

426
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,559
especially Zhuo Yue.

427
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,900
He is Kang Sihan's right-hand man.

428
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,859
He...

429
00:37:54,992 --> 00:37:56,867
What?

430
00:37:56,867 --> 00:37:59,734
He says we're poaching snobs.

431
00:38:03,225 --> 00:38:06,100
People die in pursuit of wealth.

432
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,667
Life is about fame and fortune.

433
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:13,918
People who say that are either pretending to be lofty

434
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:15,709
or are really talented.

435
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:18,867
He wants to take this chance to raise the stakes.

436
00:38:18,867 --> 00:38:20,350
Talk to him again.

437
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,470
Offer him a higher salary.

438
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:27,392
I want to see how long he takes to join us.

439
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:28,575
Okay.

440
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:31,409
But I'm still worried.

441
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:35,367
What if our plan doesn't work?

442
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:43,125
President Kang, something happened.

443
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:44,083
What's up?

444
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:47,100
Our two stores suddenly caught fire this morning.

445
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,492
What?

446
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:52,717
Excuse me.

447
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:55,876
Excuse me.

448
00:38:56,684 --> 00:38:57,684
- Someone went inside.
- Who is he?

449
00:38:57,684 --> 00:38:58,976
He's the owner.

450
00:38:58,976 --> 00:38:59,992
We still don't know what's going on.

451
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:01,600
You can't go in.

452
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:39,934
Our direct economic losses from this fire...

453
00:39:39,934 --> 00:39:40,934
Don't say it.

454
00:39:40,934 --> 00:39:42,400
President Kang.

455
00:39:49,626 --> 00:39:51,684
Director Shen, yes.

456
00:39:51,684 --> 00:39:54,142
I was about to visit you

457
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,876
so we could talk about the second payment.

458
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,010
What?

459
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:03,100
Are you kidding?

460
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,542
Why?

461
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:06,726
Wait.

462
00:40:06,726 --> 00:40:09,575
I'll let my boss talk to you.

463
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:11,183
Director Shen's factory is in charge

464
00:40:11,183 --> 00:40:13,242
of our 600,000 international orders.

465
00:40:13,242 --> 00:40:15,183
He says he's not doing it anymore.

466
00:40:18,825 --> 00:40:22,459
Hello, Director Shen. This is Sihan.

467
00:40:23,792 --> 00:40:25,500
Can I ask...

468
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,851
Why are you breaking the contract?

469
00:40:27,851 --> 00:40:31,170
You know you have to pay the compensation, right?

470
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:33,590
Hello?

471
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,925
What did he say?

472
00:40:37,142 --> 00:40:41,534
He said he will pay the breach of contract fee.

473
00:40:42,217 --> 00:40:44,726
Why did that happen?

474
00:40:44,726 --> 00:40:48,200
Someone must've asked him to do so.

475
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,809
Someone's paying for him

476
00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:52,542
and he's getting benefits himself.

477
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:57,450
They're deliberately trying to make things difficult for us.

478
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:00,659
Their compensation can't make up for the loss.

479
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:03,409
If we can't deliver the goods on time,

480
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:06,918
we will face huge compensation fees.

481
00:41:06,918 --> 00:41:10,040
And our biggest loss is our reputation.

482
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:14,142
Zhuo Yue, find another manufacturer to expedite the production.

483
00:41:14,142 --> 00:41:15,667
We must deliver our goods on time.

484
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:18,017
Okay, I will get to it right now.

485
00:41:30,284 --> 00:41:32,283
Hello, Director Wu.

486
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,475
Why?

487
00:41:36,475 --> 00:41:38,600
Didn't we cooperate well last time?

488
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,800
We can talk through any problems.

489
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,670
Hello?

490
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:51,559
What's up?

491
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:54,459
Qiao Mei Chemical Factory breached their contract too.

492
00:41:54,459 --> 00:41:56,792
It's too much of a coincidence.

493
00:41:57,934 --> 00:41:59,976
It's not a coincidence.

494
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,526
Do you want me to investigate?

495
00:42:01,526 --> 00:42:02,876
No.

496
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:04,392
I know who did it.

497
00:42:04,392 --> 00:42:05,892
Who?

498
00:42:05,892 --> 00:42:07,042
Zhen Tian.

499
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:09,500
I just met with the Chief Financial Officer.

500
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:14,934
He tells me that our sales growth isn't ideal.

501
00:42:14,934 --> 00:42:16,959
He says I need to pay attention to it.

502
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:22,434
I know you'll say there are many factors that contributed to this.

503
00:42:22,434 --> 00:42:26,434
Including costs, clients, the environment, and so on.

504
00:42:26,434 --> 00:42:28,167
I don't want to hear any excuses.

505
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:31,934
I want you to find solutions.

506
00:42:31,934 --> 00:42:33,851
Director Yin.

507
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,034
What's this?

508
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:38,218
It's a list of factories that just signed with Z&X.

509
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,350
Can you handle it?

510
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:46,183
Two of these factories work with Yue-Sai so they'll be easier to handle.

511
00:42:46,183 --> 00:42:49,392
But we might run into some issues with the other three factories.

512
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:52,183
I don't want to hear that.

513
00:42:52,183 --> 00:42:54,934
Okay, I will try my best.

514
00:42:54,934 --> 00:42:59,651
Moreover, I heard that the two new Z&X stores were burnt down last night.

515
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:02,792
Do you know the cause of the fire?

516
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:04,751
We don't know yet.

517
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:07,325
But God is helping us.

518
00:43:07,325 --> 00:43:09,718
Maybe this matter isn't so simple.

519
00:43:11,742 --> 00:43:15,267
Alright, let's end the meeting here.

520
00:43:15,267 --> 00:43:18,183
I hope you all can think about ways

521
00:43:18,183 --> 00:43:20,099
to improve your performance growth.

522
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,767
Report to me next week.

523
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:23,459
Okay, Director Yin.

524
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:32,417
Is there something wrong?

525
00:43:33,517 --> 00:43:35,600
If the fires broke out in both stores at the same time,

526
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,734
it must've been man-made fires.

527
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:42,118
Who would you suspect first if you were Kang Sihan?

528
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,200
You?

529
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,250
If the media asks us about it,

530
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,726
do we need to explain anything?

531
00:43:52,726 --> 00:43:54,559
Don't say anything.

532
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:56,142
Anything we say

533
00:43:56,142 --> 00:43:58,392
will only sound like an excuse.
