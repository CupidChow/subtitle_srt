00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,600
<i>[Scarlet Heart 2]</i>

2
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,020
<i>[Episode 31]</i>

3
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,840
You're hanging out with me out here in broad daylight.

4
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,082
Aren't you worried about getting caught by those bandits?

5
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:14,125
They left this morning.

6
00:02:15,684 --> 00:02:18,200
You were out in the rain yesterday.

7
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,992
It's good for you to be in the sun today.

8
00:02:25,183 --> 00:02:26,517
Alright.

9
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:29,534
Let's get inside.

10
00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:31,642
They might be back soon.

11
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,876
Here.

12
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,709
Stop taking these pills.

13
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,392
It's too toxic.

14
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,600
Yinuo, hang in there.

15
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,250
There'll be a cure to your illness when we get out of here.

16
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,859
Trust me.

17
00:03:16,142 --> 00:03:17,626
Listen to me.

18
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:54,880
Come out, bitch.

19
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,300
Where is she?

20
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:58,225
It might be them.

21
00:03:58,225 --> 00:04:00,600
Hide while I deal with them.

22
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:11,559
What's going on?

23
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:13,767
Why do you look so mad early in the morning?

24
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:15,283
What's going on?

25
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:18,100
You bitch.

26
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,517
My eyes have been twitching since last night.

27
00:04:23,517 --> 00:04:25,392
Boss was afraid of having more troubles

28
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:27,559
when he made the phone calls last night.

29
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:31,350
So he asked us to burn the guy's body this morning.

30
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,842
But now his body

31
00:04:33,842 --> 00:04:35,767
is gone.

32
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:37,784
Did you save him?

33
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:40,176
Maybe...

34
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:42,500
Maybe it was carried off by the wolves.

35
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,742
How were there no traces

36
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:47,634
if it was carried off by the wolves?

37
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:50,617
This...

38
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:56,684
This...

39
00:04:58,684 --> 00:05:00,667
What is this about?

40
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,559
I was applying it to my face since it was hurting.

41
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:05,900
Do you have a problem with that?

42
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,559
To apply on your face?

43
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,976
I used up all my herbs.

44
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,626
Come get some more with me.

45
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:15,259
Are you coming?

46
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:19,476
Alright, let's go.

47
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:23,867
Let's go.

48
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:05,542
Your brother is young and promising.

49
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,250
We clicked immediately.

50
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,726
Come on, bottoms up.

51
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:10,517
We drank and chatted the entire night

52
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:14,392
when we were in Lancheng.

53
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:15,976
He's been abroad

54
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,600
and is very knowledgeable.

55
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,709
I learned a lot from him.

56
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:24,209
My Second Brother is indeed great.

57
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:26,209
Come on, bottoms up.

58
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:29,134
- Bottoms up.
- Come, let's go.

59
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:31,717
Siyu holds his alcohol well.

60
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,183
Of course, he owns a bar.

61
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:42,059
I used to bring him to buy materials frequently.

62
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:44,492
I learned a lot from him.

63
00:06:44,492 --> 00:06:46,325
To be frank,

64
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:49,117
I didn't want him to go.

65
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,767
But he had something to do in Beijing

66
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:54,509
and couldn't spare any more time.

67
00:06:56,475 --> 00:06:58,518
He was kidnapped

68
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:01,851
after I sent him off.

69
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:04,350
Factory Manager.

70
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,709
I'm a total stranger to this place.

71
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:10,642
I need your help to save my brother.

72
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:13,484
Come on, bottoms up.

73
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,400
Come on, Siyu.

74
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:29,584
Fill the glasses.

75
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:30,892
I...

76
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:38,009
Siyu.

77
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:46,209
Siyu, the bandits are calling.

78
00:07:49,976 --> 00:07:52,500
He looked so tough just now.

79
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,192
But everyone shows their true colors after drinking with me.

80
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:05,999
Come here.

81
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:26,492
Freeze! Sit down.

82
00:08:26,492 --> 00:08:28,492
Sit down.

83
00:08:28,492 --> 00:08:30,892
What are you guys doing?

84
00:08:30,892 --> 00:08:32,350
Let me introduce you.

85
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,892
This is my buddy, Wang Hao.

86
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:35,475
He used to work on a stud-farm.

87
00:08:35,475 --> 00:08:38,517
He gave me a lot of my horses in Beijing.

88
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:41,209
But now he sells horse meat.

89
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:44,183
These guys are his butchers.

90
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:46,159
They have knives on them at all times.

91
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,042
Since I came to their territory,

92
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:50,083
I informed them in advance.

93
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,559
Anyoe who tries to make trouble for Siyu

94
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,517
is making trouble with me.

95
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:56,042
We won't let that happen.

96
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:56,767
No...

97
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,675
I knew you were up to no good.

98
00:08:59,675 --> 00:09:01,976
Why would Zhen Tian Group give our business

99
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:04,851
to such a small factory?

100
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:05,942
And you.

101
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:09,659
I saw you peeking at my box since the moment I saw you.

102
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:10,584
Listen.

103
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,309
I was pretending to be drunk.

104
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:14,584
To make you all show your true colors.

105
00:09:14,584 --> 00:09:16,792
No, you...

106
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:18,934
You're being unreasonable.

107
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,126
I really thought you were drunk.

108
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:24,142
It's not safe for you to carry such a large sum of money on you.

109
00:09:24,142 --> 00:09:27,209
I think it would be better to keep it here so I can watch it.

110
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:30,159
I can't believe you don't trust me.

111
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,142
Shut up.

112
00:09:31,142 --> 00:09:32,709
I'll settle this with you later.

113
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:34,475
Did you collude with the bandits to kidnap my brother

114
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:36,200
because you couldn't hand over the goods to him?

115
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,442
I didn't do that.

116
00:09:38,442 --> 00:09:42,684
I treated him really well when he got here.

117
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:46,042
I took him for seafood,

118
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:48,999
and we ordered a lot of crabs and lobsters.

119
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:50,542
We even went to karaoke

120
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:52,142
and went to the sauna.

121
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:54,267
After that, I brought him to a five-star hotel.

122
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:55,600
Then we signed the contract.

123
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,283
I was good to him.

124
00:09:58,526 --> 00:10:03,159
That was the schedule for that day.

125
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:07,475
I swear I didn't see him after he left.

126
00:10:07,475 --> 00:10:09,976
Alright, I'll buy it for the time being.

127
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,100
You aren't capable of kidnapping him anyways.

128
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,200
- Hello?
- So did you bring the money?

129
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,951
Yes, but I want to see my brother first.

130
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:27,342
That's easy.

131
00:10:27,342 --> 00:10:31,700
The moment I see the money is the moment you see your brother.

132
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,276
How should we do this?

133
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:37,325
Take a cab to Hongqi Road.

134
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:39,934
Bear in mind that you have to come alone.

135
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:42,475
I will kill your brother

136
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,209
if I see you coming with other people

137
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:48,934
or if you contact the police.

138
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:50,409
Are we clear?

139
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:55,392
Boss, we are going to be rich.

140
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:06,600
Good thing I gave you the money.

141
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,018
It might've ended up badly if I kept it on me.

142
00:11:10,018 --> 00:11:12,142
You can never be too careful.

143
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,892
I'm going to make the transaction with the bandits now.

144
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:21,976
You better not play tricks with me.

145
00:11:21,976 --> 00:11:24,209
Or I won't be easy on you.

146
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:26,667
- Come on.
- Let's go.

147
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:29,083
Don't move.

148
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,059
To be frank, the people who kidnapped your brother

149
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:33,267
might be the wanted habitual offenders.

150
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:35,059
They killed a hostage before.

151
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,617
It's too dangerous for you to go pay the ransom alone.

152
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:39,726
That's why I don't plan on going alone.

153
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:43,351
How do we not get caught by the bandits if we go with you?

154
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:49,283
You see that cab?

155
00:11:49,283 --> 00:11:50,934
You will pretend to be the cab driver.

156
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:53,475
They won't suspect anything.

157
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:56,534
Then have your people follow us.

158
00:11:56,534 --> 00:11:58,900
That's a good idea. Let's go.

159
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,667
Now there is one more person who knows about our affair.

160
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:06,200
What should we do now?

161
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:12,892
It's all or nothing.

162
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:14,559
Let's report this to the police.

163
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:17,018
And make the kidnappers kill Kang Sihan.

164
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:19,542
All the evidence will be gone

165
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:22,267
once Kang Sihan is dead.

166
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:26,183
Kang Siyu can't do anything to us without evidence.

167
00:12:26,183 --> 00:12:28,726
Even if we report to the police,

168
00:12:28,726 --> 00:12:30,225
it won't be easy to deceive them.

169
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:31,642
They'll be careful.

170
00:12:31,642 --> 00:12:34,292
This might not be sufficient to alert the bandits.

171
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:38,767
Did I say we were reporting the kidnapping?

172
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:40,899
This is just to warn the bandits.

173
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:43,809
Come here, let me tell you.

174
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,292
Call 110 now.

175
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:52,183
And say that there is a robbery happening on Hongqi Road.

176
00:12:52,183 --> 00:12:55,209
The robber robbed a lot of money.

177
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,876
He is carrying a case

178
00:12:57,876 --> 00:13:01,309
which is fully filled with cash.

179
00:13:12,734 --> 00:13:13,851
Dad.

180
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:15,350
What's the situation now?

181
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,267
It's not so great.

182
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:19,475
The bandits are trying to lure us to get everything from us.

183
00:13:19,475 --> 00:13:20,350
Siyu.

184
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,559
You are dealing with bandits now.

185
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,242
Do be aware.

186
00:13:26,242 --> 00:13:28,534
Hongqi Road is just ahead.

187
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:30,142
Alright, Dad. I'll talk to you later.

188
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,517
I'll keep you posted.

189
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:33,500
Be careful.

190
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:50,283
Just ask the others to stay here.

191
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:51,559
The bandits can easily spot us.

192
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,350
Let's go first, I will lure them out.

193
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,809
You guys will come once something happens.

194
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:58,809
Be on standby.

195
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:01,292
Zhentian, it's time to take your pills.

196
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:18,283
We're facing an emergency situation now.

197
00:14:18,283 --> 00:14:22,700
Yet Siyu seems so confident and relaxed.

198
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,959
He's like a child.

199
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,099
Don't worry about him too much.

200
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:31,642
Though Siyu may seem irresponsible,

201
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:34,099
he is a smart guy.

202
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:35,934
He'll handle this well

203
00:14:35,934 --> 00:14:38,684
and bring Sihan back safely.

204
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:40,767
There's no point in being worried about him.

205
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:42,334
He is so far away from us now.

206
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:45,059
There is nothing we can do.

207
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:47,692
This is not the only thing I am worrying about.

208
00:14:47,692 --> 00:14:49,976
Look at our company's financial statements.

209
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:55,342
You can tell how tough the company has it now.

210
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:01,134
It's all because the incident at the wedding impacted our company's image.

211
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,959
I think we have to hold

212
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:12,976
some roadshows soon

213
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:15,709
to regain the investors' confidence in us.

214
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:19,475
Your body is too weak to hold the roadshows now.

215
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:21,383
I am fine.

216
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:26,018
I wonder when Chenggui will be released.

217
00:15:26,018 --> 00:15:27,717
I wonder about this too.

218
00:15:28,534 --> 00:15:30,542
If Chenggui is released now

219
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:32,559
and takes over control of our company,

220
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,809
the situation will be even worse.

221
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,517
Our company is in deep trouble now.

222
00:15:38,517 --> 00:15:41,034
We can't afford any more complications.

223
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:48,492
Why don't we tell Zheng'er to try to talk to Chenggui?

224
00:15:48,492 --> 00:15:50,092
Zheng'er?

225
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,434
I know him well.

226
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:55,325
Although he was a bit disobedient growing up,

227
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:58,659
he knows to weigh the pros and cons during critical moments.

228
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:00,475
Chenggui might listen to him

229
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:02,925
if he calls.

230
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,992
I will call Zheng'er now.

Okay.

00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:50,676
Turn around, Sir.

Stop.

248
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:29,809
Get out there.

249
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,392
Bring the money.

250
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:35,083
Place it next to the stove.

251
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,392
Wait for me.

252
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:41,500
They might bring me somewhere else.

253
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,018

00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,559
Alright, be careful.

256
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,992
Alright.

257
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:07,434
Freeze!

00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:10,350
We received a report that someone robbed a case filled with cash.

259

Please cooperate with us.

260
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:13,567

00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:31,700
Go in.

266
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,675

Yin Chenggui has been arrested for committing an economic crime.

We also suspect that he's involved in Miss Lan's incident too.

The police are investigating.

272
00:20:09,434 --> 00:20:12,267
Yin Chenggui deserves it.

273

It's time for us to get back Zhen Tian Group.

274
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:23,717
Why are you looking at me like that?

275
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:30,325
The way you acted in front of them today.

276
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:32,751
Is that how you normally are?

277
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,551
You knew that I had no choice.

278
00:20:43,684 --> 00:20:45,734
I caused trouble for you.

279
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:49,292
Does your face still hurt?

280
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,267
It's quite strange.

281
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:56,250
I don't feel the pain

282
00:20:57,826 --> 00:20:59,334
when I am at ease.

283
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:08,942
Open the door!

284
00:21:08,942 --> 00:21:11,734
Is anyone in there? Open the door.

285
00:21:12,642 --> 00:21:14,234
Wait here, I'll open the door.

286
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:16,142
Hurry up.

287
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,992
I will break in if you don't open the door.

288
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:24,099
Open the door.

289
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:25,350
Is it okay to do that?

290
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,442
This is our last resort. Let's give it a try.

291
00:21:27,442 --> 00:21:32,526
Open the door.

292
00:21:32,526 --> 00:21:35,684
Open the door or I really will break in.

293
00:21:35,684 --> 00:21:39,730
Open the door.

294
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:42,267
Oh my god.

295
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:46,626
You're disturbing my sleep.

296
00:21:46,626 --> 00:21:50,225
I specially came to serve you.

297
00:21:56,475 --> 00:21:59,684
I don't like to rush things.

298
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:01,742
I like to take things slow.

299
00:22:01,742 --> 00:22:03,867
It makes it more enjoyable.

300
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:09,292
Anyone want my peach?

301
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:11,434
We are not fools.

302
00:22:11,434 --> 00:22:13,250
That peach must be poisonous.

303
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,183
Yes.

304
00:22:14,183 --> 00:22:16,275
Are you worried about me poisoning you?

305
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:19,000
What a bunch of cowards.

306
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,475
It's not poisonous.

307
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,859
You better go.

308
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:43,792
What a bunch of cowards.

309
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:46,759
How dare you say we are cowards?

310
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:50,759
Give it to me.

311
00:22:58,392 --> 00:22:59,234
Give me it.

312
00:22:59,234 --> 00:23:00,651
How does it taste?

313
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:02,626
It's tasty.

314
00:23:02,626 --> 00:23:03,740
Is it tasty?

315
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,190
It's good.

316
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:07,684
Is it tasty?

317
00:23:07,684 --> 00:23:10,717
Yes, it is.

318
00:23:18,617 --> 00:23:20,667
Your idea is quite effective.

319
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,742
We're lucky they were drunk.

320
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:24,851
The effect of this medication is quite harsh.

321
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:27,209
Come on, let's tie them up.

322
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:30,600
Wang Hao, thank you for bailing me out.

323
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,200
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been released so quickly.

324
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,726
They couldn't find anything anyways.

325
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:35,851
It's just a matter of time for them to let you go.

326
00:23:35,851 --> 00:23:39,100
I brought them to you.

327
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,509
Hurry up.

328
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:42,684
Move.

329
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:45,283
Kang Siyu.

330
00:23:45,283 --> 00:23:47,409
Your father sent me to help you.

331
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:48,809
Instead of trusting me,

332
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:51,492
you got so many helpers here.

333
00:23:51,492 --> 00:23:52,976
Don't you know that the more people, the more talk?

334
00:23:52,976 --> 00:23:55,659
If information gets leaked and the bandits find out,

335
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:59,784
how am I going to explain to your father if they kill Sihan?

336
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:02,099
Are you shirking the responsibility?

337
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:04,292
You called the police.

338
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:06,617
What are you talking about?

339
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:08,325
Do you have any evidence?

340
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:10,520
Are you okay?

341
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,283
Siyu.

342
00:24:12,283 --> 00:24:14,225
Kang Siyu, how dare you hit me?

343
00:24:14,225 --> 00:24:15,709
I should have killed you earlier.

344
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:16,525
Listen up.

345
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:20,792
You are so done if anything bad happens to my brother.

346
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,209
Forget it, Siyu.

347
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:23,767
It's not worth your energy to beat him up.

348
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:26,250
Let's go.

349
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,383
- Let's go.
- Come on.

350
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:30,200
Are you okay?

351
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,542
I'm fine.

352
00:24:34,742 --> 00:24:37,225
We won't get arrested

353
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,642
as long as Kang Sihan is killed.

354
00:24:39,642 --> 00:24:42,183
These wounds are nothing.

355
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:44,725
Right? Let's go.

356
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,018
Siyu.

357
00:24:51,018 --> 00:24:52,642
The bandits want the ransom.

358
00:24:52,642 --> 00:24:54,826
They won't kill your brother so easily.

359
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,934
Don't panic.

360
00:24:55,934 --> 00:24:57,918
We'll find another way to save him.

361
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:02,876
Dad.

362
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,225
How is the situation now?

363
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:06,517
The bandits are being careful.

364
00:25:06,517 --> 00:25:08,700
They changed the location at the last second.

365
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,492
Don't worry about it.

366
00:25:10,492 --> 00:25:12,018
We will keep you posted.

367
00:25:12,018 --> 00:25:14,051
Do take care of yourself.

368
00:25:23,475 --> 00:25:26,018
Yinuo, did you see that?

369
00:25:26,018 --> 00:25:27,642
This medication is too harsh.

370
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:30,009
You really have to stop taking it.

371
00:25:35,892 --> 00:25:39,267
What should we do now?

372
00:25:46,267 --> 00:25:47,634
Yinuo.

373
00:25:50,076 --> 00:25:52,350
Before they wake up,

374
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:56,826
we have a problem to solve between us.

375
00:26:00,918 --> 00:26:03,676
I think I know who you are.

376
00:26:11,183 --> 00:26:15,434
Just let bygones be bygones.

377
00:26:17,392 --> 00:26:19,684
Stop trying to hide.

378
00:26:19,684 --> 00:26:22,100
When I was tied up,

379
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,099
and when you were crying

380
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:27,809
when hearing about Zhang Xiao and Yin Zheng being together,

381
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:32,525
I guessed you were someone who knew Yin Zheng.

382
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,675
Yinuo.

383
00:26:39,675 --> 00:26:42,709
You're someone who's been through a lot.

384
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:45,475
I've been through Lan Lan's information before.

385
00:26:47,018 --> 00:26:50,720
She has a tattoo of a magnolia on her back.

386
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,640
Stop it.

387
00:26:55,283 --> 00:26:56,790
Yes.

388
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:03,300
I have a tattoo of a magnolia on my left back.

389
00:27:17,475 --> 00:27:19,384
I am Lan Lan.

390
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,483
Yin Zheng's ex-girlfriend.

391
00:27:28,183 --> 00:27:30,117
<i>Zhang Xiao.</i>

392
00:27:30,117 --> 00:27:34,109
<i>Are we really fated to be together?</i>

393
00:27:34,918 --> 00:27:37,434
<i>Just what do you know?</i>

394
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:39,542
<i>Why won't you tell me about it?</i>

395
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,618
<i>Just what are you thinking about?</i>

396
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:46,884
<i>Wait for me.</i>

397
00:27:47,434 --> 00:27:49,876
<i>I'll go to your world to find you.</i>

398
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,109
<i>And find the answers to these questions.</i>

399
00:27:57,826 --> 00:28:04,399
I didn't expect you to find out about my past.

400
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,380
That's right.

401
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:16,090
I got set up and it left me disfigured.

402
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:22,526
I couldn't accept what happened back then,

403
00:28:24,283 --> 00:28:26,800
so I left the hospital.

404
00:28:27,934 --> 00:28:31,975
I really wanted to commit suicide.

405
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:37,459
But suddenly,

406
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:42,359
I saw a ray of light.

407
00:28:43,642 --> 00:28:45,726
And it pulled me back to here.

408
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,767
After that,

409
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:53,618
I converted to Buddhism.

410
00:28:55,267 --> 00:29:00,275
I decided to forget my past

411
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:03,959
and start all over again.

412
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:07,234
Then you came here

413
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:12,125
to recover after the plastic surgery.

414
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,509
Yes.

415
00:29:16,642 --> 00:29:18,567
But I didn't expect them

416
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,642
to still find out my identity.

417
00:29:21,642 --> 00:29:23,834
Why didn't you run away from here?

418
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,018
They watch me closely.

419
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:30,209
There's no way I could escape.

420
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:35,792
Moreover, I am a girl.

421
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:37,975
If they ever catch me again,

422
00:29:39,267 --> 00:29:41,634
I will be doomed.

423
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:45,709
So I made up my mind to stay

424
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:49,475
to investigate them.

425
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,867
Then I will report them to the police to arrest them all.

426
00:29:56,851 --> 00:29:59,392
I didn't know

427
00:29:59,392 --> 00:30:01,542
that you suffered so much.

428
00:30:04,709 --> 00:30:08,583
This is a vicious cycle.

429
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,642
Just take the torment I am going through now

430
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,500
as repayment for my previous wrongdoings.

431
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:23,467
I'm not supposed to be alive anyways.

432
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:29,559
Yinuo.

433
00:30:31,784 --> 00:30:34,642
Since you're being so honest with me

434
00:30:34,642 --> 00:30:37,209
by telling me that you are Lan Lan,

435
00:30:40,325 --> 00:30:42,220
I'll tell you something too.

436
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,420
Zhang Xiao is actually your twin sister.

437
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:56,309
Your twin sister is now dating your lover.

438
00:30:58,918 --> 00:31:00,676
Do you hate her?

439
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,942
I don't know.

440
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,683
The only thing I know is that I am Ma Yinuo.

441
00:31:17,867 --> 00:31:19,500
Zhang Xiao.

442
00:31:20,142 --> 00:31:22,918
She's Lan Lan's twin sister.

443
00:31:22,918 --> 00:31:25,300
Can you really distinguish them so clearly?

444
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:32,309
We make a lot of decisions in our life.

445
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:39,492
I choose to let go of hatred.

446
00:31:50,918 --> 00:31:56,084
Do you mind that I am Lan Lan?

447
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:02,592
To be frank,

448
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:05,683
I hated Lan Lan.

449
00:32:09,434 --> 00:32:11,125
But Yinuo,

450
00:32:11,976 --> 00:32:15,059
you saved my life.

451
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:18,334
It's Ma Yinuo sitting here talking to me right now.

452
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:21,634
She is no longer Lan Lan.

453
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:28,959
I just heard you talk about your past.

454
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,542
Yinuo.

455
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,092
Let bygones be bygones.

456
00:32:42,934 --> 00:32:47,409
Do you still want me to leave with you?

457
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,225
We can escape together.

458
00:32:52,225 --> 00:32:54,350
We will seek revenge from Yin Zheng

459
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,167
for abandoning you.

460
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:07,192
Sihan, I understand how you feel.

461
00:33:08,517 --> 00:33:10,776
But I don't hate him.

462
00:33:11,475 --> 00:33:14,625
I let go of my hatred for him

463
00:33:15,434 --> 00:33:17,617
the moment I decided to start over again.

464
00:33:17,617 --> 00:33:20,300
Since fate brought you together as brothers,

465
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:24,976
why don't you clear the air

466
00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:26,792
and bring an end to all the troubles?

467
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:46,918
Hey, are you dead or alive?

468
00:33:46,918 --> 00:33:49,167
It doesn't matter.

469
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:50,325
Listen.

470
00:33:50,325 --> 00:33:52,450
You're my hostages now.

471
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,099
Do as I say if you want to survive.

472
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:55,183
Answer my questions.

473
00:33:55,183 --> 00:33:58,626
Whoever answers my questions will be set free.

474
00:33:58,626 --> 00:34:00,550
You.

475
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:02,800
How do I get to Canglang Mountain?

476
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,642
I don't know.

477
00:34:05,642 --> 00:34:07,099
Tell me.

478
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:08,600
I don't know.

479
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,792
I really have no idea about it.

480
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,760
Alright.

481
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,517
Fine.

482
00:34:13,517 --> 00:34:15,834
You've been there before though, right?

483
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:18,059
Have you been?

484
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:19,334
Yes.

485
00:34:19,334 --> 00:34:22,384
You better behave yourself.

486
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:25,699
Or you will get it from me.

487
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,142
Who are you?

488
00:34:44,142 --> 00:34:45,100
- What are you doing?
- Zhang Xiao.

489
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,517
- Who are you looking for?
- Zhang Xiao.

490
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:48,851
Don't go in. Who are you looking for?

491
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:50,667
I'm looking for Zhang Xiao. Are the Zhangs staying here?

492
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:52,876
They moved this morning.

493
00:34:52,876 --> 00:34:53,876
They moved?

494
00:34:53,876 --> 00:34:55,450
Yes.

495
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:56,959
No way.

496
00:34:58,076 --> 00:34:59,809
Did they say where they were moving to?

497
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:01,100
No.

498
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,059
Did they leave any messages?

499
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:06,083
No, they didn't leave anything.

500
00:35:08,325 --> 00:35:10,167
Can I go in and take a look?

501
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:12,334
Alright, be quick.

502
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:14,099
I am locking the door soon.

503
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:15,450
Thank you.

504
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,025
You're finally here.

505
00:35:35,876 --> 00:35:37,099
Why are you here?

506
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:38,225
I was worried about you.

507
00:35:38,225 --> 00:35:40,475
So I followed you here.

508
00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:42,576
Let's go back.

509
00:35:42,576 --> 00:35:44,726
We're so close to victory.

510
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:47,851
There is no going back for you now.

511
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:50,283
Kang Zhentian is giving a speech later.

512
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:52,959
All your efforts will go to waste

513
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:57,134
if you don't grab this chance.

514
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:04,851
Have you booked the flight?

515
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:06,325
Yes.

516
00:36:06,325 --> 00:36:08,317
Let's go to the airport.

517
00:36:09,642 --> 00:36:10,999
Let's go.

518
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:20,642
<i>If we were fated to be together from our previous life,</i>

519
00:36:20,642 --> 00:36:25,367
<i>sooner or later we will surely meet again.</i>

520
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,325
<i>Zhang Xiao.</i>

521
00:36:28,325 --> 00:36:30,809
<i>Since I can't find you in your world,</i>

522
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:33,200
<i>I'll wait for you to come home.</i>

523
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,142
<i>But it won't be for too long.</i>

524
00:36:35,751 --> 00:36:38,042
<i>I'll just wait for this lifetime.</i>

525
00:36:43,018 --> 00:36:44,659
Kang Sihan is probably dead

526
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:49,051
after the mess we created.

527
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:54,292
Better safe than sorry.

528
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:55,334
Let's make sure.

529
00:36:55,334 --> 00:36:57,667
We must make sure he's dead.

530
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:00,509
We sat here last time.

531
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,309
Sihan might've been spotted

532
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:06,434
when you guys ate together last time.

533
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:09,818
Come on, drink up.

534
00:37:15,892 --> 00:37:17,726
That car...

535
00:37:17,726 --> 00:37:20,767
Has been following us since the last time we were here.

536
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:23,159
They left after we left.

537
00:37:27,751 --> 00:37:28,667
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

538
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:30,434
Come on, let's eat.

539
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:37,367
Boss, the dishes have been served.

540
00:37:39,918 --> 00:37:40,809
Come.

541
00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:43,034
Don't miss anything.

542
00:37:43,034 --> 00:37:44,417
I will go take a look.

543
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:45,726
Alright.

544
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,209
The police must know something.

545
00:37:52,209 --> 00:37:54,942
Otherwise there wouldn't be so many police here.

546
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,409
Buddy.

547
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:59,684
We have to leave this place.

548
00:37:59,684 --> 00:38:02,899
Brother, it's fifty million.

549
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:15,083
Are you insane?

550
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:19,100
Do you want your life or the money?

551
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,809
Don't you get it?

552
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:23,142
We killed someone.

553
00:38:23,142 --> 00:38:26,042
As I expected, Kang Sihan is dead.

554
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:29,742
We're dead once they find out.

555
00:38:31,751 --> 00:38:35,192
You've all worked hard.

556
00:38:36,242 --> 00:38:41,784
We will leave after finishing this meal.

557
00:39:02,325 --> 00:39:05,618
The bandits had us going back and forth on this road yesterday.

558
00:39:05,618 --> 00:39:08,726
It means they know this area well.

559
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:13,976
I think Xishi Restaurant is the most convenient place to observe this area.

560
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:17,709
Are you trying to say that the bandits were in this restaurant yesterday?

561
00:39:17,709 --> 00:39:21,392
The factory manager said he brought my brother here the other day.

562
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:23,334
I think this is their den.

563
00:39:23,334 --> 00:39:24,784
Let's go in and take a look.

564
00:39:24,784 --> 00:39:26,380
Let's go.

565
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,417
- See what else you want.
- We're okay.

566
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:30,818
Please take a seat.

567
00:39:32,034 --> 00:39:33,700
Excuse me.

568
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,359
Have you seen this person?

569
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:42,159
Yes.

570
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:44,575
He ate here a few days ago.

571
00:39:44,575 --> 00:39:49,299
We were saying how rare it was to see such a handsome man here.

572
00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:50,225
- Look.
- What?

573
00:39:50,225 --> 00:39:51,934
It's him.

574
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:55,018
Yes, he was here a few days ago.

575
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,600
Our boss even attended to him herself.

576
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,042
It's the first time she ever served a customer personally.

577
00:40:00,976 --> 00:40:02,492
Is she here?

578
00:40:02,492 --> 00:40:05,059
No, she hasn't been here for a few days.

579
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:07,283
Our accountant has been handling the register.

580
00:40:07,283 --> 00:40:09,309
When did she leave?

581
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:12,409
It was the day after this guy was here.

582
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:14,767
Has your boss ever left for a long period of time?

583
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:15,783
She does it once in a while.

584
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:18,492
But she always goes to Canglang Mountain.

585
00:40:18,492 --> 00:40:20,475
Canglang Mountain?

586
00:40:20,475 --> 00:40:21,751
Can you bring me there?

587
00:40:21,751 --> 00:40:23,450
You want to go to Canglang Mountain?

588
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,517
The Canglang Mountain they talk about isn't actually a mountain.

589
00:40:25,517 --> 00:40:27,183
It's a desert.

590
00:40:27,183 --> 00:40:29,751
People don't normally leave there in one piece after they go.

591
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:31,492
You guys are locals.

592
00:40:31,492 --> 00:40:32,526
Don't you know the way there?

593
00:40:32,526 --> 00:40:35,409
No, if you want to go to Canglang Mountain,

594
00:40:35,409 --> 00:40:36,617
you have to find someone named Zhang Luotuo.

595
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:38,642
He is the only one who can bring people to Canglang Mountain.

596
00:40:38,642 --> 00:40:40,642
Nobody will go there without him.

597
00:40:40,642 --> 00:40:42,183
Zhang Luotuo.

598
00:40:42,183 --> 00:40:44,199
Do you know where his house is?

599
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,918
He's been gone for a while.

600
00:40:45,918 --> 00:40:48,542
I really don't know about his whereabouts.

601
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:50,709
Both of you are too lucky.

602
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:54,059
I heard that Zhang Luotuo moved back here as of this morning.

603
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:59,300
He stays in a house outside of the village in the south.

604
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,334
I know where that place is at.

605
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,051
Come on, I'll take you.

606
00:41:11,642 --> 00:41:13,034
Be careful.

607
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:26,967
Dad.

608
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:28,542
So we're moving back here.

609
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:29,475
Yes.

610
00:41:29,475 --> 00:41:31,600
Why didn't you just tell me?

611
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,134
Xiaoxiao.

612
00:41:33,134 --> 00:41:35,667
You were so sad the day Yin Zheng left.

613
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:37,999
I was sad too.

614
00:41:41,475 --> 00:41:44,175
Xiaoxiao, look at this photo.

615
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:48,209
I took this photo with Brother Kang,

616
00:41:48,209 --> 00:41:49,934
Yin Zheng's father, Yin Chengyi,

617
00:41:49,934 --> 00:41:52,225
and your biological father, Xiao Hua.

618
00:41:52,225 --> 00:41:56,059
We took it the day we found the treasure 25 years ago.

619
00:41:56,784 --> 00:41:59,325
Two people died that day.

620
00:41:59,325 --> 00:42:01,642
One of them was Yin Zheng's father, Yin Chengyi,

621
00:42:01,642 --> 00:42:04,667
the other was your father, Xiao Hua.

622
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:11,234
Your father was shot to death by Yin Zheng's second uncle.

623
00:42:12,934 --> 00:42:17,076
Yin Chengyi was buried by the quicksand because of his greediness.

624
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,517
The situation was messy.

625
00:42:19,517 --> 00:42:23,083
I could never forget it.

626
00:42:23,892 --> 00:42:27,918
What does this have to do with our move?

627
00:42:37,834 --> 00:42:39,383
Daughter.

628
00:42:39,383 --> 00:42:41,751
I want you to stay away from Yin Zheng.

629
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:43,934
I don't want him to be able to find you again.

630
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:45,959
Why?

631
00:42:47,183 --> 00:42:49,475
The grudges of the previous generation

632
00:42:49,475 --> 00:42:51,600
was supposed to have nothing to do with you,

633
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,000
but it's too bad that you can't separate yourself from it.

634
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,334
I don't want you to get involved with this.

635
00:42:57,334 --> 00:43:00,709
I want you to have a peaceful life here.

636
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:02,170
Dad.

637
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,375
I get it.

638
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,099
Daughter.

639
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:09,709
Just stay here at ease.

640
00:43:09,709 --> 00:43:13,642
Love is how you see it.

641
00:43:13,642 --> 00:43:17,918
You should give up on it if it brings you misery.

642
00:43:17,918 --> 00:43:21,375
I'm not a wealthy person.

643
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:24,484
But we won't starve to death here.

644
00:43:25,892 --> 00:43:28,292
No matter what your final decision is,

645
00:43:29,492 --> 00:43:31,684
I always got your back.

646
00:43:31,684 --> 00:43:33,050
Dad.

647
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,950
Thank you.
