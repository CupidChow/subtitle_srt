00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,080
<i>[Episode 22]</i>

3
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,912
<i>I've decided.</i>

4
00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:49,038
<i>Let's break up.</i>

5
00:01:49,038 --> 00:01:50,662
<i>Remember.</i>

6
00:01:50,662 --> 00:01:53,879
<i>Zhang Xiao was with Black Cat Detective.</i>

7
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,062
Not Kang Sihan.

8
00:01:56,062 --> 00:01:59,187
<i>Xinyi is a kind and innocent girl.</i>

9
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:01,446
<i>You should be kind to her.</i>

10
00:02:05,954 --> 00:02:07,304
What are you doing?

11
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:12,012
Don't move.

12
00:02:13,762 --> 00:02:15,787
What's going on with you?

13
00:02:15,787 --> 00:02:18,562
Is this necessary?

14
00:02:18,562 --> 00:02:21,996
The company has a rule.

15
00:02:21,996 --> 00:02:24,979
If you jump down from here, your family will be held responsible.

16
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,671
I wasn't trying to jump.

17
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:28,996
Then why did you climb up so high?

18
00:02:28,996 --> 00:02:31,029
Let me go.

19
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:35,720
Leave me alone.

20
00:02:36,437 --> 00:02:38,679
You're one to talk.

21
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:41,287
Who was crying just now?

22
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:49,295
Did you hear all of it?

23
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:57,520
What are you doing here?

24
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,404
I'm here often.

25
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:08,854
Just a warning.

26
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:11,019
I saved your life.

27
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:14,270
You can't die without my permission.

28
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:17,990
Wait.

29
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,820
What you just heard...

30
00:03:21,854 --> 00:03:24,090
Can you not tell anyone?

31
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,645
Don't worry.

32
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:33,880
I'm not interested in your relationship.

33
00:03:34,537 --> 00:03:37,812
But the more you get hurt,

34
00:03:37,812 --> 00:03:39,945
the better you should treat yourself.

35
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:43,687
You'll get through this soon.

36
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:52,129
Ever since your sister left,

37
00:03:52,912 --> 00:03:55,190
I've been coming here often.

38
00:03:56,996 --> 00:03:59,496
It cleared my head about a lot of things.

39
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:03,287
You should try it if you get the chance.

40
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:05,812
Come here when you're feeling down.

41
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,546
Close your eyes,

42
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:09,490
and then clear your mind.

43
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:12,829
When you open your eyes again,

44
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:15,454
you will realize that you feel at peace.

45
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:18,154
I can clear my mind,

46
00:04:19,554 --> 00:04:21,379
but I can't forget my memories.

47
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:25,312
As long as you're at peace,

48
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:29,103
your memories won't hurt as much.

49
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:34,119
You can't restart your life,

50
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:36,146
so you'll just have to keep moving forward.

51
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:49,170
Keep moving forward.

52
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:54,454
You should come over to dinner tonight.

53
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:56,287
Xinyi, don't do this.

54
00:04:56,287 --> 00:04:58,120
We broke up.

55
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,270
No.

56
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,120
We were just on a break.

57
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,495
Stop joking around.

58
00:05:02,495 --> 00:05:03,729
We weren't on a break.

59
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:05,812
We broke up.

60
00:05:05,812 --> 00:05:10,112
We're not suitable for each other.

61
00:05:11,303 --> 00:05:13,829
Sihan, I know I have a bad temper.

62
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:15,762
I'll change.

63
00:05:16,762 --> 00:05:18,829
You said that many times before.

64
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:21,546
I swear it this time.

65
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:24,771
Xinyi, your car is here.

66
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:27,095
Go home. I still have to work.

67
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,095
I'm okay. You can go.

68
00:05:49,604 --> 00:05:51,504
Who was that girl?

69
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:56,162
A friend.

70
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:57,537
Friend?

71
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:02,019
Siyu, you don't need to know.

72
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:03,887
She is my ex-girlfriend, okay?

73
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:06,312
Why are you so close with your ex-girlfriend?

74
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:09,203
How am I close with her?

75
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,812
You don't need to worry about it.

76
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:13,203
But what about Zhang Xiao?

77
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:15,620
Are you cheating on her?

78
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,829
No.

79
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:18,495
Then how do you explain what just happened?

80
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:20,504
I don't need to explain to you.

81
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,938
Huang Di, tell me a joke.

82
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:33,454
Okay. What kind of joke?

83
00:06:33,454 --> 00:06:34,970
Your best joke.

84
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,503
Animation?

85
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:46,129
Once there was a frog.

86
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:50,687
It walked on the road.

87
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:53,854
I want to hear an action one.

88
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:56,096
No problem.

89
00:06:57,954 --> 00:07:02,571
There was a frog who knew Kungfu.

90
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:07,329
It walked on the road.

91
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,854
How dare you mess with me?

92
00:07:10,854 --> 00:07:12,954
How dare you!

93
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:14,495
Don't run.

94
00:07:14,495 --> 00:07:15,354
No!

95
00:07:15,354 --> 00:07:17,787
Come and get me.

96
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:19,437
Stop it.

97
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:21,387
What are you doing?

98
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:24,287
This is my private kitchen,

99
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:25,871
not a playground.

100
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:27,420
Get out.

101
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:32,287
Let's go.

102
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:09,790
<i>[I'm here rooting for you!]</i>

103
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,162
Sihan.

104
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,470
Dad.

105
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:20,854
You did well today.

106
00:08:20,854 --> 00:08:22,662
Thank you.

107
00:08:22,662 --> 00:08:26,454
You and Xinyi...

108
00:08:26,454 --> 00:08:28,337
What's going on?

109
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:34,704
We were classmates in London.

110
00:08:34,704 --> 00:08:36,354
We were together for three years.

111
00:08:36,354 --> 00:08:39,854
But we broke up before I came back.

112
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:42,529
I didn't know she was Director Meng's daughter.

113
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:46,229
She also doesn't know about my background.

114
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:48,962
It seems like you weren't clear with her.

115
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:54,470
I think she still loves you.

116
00:08:54,987 --> 00:08:59,929
Dad, this is my own private matter.

117
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:03,579
Yes, but it's to be taken seriously.

118
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:08,245
Your relationship affects our cooperation.

119
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:12,912
I don't wish to become your bargaining chip.

120
00:09:12,912 --> 00:09:15,912
Who do you think I am?

121
00:09:15,912 --> 00:09:20,570
I'm not the kind of man who will sacrifice his son's marriage

122
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,787
to get an advantage in a cooperation.

123
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:29,270
Zhen Tian Group is capable of buying the contract.

124
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:33,079
Your relationship is just the icing on the cake.

125
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:37,587
But I don't wish for you to marry her because of this.

126
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:46,171
How are things with Xiaoxiao?

127
00:09:53,771 --> 00:09:55,219
Sihan.

128
00:09:55,854 --> 00:09:57,938
No matter who you choose to be with,

129
00:09:57,938 --> 00:10:00,170
I will support you.

130
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:04,038
Thank you.

131
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:06,495
But I want you to remember one thing.

132
00:10:06,495 --> 00:10:09,579
Whether you choose Zhang Xiao or Xinyi,

133
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:12,938
someone will get hurt.

134
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:15,562
It's unavoidable.

135
00:10:15,562 --> 00:10:19,896
I just hope you can minimize the harm.

136
00:10:19,896 --> 00:10:22,029
Do you get what I'm saying?

137
00:10:25,162 --> 00:10:28,079
I believe in you.

138
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:39,729
What a coincidence.

139
00:10:39,729 --> 00:10:41,154
Yes.

140
00:10:42,162 --> 00:10:43,687
What are you doing here?

141
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:46,646
I...

142
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,687
I came to give my father something.

143
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:52,454
I guess I got lost.

144
00:10:52,454 --> 00:10:53,771
His office is on the top floor.

145
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:55,495
The top floor?

146
00:10:56,771 --> 00:10:59,938
But he told me his office was on the 21st floor.

147
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,379
Are you a Scorpio?

148
00:11:06,203 --> 00:11:07,620
Yes.

149
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:12,245
Have you had back luck recently?

150
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:15,954
I know a thing or two about horoscopes.

151
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:17,720
Your luck is bad recently.

152
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,746
But don't worry.

153
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:23,646
Your luck will change at 1:02 pm.

154
00:11:23,646 --> 00:11:27,054
There's 17 minutes left.

155
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,162
It'll go by quickly.

156
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:29,729
The time it takes to finish a meal.

157
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:31,329
17 minutes.

158
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:33,354
Yes.

159
00:11:33,354 --> 00:11:35,119
Look on Taobao, check Weibo,

160
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:36,454
or message your friends.

161
00:11:36,454 --> 00:11:38,354
It'll go by quickly.

162
00:11:39,954 --> 00:11:42,829
I'm a certified master.

163
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:46,270
You can ask me any questions you have about horoscopes.

164
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:49,829
Do you still have work?

165
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:52,330
Get on with your day then.

166
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,354
I'll get going.

167
00:11:54,354 --> 00:11:55,354
See you

168
00:11:55,354 --> 00:11:56,820
- Bye.
- Bye.

169
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,440
<i>[I'm here rooting for you!]</i>

170
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:36,020
Sadness is punishment for yourself.

171
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,229
Happiness is punishment for the person who hurt you.

172
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:41,762
Energy candy.

173
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:05,704
What is it?

174
00:13:05,704 --> 00:13:08,412
It's that annoying Jack.

175
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,229
He's so nitpicky.

176
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:12,604
He said my design was bad.

177
00:13:12,604 --> 00:13:16,019
I worked two days straight on that.

178
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:18,771
Don't be mad.

179
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:22,270
Have a piece of energy candy.

180
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,996
Energy candy?

181
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:26,838
It will brighten your mood.

182
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:28,412
It's magic.

183
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:30,854
Did you make this?

184
00:13:33,537 --> 00:13:36,995
It is from someone that I should thank.

185
00:13:37,938 --> 00:13:40,338
But I don't know who he is.

186
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:43,829
What time is it?

187
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:44,838
1:04.

188
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:46,571
1:04?

189
00:13:47,604 --> 00:13:49,212
He was right.

190
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:52,746
One, two, three, go.

191
00:13:52,746 --> 00:13:58,203
- One, two, three, go.
- Go.

192
00:13:58,203 --> 00:14:00,280
- Catch.
- Catch.

193
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,312
- Go.
- Switch.

194
00:14:01,312 --> 00:14:03,237
What are you doing here?

195
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,871
Xiaoxiao, where have you been?

196
00:14:05,871 --> 00:14:08,162
Why aren't you here with your dad?

197
00:14:08,162 --> 00:14:09,520
Dad.

198
00:14:10,138 --> 00:14:12,229
Why are you two visiting my dad?

199
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:14,829
Look at his finger.

200
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:16,454
Yes, look at it.

201
00:14:16,454 --> 00:14:17,762
It's not bad.

202
00:14:17,762 --> 00:14:19,887
I just accidentally cut it two days ago.

203
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:23,079
Siyu brought me here to get it wrapped so we visited Uncle.

204
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:24,746
It's that serious?

205
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:29,746
Ask the nurse to wrap it.

206
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:31,495
Give it back.

207
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:35,020
I'll cut an apple for you.

208
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,504
Great.

209
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:43,812
Dad, how are you feeling?

210
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:45,796
A lot better today.

211
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:47,187
Great.

212
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,620
I want to discharge from the hospital.

213
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,120
You'll be free in a few more days.

214
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,395
My daughter.

215
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,954
I miss the desert.

216
00:14:56,954 --> 00:14:59,337
I knew it.

217
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:01,771
This is for you.

218
00:15:02,854 --> 00:15:04,170
What is it?

219
00:15:07,537 --> 00:15:09,087
The desert.

220
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:12,996
My daughter.

221
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,800
You know me well.

222
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,746
This is great.

223
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:19,219
Piggy.

224
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,119
Princess.

225
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:23,312
You got here quick.

226
00:15:23,312 --> 00:15:24,771
Thank you.

227
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:28,120
Nice to meet you, Uncle.

228
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,454
Nice to meet you.

229
00:15:29,454 --> 00:15:32,370
Dad, do you remember Xinyi?

230
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,412
Xinyi?

231
00:15:36,262 --> 00:15:38,203
Your college roommate?

232
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,579
The one who had five luxury cars for her luggage on the first day?

233
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:42,329
It's her, right?

234
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:45,019
You have such good memory.

235
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:46,579
No.

236
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,504
It's because your cars got everyone's attention.

237
00:15:49,504 --> 00:15:52,646
The boys were walking into poles.

238
00:15:52,646 --> 00:15:55,012
Stop it.

239
00:15:55,012 --> 00:15:56,704
Uncle, have an apple.

240
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:58,395
Thank you, you too.

241
00:15:58,395 --> 00:16:00,412
It's okay.

242
00:16:01,354 --> 00:16:04,203
Is he Black Cat Detective?

243
00:16:04,203 --> 00:16:05,996
Who are you?

244
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:08,695
I am her best friend, Meng Xinyi.

245
00:16:08,695 --> 00:16:10,162
Nice to meet you.

246
00:16:10,162 --> 00:16:12,212
You're her best friend?

247
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:15,537
Really?

248
00:16:15,537 --> 00:16:18,120
Xiaoxiao never mentioned me to you?

249
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:21,038
Of course she did.

250
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:22,145
Right.

251
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:24,012
She talks about you a lot too.

252
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:28,412
Wasn't Xiaoxiao hard to court?

253
00:16:28,412 --> 00:16:29,954
Yes, she was.

254
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:31,812
Tell me your story.

255
00:16:31,812 --> 00:16:33,690
I am curious.

256
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,495
Remember why you're here.

257
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:40,495
I got so excited when I saw Black Cat Detective.

258
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:43,412
Uncle, get well soon.

259
00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:44,203
Thank you.

260
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,671
You're welcome.

261
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:08,254
Lower.

262
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,495
Yes, a little lower.

263
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:13,020
Xiaoxiao, a little higher.

264
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,303
Great.

265
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:20,220
Black Cat Detective, I finally get to see you in person today.

266
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,654
Should we get dinner later?

267
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,103
He's busy.

268
00:17:29,103 --> 00:17:30,171
It's fine.

269
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:32,712
I should still treat Xiaoxiao's best friend to dinner.

270
00:17:32,712 --> 00:17:33,738
Yes.

271
00:17:33,738 --> 00:17:36,203
Piggy, stop trying to save him money.

272
00:17:36,203 --> 00:17:38,912
What do you want to eat?

273
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:40,862
Something good.

274
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:43,287
- Roasted duck.
- Okay, no problem.

275
00:17:43,287 --> 00:17:45,520
See you tonight.

276
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,162
Uncle, rest well. I'm going now.

277
00:17:48,162 --> 00:17:49,019
Okay.

278
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:50,379
I'll see you out.

279
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:57,938
This is good.

280
00:17:57,938 --> 00:17:59,462
Huang Di?

281
00:17:59,462 --> 00:18:00,929
Stop there!

282
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:05,054
Stop there!

283
00:18:05,054 --> 00:18:06,079
You annoying man.

284
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,162
Why are you here?

285
00:18:07,162 --> 00:18:08,495
You feel lonely now?

286
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:09,704
You want to get scolded?

287
00:18:09,704 --> 00:18:11,079
No.

288
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:13,203
Talking back now too?

289
00:18:13,203 --> 00:18:15,429
- Yes.
- Leave now.

290
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,520
Go!

291
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,620
Princess.

292
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,729
Don't get angry.

293
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:21,679
He is here to visit my father.

294
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:23,829
So he's a decent person now.

295
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:25,787
How did you treat her before?

296
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:27,771
Do you know how much you hurt her?

297
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:29,871
She got into a car accident and nearly lost her memory.

298
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:31,587
Why weren't you the one who got hit?

299
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:33,187
Alright, forget it.

300
00:18:33,187 --> 00:18:34,329
Don't say that.

301
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:35,920
It's all in the past now.

302
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:38,595
How dare you?

303
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:40,979
Don't yell at him here.

304
00:18:40,979 --> 00:18:42,846
People are staring.

305
00:18:42,846 --> 00:18:43,495
Come on.

306
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:44,787
I want them to see this.

307
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:46,579
So he won't bully you anymore.

308
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:48,579
My sister.

309
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:51,495
When did I bully her?

310
00:18:51,495 --> 00:18:54,287
Shut up. Did I ask you to speak?

311
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:55,720
No.

312
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,162
Listen. It's unfortunate for you to have run into me today.

313
00:18:59,162 --> 00:19:02,329
You should open your eyes and see how great she is.

314
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:06,019
You didn't cherish her and cheated on her.

315
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,829
You're not human!

316
00:19:07,829 --> 00:19:09,229
Forget it.

317
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:11,019
It's in the past. Just let him go.

318
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,604
You...

319
00:19:13,971 --> 00:19:14,854
Fine.

320
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,620
I will let you go because of Xiaoxiao.

321
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,912
If you ever dare to do anything to her again...

322
00:19:18,912 --> 00:19:20,787
I swear.

323
00:19:20,787 --> 00:19:24,129
I won't do that again.

324
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:30,419
Don't be mad.

325
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,979
I'm so mad.

326
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:33,787
Alright, go back to take care of Uncle.

327
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:35,579
I will go now.

328
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:37,345
See you tonight.

329
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:55,504
Thank you for earlier.

330
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:57,912
It's nothing.

331
00:19:57,912 --> 00:19:58,829
Don't worry.

332
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:01,896
I will cancel with her later.

333
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:04,854
Don't, I want to keep playing the part.

334
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:08,787
My biggest dream is to become an actor.

335
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:10,437
I started the role.

336
00:20:10,437 --> 00:20:12,671
Let me finish it.

337
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:14,387
Don't worry.

338
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:15,829
I know what to do.

339
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:17,712
See you tonight.

340
00:20:17,712 --> 00:20:19,262
Huang Di, we're leaving.

341
00:20:19,262 --> 00:20:21,162
Coming.

342
00:20:21,162 --> 00:20:22,145
Wait for me.

343
00:20:22,145 --> 00:20:24,871
Huang Di, don't get mad.

344
00:20:24,871 --> 00:20:27,820
You know how Xinyi can be.

345
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:30,537
Of course.

346
00:20:30,537 --> 00:20:33,495
I feel bad for whoever she marries.

347
00:20:33,495 --> 00:20:36,437
There's no hope for him.

348
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:41,229
My stomach is in pain.

349
00:20:41,229 --> 00:20:42,870
I will go now.

350
00:20:58,612 --> 00:20:59,437
Xinyi.

351
00:20:59,437 --> 00:21:01,537
Sihan, are you free later?

352
00:21:01,537 --> 00:21:03,787
Let's get dinner.

353
00:21:03,787 --> 00:21:05,203
Did something happen?

354
00:21:05,203 --> 00:21:07,038
You know Zhang Xiao, right?

355
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:09,454
Her Black Cat Detective made an appearance.

356
00:21:09,454 --> 00:21:10,620
I have plans with her.

357
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,919
Will you go with me?

358
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:15,312
Black Cat Detective?

359
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:16,996
Her boyfriend.

360
00:21:16,996 --> 00:21:19,938
I just met him. He's great.

361
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:21,729
Where did you meet him?

362
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:23,145
The hospital.

363
00:21:23,145 --> 00:21:25,079
I went to visit her father.

364
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:27,520
Don't make me go alone.

365
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,896
Okay, see you later.

366
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:30,412
Okay, bye.

367
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:32,087
Bye.

368
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:36,654
Black Cat Detective.

369
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:38,812
Xiaoxiao.

370
00:21:38,812 --> 00:21:43,446
You never told me about Siyu.

371
00:21:44,287 --> 00:21:46,420
He's just a friend.

372
00:21:47,495 --> 00:21:50,896
So now he's just a friend?

373
00:21:50,896 --> 00:21:54,054
He really is just a friend.

374
00:21:54,829 --> 00:21:56,220
Really?

375
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,479
Fine.

376
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:02,996
I'll trust that he's just a friend then.

377
00:22:02,996 --> 00:22:05,270
But if he ever does become your boyfriend,

378
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,162
be sure to let me know.

379
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:10,219
Got it.

380
00:22:16,495 --> 00:22:18,012
Xiaoxiao.

381
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:21,245
Do you have any news about your sister?

382
00:22:22,303 --> 00:22:23,887
No.

383
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,812
It's been a month.

384
00:22:29,787 --> 00:22:31,954
If we were in the desert,

385
00:22:31,954 --> 00:22:34,787
she would have an even lower chance of surviving.

386
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:37,704
Dad, this is not the desert.

387
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:40,045
Why do you keep talking about it?

388
00:22:42,145 --> 00:22:43,562
Xiaoxiao.

389
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:50,587
I don't think we should've given your sister's earring to that man.

390
00:22:51,646 --> 00:22:54,087
You mean Director Yin?

391
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:58,454
Maybe if those earrings were together,

392
00:22:58,454 --> 00:23:02,579
you can one day reunite with your sister.

393
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:05,919
Dad, you're just superstitious.

394
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,145
No.

395
00:23:08,445 --> 00:23:11,479
I have faith and hope.

396
00:23:12,646 --> 00:23:15,846
We should all have these two things.

397
00:23:23,071 --> 00:23:25,538
Don't be nervous. I got you.

398
00:23:28,462 --> 00:23:31,287
Your earring is beautiful.

399
00:23:31,287 --> 00:23:33,829
It was my mom's.

400
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,654
Why do you only have one?

401
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:40,779
My sister has the other one.

402
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:52,287
Piggy, Black Cat Detective.

403
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:53,812
I'm glad he's here.

404
00:23:55,854 --> 00:23:57,362
Princess.

405
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,495
Siyu?

406
00:24:00,495 --> 00:24:02,662
You know each other?

407
00:24:02,662 --> 00:24:06,062
Brother, you're Xinyi's boyfriend?

408
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:07,712
Brother?

409
00:24:08,771 --> 00:24:11,003
You're his brother?

410
00:24:11,003 --> 00:24:12,838
Yes, have a seat.

411
00:24:12,838 --> 00:24:15,646
Piggy, it's such a small world.

412
00:24:15,646 --> 00:24:18,838
We found a pair of brothers.

413
00:24:18,838 --> 00:24:20,250
Yes, what a coincidence.

414
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:23,446
I can't even believe it myself.

415
00:24:24,646 --> 00:24:28,620
But you guys look so different.

416
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,854
We don't share the same mom.

417
00:24:29,854 --> 00:24:32,038
Really?

418
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:36,787
Sihan, you never told me you had a brother.

419
00:24:36,787 --> 00:24:38,604
We agreed before.

420
00:24:38,604 --> 00:24:40,229
We don't talk about family.

421
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,912
Alright, we can talk about it later down the line.

422
00:24:42,912 --> 00:24:44,379
Let's order food, I'm so hungry.

423
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:45,203
Okay.

424
00:24:45,203 --> 00:24:47,003
Xiaoxiao, what do you want to eat?

425
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,354
Waiter, get us another menu please.

426
00:24:52,812 --> 00:24:54,145
Sir, here's your menu.

427
00:24:54,145 --> 00:24:55,645
Thank you.

428
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,254
I'm going to wash my hands first.

429
00:25:12,646 --> 00:25:15,796
Sihan, what do you want to eat?

430
00:25:16,412 --> 00:25:17,646
Whatever.

431
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:20,020
I'm not feeling too well today.

432
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,187
Are you alright?

433
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,546
I'm fine.

434
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:28,754
I have to make a call.

435
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,062
Xiaoxiao.

436
00:25:45,062 --> 00:25:47,979
What are you doing? Let go of me.

437
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,120
Xiaoxiao.

438
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,604
I'll tell Xinyi everything.

439
00:25:53,162 --> 00:25:54,829
Are you crazy?

440
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:56,162
Do you want me to hate you?

441
00:25:56,162 --> 00:25:59,370
If I make it clear, I'll only hurt one person.

442
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,996
If I don't make it clear that we already broke up,

443
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:04,162
I hurt the three of us.

444
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:08,012
Don't tell me you already don't love me anymore.

445
00:26:09,345 --> 00:26:10,746
I admit it.

446
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:14,037
I still love you.

447
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,812
But I love Xinyi more.

448
00:26:16,812 --> 00:26:19,479
Xiaoxiao, relationships aren't things.

449
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:21,646
You can't just put it down like it's nothing.

450
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,420
I know Xinyi.

451
00:26:24,595 --> 00:26:27,512
She's always been a princess.

452
00:26:27,512 --> 00:26:29,787
She's never experienced any setbacks.

453
00:26:30,887 --> 00:26:33,079
She won't be able to accept this.

454
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:35,112
But she'll find out eventually.

455
00:26:35,112 --> 00:26:36,429
Black...

456
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,062
Director Kang.

457
00:26:43,245 --> 00:26:45,195
Please.

458
00:26:47,054 --> 00:26:49,996
Please let her have her perfect world.

459
00:26:51,704 --> 00:26:54,738
This is too cruel for her.

460
00:26:59,912 --> 00:27:01,420
Xiaoxiao.

461
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:04,771
I don't want anything else.

462
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:06,562
I just want you.

463
00:27:06,562 --> 00:27:08,329
Xinyi and I are of the past.

464
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:10,787
My heart is with you and not with her.

465
00:27:10,787 --> 00:27:14,070
Do you think I can give her happiness?

466
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,954
Stop it.

467
00:27:18,954 --> 00:27:19,871
No.

468
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,395
I have to tell her.

469
00:27:21,395 --> 00:27:22,579
What are you doing?

470
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:23,412
I have to tell her.

471
00:27:23,412 --> 00:27:25,229
I have to tell her everything.

472
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:27,220
Kang Sihan.

473
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,812
Don't you understand?

474
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:32,862
Between you and Xinyi, I choose Xinyi.

475
00:27:34,162 --> 00:27:36,062
She showed up in my life

476
00:27:36,062 --> 00:27:39,079
seven years earlier than you.

477
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:41,390
She is my best friend.

478
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:45,254
You saw what she did at the office.

479
00:27:45,912 --> 00:27:48,587
She won't let anyone bully me.

480
00:27:49,303 --> 00:27:52,220
So I won't allow anyone to hurt her.

481
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:56,454
If you want to tell her,

482
00:27:56,454 --> 00:27:58,787
I won't forgive you,

483
00:27:58,787 --> 00:28:00,979
and I won't forgive myself.

484
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:04,637
I will disappear from your life.

485
00:28:35,638 --> 00:28:38,087
I ordered your favorite corn.

486
00:28:38,746 --> 00:28:40,120
Thank you.

487
00:28:45,287 --> 00:28:46,595
Sit.

488
00:28:47,454 --> 00:28:48,846
Let's eat.

489
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:57,571
How are you feeling?

490
00:28:59,203 --> 00:29:01,562
I think I should go home and rest.

491
00:29:01,562 --> 00:29:03,390
You should eat with them.

492
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,790
Sorry.

493
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:11,162
Piggy, I should go with him.

494
00:29:11,162 --> 00:29:13,162
I'll go to the hospital with him.

495
00:29:13,162 --> 00:29:14,220
Enjoy your food.

496
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,504
Sorry, see you next time.

497
00:29:22,954 --> 00:29:24,954
You should eat something.

498
00:29:24,954 --> 00:29:27,090
I have no appetite.

499
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,020
You go ahead.

500
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,019
Did he bother you at the bathroom?

501
00:29:34,403 --> 00:29:37,687
Thank you for what you did today.

502
00:29:37,687 --> 00:29:39,120
It's nothing.

503
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,919
I'll go now.

504
00:29:43,704 --> 00:29:45,029
Go ahead.

505
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,720
♫ <i>It falls to the bottom of my heart</i> ♫

506
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:57,846
♫ <i>Seething endlessly</i> ♫

507
00:29:57,846 --> 00:30:03,654
♫ <i>Every night I wake up from my empty dream</i> ♫

508
00:30:03,654 --> 00:30:09,387
♫ <i>Losing you is like losing everything</i> ♫

509
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:14,162
♫ <i>Who remembers the day we broke up?</i> ♫

510
00:30:14,162 --> 00:30:19,679
♫ <i>It was still raining</i> ♫

511
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,038
♫ <i>We promised not to give up</i> ♫

512
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:30,579
♫ <i>We were really stupid</i> ♫

513
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:34,579
♫ <i>Now I'm left all alone</i> ♫

514
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:42,095
♫ <i>Involuntarily</i> ♫

515
00:30:43,162 --> 00:30:44,512
Zhang Xiao.

516
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:52,703
Supervisor Yin, do you need something?

517
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,812
Open it.

518
00:31:06,996 --> 00:31:09,162
This belongs to Lan Lan.

519
00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:12,638
I think it's best to give it to you.

520
00:31:14,403 --> 00:31:16,780
This earring is a pair.

521
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,304
Just like you and Lan Lan.

522
00:31:20,687 --> 00:31:24,745
So I think they should be together.

523
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,070
What happened?

524
00:31:32,662 --> 00:31:34,838
My earring is missing.

525
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:11,579
We looked everywhere on this road.

526
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:13,845
I don't think it dropped out here.

527
00:32:14,979 --> 00:32:18,954
Do you think it dropped anywhere else?

528
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,137
I haven't been anywhere except here and the restaurant.

529
00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:26,919
Why can't I find it?

530
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:28,429
What do I do?

531
00:32:32,746 --> 00:32:35,137
If both the earrings are together,

532
00:32:36,437 --> 00:32:40,054
maybe I can reunite with Lan Lan one day.

533
00:32:43,145 --> 00:32:45,729
Sometimes things are gone forever once they're gone.

534
00:32:49,512 --> 00:32:51,737
You should have faith and hope.

535
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,745
We should all have these two things.

536
00:33:22,787 --> 00:33:24,579
Seems like there are people just like you.

537
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:26,587
People are always dropping their things.

538
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,119
Since you're already down there,

539
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:35,603
can you help me look?

540
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:48,762
<i>I never expected to see this side of you.</i>

541
00:33:56,312 --> 00:33:58,620
Come back up.

542
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,646
It's getting cold now, stop looking.

543
00:34:01,646 --> 00:34:03,220
What did you say?

544
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:17,229
Now you're smiling.

545
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:35,162
Ice face.

546
00:34:35,162 --> 00:34:37,229
So you can smile.

547
00:34:37,229 --> 00:34:39,295
I can take revenge too.

548
00:34:43,395 --> 00:34:45,054
What are you doing?

549
00:35:16,746 --> 00:35:18,962
He's been waiting for you.

550
00:35:26,996 --> 00:35:28,270
The show is over.

551
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:30,454
I think we should talk.

552
00:35:30,454 --> 00:35:31,412
About what?

553
00:35:31,412 --> 00:35:32,896
Why are you pretending to be me?

554
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:35,537
Someone has to do it.

555
00:35:35,537 --> 00:35:36,787
I'm not joking.

556
00:35:36,787 --> 00:35:38,454
I'm being serious.

557
00:35:40,245 --> 00:35:43,595
I just don't want her to have a hard time.

558
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,687
You like her?

559
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:47,771
I am just helping her.

560
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,787
Siyu.

561
00:35:49,787 --> 00:35:52,362
I hope that this stops here.

562
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:54,245
She needs me.

563
00:35:54,245 --> 00:35:57,646
She needs a man who can lend her a shoulder and love her,

564
00:35:57,646 --> 00:36:01,020
and not a boy who can play and eat with her.

565
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,704
So does she need a man who cheats on her?

566
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:04,871
I don't care what you think of this.

567
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,912
I don't want you to get involved in this.

568
00:36:06,912 --> 00:36:08,562
Don't mess things up.

569
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,038
Brother, you're selfish.

570
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:16,203
All I want is for her to be happy.

571
00:36:16,203 --> 00:36:17,471
But you?

572
00:36:17,471 --> 00:36:19,996
You want to happiness from her.

573
00:36:19,996 --> 00:36:21,829
You don't care about her.

574
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:23,995
You only care about yourself.

575
00:36:53,938 --> 00:36:56,162
You'll get drunk drinking alone.

576
00:36:56,162 --> 00:36:57,546
I'll drink with you.

577
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:12,038
Now that's Hero's bartender.

578
00:37:12,038 --> 00:37:13,312
Again.

579
00:37:23,479 --> 00:37:25,079
Again.

580
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:27,454
Why are you so down?

581
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:30,020
Do you think you're the only one with a crush?

582
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,395
Others don't matter to me.

583
00:37:32,395 --> 00:37:34,145
How can you say that?

584
00:37:34,145 --> 00:37:36,312
What if you're the one they have a crush on?

585
00:37:38,287 --> 00:37:40,129
She has bad luck then.

586
00:37:42,912 --> 00:37:44,829
I am that girl.

587
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:48,219
I've had a crush on you for so long.

588
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,119
It must feel terrible...

589
00:37:57,096 --> 00:37:58,919
to have a crush on me.

It's nothing.

00:39:11,395 --> 00:39:14,162
You seem distracted.

605
00:39:14,162 --> 00:39:15,904
It's really nothing.

606
00:39:18,687 --> 00:39:23,238
Did that friend become your boyfriend?

607
00:39:23,912 --> 00:39:25,329
What friend?

608
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:26,746
Come on.

613
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,354
There's nothing going on between us.

614
00:39:37,354 --> 00:39:39,270
We were just teasing Xinyi.

615
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,495
Don't talk about this anymore.

616
00:39:42,495 --> 00:39:44,329
If there's nothing between you two,

617
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:46,912
then there's something with someone else.

618
00:39:46,912 --> 00:39:49,162
Have I met him?

619
00:39:49,162 --> 00:39:50,504
Dad.

620
00:39:51,871 --> 00:39:53,604
I'll go do the discharge paperwork.

621
00:39:53,604 --> 00:39:55,246
Wait for me here.

622
00:39:58,454 --> 00:39:59,479
Please take this.

00:40:10,662 --> 00:40:12,329
Did you come visit my dad?

626
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:14,412
I just finished the paperwork.

627
00:40:20,562 --> 00:40:22,170
Princess.

628
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:26,796
You...

629
00:40:27,704 --> 00:40:30,729
Don't tell anyone.

630
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:33,979
I am pregnant.

631
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:38,212
When did you find out?

632
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,254
A month ago.

633
00:40:42,038 --> 00:40:43,512
How many months now?

634
00:40:44,595 --> 00:40:46,287
Four months.

635
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,370
Does he know about it?

636
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,929
No.

637
00:40:52,929 --> 00:40:54,912
I don't want to let him know.

638
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:58,929
Did you tell your mom?

639
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:09,438
What is your plan?

640
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:12,929
I'm having the baby.

641
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,495
You're sure?

642
00:41:16,646 --> 00:41:17,829
I'll explain it to you later on.

643
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:19,829
Are you free now?

644
00:41:19,829 --> 00:41:21,746
It's my first time getting a prenatal test.

645
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:23,287
I'm a little scared.

646
00:41:23,287 --> 00:41:25,129

Yes.

650
00:42:01,662 --> 00:42:03,012
Dad.

651
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,119
I finished the paperwork,

652
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,996
but something came up.

653
00:42:07,996 --> 00:42:10,495
Can you go home yourself?

654
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,829
Sorry.

655
00:42:13,454 --> 00:42:16,487
Bye.

657
00:42:25,571 --> 00:42:28,879
Did something happen?

658
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:33,403
I'm scared.

659
00:42:34,687 --> 00:42:36,295
Why?

660
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:42,200
We broke up before he came back.

661
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,412
I just treated it as just a break.

662
00:42:46,412 --> 00:42:48,996
I thought we would make up after a few days.

663
00:42:48,996 --> 00:42:53,462
But he came back on his own.

664
00:42:55,579 --> 00:42:59,003
I wanted to forget about him too.

665
00:42:59,003 --> 00:43:01,429
But after a few days,

666
00:43:01,429 --> 00:43:05,200
I realized I can't live without him.

667
00:43:06,287 --> 00:43:09,162
How about him?

668
00:43:09,162 --> 00:43:11,038
I don't know.

669
00:43:11,038 --> 00:43:12,979
We've been together for three years.

670
00:43:12,979 --> 00:43:15,287
We can't just end it.

671
00:43:16,746 --> 00:43:20,370
Don't let him know about this.

672
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:22,412
I don't want to pressure him.

673
00:43:24,162 --> 00:43:25,520
Okay.

674
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,579
But you have to tell your mother.

675
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:30,754
No way.

676
00:43:30,754 --> 00:43:34,119
She'll go to the Kang residence

677
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:36,938
and ask him to marry me.

678
00:43:36,938 --> 00:43:38,812
I don't want that.

679
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:43,119
I want to change my bad habits

680
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,396
and have him fall in love with me all over again.
