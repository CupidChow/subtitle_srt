2
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:43,040
<i>[Episode 9]</i>

3
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:46,409
Hurry.

4
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,092
Faster.

5
00:01:50,018 --> 00:01:51,442
Come in.

6
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:55,542
Everyone.

7
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:56,934
Gather.

8
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:59,283
We have two new colleagues joining us today.

9
00:01:59,283 --> 00:02:00,976
This is Chef Xiao Yu,

10
00:02:00,976 --> 00:02:02,751
and this is Chef Xiao Yu's assistant, Ling Dang.

11
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:05,350
Please take care of them.

12
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,834
Thank you.

13
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:15,018
Which cuisine do you specialize in?

14
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:19,409
I've cooked the five major Chinese cuisines, Western, and Man-Han feasts.

15
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:23,350
Great.

16
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,309
There are so many cuisines.

17
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:30,309
Even having a taste of them all is a difficult task.

18
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:36,099
You said you're experienced with Man-Han feasts.

19
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:37,684
Then I want to ask you,

20
00:02:37,684 --> 00:02:42,083
which dishes are you an expert in?

21
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,250
Well...

22
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:46,434
Red meatballs, white meatballs,

23
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:47,450
braised meatballs, deep-fried meatballs,

24
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,617
Southern style saute meatballs, alfalfa meatballs,

25
00:02:48,617 --> 00:02:49,992
pork-seafood meatballs, braised pork balls in gravy,

26
00:02:49,992 --> 00:02:51,083
green onion meatballs, tofu meatballs-

27
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,500
Alright.

28
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,142
We're in the kitchen,

29
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,142
not in a crosstalk theater.

30
00:02:57,142 --> 00:03:00,083
I hope you're not all bark and no bite.

31
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:03,142
Out of the dishes you mentioned just now,

32
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,851
the one that requires the most skill are the braised pork balls in gravy.

33
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:10,675
Chef Xiao Yu, can you show us your skills?

34
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:12,918
Yes, that would be great.

35
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:14,792
It's just braised pork balls in gravy.

36
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:16,125
Piece of cake.

37
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:20,059
But I have a small quirk when I'm cooking.

38
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:22,059
What's your quirk?

39
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:24,809
I can't have people watch me cook.

40
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:26,800
I'll get nervous if people watch me.

41
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,500
Then I can't cook well.

42
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:32,959
I never heard of that before.

43
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,684
Chef Xiao Yu,

44
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:40,475
we're an open kitchen.

45
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:43,684
It's hard to not be seen while cooking.

46
00:03:43,684 --> 00:03:46,792
Then I don't think I can make braised pork balls in gravy.

47
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:49,151
Can you speak with her?

48
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:52,267
Assistant Qiao.

49
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:54,784
Director Yin asked me to speak to you.

50
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:57,350
He is Director Yin's brother.

51
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,225
Please take care of him, understand?

52
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:02,325
Okay, I understand.

53
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:05,167
Chef Xiao Yu,

54
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:06,876
Director Yin told us to take care of you.

55
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:10,059
If you're met with any problems while working,

56
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:11,834
you can go speak with him at any time.

57
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,209
Alright.

58
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:15,042
I'll get going then.

59
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:16,099
Thank you.

60
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:17,826
Goodbye, Assistant Qiao.

61
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:25,292
Prepare a separate kitchen for Chef Xiao Yu.

62
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:28,225
Manager Wang, that's never happened before.

63
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:30,309
It's happening now.

64
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:32,292
Why are you all standing there? Go.

65
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:34,434
Come on.

66
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:36,459
I'll get going now, Chef Xiao Yu.

67
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:39,409
Thank you for helping, Manager.

68
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,376
Chef Xiao Yu, we have an order from a customer.

69
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:56,300
Did I go the wrong way?

70
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,851
Come back.

71
00:04:57,851 --> 00:04:59,109
What's your name?

72
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:00,667
Fan Lishan.

73
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:01,767
What's your horoscope?

74
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,834
- Gemini.
- Gemini?

75
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:06,392
That's very compatible with me.

76
00:05:06,392 --> 00:05:07,667
You look honest.

77
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:10,059
Do you want to be my friend?

78
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,500
This is my collection.

79
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,959
Help yourself.

80
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,918
I can't drink on the job.

81
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:17,367
Don't be so stubborn.

82
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:20,042
Only you and I will know.

83
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,475
It's just a cocktail.

84
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:26,100
You won't get drunk from it.

85
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,559
It's fruit combined with alcohol.

86
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:29,659
It tastes good. Try it.

87
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,709
Give it a try.

88
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:34,125
Alright.

89
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:40,209
- It's pretty good.
- Right?

90
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:40,976
I almost forgot.

91
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:43,342
Chef Xiao Yu, this is your menu.

92
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:47,309
Lemon chicken, fried shrimp, shrimp tofu.

93
00:05:47,309 --> 00:05:48,559
That's too easy.

94
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:50,784
I feel no pressure at all.

95
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:57,626
Why are you still standing there?

96
00:05:57,626 --> 00:06:00,976
Watching me cook will get you struck by lightning.

97
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:02,376
Alright.

98
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:08,459
I've eaten lemon chicken before,

99
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:10,367
but how do you cook it?

100
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,392
Ling Dang, we'll just get it delivered from a nearby restaurant.

101
00:06:15,392 --> 00:06:16,726
Ling Dang.

102
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,892
What are you doing?

103
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:24,350
I'm making lemon chicken and friend shrimp.

104
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,167
You know how to cook that?

105
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:29,876
My dad is a national first-class chef.

106
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:31,792
Your dad is awesome.

107
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,184
This goes out to him.

108
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:44,726
Boss, what are you doing?

109
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:47,050
Something important. Don't disturb me.

110
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:06,375
Ling Dang, help me make this.

111
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,918
Blueberry cake.

112
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:09,142
Blueberry cake?

113
00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:10,999
Don't you not like dessert?

114
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:13,460
I like it now.

115
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,600
Is it for Zhang Xiao?

116
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,642
Why are you quiet?

117
00:07:18,642 --> 00:07:20,392
Do you like her?

118
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:25,542
Congratulations, Miss.

119
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:28,250
You're sitting in our lucky seat.

120
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,034
This is our gift to you.

121
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,726
Lucky seat?

122
00:07:32,726 --> 00:07:35,684
Yes, it's our latest event.

123
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:37,234
Thank you.

124
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:38,334
You're welcome.

125
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:41,042
The cream on the cake has been processed.

126
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:42,309
You won't gain weight from it.

127
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:43,976
Please enjoy it.

128
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:45,500
Thank you.

129
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:52,959
How considerate.

130
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,759
Jack, your skin isn't looking too good.

131
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,899
Are you having any troubles?

132
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:07,367
Don't you know?

133
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,876
I have to face stupid Zhang Xiao everyday.

134
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:12,100
Do you think my skin would look good?

135
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,559
I'm going to the spa after work

136
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:17,626
to see if I can do something for my skin.

137
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:21,167
Didn't you say Zhang Xiao always wants to curry favor with the chairman?

138
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,459
She must be very cunning.

139
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:26,334
So why did she offend Director Yin?

140
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:27,667
You have no idea.

141
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:30,918
It's called acting recklessly.

142
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:32,042
I'm sure you don't know.

143
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:36,600
Her brain was squished between a door.

144
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,083
She's over there.

145
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:47,042
What are you looking at?

146
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:49,060
Never seen a handsome man before?

147
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:52,542
Did you bring Miss Lan Lan her flowers yet?

148
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:55,434
You can put your work aside for today.

149
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,959
Go sweep the studio.

150
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,492
If there's a spot of dirt anywhere,

151
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,959
you know what the consequences are.

152
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,459
Can't you see I'm eating?

153
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:09,642
All you know to do is eat.

154
00:09:09,642 --> 00:09:12,525
Aren't you afraid of gaining weight?

155
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:16,375
Are you done?

156
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,125
Why are you so angry?

157
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,226
Not classy at all.

158
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:24,160
Let's go over there.

159
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,030
- Come on.
- Okay.

160
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:30,575
Waiter.

161
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:35,584
I want to order Provence pumpkin soup.

162
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:37,292
What do you want to eat?

163
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:38,999
- I want a sandwich.
- Okay.

164
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:41,951
I want a vegetable salad.

165
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:44,042
- Please wait.
- Alright, that's all.

166
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,475
Xiao Fan.

167
00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:50,726
What's the matter, Chef Xiao Yu?

168
00:09:50,726 --> 00:09:52,667
Do you want more of my cocktails?

169
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:55,667
I can't keep drinking your stuff.

170
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:56,667
It's just a few bottles.

171
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:57,809
You've helped me a lot.

172
00:09:57,809 --> 00:09:58,667
Go to my room.

173
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,484
Ling Dang has prepared it.

174
00:10:00,484 --> 00:10:02,375
Okay, if you insist.

175
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,225
Let me take these dishes out first.

176
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:05,776
Go now. The manager is coming soon.

177
00:10:05,776 --> 00:10:07,225
But these dishes...

178
00:10:07,225 --> 00:10:08,018
I'll take them out for you.

179
00:10:08,018 --> 00:10:09,334
Is it that table?

180
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:12,559
Yes, just follow the perfume.

181
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,200
Okay, no problem.

182
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,100
Thank you.

183
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,367
You're welcome.

184
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:37,792
You have to use lip balm,

185
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:40,375
or your lips will get dry.

186
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:42,409
Your dishes.

187
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,992
Your sandwich.

188
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,459
And your salad.

189
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,250
Okay, thank you.

190
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:51,667
Your pumpkin soup.

191
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,999
Your Provence pumpkin soup, please enjoy.

192
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:55,340
Thank you.

193
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,830
Wait.

194
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:00,517
Why are you covered up?

195
00:11:00,517 --> 00:11:02,475
I've been getting a lot of acne.

196
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:05,275
I'm worried it would affect your appetite, so I covered it.

197
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:06,867
You're so considerate.

198
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:09,392
I'll praise you in your feedback.

199
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:11,392
Thank you, please enjoy.

200
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:16,892
Jack.

201
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:18,267
You're already so slim.

202
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:19,834
Why are you still watching what you eat?

203
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:22,726
Right, you're making us feel embarrassed to eat.

204
00:11:22,726 --> 00:11:23,918
You don't understand.

205
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:26,042
It's natural beauty.

206
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:35,299
Delicious.

207
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:39,099
Yue-Sai's cosmetics for this season

208
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:42,142
is mainly focused on a young and fashionable style,

209
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:46,542
mainly targeting women 25 to 30 years old.

210
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:49,059
Its core component is ganoderma spore polysaccharides,

211
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:51,209
and it's extracted from high tech.

212
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:55,100
The raw materials are from the most essential parts of ganodema.

213
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:01,225
You might not know.

214
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:02,959
Tracing back to 300 years ago,

215
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,250
the princess and concubines from the Qing Dynasty

216
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,809
used ganoderma as cosmetics.

217
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:14,200
So our advertising concept this time around focuses on good complexion.

218
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:19,042
Of course, I get it.

219
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:23,851
Some of you may not understand what aristocratic temperament may be

220
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:25,976
since your lives may be of low standard,

221
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:28,025
like a frog at the bottom of a well.

222
00:12:28,025 --> 00:12:31,542
You'll never understand the world of the bird.

223
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,276
Zhang Xiao.

224
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:40,567
I know you don't get it.

225
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:42,983
But it doesn't matter.

226
00:12:42,983 --> 00:12:45,475
You can look at Jack,

227
00:12:45,475 --> 00:12:47,350
me.

228
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,183
Then you'll understand what aristocratic temperament is.

229
00:12:51,183 --> 00:12:55,400
It's pretty simple. Just two important points.

230
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,575
First, be a high-profile person.

231
00:12:58,575 --> 00:13:02,426
Second, exude understated elegance.

232
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,100
Aristocratic temperament won't be easily understood by the ordinary person.

233
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,584
Just like the perfume that I usually use.

234
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:21,559
You won't understand that either.

235
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:24,334
The third point of aristocratic temperament

236
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:26,959
is to be reserved.

237
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,792
Reserved means...

238
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:34,042
Meeting dismissed.

239
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,683
Let's go.

240
00:13:49,851 --> 00:13:52,283
<i>ZX, have you been busy?</i>

241
00:13:52,283 --> 00:13:53,642
<i>Why haven't you been replying to me?</i>

242
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:56,434
<i>Are you free for dinner tonight?</i>

243
00:13:56,434 --> 00:13:57,918
<i>Why are you treating me to dinner again?</i>

244
00:13:57,918 --> 00:13:59,667
<i>Did you get paid?</i>

245
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:02,125
<i>Bingo.</i>

246
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:05,734
<i>Alright.</i>

247
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:08,959
<i>There's always time for food.</i>

248
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:09,767
<i>Good.</i>

249
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:12,409
<i>See you at 6pm.</i>

250
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:16,926
Come in.

251
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,442
Chairman, here's the information you wanted.

252
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,170
<i>[Zhang Zejiang]</i>

253
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:39,742
<i>What are you doing? Go!</i>

254
00:14:39,742 --> 00:14:42,159
<i>Don't say I didn't warn you.</i>

255
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,142
<i>Alright, Chenggui.</i>

256
00:14:43,142 --> 00:14:44,942
<i>- Stop it.
- Go!</i>

257
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:47,142
<i>- Chenggui.
- Stop it!</i>

258
00:14:47,142 --> 00:14:50,159
<i>The tornado is coming. Get in the car!</i>

259
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:53,726
Can you contact this person?

260
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,417
I can't get through to his phone.

261
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:57,142
I asked Zhang Xiao before

262
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:59,709
and she said her father always bring an expedition team into the desert.

263
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:02,167
It's common to not be able to contact him.

264
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,751
Don't let Zhang Xiao know about this.

265
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,125
I understand. Don't worry.

266
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,934
I want to contact this person.

267
00:15:10,934 --> 00:15:12,183
Okay.

268
00:15:13,142 --> 00:15:14,309
Chairman.

269
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:17,183
Did Madam talk to you about the birthday party?

270
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,183
What birthday party?

271
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,375
To celebrate your 60th birthday.

272
00:15:24,142 --> 00:15:25,926
I almost forgot about it.

273
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:30,726
She said that Yin Zheng organized it for me.

274
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,918
It's been so long.

275
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:37,909
He's finally willing to do something for me.

276
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,709
It must've been Zhao Lan's idea.

277
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:48,392
Alright.

278
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:09,167
<i>Why did you take mom's box?</i>

279
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:33,392
You're back.

280
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,350
Did you eat?

281
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,142
No, I was waiting for you.

282
00:16:37,142 --> 00:16:39,209
Your son developed this for you.

283
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:43,375
He said you will stay young after using it.

284
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,242
This kid.

285
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:47,525
Give it to me.

286
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:51,692
Did something happen at the office?

287
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:53,999
I'm just tired.

288
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:56,534
I'll give you a massage.

289
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,309
Here.

290
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:01,834
You're 60 years old now.

291
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:04,100
You should pay more attention to your health.

292
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,283
I can't help it.

293
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:10,018
Let the young men do what they can for you.

294
00:17:10,018 --> 00:17:12,709
Why must you do everything yourself?

295
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:16,226
You won't understand business.

296
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,934
Zhentian.

297
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:22,225
I heard Sihan is back.

298
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:24,330
Have you seen him?

299
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:26,642
No.

300
00:17:26,642 --> 00:17:29,250
I want to invite him here.

301
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,099
It's been so long.

302
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:33,767
I still haven't gotten closure.

303
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:37,517
I asked him to leave, not you.

304
00:17:37,517 --> 00:17:38,976
Why are you blaming yourself?

305
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:39,709
But...

306
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:41,726
Alright, stop thinking about it.

307
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:45,684
I will find a time to ask him to visit.

308
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:51,592
Isn't your birthday a good opportunity?

309
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:53,792
He won't come.

310
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:55,042
Why not?

311
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:56,999
No reason.

312
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:59,242
No one knows a son better than his father.

313
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:03,526
Stop worrying about this.

314
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:10,142
I'm quite happy that Xiao Zheng organized

315
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:12,099
my birthday party for me.

316
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:14,584
Yes, I also didn't expect it.

317
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:16,876
You didn't ask him to do so?

318
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:19,542
I just reminded him of your birthday.

319
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:21,751
He took it upon himself to organize it for you.

320
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:23,083
See.

321
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:26,099
Everyone eventually grows up.

322
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:27,767
Stop worrying.

323
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:29,330
Sihan will come around one day too.

324
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,990
He will come to understand us.

325
00:18:38,142 --> 00:18:41,751
Lastly, I want French stewed liver for dessert.

326
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:43,617
Okay, please wait.

327
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:52,959
Since you like watches so much,

328
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:54,967
I'll get one for you as a gift.

329
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,640
It's okay.

330
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,670
I'm not interested in watches.

331
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:02,542
I'm just thinking.

332
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05,459
The founder of this watch, Botwright.

333
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:10,517
He developed such amazing watches 300 years ago.

334
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:14,575
A lot of European nobles and famous people like to collect his watches.

335
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:18,892
The kings and queens are his fans also.

336
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:22,142
You know a lot.

337
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:24,267
I just heard from my mother.

338
00:19:24,267 --> 00:19:25,892
When I shop with her,

339
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:28,476
she likes to tell me stories about the brands.

340
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:33,051
Sorry.

341
00:19:34,584 --> 00:19:35,934
Mom.

342
00:19:37,018 --> 00:19:38,542
I bought it.

343
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:41,225
I spent the whole day too.

344
00:19:41,225 --> 00:19:42,959
My legs are swollen.

345
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,392
I can't tell you.

346
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:47,559
But don't worry,

347
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,183
I'm sure you'll be satisfied.

348
00:19:49,183 --> 00:19:50,309
He'll be happy too.

349
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:51,834
Okay?

350
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:55,392
Okay.

351
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:59,100
Anyway, remember everything I'm doing today.

352
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,734
Next time don't say I'm not filial to him.

353
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:05,534
Okay, bye.

354
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:12,042
My mom cares about the old man so much.

355
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:13,642
It's his sixtieth birthday.

356
00:20:13,642 --> 00:20:15,492
Of course she's taking it seriously.

357
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,183
In order to make your mom happy,

358
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:23,417
you'll have to do whatever he wants on his birthday.

359
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:26,100
Don't argue with him.

360
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,350
Don't worry.

361
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,959
I know.

362
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:32,417
In fact, I organized the birthday party

363
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:34,334
not only for my mom,

364
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,800
but also for you.

365
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:40,292
For me?

366
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:43,309
I hope to officially introduce you to them

367
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,492
while they're in a good mood.

368
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:48,209
Thank you.

369
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:50,534
As long as you can understand my intentions.

370
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,334
I understand.

371
00:20:54,225 --> 00:20:56,142
No matter what you do,

372
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:58,067
I will support you.

373
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,667
Can you close your eyes?

374
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,167
Open them.

375
00:21:24,142 --> 00:21:25,600
Do you like it?

376
00:21:27,726 --> 00:21:29,318
I like it.

377
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:33,867
Thank you.

378
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,142
Don't say thank you.

379
00:21:37,142 --> 00:21:40,242
I would do anything for you.

380
00:22:14,183 --> 00:22:18,392
♫ <i>I'm absolutely crazy about you</i> ♫

381
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:22,851
♫ <i>You're my absolute choice</i> ♫

382
00:22:22,851 --> 00:22:27,142
♫ <i>Whether or not we're compatible</i> ♫

383
00:22:27,142 --> 00:22:32,275
♫ <i>Do you feel the same as me?</i> ♫

384
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:38,099
♫ <i>I'm ready to be happy with you</i> ♫

385
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:42,475
♫ <i>You're my rain after a long drought</i> ♫

386
00:22:42,475 --> 00:22:46,751
♫ <i>Whether or not we can turn this around</i> ♫

387
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:51,850
♫ <i>I want to ask about your feelings for me</i> ♫

388
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:58,242
♫ <i>I still stammer over the words and want to disappear</i> ♫

389
00:22:58,242 --> 00:23:03,051
♫ <i>I struggle after realizing it's just the beginning</i> ♫

390
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:13,559
You don't want me to take you home?

391
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,892
No, it's close.

392
00:23:15,892 --> 00:23:17,950
I can just walk home.

393
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,450
Thank you.

394
00:23:30,334 --> 00:23:32,542
It's the first snow of the year.

395
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:36,950
It's snowing a lot. Put on a coat.

396
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,018
Thank you.

397
00:23:41,225 --> 00:23:42,942
Give me a second.

398
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,183
Do you like snow?

399
00:24:04,183 --> 00:24:05,609
Yes.

400
00:24:06,225 --> 00:24:10,550
I think it's the most pure thing in the world.

401
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,726
How about you?

402
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:16,084
I love what you love.

403
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,051
I mean...

404
00:24:22,584 --> 00:24:25,250
You're quite amazing.

405
00:24:28,876 --> 00:24:33,851
I heard that if a couple watches the first snow together,

406
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:37,709
their love will become the snow on the floor.

407
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,500
It melts into water and freezes into ice.

408
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,675
Then the couple will be together forever.

409
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,292
Have you tried it before?

410
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:51,183
No.

411
00:24:51,183 --> 00:24:52,492
How about you?

412
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:59,099
From your expression, I'm sure you have.

413
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:01,559
You will know next year.

414
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,751
Keeping me guessing.

415
00:25:03,751 --> 00:25:06,300
Alright, you should get home.

416
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:10,809
Bye.

417
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,399
Bye.

418
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,918
Take the umbrella.

419
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:26,375
Thank you.

420
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,726
Bye.

421
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:46,751
What are you doing tomorrow?

422
00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:48,992
Going to work.

423
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:53,459
I'm so forgetful.

424
00:25:53,459 --> 00:25:55,626
I thought tomorrow was Saturday.

425
00:25:55,626 --> 00:25:57,250
It's cold outside.

426
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,259
Get inside.

427
00:26:10,584 --> 00:26:14,700
Do you want to watch movie with me tomorrow night?

428
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:20,259
Okay, see you after work.

429
00:26:21,225 --> 00:26:22,626
See you.

430
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,317
Bye.

431
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:40,475
<i>ZX, do you see that?</i>

432
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,334
<i>Our love is just like the snow on the floor.</i>

433
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:48,292
<i>It melts into water and freezes into ice.</i>

434
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:51,125
<i>We will be together forever.</i>

435
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,684
President Kang, the orders from the international convention.

436
00:27:08,684 --> 00:27:09,934
Thanks, just leave it there.

437
00:27:09,934 --> 00:27:11,250
There are a total of 127 orders.

438
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,834
Z&X is getting very popular.

439
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:16,851
It's a victory for us this time.

440
00:27:16,851 --> 00:27:18,375
But we must still work harder

441
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:20,459
to not let these 127 orders down.

442
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:21,709
Don't worry.

443
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:23,099
I already found a manufacturer.

444
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,600
I prepared the deposit too.

445
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,542
Good.

446
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:26,751
By the way, Zhuo Yue,

447
00:27:26,751 --> 00:27:30,392
what's your opinion on Yue-Sai's latest skin care products?

448
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:33,851
I feel that they're obviously targeting us.

449
00:27:33,851 --> 00:27:37,559
Their original customer base are the nobles and the rich,

450
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:42,099
while our targeted customer base for this product are young girls under 25 years old.

451
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:46,100
Then they immediately changed courses and released their snow ear moisturizing series.

452
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,959
Isn't it obvious they want to take away our customers?

453
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,183
You're right.

454
00:27:50,183 --> 00:27:52,417
Although we got so many orders,

455
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,250
we can't let our guard down.

456
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,792
We have a firm foothold in the fragrance market,

457
00:27:57,792 --> 00:28:00,626
but we're still new to skin care products.

458
00:28:00,626 --> 00:28:02,018
It's not easy.

459
00:28:02,018 --> 00:28:05,300
Don't overthink it. Let's take it one step at a time.

460
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,959
You're still the same.

461
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:13,142
By the way, you have mail.

462
00:28:13,142 --> 00:28:15,292
I'll get going if there's nothing else.

463
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:18,083
Okay, go spend time with your girlfriend.

464
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:22,018
Try to turn your girlfriend into your wife by the end of the year.

465
00:28:22,018 --> 00:28:23,792
It's not an easy task.

466
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:27,542
Women are all so materialistic nowadays.

467
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:30,142
They want a house, an SUV, a diamond ring.

468
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,167
I don't have money for her.

469
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,584
Zhuo Yue, thank you for the past two years.

470
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:37,667
Don't get me wrong.

471
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:39,600
I'm not complaining.

472
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,000
But Z&X is still in its starting stages,

473
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,517
and it's necessary for us to be dedicating more time.

474
00:28:43,517 --> 00:28:46,100
But I believe in you.

475
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,684
Thank you.

476
00:28:48,684 --> 00:28:51,099
After we fulfill these 127 orders,

477
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:53,309
I will increase your salaries.

478
00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:55,442
Then you can marry your girlfriend.

479
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,083
I don't know if that's happening.

480
00:28:59,434 --> 00:29:05,226
Do you think all the kind pretty girls only exist in fairy tales?

481
00:29:06,626 --> 00:29:08,267
I don't think so.

482
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:10,609
Is something going on?

483
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:11,999
No.

484
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:12,851
You'd better get going.

485
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,517
You'll get punished if you're late.

486
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:16,467
She wouldn't dare.

487
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,542
Hello?

488
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:22,918
Xiao Mei.

489
00:29:22,918 --> 00:29:24,709
I'm walking to the garage.

490
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:26,851
Of course I miss you.

491
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:29,959
Yes, I miss you every day.

492
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:32,067
It's true.

493
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,850
<i>[Invitation]</i>

494
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:59,334
Chairman.

495
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:01,225
Did you give Sihan his invitation?

496
00:31:01,225 --> 00:31:02,334
Yes.

497
00:31:02,334 --> 00:31:04,942
But he still hasn't arrived.

498
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:08,083
Alright, I got it.

499
00:31:10,584 --> 00:31:12,342
This way, please.

500
00:31:31,834 --> 00:31:33,990
Chairman is here.

501
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,234
Start the music.

502
00:31:35,234 --> 00:31:36,876
Chairman is here.

503
00:31:36,918 --> 00:31:37,918
Chairman.

504
00:31:37,918 --> 00:31:40,726
The star is here.

505
00:31:40,726 --> 00:31:43,142
Congratulations, Chairman.

506
00:31:43,142 --> 00:31:47,340
Happy birthday.

507
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,750
Thank you.

508
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,980
Everyone.

509
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:56,470
Cheers.

510
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,709
Let's have fun tonight.

511
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:04,375
Okay.

512
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:06,734
Let's go there.

513
00:32:09,626 --> 00:32:10,959
You look really pretty today.

514
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:13,083
I'll go greet them.

515
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:15,010
Zhentian.

516
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:20,876
Yin Zheng put a lot of effort into your birthday party tonight.

517
00:32:20,876 --> 00:32:22,999
Yes, he did.

518
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:26,350
He also did a good job with our winter auction.

519
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:30,999
I think he improved a lot this year.

520
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:35,225
It's all thanks to you for teaching him your ways.

521
00:32:35,225 --> 00:32:38,918
I always tell him that he wouldn't be the man he is today without you.

522
00:32:38,918 --> 00:32:40,392
I tell him to thank you.

523
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,584
Not at all.

524
00:32:42,584 --> 00:32:44,999
I watched him grow up.

525
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:49,834
Although he is quite stubborn,

526
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,918
he is quite the genius in management.

527
00:32:52,918 --> 00:33:00,142
The company needs a talented person like him as the successor.

528
00:33:00,142 --> 00:33:01,250
Mr. Wang.

529
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,225
You keep talking to the chairman.

530
00:33:04,225 --> 00:33:06,042
You should give the chairman a chance to talk to other people too.

531
00:33:06,042 --> 00:33:07,892
Look at that.

532
00:33:07,892 --> 00:33:10,350
He's so petty.

533
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,059
I've only just started speaking to the chairman.

534
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:15,350
And you're saying I've been hogging him?

535
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:18,142
You two have been arguing all your life.

536
00:33:18,142 --> 00:33:20,059
Today is my birthday,

537
00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:21,976
yet you're still arguing.

538
00:33:21,976 --> 00:33:24,100
I don't know what to do with you.

539
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,375
Zhentian, I'll just say this.

540
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:28,350
After turning 60,

541
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,392
you should enjoy the rest of your life.

542
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:35,209
I think you should consider your next successor.

543
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:37,059
You're right.

544
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:38,517
Even though I don't think I'm old,

545
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:43,284
I can't keep my position forever.

546
00:33:43,284 --> 00:33:46,459
I should pass this position onto a young man.

547
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:47,876
Yes.

548
00:33:47,876 --> 00:33:51,642
Sihan studied abroad for 20 years.

549
00:33:51,642 --> 00:33:53,350
Now that he's back,

550
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,918
why let him start a new business?

551
00:33:55,918 --> 00:33:56,934
As the saying goes,

552
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,726
don't let one's own fertile water flow into others' field.

553
00:33:59,726 --> 00:34:04,417
Why don't you let him join the company?

554
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,667
Moreover, he is your son.

555
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:09,225
You're too old-fashioned.

556
00:34:09,225 --> 00:34:10,334
What's up?

557
00:34:10,334 --> 00:34:12,100
Times are different now.

558
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,167
It's not about blood.

559
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:16,600
Nowdays,

560
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,459
as long as one is talented,

561
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:22,000
he can be the successor of the group.

562
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,309
Yes, whether it's his knowledge or his character,

563
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:27,542
Sihan is better than Yin Zheng.

564
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:31,776
Moreover, he is your own son.

565
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:35,559
Yin Zheng isn't the same as before.

566
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:38,667
You never focus on him.

567
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:40,792
Do you even know how capable he is?

568
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:45,083
Sure, Yin Zheng isn't his biological son.

569
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,600
But see what he put together today?

570
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,892
He organized a birthday party for Zhentian today.

571
00:34:48,892 --> 00:34:51,392
It means he's filial to him.

572
00:34:51,392 --> 00:34:54,059
Sure, Kang Sihan is his biological son.

573
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:58,534
But where is he now?

574
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:01,559
Did you even think about it?

575
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:04,375
Yin Zheng organized this birthday party.

576
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:06,292
Did he even inform Sihan?

577
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:07,642
Shouldn't he be here regardless?

578
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:09,492
Do you think he doesn't know his dad's birthday?

579
00:35:09,492 --> 00:35:11,100
Alright, enough.

580
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,100
Don't argue.

581
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,709
I know what you both mean.

582
00:35:16,267 --> 00:35:18,042
I'll go over there to greet some more guests.

583
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:19,417
Okay.

584
00:35:41,834 --> 00:35:43,225
Zheng'er.

585
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:46,159
Second Uncle.

586
00:35:47,918 --> 00:35:49,667
I have someone to introduce to you.

587
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:53,434
This is the company's new model, Lan Lan.

588
00:35:53,434 --> 00:35:55,034
He is my uncle.

589
00:35:56,475 --> 00:35:58,350
Hi, Mr. Yin.

590
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:02,209
Lan Lan is a nice name.

591
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:04,851
Is it your stage name?

592
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:07,650
No, it's my real name.

593
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:11,626
Uncle, you just got off the plane, right?

594
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:14,059
Yes, I came as soon as I got off.

595
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:16,475
My luggage is still in the hall.

596
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:19,542
I'll have some people send the luggage to the hotel.

597
00:36:19,542 --> 00:36:20,626
Okay.

598
00:36:20,626 --> 00:36:23,270
Lan Lan, will you stay here with them?

599
00:36:31,834 --> 00:36:33,934
Miss Lan Lan.

600
00:36:33,934 --> 00:36:37,083
Please come to the balcony with me.

601
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,559
Han Qing.

602
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:51,092
I'm sure you have a lot to say to Miss Lan, right?

603
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:57,918
You gave yourself such a nice name.

604
00:36:57,918 --> 00:36:59,792
I just know your name is Ma Wa.

605
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:02,492
How do you know my nephew?

606
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:06,700
Honestly,

607
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,434
if I knew he was your nephew,

608
00:37:10,434 --> 00:37:12,209
I wouldn't be interested in him.

609
00:37:12,209 --> 00:37:15,292
You're afraid of anyone who is related to me?

610
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:16,726
Yes.

611
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:18,751
You are poison.

612
00:37:18,751 --> 00:37:21,709
If I'm poison, then you're a noxious insect.

613
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:27,183
You like to bite on the skin

614
00:37:27,183 --> 00:37:29,600
and latch on tightly.

615
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,099
Tell me.

616
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:33,918
Why are you with Yin Zheng?

617
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,200
What are you trying to do?

618
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,834
Nothing.

619
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,175
I just think he's handsome and rich.

620
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,550
Don't panic.

621
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,250
I don't want to be Mrs. Yin.

622
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,183
I'm not panicking.

623
00:37:50,183 --> 00:37:55,709
I just didn't expect Han Qing to be stupid enough to fall in love with you.

624
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:59,109
He even betrayed me and let you go.

625
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:01,542
But as you can see, we're meant to be.

626
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:05,667
We meet again, in a foreign country this time.

627
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:08,099
Han Qing.

628
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,634
Now you know what kind of woman she is.

629
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:14,267
She likes high status

630
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:16,392
and likes to move up.

631
00:38:16,392 --> 00:38:17,726
She likes jewelry, branded bags,

632
00:38:17,726 --> 00:38:19,642
and rich men.

633
00:38:19,642 --> 00:38:22,125
She's a woman with many desires.

634
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:24,392
A prostitute.

635
00:38:24,392 --> 00:38:27,642
Suddenly she changed everything about herself

636
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:30,626
and is here with my nephew.

637
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:40,334
Miss Lan? A model?

638
00:38:40,334 --> 00:38:43,067
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

639
00:38:44,918 --> 00:38:46,992
Wait.

640
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:50,492
I'm still not done.

641
00:38:52,392 --> 00:38:54,792
Your hands are still beautiful.

642
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:56,934
They look even more beautiful

643
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,167
with this bracelet on.

644
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:00,859
Enough.

645
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:03,751
What do you want?

646
00:39:03,751 --> 00:39:06,225
You should ask Han Qing.

647
00:39:06,225 --> 00:39:10,309
He loved you so much.

648
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:12,900
He was even willing to sacrifice his life for you.

649
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,859
But he doesn't hate me, he hates you.

650
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:19,442
Because I let him know what kind of woman you are.

651
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,712
Let me go.

652
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:26,129
I'm going back inside.

653
00:39:26,129 --> 00:39:29,003
Do you think you can go back in there?

654
00:39:29,003 --> 00:39:31,019
You're Ma Wa.

655
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:34,595
You'll never fit into this extravagant world.

656
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,395
Why won't you let me free?

657
00:39:39,395 --> 00:39:41,996
Because you belong to me.

658
00:39:41,996 --> 00:39:43,812
I picked you up from off the streets.

659
00:39:43,812 --> 00:39:45,038
Without me,

660
00:39:45,038 --> 00:39:48,687
you would be dead by now. Did you forget?

661
00:39:51,145 --> 00:39:52,771
What do I have to do to be free?

662
00:39:52,771 --> 00:39:54,712
Be free?

663
00:39:54,712 --> 00:39:56,395
It's simple if you want to be Miss Lan.

664
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:59,137
Just do something for me.

665
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,820
Put this photo

666
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,796
into the present Yin Zheng is giving to his dad.

667
00:40:12,062 --> 00:40:13,187
Then?

668
00:40:13,187 --> 00:40:15,029
Nothing.

669
00:40:15,604 --> 00:40:17,370
That's it?

670
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,329
Yes.

671
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:27,237
Then you can go back and enjoy your life.

672
00:41:10,145 --> 00:41:11,154
Hello.

673
00:41:11,154 --> 00:41:13,770
Can you give me Director Yin's present?

674
00:41:16,479 --> 00:41:17,520
Here you go.

675
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,012
Thank you.

676
00:41:23,896 --> 00:41:25,279
Second Uncle.

677
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:27,512
Let's go greet my old man.

678
00:41:27,512 --> 00:41:28,720
This way.

679
00:41:31,229 --> 00:41:32,787
Chairman.

680
00:41:32,787 --> 00:41:35,062
- Chairman, my uncle is here.
- Brother.

681
00:41:35,062 --> 00:41:38,062
Sorry for being late.

682
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:39,938
Please forgive me.

683
00:41:39,938 --> 00:41:43,838
You didn't have to come.

684
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:45,646
Today is your big day.

685
00:41:45,646 --> 00:41:50,019
I would do anything to be here.

686
00:41:50,019 --> 00:41:51,979
If I'm not mistaken,

687
00:41:51,979 --> 00:41:57,019
this is the Yin Chenggui who ran off with the money, right?

688
00:41:57,019 --> 00:41:58,479
Uncle Liu, what are you talking about?

689
00:41:58,479 --> 00:42:00,470
Don't get so agitated.

690
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:03,379
Director Liu is right.

691
00:42:03,379 --> 00:42:05,203
I was young at the time,

692
00:42:05,203 --> 00:42:06,896
and I made a mistake.

693
00:42:06,896 --> 00:42:10,119
I'm grateful that Brother was willing to forgive me.

694
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:15,187
Take this as a lesson for the future.

695
00:42:15,187 --> 00:42:19,454
I know my place.

696
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:22,203
It's all in the past.

697
00:42:22,203 --> 00:42:23,495
We don't need to keep bringing it up.

698
00:42:23,495 --> 00:42:24,520
Yes.

699
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,245
Today is your big day.

700
00:42:26,245 --> 00:42:29,604
Let's forget about the shameful things of the past.

701
00:42:29,604 --> 00:42:31,938
Brother, where is my sister-in-law?

702
00:42:31,938 --> 00:42:33,587
- I should-
- Excuse me.

703
00:42:33,587 --> 00:42:35,312
- Madam.
- Mom.

704
00:42:35,312 --> 00:42:37,262
Mom, my uncle is here.

705
00:42:38,879 --> 00:42:41,820
Long time no see, Sister-in-law.

706
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,737
<i>Give me it.</i>

707
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,871
Chenggui.

708
00:42:50,938 --> 00:42:52,812
What are you doing here?

709
00:42:52,812 --> 00:42:56,879
I'm here to celebrate Brother's birthday.

710
00:42:56,879 --> 00:42:58,779
Thank you.

711
00:43:00,354 --> 00:43:03,671
Zhentian, your friends over there want to talk to you.

712
00:43:03,671 --> 00:43:05,695
I'll head over there then.

713
00:43:13,354 --> 00:43:15,079
Second Uncle, let me get you some wine.

714
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:16,429
Okay.

715
00:43:22,979 --> 00:43:24,729
Why did you invite him?

716
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:26,812
I think Yin Zheng invited him.

717
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,520
This kid...

718
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,003
It's okay.

719
00:43:30,003 --> 00:43:32,495
Chenggui is his uncle.

720
00:43:32,495 --> 00:43:34,854
He's family after all.

721
00:43:34,854 --> 00:43:38,287
You're always so considerate of others.

722
00:43:38,287 --> 00:43:41,045
Isn't it good to not take things too hard?

723
00:43:41,646 --> 00:43:43,229
Where is Siyu?

724
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:45,045
He went to Bashang Grasslands with his friends.

725
00:43:45,045 --> 00:43:46,687
He won't be back until the day after tomorrow.

726
00:43:46,687 --> 00:43:49,604
Look at him.

727
00:43:49,604 --> 00:43:52,896
He's not even here for his dad's sixtieth birthday.

728
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,938
It's alright. Didn't you just say so yourself?

729
00:43:55,938 --> 00:43:57,587
Don't take things too hard.

730
00:43:57,587 --> 00:43:59,912
A grown boy can't be kept at home.

731
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,270
Do you want to eat cake?

732
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,162
Okay.
