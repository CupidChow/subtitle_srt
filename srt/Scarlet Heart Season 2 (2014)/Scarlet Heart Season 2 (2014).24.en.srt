<i>Xiaoxiao, I'm leaving.</i>

<i>You're busy with work so I won't disturb you.</i>

5
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:04,079
<i>I just have a few luggages so no need to see me off.</i>

6
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,787
<i>Don't worry.</i>

7
00:02:05,787 --> 00:02:07,429
<i>Take good care of yourself.</i>

8
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:10,119
<i>Don't let me worry.</i>

00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,787
<i>Also, I think Siyu is great.</i>

10
00:02:13,787 --> 00:02:15,896
<i>He's bright, optimistic, and friendly.</i>

11
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:19,929
<i>Make sure to get along if you've decided on him.</i>

12
00:02:19,929 --> 00:02:22,896
<i>Remember to tell me when he becomes your boyfriend.</i>

13
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:27,729
<i>Daughter, if you have any worries,</i>

14
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:29,604
<i>I'm willing to be your trash bin.</i>

15
00:02:29,604 --> 00:02:32,062
<i>Just throw all your worries at me.</i>

16
00:02:32,062 --> 00:02:36,395
<i>But remember, happiness is most important.</i>

17
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:40,287
<i>If anything or anyone makes you unhappy,</i>

18
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:43,095
<i>just forget about it.</i>

19
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:51,729
Dad.

20
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:53,203
Xiaoxiao.

21
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:54,812
You don't need to send me off.

22
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:57,003
The train has left.

23
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,729
Make sure to eat all the dishes on the table.

24
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:03,462
Don't waste it.

25
00:03:04,637 --> 00:03:07,604
Call me as soon as you get home.

26
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,503
Okay, bye.

27
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,919
Bye.

28
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,237
Xiaoxiao.

29
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,962
How is your dad?

30
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,912
He's recovered.

31
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:49,437
Thanks for your concern.

32
00:03:50,704 --> 00:03:52,638
I want to talk to you.

33
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,379
You made the right choice.

34
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:02,787
Congratulations.

35
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:09,254
I'm moving house.

00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:12,754
Where is your new house?

37
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,103
Xinyi chose it.

38
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:20,938
Once everything is furnished,

39
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:22,937
I'll go to your housewarming.

40
00:04:27,746 --> 00:04:29,270
Xiaoxiao.

41
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:33,287
Sorry.

00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:35,690
Director Kang.

43
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,620
I'm fine.

44
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:45,546
Goodbye.

45
00:04:49,746 --> 00:04:51,295
Goodbye.

I'm here to see if my therapy suggestion works.

59
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:05,129
Wait.

60
00:06:06,303 --> 00:06:08,787
Don't show your worries on your face.

61
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:10,712
Everyone will know.

62
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:13,254
Supervisor Yin.

63
00:06:13,254 --> 00:06:16,087
If there's nothing else, I'm getting back to work.

64
00:06:16,846 --> 00:06:19,762
Don't call me Supervisor Yin if no one's around.

65
00:06:19,762 --> 00:06:21,919
Call me Yin Zheng.

66
00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:27,395
And let me know if I can help with anything.

67
00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:32,137
Your therapy suggestion really works.

68
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,287
I feel a lot better.

69
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:37,003
That's good.

70
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:40,370
But don't tell too many people about this.

71
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,179
It won't work if too many people come up.

72
00:06:57,495 --> 00:06:58,562
Zheng'er.

73
00:06:58,562 --> 00:06:59,996
Second Uncle.

74
00:06:59,996 --> 00:07:02,220
What are you doing?

75
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,103
Nothing much. Go ahead.

76
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:07,812
It's nothing. I just wanted to ask.

77
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:09,896
Did you resume your post?

78
00:07:11,303 --> 00:07:12,938
Of course not.

79
00:07:12,938 --> 00:07:15,512
Zheng'er, I heard that Kang Sihan

80
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:19,887
is marrying Yin Feng Group's Miss Meng.

81
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:20,662
Yes.

82
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:22,354
Don't take this lightly.

83
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:23,938
If they get married,

84
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:25,562
you're going to have more trouble.

85
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:28,771
Do you want to be the Logistics Department Supervisor forever?

86
00:07:28,771 --> 00:07:30,287
The old man isn't that bad.

87
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:33,045
He's not that bad, but his son is.

88
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,896
<i>Zheng'er, listen to me.</i>

89
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:40,003
<i>You have to resume your post before they get married.</i>

90
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:44,495
<i>Or you'll become the laughingstock.</i>

91
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:11,687
I really want to thank you.

92
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:13,495
You have no relationship with her.

93
00:08:13,495 --> 00:08:15,119
Thank you for giving her money every month.

94
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,345
Her life is a lot better.

95
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:19,119
It's nothing.

96
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,454
See what else she needs.

97
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:21,829
I'll have someone send it over.

98
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:25,287
It's okay. It's so much work for you to send things up here.

99
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:26,538
It's okay.

100
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:29,270
It's a chance for me to come here to relax.

101
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,504
Miss Zhang, you're here too.

102
00:08:31,504 --> 00:08:33,812
It's difficult to walk up here alone.

103
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:35,954
I can go get you if you let me know.

104
00:08:35,954 --> 00:08:37,187
It's okay.

105
00:08:37,187 --> 00:08:40,370
I don't come often.

106
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,504
These are for Grandma.

107
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:44,220
You two are good people.

108
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,103
I thank you on her behalf.

109
00:08:46,103 --> 00:08:47,662
I would like to see her.

110
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:49,279
Sure.

111
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,537
Grandma.

112
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:54,938
They're here to see you.

113
00:08:54,938 --> 00:08:58,120
Grandma, they're here to see you again.

114
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:02,412
Emperor Yongzheng.

115
00:09:03,554 --> 00:09:05,337
Empress Ruoxi.

116
00:09:06,771 --> 00:09:09,062
- Whenever she sees a man and woman together,
- Bless us.

117
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:11,829
- she says these strange things.
- Emperor Yongzheng, Empress Ruoxi.

118
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:13,245
No.

119
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:16,312
Look, Emperor Yongzheng.

120
00:09:16,312 --> 00:09:18,979
Empress Ruoxi. Look.

121
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:21,854
Emperor Yongzheng, Empress Ruoxi.

122
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:25,020
Are you okay?

123
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:28,854
I'm fine.

124
00:09:28,854 --> 00:09:31,703
My brain is just acting up again.

125
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:35,879
I'm seeing things I can't recall.

126
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:39,662
Village Chief, we'll get going then.

127
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,979
Let Grandma have a good rest.

128
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:43,454
Okay.

129
00:09:43,454 --> 00:09:45,003
Let's go down.

130
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,979
What a coincidence.

131
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:51,379
Yes.

132
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:55,879
How did you get here?

133
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,403
I took a cab.

134
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:01,079
I'll take you home then.

135
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:02,771
It's hard to get a cab here.

136
00:10:03,887 --> 00:10:05,254
Thank you.

137
00:10:11,646 --> 00:10:13,079
What's wrong?

138
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:16,454
I seem to have lost my car keys.

139
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:19,119
Did you drop them up on the mountain?

140
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,979
Do we want to go look for them?

141
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:27,896
Miss, my car broke.

142
00:10:27,896 --> 00:10:30,019
Can you sell your bike to me?

143
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:31,812
This...

144
00:10:31,812 --> 00:10:32,996
Do you think this is enough?

145
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:34,412
It's enough.

146
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:36,038
Thank you.

147
00:10:36,038 --> 00:10:37,712
You're welcome.

148
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:42,320
Dare to get on?

149
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:51,162
I haven't ridden a bike in a while.

150
00:10:51,162 --> 00:10:53,370
I almost forgot how it feels.

151
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,662
This is happiness for us normal people.

152
00:10:55,662 --> 00:10:57,754
You don't usually get to experience this.

153
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:02,412
Yes, I was feeling pretty happy.

154
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,354
But carrying such a heavy you,

155
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:06,379
I'm not as happy.

156
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,287
Alright.

157
00:11:09,287 --> 00:11:11,662
For you to experience happiness to the max,

158
00:11:11,662 --> 00:11:13,479
I'll get off.

159
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:16,303
I'm just kidding.

160
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:23,146
I would like to ask you something.

161
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:26,919
You can't lie to me.

162
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:30,287
Say it.

163
00:11:31,162 --> 00:11:33,771
That day at the fountain,

164
00:11:33,771 --> 00:11:36,379
did you fall on purpose?

165
00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:41,820
What do you think?

166
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,871
I know.

167
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:50,096
You know?

168
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:53,346
I just know.

169
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:00,219
I know too.

170
00:12:01,646 --> 00:12:04,096
Slow down.

171
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:05,704
No.

172
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,437
I have to ride faster.

173
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,996
I have to get to the car.

174
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:11,938
Otherwise I'll lose momentum.

175
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:13,429
Really?

176
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,019
Do you want to try?

177
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:18,337
Fine.

178
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:23,720
Now I'm really feeling the happiness.

179
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:32,820
Go check out what the situation is.

180
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:37,370
Supervisor Yin.

181
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,354
What's wrong?

182
00:12:38,354 --> 00:12:39,729
The office materials were returned.

183
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:40,954
Director Li isn't satisfied.

184
00:12:40,954 --> 00:12:43,954
He wants their original imported stationery.

185
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:45,395
He didn't want to hear me explain.

186
00:12:45,395 --> 00:12:46,429
You see...

187
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:48,912
The imported stationery is way over budget.

188
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:50,687
I'll talk to him myself.

189
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,996
Supervisor, I have a client waiting for me in my office.

190
00:12:52,996 --> 00:12:54,079
Can you...

191
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:54,871
I'll do it.

192
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:56,620
Thank you.

193
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,003
Take it easy.

194
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,495
Can you watch where you're going?

195
00:13:03,495 --> 00:13:04,138
Right.

196
00:13:04,138 --> 00:13:05,579
How could you bump into us?

197
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,104
- Sorry.
- Right.

198
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:10,370
Are you okay?

199
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,687
How would I know if I'm okay?

200
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:14,787
- Ask your manager to come.
- Yes.

201
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:15,896
I'm so sorry.

202
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:17,045
I'm the manager.

203
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:21,395
You? Managers don't move things on their own.

204
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:22,912
Don't lie to us.

205
00:13:22,912 --> 00:13:25,019
You don't want to ask your manager to come?

206
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:28,120
My son's a journalist.

207
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,329
No, Auntie.

208
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:30,203
How about this?

209
00:13:30,203 --> 00:13:32,229
I'll take you to the hospital for a check up.

210
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,412
We'll get an exam.

211
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,787
No, give me money.

212
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:35,870
You bumped into me.

213
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,579
- Right.
- Give me money.

214
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:39,395
You bumped into her.

215
00:13:39,395 --> 00:13:40,887
Give me money.

216
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:49,829
What are you doing here?

217
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:52,871
I brought you your medicine.

218
00:13:54,103 --> 00:13:55,829
Look at my bad memory.

219
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:58,229
I knew I forgot something.

220
00:13:58,229 --> 00:14:00,671
But I couldn't remember what.

221
00:14:06,854 --> 00:14:08,170
Here.

222
00:14:15,537 --> 00:14:19,646
Zhentian, I went to the mall yesterday.

223
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:21,287
What's the matter?

224
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:23,620
I saw Zheng'er.

225
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,495
Why was he there?

226
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:28,295
He seemed to be delivering office supplies.

227
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:33,346
Good, he's doing things himself.

228
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:38,470
I think after transferring him to the logistics department,

229
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,646
he has become more hardworking.

230
00:14:41,646 --> 00:14:44,662
The food and sanitation of the entire building have improved.

231
00:14:44,662 --> 00:14:45,787
Zhentian.

232
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:48,996
Don't you think Zheng'er's punishment is too heavy?

233
00:14:48,996 --> 00:14:52,203
I know what I'm doing.

234
00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:54,554
Your relationship hasn't been good.

235
00:14:54,554 --> 00:14:56,537
I'm just worried that if this continues...

236
00:14:56,537 --> 00:14:59,954
Alright, I get what you want to say.

237
00:14:59,954 --> 00:15:03,079
But don't worry about Zheng'er.

238
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:06,287
We have to give all my employees the same treatment.

239
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:08,120
It's because Zheng'er is my son.

240
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,537
I can't give him a light sentence.

241
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:13,120
I never get involved with the company's affairs.

242
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,637
But I think you punished him enough already.

243
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:17,329
You should stop now.

244
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:20,854
Alright, stop.

245
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,712
We're done talking about this.

246
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:26,362
But it makes me uncomfortable.

247
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,770
Then go home and rest.

248
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:42,479
Where is Madam?

249
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:44,203
After she came back from the office,

250
00:15:44,203 --> 00:15:46,746
she stayed in the bedroom and didn't come out.

251
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,120
She didn't have lunch either.

252
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,454
She took her luggage in the afternoon and left.

253
00:15:51,454 --> 00:15:52,595
Give me a cup of tea.

254
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:53,904
Yes.

255
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,550
Hello?

256
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,704
Is this Siyu?

257
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:15,546
Dad, Mom is at my stud farm.

258
00:16:16,804 --> 00:16:18,019
She's with you?

259
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,038
Yes.

260
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:20,662
I'll take her home later.

261
00:16:20,662 --> 00:16:22,980
No.

262
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,312
I will go and pick her up.

263
00:16:24,312 --> 00:16:25,796
Okay.

264
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,579
Mom, go home.

265
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:41,145
Don't argue with him again for me.

266
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:43,520
He's still the chairman.

267
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,245
It's been such a long time.

268
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:49,454
He already gave you your punishment.

269
00:16:49,454 --> 00:16:51,487
How much longer does he want to punish you?

270
00:16:52,203 --> 00:16:54,437
I'm not blaming him for punishing you.

271
00:16:54,437 --> 00:16:56,362
I just think that the punishment is too heavy.

272
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:59,704
I think it's been long enough already.

273
00:16:59,704 --> 00:17:01,045
Right?

274
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,879
Do you think I'm crossing the line?

275
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,162
Chairman.

276
00:17:07,162 --> 00:17:10,203
Zhentian, why are you here?

277
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:13,779
Siyu called me to tell me where you were.

278
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,829
Mom just came out for some fresh air.

279
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,119
I was going to take her home.

280
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,303
But it seems she doesn't need me to anymore.

281
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:25,837
You two can talk. I'll go find Siyu.

282
00:17:29,512 --> 00:17:30,979
We're not kids anymore.

283
00:17:30,979 --> 00:17:33,829
You're still running away from home?

284
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:38,038
We've been married for over twenty years.

285
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:40,120
You've never done this before.

286
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,070
Promise to never do this again.

287
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,804
Okay.

288
00:17:46,554 --> 00:17:49,996
I shouldn't be doing this.

289
00:17:49,996 --> 00:17:52,504
But I just don't want Zheng'er to go through this.

290
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:56,629
Don't you think this is a kind of training for him?

291
00:17:57,329 --> 00:17:59,479
I know how he feels.

292
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,520
I also know his limits.

293
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,119
You need to trust me.

294
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,662
When it's the right time,

295
00:18:04,662 --> 00:18:06,629
I'll resume his post.

296
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:10,704
Alright.

297
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:14,095
Come home with me.

298
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,479
Come on.

299
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,120
Why aren't you with mom?

300
00:18:32,096 --> 00:18:33,771
The old man came to pick her up.

301
00:18:33,771 --> 00:18:35,604
Brother, can't you call him Dad?

302
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:36,854
We are family.

303
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:38,671
Why are you being such a stranger?

304
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,662
I'm not.

305
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,912
I still think of you as my brother.

306
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:47,662
Brother, honestly,

307
00:18:47,662 --> 00:18:49,871
I think Second Brother is nice.

308
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:52,279
Why can't you get along with him?

309
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,196
He may look gentle and cultivated,

310
00:18:58,196 --> 00:19:01,119
but he's not really like that.

311
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,162
I've worked for Zhen Tian Group for over a decade.

312
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:07,604
He got me sent to the logistics department as soon as he came back.

313
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:11,729
Brother, don't you think you're complicating things?

314
00:19:11,729 --> 00:19:14,345
I know you might not agree with me.

315
00:19:14,345 --> 00:19:15,579
But I think it's pretty simple.

316
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:19,096
We're all brothers.

317
00:19:19,096 --> 00:19:21,337
Why can't we just get along with each other?

318
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,954
The horses in your stud farm are doing great.

319
00:19:27,954 --> 00:19:29,579
Lend me one next time.

320
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:30,787
Why lend?

321
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:33,329
I'll give you a pair when you get married.

322
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:35,412
Don't worry about giving me a gift just yet.

323
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:37,220
Gift them to your Second Brother first.

324
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,079
What's wrong?

325
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:45,337
You're unhappy that Sihan is getting married?

326
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:54,303
It's not that. Second Brother...

327
00:19:54,303 --> 00:19:56,119
Second Brother is great.

328
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:58,179
But in this case,

329
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:00,579
whatever decision he makes,

330
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,454
he will hurt the other person.

331
00:20:07,454 --> 00:20:11,229
You're referring to Zhang Xiao?

332
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,329
It seems you really care about her.

333
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:16,854
No.

334
00:20:18,871 --> 00:20:21,829
You never wanted anything to do with the company.

335
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:26,179
But then you suddenly told me you wanted to be a cook at Zhen Tian Group.

336
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:30,346
I'm sure you've fallen in love with Zhang Xiao.

337
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:33,495
What is it?

338
00:20:33,495 --> 00:20:35,395
Did I figure you out?

339
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,512
Brother.

340
00:20:39,262 --> 00:20:41,546
I think you also like her.

341
00:20:43,912 --> 00:20:46,429
Did I also figure you out?

342
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:52,229
Brother, Zhang Xiao isn't Lan Lan's replacement.

343
00:20:53,762 --> 00:20:54,996
Lan Lan is Lan Lan.

344
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:57,337
Zhang Xiao is Zhang Xiao.

345
00:20:57,337 --> 00:20:59,538
They're completely different people.

346
00:21:00,412 --> 00:21:05,079
Brother, can't you keep your distance from her?

347
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:07,220
Can you do that?

348
00:21:08,637 --> 00:21:09,871
No.

349
00:21:12,303 --> 00:21:15,245
She's a good friend.

350
00:21:15,245 --> 00:21:17,262
I have no need to avoid her.

351
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:53,662
Second Uncle.

352
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:56,987
Zheng'er, I heard that Kang Sihan is now in charge

353
00:21:56,987 --> 00:21:59,929
of Yin Feng and Zhen Tian's partnership.

354
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:03,912
Meng Yinan doesn't trust me.

355
00:22:03,912 --> 00:22:06,370
But this was your project.

356
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,245
It's also a project you've been working on independently

357
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:11,746
all these years at Zhen Tian Group.

358
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:14,203
Now that the project is about to be a success,

359
00:22:14,203 --> 00:22:18,829
they can't just throw you away like garbage.

360
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:20,787
If you don't feel sad,

361
00:22:20,787 --> 00:22:23,387
I feel sad for you.

362
00:22:24,495 --> 00:22:27,495
I don't think it's because Meng Yinan doesn't trust you.

363
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:29,387
It's because someone put an obstacle in your way.

364
00:22:29,387 --> 00:22:31,019
Forget it, Second Uncle.

365
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:33,162
There's not just one Yin Feng.

366
00:22:33,162 --> 00:22:34,829
There will be plenty of other opportunities.

367
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:38,879
Listen to me, chances are like water in your hands.

368
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:41,312
You won't get more if it escapes.

369
00:22:41,312 --> 00:22:43,395
I'll give you an idea.

370
00:22:44,303 --> 00:22:47,220
I can help you stage a comeback.

371
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,454
It's okay, Second Uncle.

372
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:49,979
I can handle this on my own.

373
00:22:49,979 --> 00:22:52,520
You're still too young.

374
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,954
Just listen to me.

375
00:22:55,954 --> 00:22:59,038
Remember the present I got you for Christmas?

376
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:01,654
We can finally use it.

377
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:06,596
Give Kang Sihan some wedding candies.

378
00:23:24,554 --> 00:23:25,954
Director Kang.

379
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,245
I heard from Xinyi

380
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:38,862
that you're planning your wedding for Valentine's Day.

381
00:23:38,862 --> 00:23:40,162
Congratulations.

382
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:44,000
Thank you.

383
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,340
She told me she wants you to be her bridesmaid.

384
00:23:51,412 --> 00:23:53,812
If you're in an awkward position,

385
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:56,170
just find an excuse to reject her.

386
00:23:56,804 --> 00:23:58,679
If you can't do it,

387
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:01,079
I will handle it for you.

388
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:04,762
Director Kang, I can handle it myself.

389
00:24:05,762 --> 00:24:07,220
Goodbye.

390
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,103
Hello, Chairman.

391
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,554
Chairman.

392
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:19,954
Hello, Chairman.

393
00:24:37,412 --> 00:24:43,162
I know Sihan's decision is really upsetting for you.

394
00:24:43,162 --> 00:24:45,096
But I can tell you,

395
00:24:45,662 --> 00:24:47,370
I know him well.

396
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:52,412
It's definitely not because of her family background.

397
00:24:52,412 --> 00:24:53,960
I know.

398
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,262
Uncle Kang, please don't worry.

399
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,537
This is what I want to see.

400
00:24:59,537 --> 00:25:01,019
Why?

401
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:04,620
Because Xinyi is my best friend.

402
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:09,029
When Sihan and I started dating,

403
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:11,912
Xinyi came back from overseas.

404
00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:14,954
The timing was such a coincidence.

405
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,345
Even I feel like it's like a drama.

406
00:25:19,345 --> 00:25:21,370
But no matter what,

407
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,519
I don't want to hurt Xinyi.

408
00:25:24,662 --> 00:25:28,404
So Sihan's decision is the best choice.

409
00:25:29,954 --> 00:25:35,245
Xiaoxiao, if you have any difficulties in your work,

410
00:25:35,245 --> 00:25:36,929
come to me directly.

411
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:41,096
Uncle Kang, thanks for your concern.

412
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,603
I'm sorry for letting you worry about me.

413
00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:50,203
I just want to tell you.

414
00:25:50,203 --> 00:25:53,829
Regardless of whether or not you can be a part of our family,

415
00:25:53,829 --> 00:25:55,871
I will always think of you

416
00:25:55,871 --> 00:25:59,354
as family.

417
00:26:16,495 --> 00:26:18,387
I have to talk to you.

418
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:22,371
It's about the business trip on Valentine's Day.

419
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:25,312
I spoke to Jack.

420
00:26:25,312 --> 00:26:27,387
I have an important event that day.

421
00:26:29,512 --> 00:26:30,912
I know.

422
00:26:30,912 --> 00:26:32,938
For Kang Sihan's wedding.

423
00:26:33,804 --> 00:26:35,019
Yes.

424
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,829
I was thinking.

425
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:40,219
If you can go to Paris,

426
00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:42,646
you can bring me two original movie posters.

427
00:26:42,646 --> 00:26:45,454
You can also ask other colleagues to bring it back for you.

428
00:26:46,762 --> 00:26:50,503
These two movies were Lan Lan's favorites.

429
00:26:52,054 --> 00:26:54,079
I promised her.

430
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,912
If I were ever in Paris,

431
00:26:55,912 --> 00:26:58,854
I would get her the original posters for these movies.

432
00:26:58,854 --> 00:27:03,119
But, unfortunately, I can't carry out this promise.

433
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:05,871
I wanted to ask you to help me.

434
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:11,038
But I don't think you'd go.

435
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:12,554
I...

436
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,595
Can I go a day later?

437
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:19,171
I can't make that decision.

438
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:21,879
I'm no longer the vice president.

439
00:27:23,495 --> 00:27:26,620
I really want to do this for you.

440
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,287
But...

441
00:27:27,287 --> 00:27:28,454
Forget it.

442
00:27:28,454 --> 00:27:30,370
If you want to suffer,

443
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,487
then go to their wedding.

444
00:27:33,704 --> 00:27:37,329
I just thought this was a great excuse

445
00:27:37,329 --> 00:27:40,754
for you to avoid such an awkward situation.

446
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:44,029
But it seems I thought wrong.

447
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,870
If I were you, I would go to Paris.

448
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,038
Come, cheers.

449
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:05,579
The alcohol is coming.

450
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:07,020
This is really popular nowadays.

451
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,437
Drink as much as you want. It's on me.

452
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,454
I want all of you to crawl out of here today.

453
00:28:14,454 --> 00:28:16,412
Everyone can crawl out of here except you.

454
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:18,019
You have a wedding to attend tomorrow.

455
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:20,203
Yes, Sihan. Don't drink so much.

456
00:28:20,203 --> 00:28:21,746
You seem drunk already.

457
00:28:21,746 --> 00:28:23,829
It's his last bachelor party.

458
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:25,771
Are you still his friend if you don't let him drink?

459
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:28,895
Yeah, Zhuo Yue. You're so protective of your boss.

460
00:28:30,787 --> 00:28:32,829
Brother, you're here.

461
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:34,646
Come on, let's have a drink.

462
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,979
Come, cheers.

463
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:38,203
Let me introduce you.

464
00:28:38,203 --> 00:28:40,595
My eldest brother, Yin Zheng.

465
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:43,245
Supervisor Yin.

466
00:28:43,245 --> 00:28:45,262
Let me introduce you.

467
00:28:45,262 --> 00:28:47,038
This young talent

468
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,454
is Zhen Tian Group's logistics department's Supervisor Yin.

469
00:28:51,454 --> 00:28:53,340
- Say hi to Supervisor Yin.
- Hello, Supervisor Yin.

470
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,870
- Supervisor Yin.
- From the logistics department.

471
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:01,162
Go get our Director Kang a big fruit tray.

472
00:29:01,162 --> 00:29:03,103
Remember to bring the lychees.

473
00:29:03,103 --> 00:29:04,119
What are you talking about?

474
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,220
It's okay.

475
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,119
I think you're mistaken.

476
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:12,020
Normally these things are done by Director Kang's personal assistant.

477
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,120
Assistant Zhuo, why are you still sitting there?

478
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,412
Go get it.

479
00:29:18,704 --> 00:29:20,200
Yin Zheng.

480
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:26,454
I'm very happy today.

481
00:29:26,454 --> 00:29:30,120
If you're also happy, let's let go of the past and drink together.

482
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,537
If you are unhappy, just go.

483
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:35,162
That's enough, Brother.

484
00:29:35,162 --> 00:29:37,912
I just wanted to come drink alone.

485
00:29:37,912 --> 00:29:41,087
I have no interest in these kinds of gatherings anyways.

486
00:29:45,012 --> 00:29:47,203
Whether you believe it or not,

487
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:50,662
I just hope you can cherish everything you have now.

488
00:29:50,662 --> 00:29:54,520
You can't always get what you want so easily.

489
00:29:55,395 --> 00:29:57,019
Take care of your brother.

490
00:29:57,019 --> 00:29:58,220
Brother.

491
00:30:05,395 --> 00:30:07,412
What are you doing?

492
00:30:07,412 --> 00:30:08,929
Business trip.

493
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:10,403
Business trip?

494
00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:13,129
You're not going to the wedding tomorrow?

495
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:15,020
No.

496
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,096
Are you still in love with Sihan?

497
00:30:19,096 --> 00:30:20,329
Says who?

498
00:30:20,329 --> 00:30:22,303
Why aren't you going then?

499
00:30:22,303 --> 00:30:24,119
Why are you avoiding them?

500
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:26,138
What other reasons do you have

501
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:28,971
aside for not being able to face them?

502
00:30:28,971 --> 00:30:30,871
Didn't I tell you?

503
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,871
I'm going on a business trip to Paris.

504
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:35,996
After a whole day of meetings,

505
00:30:35,996 --> 00:30:38,203
I get two weeks to travel on company dollar.

506
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,746
If you were in my situation,

507
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:42,820
would you go to the wedding or travel?

508
00:30:43,704 --> 00:30:46,746
Zhang Xiao, I look down on you.

509
00:30:46,746 --> 00:30:48,871
Why are you so selfish?

510
00:30:48,871 --> 00:30:51,412
Xinyi's wedding is once in a lifetime.

511
00:30:51,412 --> 00:30:54,512
You have plenty of chances to travel.

512
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,871
Don't worry about me.

513
00:30:58,871 --> 00:31:00,638
Go back to your room.

514
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:06,020
I look down on you.

515
00:31:11,138 --> 00:31:14,471
Did you change your mind?

516
00:31:15,637 --> 00:31:17,179
Tomorrow,

517
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:19,129
help me tell Xinyi.

518
00:31:19,954 --> 00:31:21,746
Just tell her I had a last minute business trip.

519
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:25,596
It's an emergency and I can't go.

520
00:31:25,596 --> 00:31:27,796
You're so strange.

521
00:31:28,412 --> 00:31:30,079
You're not going to her wedding.

522
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:32,454
Tell her yourself.

523
00:31:32,454 --> 00:31:34,620
You keep saying you're best friends.

524
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,929
There's no way I'm telling her for you.

525
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,212
Cheers.

526
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:27,412
<i>I'll go to Paris tomorrow.</i>

527
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,903
<i>I'll do the favor you asked me.</i>

528
00:32:47,412 --> 00:32:48,746
- Hello.
- Hello.

529
00:32:48,746 --> 00:32:49,662
Are you Zhang Xiao?

530
00:32:49,662 --> 00:32:50,579
Yes.

531
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:52,579
Your express delivery.

532
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:53,879
Thank you.

533
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:18,537
<i>Piggy.</i>

534
00:33:18,537 --> 00:33:20,312
<i>Did you receive your bridesmaid dress?</i>

535
00:33:20,312 --> 00:33:23,620
<i>I carefully chose it from more than 200 dresses.</i>

536
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,954
<i>I put more thought into yours than my own wedding dress.</i>

537
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:28,203
<i>I want you to look amazing today.</i>

538
00:33:28,203 --> 00:33:30,079
<i>I want you to be as pretty as me.</i>

539
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:30,871
<i>Get changed.</i>

540
00:33:30,871 --> 00:33:32,987
<i>Don't be late today.</i>

541
00:33:40,662 --> 00:33:43,119
Brother, are you crazy?

542
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,954
Are you running away from the wedding?

543
00:33:44,954 --> 00:33:46,620
Sihan, stop messing around.

544
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,771
Come out.

545
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:49,520
Xinyi is already there.

546
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,620
They're all waiting for you.

547
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,537
Listen.

548
00:33:52,537 --> 00:33:54,271
I'll break this door if you don't come out.

549
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:57,629
Sihan, did you hear me?

550
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,119
Brother, get moving.

551
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:02,579
Be a man.

552
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:05,370
Don't trigger him. He can't be coerced by force.

553
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,604
Brother, I know you don't feel good.

554
00:34:07,604 --> 00:34:08,996
You're uncomfortable.

555
00:34:08,996 --> 00:34:11,762
But what can you do?

556
00:34:11,762 --> 00:34:13,620
You have to get through this one way or another.

557
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:17,062
You made this decision, so stop making it hard for yourself.

558
00:34:17,062 --> 00:34:19,329
Brother, I beg you.

559
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:20,579
Come out.

560
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:22,529
We're all waiting for you.

561
00:34:27,846 --> 00:34:28,595
What's going on?

562
00:34:28,595 --> 00:34:31,345
Why isn't he here yet?

563
00:34:31,345 --> 00:34:32,638
Don't worry.

564
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:36,470
Sihan has always been responsible.

565
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,495
There won't be any hiccups, so don't worry.

566
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:40,537
He isn't answering his phone.

567
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,595
I heard he got drunk yesterday.

568
00:34:42,595 --> 00:34:44,203
He's a man in his thirties.

569
00:34:44,203 --> 00:34:47,287
Did he forget about such a big event today?

570
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:48,645
Don't worry.

571
00:34:48,645 --> 00:34:50,829
I called my youngest son just now.

572
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:51,954
They're together.

573
00:34:51,954 --> 00:34:53,345
They're rushing over here.

574
00:34:53,345 --> 00:34:55,746
I think there's just some traffic on the way.

575
00:34:55,746 --> 00:34:58,070
Mom, don't worry.

576
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,329
I'm just worrying for you.

577
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:01,245
Seriously...

578
00:35:01,245 --> 00:35:03,212
Alright.

579
00:35:05,846 --> 00:35:07,038
They're here.

580
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,512
Sihan.

581
00:35:10,387 --> 00:35:11,120
Sihan.

582
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,162
Xinyi, sorry for being late.

583
00:35:13,162 --> 00:35:15,062
It's okay. Let's go.

584
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,429
Dad, Auntie Lan.

585
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:20,771
Mom.

586
00:35:20,771 --> 00:35:23,203
You made Xinyi wait.

587
00:35:23,203 --> 00:35:25,854
I thought you forgot about today's event.

588
00:35:25,854 --> 00:35:27,245
I'm sorry.

589
00:35:27,245 --> 00:35:28,871
I'm sorry for making you wait.

590
00:35:28,871 --> 00:35:30,912
Don't make any more mistakes.

591
00:35:30,912 --> 00:35:32,854
There won't be any more mistakes.

592
00:35:32,854 --> 00:35:34,662
Alright, Mom, let's go in.

593
00:35:34,662 --> 00:35:36,912
Chairman, Director Meng, let's go in.

594
00:35:36,912 --> 00:35:38,754
- Let's go in.
- Alright.

595
00:35:41,762 --> 00:35:45,012
Xinyi, where is the bridesmaid?

596
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:48,012
Black Cat Detective, where's the bridesmaid?

597
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,595
I don't know. I called her.

598
00:35:49,595 --> 00:35:51,012
She didn't pick up.

599
00:35:51,012 --> 00:35:53,779
But I'm sure she'll be here.

600
00:35:56,804 --> 00:35:59,254
How strange, it's already time.

601
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:01,203
She's here.

602
00:36:01,203 --> 00:36:02,787
Piggy.

603
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,704
Piggy, you're finally here.

604
00:36:06,704 --> 00:36:09,019
I'm sorry, there was traffic.

605
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:11,520
It's fine. As long as you're here.

606
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,029
I would hate you forever if you didn't come.

607
00:36:16,096 --> 00:36:17,379
Let's go.

608
00:36:34,138 --> 00:36:36,370
Sister Xinyi, is the ring ready?

609
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,038
It's in the room upstairs.

610
00:36:38,038 --> 00:36:39,203
I'll go get it for you.

611
00:36:39,203 --> 00:36:40,079
It's okay.

612
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,119
You don't know where it is.

613
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,495
I'll go.

614
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:45,329
Come on. Give me a second.

615
00:37:01,826 --> 00:37:05,134
I didn't expect you to actually come.

616
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:12,283
I told you.

617
00:37:12,951 --> 00:37:16,484
I'll be at Xinyi's wedding.

618
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:19,383
We made a promise.

619
00:37:21,076 --> 00:37:24,259
I hope you can be a dedicated husband.

620
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:27,117
Treat Xinyi well.

621
00:37:27,951 --> 00:37:32,034
Let her be the happiest princess in the world.

622
00:37:38,392 --> 00:37:40,018
Zhang Xiao.

623
00:37:51,242 --> 00:37:53,434
I'm sorry, Supervisor Yin.

624
00:37:53,434 --> 00:37:55,826
I came.

625
00:37:55,826 --> 00:37:57,718
I had to come.

626
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:01,118
I really don't understand.

627
00:38:01,118 --> 00:38:03,651
Why did you have to come here and suffer?

628
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:05,976
Yin Zheng.

629
00:38:05,976 --> 00:38:07,726
This is between me and Xiaoxiao.

630
00:38:07,726 --> 00:38:09,584
It's none of your business.

631
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:12,100
Enough.

632
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,392
Stop it.

633
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:15,784
There's no point.

634
00:38:15,784 --> 00:38:16,851
I'll take you over there.

635
00:38:16,851 --> 00:38:18,609
You still need to prepare.

636
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:37,750
Zheng'er.

637
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,642
Second Uncle.

638
00:38:39,642 --> 00:38:41,642
Are you at the venue?

639
00:38:42,409 --> 00:38:43,225
Yes.

640
00:38:43,225 --> 00:38:44,992
Great.

641
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,225
The show is about to start.

642
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:49,325
I think we should forget it, Second Uncle.

643
00:38:49,325 --> 00:38:51,142
There's too much at stake.

644
00:38:51,142 --> 00:38:53,099
We don't know what's going to happen.

645
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:54,976
Silly boy.

646
00:38:55,717 --> 00:38:58,434
What did I teach you?

647
00:38:58,434 --> 00:39:01,176
Ruthlessness is the mark of a truly great man.

648
00:39:01,176 --> 00:39:02,359
Alright.

649
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:06,700
Just sit back and watch.

650
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,076
Second Uncle.

651
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,892
Princess, is this your second wedding dress?

652
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:22,183
Yes.

653
00:39:29,018 --> 00:39:31,492
You need to help me drink today.

654
00:39:31,492 --> 00:39:33,151
Of course.

655
00:39:33,784 --> 00:39:36,684
Sihan originally wanted to do this in London.

656
00:39:36,684 --> 00:39:40,018
But we simplified everything since I'm pregnant.

657
00:39:40,018 --> 00:39:41,450
This is still simple?

658
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,159
It's so extravagant.

659
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,434
You don't look pregnant at all.

660
00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:48,409
You look just like a young girl.

661
00:39:48,409 --> 00:39:49,809
Stop making fun of me.

662
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:51,826
I'm serious.

663
00:39:51,826 --> 00:39:52,851
We have a deal.

664
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:54,600
You're my baby's godmother.

665
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,326
Of course.

666
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:06,767
Xinyi, are you ready?

667
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:08,309
Almost done.

668
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:10,459
You still have five minutes.

669
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,976
Get on with it with Black Cat Detective.

670
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:15,951
Gossip girl.

671
00:40:24,225 --> 00:40:25,300
Mom.

672
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,540
Come.

673
00:40:29,492 --> 00:40:31,334
We are really happy.

674
00:41:05,976 --> 00:41:08,992
Ladies and gentlemen.

675
00:41:08,992 --> 00:41:12,267
Welcome, and thank you for coming to support.

676
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:17,617
Let's witness their happiest and sweetest moment.

677
00:41:17,617 --> 00:41:21,334
Let's invite them to exchange their wedding rings.

678
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:54,934
Friends.

679
00:41:54,934 --> 00:41:57,534
Now shouldn't they...

680
00:41:57,534 --> 00:42:03,125
Kiss!

681
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:04,892
Alright!

682
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:18,018
Friends.

683
00:42:18,018 --> 00:42:19,934
Let's revisit the happy moments

684
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:23,600
from the moment this couple met

685
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,075
to the moments they fell in love.

686
00:42:29,118 --> 00:42:32,700
♫ <i>The world has turned to ashes</i> ♫

687
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,892
♫ <i>But love is still standing tall</i> ♫

688
00:42:35,892 --> 00:42:42,926
♫ <i>Are you real or just my imagination?</i> ♫

689
00:42:42,926 --> 00:42:46,309
♫ <i>Behind the times that we forgot</i> ♫

690
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:49,759
♫ <i>The dilapidated steps I sit on alone</i> ♫

691
00:42:49,759 --> 00:42:54,000
♫ <i>Which troubled times don't end in parting?</i> ♫

692
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:12,375
Why are there these photos?
