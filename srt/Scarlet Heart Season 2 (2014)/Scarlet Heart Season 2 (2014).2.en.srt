3
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:46,602
Ladies, it's time to gather.

4
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:49,209
Hurry.

5
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,613
Let's go.

6
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,905
Please have a seat here, Miss.

7
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,307
Here.

8
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,022
We'll go in first.

9
00:01:58,924 --> 00:02:00,312
Your head is bleeding.

10
00:02:00,312 --> 00:02:02,304
Do you want to bind up your wound?

11
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:06,621
No, thanks.

12
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:08,311
Alright, have a rest then.

13
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:10,314

Director Yin, this is the information on the survival show.

30
00:04:35,517 --> 00:04:38,103
She is Lan Lan, 25 years old.

31
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:41,103
She's a professional model who just returned from Australia,

32
00:04:41,103 --> 00:04:43,701
and has been a cover model

33
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,311
for Harper's Bazaar and Cosmo.

34
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:48,105

Director Yin, your meeting with Director He from Tianjin Fuli Center

40
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,208
will start in 15 minutes.

41
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,210
I've prepared the documents.

42
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,210
Do you want to take a look?

43
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:25,104
Okay.

44
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:37,622
Miss, are you here for the open audition?

45
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:39,821
Open audition?

46
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:41,518
No, I'm looking for someone.

47
00:05:41,518 --> 00:05:42,721
I'm sorry, please leave.

48
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:44,213
Thank you.

49
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:46,615
This way.

50
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,301
Come.

51
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:57,320
Please, Miss.

52
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,106
Who did you say you saw just now?

53
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:13,001
Ma'ertai Ruoxi.

54
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:16,002
Really?

55
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:18,515
She looks just like me.

56
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:20,612
Although I'm not 100% sure,

57
00:06:20,616 --> 00:06:23,319
I think it's her.

58
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:28,310
After I fell into my coma following the car accident,

59
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,900
I woke up in the Eighth Prince's mansion.

60
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,822
All the servants and ladies there at the time

61
00:06:32,822 --> 00:06:35,721
all said that I fell from the stairs.

62
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:38,000
And when I saw this girl today,

63
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,416
she also fell down the stairs.

64
00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:43,005
You mean...

65
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:45,723
The moment Ma'ertai Ruoxi fell from the stairs,

66
00:06:45,723 --> 00:06:47,311
you and her exchanged identities?

67
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:50,910
Not only her, but also Kangxi.

68
00:06:51,822 --> 00:06:55,003
I met with the Chairman Kang Zhentian of Zhen Tian Group today.

69
00:06:55,003 --> 00:06:59,206
He looks just like the Kangxi I remember.

70
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:02,924
That's right.

71
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:06,515
Have you heard of parallel universes?

72
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:10,210
It's been an issue I've been studying since you got into your accident.

73
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,518
What's that?

74
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:12,924
Your issue.

75
00:07:12,924 --> 00:07:14,820
My issue?

76
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,210
Have you heard of the grandmother paradox?

77
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,614
No.

78
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:23,208
The grandmother paradox

79
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,003
describes when we travel through time to go back into the past

80
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:28,004
to meet our grandmothers

81
00:07:28,004 --> 00:07:30,414
and then killing her.

82
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:33,721
Since our grandmother died when she was young,

83
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:36,901
the future us would never be born.

84
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:39,706
And if we were never born,

85
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:43,101
how did we go back to the past to kill our grandmother?

86
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:45,110
And so a paradox arises.

87
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,518
This paradox describes the concept of parallel universes,

88
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:50,905
which is also the parallel universe theory proposed by Hawking.

89
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,721
When a time traveler changes history

90
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:54,930
by traveling to the past,

91
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,100
the timeline gets split.

92
00:07:58,808 --> 00:08:01,210
Just like how you traveled through time to the Qing Dynasty,

93
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,002
becoming Ma'ertai Ruoxi and falling in love with the Fourth Prince.

94
00:08:04,002 --> 00:08:06,517
You two were deeply in love,

95
00:08:06,517 --> 00:08:09,208
but you've actually also changed the history.

96
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,618
Because the Fourth Prince would've never fallen in love

97
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:14,503
with a girl named Ma'ertai Ruoxi in real history.

98
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:18,822
So according to what you said,

99
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:21,203
the history since then

100
00:08:21,203 --> 00:08:23,009
has been split into two because of me?

101
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:26,414
I'm a part of one the histories

102
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:29,002
and left out of the other.

103
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:31,412
These two space-times are developing in parallel.

104
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:33,003
In the universe I was a part of,

105
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:35,021
Fourth Prince has come to look for me in present day.

106
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:37,104
And in the universe without me,

107
00:08:37,104 --> 00:08:41,820
Ma'ertai Ruoxi accidentally came here to present day.

108
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,007
In actuality, we don't know each other.

109
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:47,621
How complicated.

110
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:49,003
I don't understand it at all.

111
00:08:49,003 --> 00:08:50,721
Actually, it's not as complicated as you think.

112
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:53,310
We just need to investigate.

113
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,207
That's right, let's work together.

114
00:08:56,207 --> 00:08:58,900
You investigate Lan Lan while I investigate Yin Zheng.

115
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:01,312
It's not a difficult task,

116
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:04,209
but this is none of my business.

117
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,530
How are you going to reward me?

118
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:17,318
You're so amazing.

119
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:29,313
Xiao Zheng.

120
00:09:29,313 --> 00:09:31,615
Listen to my advice.

121
00:09:31,615 --> 00:09:34,211
Don't provoke your father anymore.

122
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:36,616
I don't think I did anything wrong.

123
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:40,003
It's his business for getting mad.

124
00:09:40,003 --> 00:09:42,311
What can you gain from this?

125
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:44,901
He is getting old.

126
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:48,415
Just be patient for just a bit longer and the company will soon be yours.

127
00:09:48,415 --> 00:09:52,414
You can do whatever you want when that time comes.

128
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:53,901
Uncle Wang.

129
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:57,517
Zhen Tian Group belongs to the Kang family, not the Yin family.

130
00:09:57,517 --> 00:10:00,515
He already has a successor in mind.

131
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:02,901
Don't say that.

132
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:04,822
You still have time.

133
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:07,311
You can't give up yet.

134
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:10,211
Kang Sihan has been overseas for twenty years.

135
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:12,619
Even though he's his biological son,

136
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:16,310
they have no connection due to the distance.

137
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,107
Even with your younger brother,

138
00:10:19,107 --> 00:10:21,518
he's not your competition.

139
00:10:21,518 --> 00:10:24,408
Besides, he won't compete with you anyways.

140
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:34,621
Now that Kang Sihan is back,

141
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:37,513
he's your biggest threat.

142
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:38,922
Xiao Zheng,

143
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:44,208
I really don't think you should challenge the chairman's patience for you anymore.

144
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,619
He actually treats you very well.

145
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:50,518
Take this open audition for example.

146
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:53,007
In the end he still agreed to it.

147
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:57,717
What should I do then?

148
00:10:57,717 --> 00:11:00,419
Thank him for taking good care of my mother over the years?

149
00:11:01,106 --> 00:11:04,411
Thank him for managing my father's assets in such a good manner?

150
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:05,514
As years passed,

151
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:09,104
my parents' property has turned into his property.

152
00:11:09,104 --> 00:11:11,619
And even I have become his son by law.

153
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:13,209
Everything is his now.

154
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:14,920
What gives him the right?

155
00:11:19,106 --> 00:11:20,107
Xiao Zheng.

156
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:22,620
I watched you grow up.

157
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,123
I really do think that you're talented.

158
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:27,800
Don't ever ruin yourself.

159
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,924
A few words of advice for you.

160
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:32,120
Never give up.

161
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,620
Understand?

162
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:43,205
Here's to you.

163
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:52,902
- Let's not drink anymore.
- It's fine.

164
00:11:52,902 --> 00:11:55,411
Fine, I'll drink one more with you.

165
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:00,721
Cheers.

166
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,513
A shot of tequila.

167
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:05,208
Enjoy, Miss.

168
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,721
Xiao Zheng, what's wrong?

169
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:16,824
Nothing.

170
00:13:16,824 --> 00:13:18,200
Come on. Let's keep drinking.

171
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,820
No, it's late.

172
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,100
I'll ask the driver to take you home.

173
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,860
Come on.

174
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,140
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

175
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,855
<i>You recognize me?</i>

176
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,125
<i>I really don't know you.</i>

177
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,490
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

178
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,752
<i>I thought...</i>

179
00:14:05,435 --> 00:14:08,133
<i>You were someone I knew.</i>

180
00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:12,841
♫ <i>The window that was ajar</i> ♫

181
00:14:12,841 --> 00:14:16,226
♫ <i>The dim glow of light</i> ♫

182
00:14:16,226 --> 00:14:20,520
♫ <i>They couldn't light up the darkness in your heart</i> ♫

Manager.

198
00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:47,325
No, no, no.

199
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:49,732
Please stop calling me manager.

200
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:52,020
Don't you think it's corny?

201
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,144
Please call me Jack.

202
00:15:55,144 --> 00:15:57,332
- Okay.
- Say it.

203
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,140
Jacker.

204
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,180
Not Jacker, it's Jack.

205
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:07,360
- Jack.
- Jack.

206
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,049
Jack.

207
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:13,560
Nice.

208
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,569
You have very good English pronunciation.

209
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,187
What are you looking at?

210
00:16:24,227 --> 00:16:26,044
Nothing.

211
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:28,229
- Manager.
- Jack.

212
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:30,229
Jack, pardon me.

213
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:31,633
Can I leave for a while?

214
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:35,334
Do you know the code of practice?

215
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:37,580
I'm sorry, I have a stomachache.

216
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,110
I'm so busy.

217
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,021
Follow me.

218
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:44,126
Come, follow me to the judges.

219
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:45,743
Okay.

220
00:16:47,743 --> 00:16:49,734
Good luck.

221
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,743

00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:34,540
It's really you.

227
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,741
I'm Xiao Anzi.

228
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:41,431
I'm sorry, you're mistaken.

229
00:17:44,124 --> 00:17:46,023
No way.

230
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,739
Stop kidding around.

231
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:50,429
I told you, you're mistaken.

232
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:55,123
Fine. If I'm mistaken,

233
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:58,642
then tell me who you are.

234
00:17:59,943 --> 00:18:03,650
Who are you? What do you want?

235
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:07,535
The panic in your eyes gave you away.

236
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:10,132
You're Ruoxi, just admit it.

237
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:13,431
Huang Di.

238
00:18:13,431 --> 00:18:15,330
Give it back.

239
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,636
Which department are you from?

240
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:19,040
I...

241
00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:21,534
It was just a misunderstanding.

242
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,123
I have a friend that looks just like you.

243
00:18:24,123 --> 00:18:27,125
I thought she was playing a joke on me and pretending not to know me.

244
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,228
Since I mistook you for someone else, please give it back to me.

245
00:18:30,228 --> 00:18:32,331
It was really a mistake.

246
00:18:32,331 --> 00:18:33,433
Lan Lan, it's your turn now.

247
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:35,532
Come with me to the judges.

248
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,638
This is your desk.

249
00:18:48,638 --> 00:18:52,124
Remember the company has rules

250
00:18:52,124 --> 00:18:56,232
During your probation period,

251
00:18:56,232 --> 00:18:59,840
you can't modify, move, or remove any properties of the company.

252
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,743
You also can't drive nails, paste stickers, draw,

253
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,531
demolish, or burn on this desk.

254
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:11,942
You must be punctual and you can't leave early.

255
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:15,224
You can have staff meals in the staff canteen on the tenth floor

256
00:19:15,224 --> 00:19:16,633
or you may choose to go out to eat.

257
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:19,022
But you are not allowed to eat inside the office.

258
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:22,539
If you're caught, you'll be fined 500 yuan. Understood?

259
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:23,939
Understood.

260
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,537
Manager, is there anything else?

261
00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:30,741
Jack.

262
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:33,022
You need to get used to calling me that.

263
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:35,228
Okay, Jack.

264
00:19:35,228 --> 00:19:36,131
Is there anything else?

265
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:38,433
Of course, a big problem.

266
00:19:38,433 --> 00:19:40,843
Go downstairs now and buy me breakfast.

267
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:43,740
I want a whole wheat croissant and an Americano.

268
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,743
You'll be in charge of my breakfast for the week.

269
00:19:46,743 --> 00:19:49,333
It's also my way of evaluating your work abilities.

270
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,432
Understand?

271
00:19:51,432 --> 00:19:52,433
Yes.

272
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:53,741
Good.

273
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:04,236
Hi.

274
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:07,435
Hi, my name is Zhang Xiao.

275
00:20:07,435 --> 00:20:09,022
It's my first day.

276
00:20:09,022 --> 00:20:10,842
I look forward to working with you.

277
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:13,331
My name is Mo Xiaohe.

278
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:14,843
I am a newcomer as well.

279
00:20:14,843 --> 00:20:16,535
You're still my senior.

280
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:18,429
We have such bad luck.

281
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:19,228
Why?

282
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:21,028
You can be more feminine.

283
00:20:21,028 --> 00:20:23,425
That's right.

284
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,125
I thought I would meet some cute guys here.

285
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,333
I didn't expect to work for him.

286
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,640
Look at him.

287
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,434
He's not manly at all.

288
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:38,227
Then look at Director Yin.

289
00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:39,742
He's handsome.

290
00:20:39,742 --> 00:20:42,635
He's elegant.

291
00:20:42,635 --> 00:20:45,125
He's so charming.

292
00:20:46,637 --> 00:20:49,639
Is Director Yin really that charming?

293
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:51,021
Of course.

294
00:20:51,021 --> 00:20:53,640
He's my dream man.

295
00:20:54,228 --> 00:20:56,842
I actually came to Zhen Tian

296
00:20:56,842 --> 00:20:58,940
for him.

297
00:21:01,021 --> 00:21:03,021
I'll go buy breakfast for Jack first.

298
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:04,543
We'll pick this up later.

299
00:21:07,538 --> 00:21:10,741
This way.

300
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,328
Please introduce yourself.

301
00:21:17,328 --> 00:21:18,921
Hello judges.

302
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:20,024
My name is Lan Lan.

303
00:21:20,024 --> 00:21:21,333
I am 25 years old,

304
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,536
and I just came back from Australia.

305
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:25,434
I have many hobbies.

306
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:27,127
Other than those I already mentioned,

307
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:29,843
sailing is actually my favorite hobby.

308
00:21:29,843 --> 00:21:32,022
I sail once a month,

309
00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:34,125
and it's become one of my habits.

310
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,832
How amazing.

311
00:21:35,832 --> 00:21:38,780
You share the same hobbies.

312
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,120
What kind of movies do you like?

313
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,074
The Double Life of Veronique.

314
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,620
<i>[Vice President's Office]</i>

315
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,108

316
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:56,644
Got it, thank you.

317
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:47,924

<i>This jade is evidence.</i>

321
00:23:10,843 --> 00:23:13,739
<i>Is this a clue to find him?</i>

322
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:20,538
<i>Did he really keep his word?</i>

323
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:23,133
<i>Did he really come to my world to look for me?</i>

324
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:27,125
<i>I'll continue to investigate.</i>

325

330

Director Yin, please sign for this.

331
00:23:51,821 --> 00:23:54,928
It's the sales report on the Ganoderma vitalizing series.

332
00:24:06,535 --> 00:24:07,930
Thank you.

333
00:24:10,922 --> 00:24:12,921
I think Lan Lan is great.

334
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:14,535
Let's choose her.

335
00:24:14,535 --> 00:24:18,124
Sign her no matter her conditions.

336
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,241
Okay.

337
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:22,022
By the way.

338
00:24:22,022 --> 00:24:24,139
For the auction poster,

339
00:24:24,139 --> 00:24:27,431
use my father's favorite magnolia hairpin as the background.

340
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:29,535
Have public relations come up with a plan.

341
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:30,920
Okay.

342
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,921
Someone moved my things.

343
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:41,950
Do I need to call security?

344
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:44,133
Forget it.

345
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,629
Director Yin, it's better to lock the door when you leave the office.

346
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:54,844
It's time for the meeting.

347
00:24:54,844 --> 00:24:56,921
There's no rush.

348
00:24:56,921 --> 00:24:59,125
Secretary Hou called just now

349
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:00,641
saying that they're stuck in traffic.

350
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:03,422
Chairman asked you to lead the meeting first.

351
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:09,644
I'll go now.

352
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:25,435
No problem, see you tomorrow.

353
00:25:25,435 --> 00:25:26,823
Bye.

354
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,224
Zhang Xiao.

355
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,739
Where is my breakfast?

356
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:41,842
I'm sorry.

357
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:43,329
After I went downstairs,

358
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:45,026
I realized that I forgot to bring my purse.

359
00:25:45,026 --> 00:25:48,226
What's wrong with you?

360
00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:50,331
Do you think you can work in Zhen Tian

361
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:52,944
with such effectiveness?

362
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,330
How about this?

363
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,540
I'll give you my breakfast.

364
00:26:00,335 --> 00:26:01,770
Gu Li Duo?

365
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,068
What's this?

366
00:26:03,068 --> 00:26:04,900
It contains coarse food grains with high fiber.

367
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,910
I believe in you this time.

368
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,380
Xiaoxiao.

369
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,080
Why are you doing here?

370
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,125
Did you find anything?

371
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:24,065
I'm not sure.

372
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:26,869
There are many things I can't figure out.

373
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,171
Why?

374
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:34,062
Can't you tell me what you know?

375
00:26:34,062 --> 00:26:35,583
Stop asking me.

376
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:37,962
I'm so confused.

377
00:26:37,962 --> 00:26:38,966
What about you?

378
00:26:38,966 --> 00:26:40,530
Me?

379
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:43,966
I think Lan Lan is very strange.

380
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:48,575
She seems to be hiding something.

381
00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:52,269
Her showing up wasn't a coincidence.

382
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:54,165
Does she know Ruoxi?

383
00:26:55,477 --> 00:26:58,967
With my years of investigation experience,

384
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:02,661
I feel like she doesn't know who Ruoxi is.

385
00:27:02,661 --> 00:27:04,478
Huang Di, someone is looking for you.

386
00:27:04,478 --> 00:27:05,960
Coming.

387
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:08,878
Just in front.

388
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:32,068
<i>A jade that belongs to Fourth Prince,</i>

389
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:35,962
<i>someone who looks just like Fourth Prince but doesn't recognize me,</i>

390
00:27:36,881 --> 00:27:39,964
<i>and a woman who looks just like me,</i>

391
00:27:39,964 --> 00:27:42,650
<i>all showed up at Zhen Tian.</i>

392
00:27:43,477 --> 00:27:46,167
<i>What's going on?</i>

393
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,375
<i>Was my experience from three months ago</i>

394
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:52,378
<i>a dream or reality?</i>

395
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:54,374
<i>Did history change</i>

396
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:56,973
<i>because of me?</i>

397
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:02,375
<i>If these are the causes and the effects,</i>

398
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:06,074
<i>then what should I do?</i>

399
00:28:13,374 --> 00:28:15,575
<i>We're separated by a wall.</i>

400
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:19,478
<i>We were once together</i>

401
00:28:19,478 --> 00:28:21,663
<i>within these walls.</i>

402
00:28:23,173 --> 00:28:25,967
<i>Just like a dream of 300 years ago.</i>

403
00:28:28,384 --> 00:28:32,680
<i>I always wished to leave these walls when I was in there.</i>

404
00:28:33,373 --> 00:28:36,864
<i>But today, after I left,</i>

405
00:28:36,864 --> 00:28:39,964
<i>I can't forget about you.</i>

406
00:28:41,675 --> 00:28:45,783
<i>We're far separated from each other.</i>

407
00:28:45,783 --> 00:28:48,669
<i>We can't touch each other.</i>

408
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,270
♫ <i>I miss you so much</i> ♫

409
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:58,070
♫ <i>The falling flowers are like flowing water</i> ♫

410
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:06,762
♫ <i>I'm still in the depths of memory</i> ♫

411
00:29:06,762 --> 00:29:11,762
<i>All along I didn't want to leave you.</i>

412
00:29:11,762 --> 00:29:16,361
<i>I can't let go of you.</i>

413
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,683
<i>At that time,</i>

414
00:29:20,683 --> 00:29:24,372
<i>it seemed like I was staying alive just for you.</i>

415
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:33,567
<i>Am I going to live like that again?</i>

416
00:29:34,966 --> 00:29:38,778
<i>The pain from the dream is still so familiar.</i>

417
00:29:41,069 --> 00:29:43,794
<i>No.</i>

418
00:29:43,794 --> 00:29:46,961
<i>I shouldn't repeat the same mistake.</i>

419
00:29:50,272 --> 00:29:55,761
♫ <i>You're the one I miss and love the most</i> ♫

420
00:29:55,761 --> 00:30:00,373
♫ <i>The lovesickness in that life</i> ♫

421
00:30:00,373 --> 00:30:04,473
♫ <i>The life and death we experienced together</i> ♫

422
00:30:04,473 --> 00:30:14,865
♫ <i>Are suddenly presented before us</i> ♫

423
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:29,274
Secretary Hou.

424
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:31,680
Bring Zhang Xiao to my car.

425
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,069
I have something to ask her.

426
00:30:33,069 --> 00:30:34,580
Why don't you go to your office first?

427
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,376
I can bring her to your office.

428
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,860
No.

429
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,374
I'm afraid I won't get anything out of her later.

430
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:41,661
Yes.

431
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,676
Zhang Xiao.

432
00:30:47,575 --> 00:30:48,963
Chairman is looking for you.

433
00:30:48,963 --> 00:30:51,461
He asked you to go to the car.

434
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,874
Does he need something?

435
00:30:55,874 --> 00:30:58,964
I don't know either. You'll know when you get there.

436
00:30:58,964 --> 00:31:00,476
Thank you.

437
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,967
Hi, Mr. Chairman.

438
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:12,482
The wind is strong, get in.

439
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,068
Is there something I can do for you?

440
00:31:21,068 --> 00:31:24,171
Are you getting used to the work?

441
00:31:24,171 --> 00:31:26,165
Yes.

442
00:31:26,165 --> 00:31:28,275
Do you like your job?

443
00:31:30,064 --> 00:31:33,381
I can't speak on that.

444
00:31:34,373 --> 00:31:38,171
Is someone making things difficult for you?

445
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:39,680
No.

446
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:42,067
I don't know.

447
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,171
You were standing in the wind in front of the building,

448
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:46,766
staring but not going in.

449
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:49,964
It seemed strange.

450
00:31:49,966 --> 00:31:53,080
Just tell me what's going on.

451
00:31:57,168 --> 00:31:59,474
Thank you for your concern.

452
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:02,740
There are just some things

453
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,040
that I can't really explain.

454
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:08,272
It's my own problem.

455
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,280
I've decided

456
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,269
to resign.

457
00:32:18,434 --> 00:32:20,818
I don't know how you resigning

458
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:25,168
is related to you standing in front of the building.

459
00:32:25,168 --> 00:32:28,862
You applied for this job and passed the exam

460
00:32:28,862 --> 00:32:31,683
to work for Zhen Tian Group.

461
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:35,368
You're resigning so soon?

462
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,660
If you think running from your problems

463
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,861
will help you solve them,

464
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:45,168
I can tell you

465
00:32:45,168 --> 00:32:47,966
that's not a good solution.

466
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,663
Facing the problem is the best way to solve it.

467
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:53,784
Get to work.

468
00:32:53,784 --> 00:32:58,472
Zhen Tian Group needs your service.

469
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,078
Director Yin.

470
00:33:10,078 --> 00:33:12,960
This is Miss Lan Lan's manager.

471
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,380
Director Yin, nice to meet you.

472
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,420
- Please have a seat.
- Okay.

473
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,216
I'll take my leave.

474
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:24,559
Lan Lan couldn't be here today so I'm here to sign for her.

475
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,396
Signing a contract is an important matter.

476
00:33:26,396 --> 00:33:28,857
Why couldn't Miss Lan Lan be here?

477
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,000
She had other plans today.

478
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,699
Sorry.

479
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:37,786
If Miss Lan Lan is not around, let's sign the contract another day.

480
00:33:37,786 --> 00:33:39,060
I'm sorry, Director Yin.

481
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,459
I'll call Lan Lan to return from Hong Kong now.

482
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:43,843
She's in Hong Kong?

483
00:33:43,843 --> 00:33:44,664
Yes.

484
00:33:44,664 --> 00:33:48,054
She sails in Hong Kong every year during this time.

485
00:33:51,661 --> 00:33:53,457
I can sign with her in Hong Kong.

486
00:33:53,457 --> 00:33:55,680
You just need to tell me her schedule.

487
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,662
That's great.

488
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:59,153
I'll make the arrangements as soon as possible.

489
00:34:12,253 --> 00:34:16,390
Zhang Xiao, where is my breakfast?

490
00:34:17,944 --> 00:34:19,456
I'm sorry, I forgot.

491
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:20,764
What?

492
00:34:20,764 --> 00:34:23,555
You forgot such an important matter.

493
00:34:25,212 --> 00:34:27,022
Jack.

494
00:34:27,022 --> 00:34:29,522
I bought soybean milk and waffles this morning.

495
00:34:29,522 --> 00:34:31,316
Would you like to try?

496
00:34:31,316 --> 00:34:33,706
How can I consume such tacky food?

497
00:34:37,147 --> 00:34:38,322
Fine.

498
00:34:38,322 --> 00:34:41,113
I'll eat this for you.

499
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:47,122
Xiaohe.

500
00:34:47,122 --> 00:34:50,220
Give the work I passed to you yesterday to Zhang Xiao.

501
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,245
- Jack, let me do it.
- You have other work to do.

502
00:34:56,212 --> 00:34:58,315
This is the poster for the auction.

503
00:34:58,315 --> 00:35:00,213
Mr. Chairman thinks highly of this case.

504
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:02,300
You must do it well.

505
00:35:04,005 --> 00:35:06,315
When is it due?

506
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:07,890
Tomorrow.

507
00:35:08,518 --> 00:35:09,621
Can I make the deadline?

508
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:11,723
You have to no matter what.

509
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:14,314
Since you work with me, you follow my pace.

510
00:35:14,314 --> 00:35:17,219
Xiaohe, follow me.

511
00:36:37,315 --> 00:36:39,800
Have you been sailing since you were young?

512
00:36:40,313 --> 00:36:42,140
No.

513
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,927
I've only been learning for three to four years.

514
00:36:44,927 --> 00:36:48,322
You're doing so well for learning for such a short period.

515
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,900
I've liked the sea since I was young.

516
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,780
My father is a biology professor.

517
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,517
He always researched marine life.

518
00:36:56,517 --> 00:36:59,714
When I was young I liked to dive with him.

519
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,640
At that time, I thought I was a Princess Mermaid.

520
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:08,421
Isn't that funny?

521
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,837
What about your mother?

522
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,100
My mother is an opera singer.

523
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,440
She often performed at the Sydney Opera House.

524
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,417
When I was young, she wanted me to learn opera.

525
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:25,820
But I wasn't interested in it.

526
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,160
You must've had a very happy childhood.

527
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,760
Yes, I love them very much.

528
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:35,801
By the way.

529
00:37:35,801 --> 00:37:38,319
Do you like magnolia?

530
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,719
I saw the magnolia tattoo on your back.

531
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,510
Do you think it's ugly?

532
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:49,416
It looks good.

533
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:51,406
I was just curious.

534
00:37:52,723 --> 00:37:56,940
Weren't you also wearing a magnolia flower in your last performance?

535
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,641
Are magnolias of sentimental value to you?

536
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,416
I accidentally fell down from the stairs that day.

537
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:06,210
My forehead was bleeding.

538
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,912
So you used a magnolia to cover your wound.

539
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,416
I feel like

540
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:18,415
I have some kind of fate with magnolia.

541
00:38:18,415 --> 00:38:20,621
Talking about fate,

542
00:38:20,621 --> 00:38:23,211
I keep thinking you look familiar.

543
00:38:23,211 --> 00:38:25,211
I seem to have met you somewhere.

544
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,820
I thought about it for a long time,

545
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,175
and finally remembered.

546
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,000
We've met in a museum.

547
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,400
Right?

548
00:38:35,211 --> 00:38:39,211
I also feel that we've met somewhere.

549
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,521
What time is it?

550
00:38:46,521 --> 00:38:49,910
Why? Do you have other plans?

551
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,805
I want to ride a horse.

552
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,860
I'm sorry.

553
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,420
I have to go now.

554
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,750
Bye.

555
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,200
Bye.

556
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,964
Xiaoxiao.

557
00:39:07,964 --> 00:39:09,380
It's 12 minutes after the work day.

558
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,994
What are you still doing here?

559
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:12,213
Working.

560
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:13,623
You can work tomorrow.

561
00:39:13,623 --> 00:39:15,521
You'll still be here.

562
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:19,320
Come home with me to take a nap.

563
00:39:20,416 --> 00:39:21,214
Let's go.

564
00:39:21,214 --> 00:39:23,204
Don't make trouble.

565
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:28,660
Look at your skin.

566
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,314
It's getting worse.

567
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:32,823
You can go back first. I'm working overtime.

568
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,314
Are you serious?

569
00:39:36,314 --> 00:39:38,310
You're not working here

570
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,920
to get a raise.

571
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,046
You should spend more time dressing up

572
00:39:43,046 --> 00:39:45,312
to meet with Director Yin.

573
00:39:45,312 --> 00:39:47,213
Lower your voice.

574
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,212
They can't hear us.

575
00:39:51,212 --> 00:39:53,700
I want to finish this first

576
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,576
before I do anything else.

577
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:59,907
Why don't you listen to me?

578
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,657
Okay, let me help you.

579
00:40:02,657 --> 00:40:04,554
No, I can do it.

580
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,817
Don't worry.

581
00:40:08,778 --> 00:40:10,580
I'll find the answer I'm looking for.

582
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,163
Answer?

583
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,517
Then I'll leave first.

584
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:33,800
This?

585
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,723
<i>Sometimes you like challenging sailing,</i>

586
00:40:41,723 --> 00:40:44,905
<i>and sometimes you like childish carousels.</i>

587
00:40:44,905 --> 00:40:47,940
<i>Your multifaceted personality quite unpredictable.</i>

588
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,755
<i>That's who I am.</i>

589
00:40:51,723 --> 00:40:54,421
I hope to eat ice cream every day.

590
00:40:54,421 --> 00:40:56,010
Come on, let's go.

591
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,722
Mommy.

592
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:06,702
Do you want to make a wish?

593
00:41:10,211 --> 00:41:12,903
I've never made a wish like this before.

594
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,003
That's because you come from a great background.

595
00:41:17,003 --> 00:41:19,522
You can eat ice cream anytime you want.

596
00:41:19,522 --> 00:41:21,800
So you don't believe in wishes.

597
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,413
Maybe.

598
00:41:24,314 --> 00:41:26,980
If they're such simple wishes,

599
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,187
perhaps you'll live a happier life.

600
00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:33,660
But I'm different.

601
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,560
I don't really like wishes that come true easily.

602
00:41:37,518 --> 00:41:41,006
I think it lacks challenge.

603
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,700
Coming with me here today

604
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,700
must be a very unexpected thing for you.

605
00:41:51,164 --> 00:41:53,961
I haven't been able to relax in such a long time.

606
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:56,317
I'm willing to accompany you.

607
00:41:59,209 --> 00:42:00,504
Let's go.

608
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,470
Let me take these for you, Miss.

609
00:42:18,311 --> 00:42:21,217
How is it?

610
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:26,203
Zhen Tian Group is very sincere about this cooperation.

611
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,315
If you think we can work together,

612
00:42:30,315 --> 00:42:32,811
why not sign the contract now?

613
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,420
Don't you need to read the content?

614
00:42:57,314 --> 00:42:59,211
I trust you.

615
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:08,980
Let's celebrate.

616
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:12,981
Congratulations on signing with Zhen Tian Group.

617
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,260
Please enjoy.

618
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,974
What are you writing?

619
00:43:44,824 --> 00:43:46,309
Guess.

620
00:43:51,415 --> 00:43:53,220
Your place of residence.
