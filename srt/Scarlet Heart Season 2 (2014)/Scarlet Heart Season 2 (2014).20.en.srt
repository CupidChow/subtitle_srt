<i>[Episode 20]</i>

3
00:01:57,434 --> 00:02:02,642
<i>I hope you can present it to me on a more special occasion.</i>

4
00:02:02,642 --> 00:02:04,042
<i>What kind of occasion?</i>

5
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:07,592
<i>An occasion we'll never forget.</i>

6
00:02:16,642 --> 00:02:18,567
- Mom.
- Zheng'er.

7
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,509
Why are you here so late?

8
00:02:26,642 --> 00:02:28,876
I was worried about you.

9
00:02:28,876 --> 00:02:31,309
Have you eaten?

10
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:32,642
Yes.

11
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,617
You don't need to worry about me. I'll be fine.

12
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:42,809
How is Lan Lan's funeral preparation?

13
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:47,876
I'm following the original plan.

14
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,667
Don't make it public.

15
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:52,726
She doesn't want to be disturbed.

16
00:02:52,726 --> 00:02:54,383
Okay.

17
00:02:58,851 --> 00:03:03,642
Zheng'er, how's the logistics department?

18
00:03:06,283 --> 00:03:08,309
Pretty good.

19
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:11,600
I'm learning things I don't usually learn.

20
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,567
Sorry.

21
00:03:16,434 --> 00:03:20,283
I'll ask your father to transfer you back in a couple of days.

22
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,200
Don't.

23
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,792
There's no point.

24
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:25,709
He won't agree to it.

25
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:29,650
Don't worry.

26
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:33,283
I will rely on my own efforts.

27
00:03:33,283 --> 00:03:36,334
Transferring back is just a matter of time.

28
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:38,592
But I worry about you.

29
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:43,259
You're worried I'll hate him.

30
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,942
Hating someone requires time.

31
00:03:49,884 --> 00:03:52,067
I wouldn't make it hard for myself.

32
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:58,200
That's good.

33
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,542
After all, he is your father.

34
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,125
Okay, it's getting late.

35
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,575
I should head back.

36
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:10,450
Listen to me.

37
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,626
Get some rest.

38
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:15,767
It's upsetting to see you like this.

39
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,400
I'll see you out.

40
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,575
Okay, this is good.

41
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:29,209
Go to bed early.

42
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,442
Hello, Uncle Wang.

43
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:53,867
- Cheers!
- Thank you for the hard work.

44
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:57,792
Cheers.

45
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,417
Xiao Zheng, how are you?

46
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,700
I'm fine.

47
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:15,076
Do you still remember what I told you?

48
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:16,951
Never give up.

49
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:18,717
Don't worry, Uncle Wang.

50
00:05:18,717 --> 00:05:20,834
I'm still in the game.

51
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,959
At the logistics department?

52
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,642
I can't believe you're putting your efforts into that.

53
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:32,060
Uncle Wang.

54
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,784
Sometimes we need to relax.

55
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:37,992
Don't give yourself too much stress.

56
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:39,526
I'll be fine.

57
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:44,518
Xiao Zheng, why are you acting like this?

58
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:46,892
Do you really want to be in the logistics department for your entire life?

59
00:05:46,892 --> 00:05:49,909
Look at how dejected you look.

60
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,925
I worry for you.

61
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:57,018
It's almost time.

62
00:05:57,018 --> 00:05:58,750
Let's celebrate.

63
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,642
Come on.

64
00:06:00,642 --> 00:06:04,584
Come.

65
00:06:04,584 --> 00:06:10,584
Congratulations to the wisest and most charming Mr. Kang Sihan for being awarded Bazaar's Man of the Year.

66
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:14,575
Cheers.

67
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,183
Thank you.

68
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,584
It's almost time.

69
00:06:19,584 --> 00:06:20,751
Let's count down together.

70
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:21,809
Come on.

71
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:27,425
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six.

72
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:32,967
Five, four, three, two, one.

73
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:42,042
Cheers!

74
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:46,792
Look at how satisfied he looks.

75
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:48,950
Then look at yourself.

76
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:52,742
I have to say this.

77
00:06:52,742 --> 00:06:57,625
I feel like he has something to do with Lan Lan's death.

78
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,517
After Lan Lan died,

79
00:07:00,517 --> 00:07:01,792
he's been floating on the clouds.

80
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:04,220
He's climbing on top of you.

81
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:06,851
Uncle Wang.

82
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:08,876
Let's not talk about unhappy things.

83
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:11,050
Okay, we won't talk about it.

84
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:17,283
You can forget everything.

85
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:21,192
But don't forget who you are and what you want.

86
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,959
Stop drinking, let's go.

87
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:32,751
You can go first. I want to sit for a bit longer.

88
00:07:34,283 --> 00:07:35,851
Okay.

89
00:07:35,851 --> 00:07:39,200
I'll go then. Don't drink too much.

90
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,709
I'll pay the bill.

91
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,500
What a coincidence.

92
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:01,851
Nice seeing you here, Director Kang.

93
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:03,142
Do you want to drink with us?

94
00:08:03,142 --> 00:08:04,809
You know everyone.

95
00:08:04,809 --> 00:08:09,392
You're all here to celebrate the wisest and most charming Mr. Kang Sihan

96
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:12,260
for being awarded Bazaar's Man of the Year.

97
00:08:12,884 --> 00:08:15,959
You sound jealous.

98
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:19,250
You're acting like you don't care,

99
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,118
but it's all just pretend.

100
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:22,976
You don't understand me at all.

101
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:26,742
Fine. If you don't want to join us, I'll head back myself.

102
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:35,200
Director Kang is back. Let's keep the party going.

103
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:45,826
You caused quite the commotion this time.

104
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,342
What do you mean?

105
00:08:48,183 --> 00:08:51,776
Since the police station notified him of the death,

106
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:53,726
he's been more depressed than before.

107
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:57,400
He hasn't come to work in two days.

108
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:02,099
The logistics department can do without him.

109
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:04,767
I would be worried if he went into work every day.

110
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,309
I know my nephew.

111
00:09:07,309 --> 00:09:09,784
He'll adapt.

112
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:14,059
The most important thing for him right now is to forget that woman.

113
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:16,575
Then he'll focus on getting his revenge.

114
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:18,159
I hope so.

You're back.

135
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,267
You're back.

136
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:13,825
They said they couldn't find you.

137
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,459
Where did you go?

138
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,217
Don't leave me.

139
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:27,167
Don't leave me again.

140
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:29,017
I'm going crazy.

141
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:35,009
Please stay.

142
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:38,518
I miss you.

143
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:05,434
I miss you, don't go.

144
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,509
Don't go.

145
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,417
Don't go.

146
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,959
Hello?

147
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,659
Where are you?

148
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:52,250
If you don't come back I'll report you to the Women's Federation for abuse.

149
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,167
Soon.

150
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:39,876
You're back, Xiaoxiao.

151
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:41,042
Where did you go?

152
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:42,100
Did you get robbed?

153
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,667
I'm so hungry I almost died.

154
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,609
I brought it back.

155
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:49,451
What is this?

156
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:57,851
Don't touch my stuff.

157
00:14:57,851 --> 00:14:59,818
Who cares.

158
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:03,118
Listen.

159

Food doesn't taste as good if you don't eat it immediately.

160
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:10,042

Yes, it was snowing too much last night.

I meant to bring it back to you later.

173
00:17:15,392 --> 00:17:17,409
You can give it to me now.

174
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,367

178

00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:54,809
I just want to say,

180
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:58,592
it's better to return what doesn't belong to you.

181
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:01,475
You're right, this isn't mine.

182

00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:08,118
I gave it to Lan Lan.

184
00:18:19,325 --> 00:18:21,375
Black Cat Detective.

185
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,320
What are you doing here?

186
00:18:24,826 --> 00:18:26,267
I came to get back my stuff.

187
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:28,660
Your stuff isn't here.

188
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:32,409
It was an accident.

189
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:36,225
She accidentally took something of mine.

190
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:42,292
I'll get going then.

191
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:54,125
Xiaoxiao, what's going on?

192
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,167
I did accidentally take something of his.

193
00:18:58,018 --> 00:18:59,475
Black Cat Detective.

194
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:00,834
You're not mad, right?

195
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:02,283
Silly girl.

196
00:19:02,283 --> 00:19:04,784
Why would I be mad at you?

197
00:19:04,784 --> 00:19:07,734
But I want you to stay away from him.

198
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:11,600
Noted.

199
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,292
Okay, go get changed.

200
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:16,020
I'll bring you to get breakfast.

201
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,999
Go.

202
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,918
Supervisor Yin.

203
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,042
Zheng'er.

204
00:19:51,951 --> 00:19:53,409
Chairman.

205
00:19:56,034 --> 00:19:57,934
Well done.

206
00:19:57,934 --> 00:19:59,142
It's nothing.

207
00:19:59,142 --> 00:20:01,183
It's just some manual labor.

208
00:20:01,183 --> 00:20:02,851
If it wasn't for the demotion,

209
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:05,592
I wouldn't have known I was such a good housekeeper.

210
00:20:06,242 --> 00:20:08,784
I know you think I've wronged you.

211
00:20:08,784 --> 00:20:10,290
Not really.

212
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,450
I didn't want to demote you,

213
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:18,199
but you know that we should be strict about our rules.

214
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:20,267
Everyone who makes mistakes

215
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:22,751
needs to bear the responsibilities.

216
00:20:22,751 --> 00:20:25,100
Each department is important.

217
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,425
As long as you get things done,

218
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,851
it can also be a good opportunity for you to train yourself.

219
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:32,142
Thank you for the advice.

220
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:33,325
Chairman.

221
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:35,700
I'll get going if there's nothing else.

222
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,751
I still have a lot of things to do.

223
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:41,199
Okay, get to your work.

224
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,409
Yes.

225
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,999
Zheng'er.

226
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:51,960
I also feel very sad for Lan Lan.

227
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,540
Thanks your concern.

228
00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:57,026
I'm fine.

229
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:53,917
Baby.

230
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:58,575
Your Black Cat Detective asked you to go to his office.

231
00:21:58,575 --> 00:22:01,542
Don't call him Black Cat Detective in the office.

232
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:04,517
Why are you being shy?

233
00:22:04,517 --> 00:22:06,120
Go ahead.

234
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,209
Hurry.

235
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,934
Director Kang, are you looking for me?

236
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,684
What did you just call me?

237
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:31,450
Director Kang.

238
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,709
Say it again?

239
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:33,834
Director Kang.

240
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:35,751
There's no one here. Why are you calling me Director Kang?

241
00:22:35,751 --> 00:22:37,767
Do you have a death wish?

242
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:39,518
Come sit.

243
00:22:46,018 --> 00:22:47,800
This is your Christmas gift.

244
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,290
Open it.

245
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,999
What is this?

246
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:02,709
Little fool.

247
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:04,534
Smell it.

248
00:23:10,142 --> 00:23:11,742
There's a scent.

249
00:23:13,617 --> 00:23:15,550
Different scents.

250
00:23:16,617 --> 00:23:17,876
This...

251
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:20,142
I spent six years collecting scents

252
00:23:20,142 --> 00:23:22,534
from places around the world.

253
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,434
I put them into an album,

254
00:23:24,434 --> 00:23:28,700
and hope we can fill this with our sweetest photos.

255
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,542
Black Cat Detective, thank you.

256
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:36,167
You're welcome.

257
00:23:40,642 --> 00:23:43,099
That's it? You're leaving?

258
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:45,100
What else?

259
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,234
Don't you have a Christmas gift for me?

260
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:52,950
Really?

261
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,459
I'm not telling you.

262
00:24:10,976 --> 00:24:12,490
Supervisor Yin.

263
00:24:13,383 --> 00:24:15,400
I was looking for you.

264
00:24:17,976 --> 00:24:19,709
Merry Christmas.

265
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:25,042
This is?

266
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:28,809
I know I said some harsh words in the past.

267
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:31,100
This is my apology.

268
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,118
I didn't take it to heart.

269
00:24:34,118 --> 00:24:36,920
I know you said those for my sister.

270
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,267
I accept the gift.

271
00:24:43,267 --> 00:24:44,892
Thank you.

272
00:24:44,892 --> 00:24:47,040
I wish you a Merry Christmas.

273
00:24:54,267 --> 00:24:58,310
<i>He's observant.</i>

274
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,700
Director Kang, you have a package from London.

275
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,325
Okay, thank you.

276
00:25:46,983 --> 00:25:48,100
Xinyi.

277
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,242
Did you receive my Christmas gift?

278
00:25:51,242 --> 00:25:53,334
I just received it, thank you.

279
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:54,751
Why are you being so polite.

280
00:25:54,751 --> 00:25:55,999
You're treating me as a stranger.

281
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:57,659
I'm coming back soon.

282
00:25:57,659 --> 00:25:59,350
Don't you still have your dissertation defense?

283
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,500
Why are you coming back so soon?

284
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,834
It got postponed for a year.

285
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:05,209
I'll talk to you when I get back. Bye.

286
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:06,659
I'm working anyways.

287
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,450
Okay, bye.

288
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:12,900
Director Yin, Kang Sihan received another two packages from London this month.

289
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,700
They're from the same girl.

290
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,959
I listened in on their call just now.

291
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:21,292
I don't think they're just friends.

292
00:26:22,742 --> 00:26:24,350
Ex-girlfriend?

293
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,792
Still not sure.

294
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,167
Seems like it, but also doesn't seem like it.

295
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:30,559
Im using women's intuition.

296
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,350
Women are always judging things according to their intuition.

297
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,992
This may cause many cases of injustice.

298
00:26:36,992 --> 00:26:39,930
I've done my part.

299
00:26:41,076 --> 00:26:42,818
Continue to monitor them.

300
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:45,934
If it's just an ex-girlfriend,

301
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:48,617
then forget about it.

302
00:26:48,617 --> 00:26:50,000
Okay.

303
00:26:56,659 --> 00:26:58,299
Merry Christmas.

304
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:00,918
Such a fancy shirt.

305
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:03,600
Russian national style.

306
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,600
I think it's very special.

307
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,475
Change into it and let me see.

308
00:27:09,475 --> 00:27:11,300
Change here?

309
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,650
Change and let me see.

310
00:27:15,225 --> 00:27:16,500
Change.

311
00:27:21,018 --> 00:27:22,334
Will do.

312
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:33,450
It's a different style.

313
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,350
But you're still handsome.

314
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:40,167
Thanks for your Christmas gift.

315
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:46,851
I've fulfilled your request.

316
00:27:46,851 --> 00:27:50,383
Can you also fulfill one of my requests?

317
00:27:50,383 --> 00:27:51,684
What?

318
00:27:51,684 --> 00:27:55,409
Let's go to Hong Kong for Christmas.

319
00:27:57,492 --> 00:27:59,934
I can't. My dad's still in the hospital.

320
00:27:59,934 --> 00:28:02,225
Don't worry, I have it covered.

321
00:28:02,225 --> 00:28:04,059
I got him the best doctor.

322
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:05,934
Why didn't I know about it?

323
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,475
Because your business is also my business.

324
00:28:08,475 --> 00:28:12,059
I wish for you to live each day happily.

325
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:13,999
I don't want you to have to worry about things.

326
00:28:20,392 --> 00:28:22,450
Thank you.

327
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,017
Black Cat Detective.

328
00:28:27,183 --> 00:28:28,559
Supervisor.

329
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:34,559
Supervisor Yin.

330
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,809
Where is Zhang Xiao?

331
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:37,759
She is on leave.

332
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,434
Leave? Is she sick?

333
00:28:40,434 --> 00:28:42,999
Of course not, she's with...

334
00:28:44,342 --> 00:28:45,751
With what?

335
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,684
Is it a secret?

336
00:28:50,492 --> 00:28:51,918
No.

337
00:28:51,918 --> 00:28:55,484
She asked me to not tell anyone.

338
00:28:56,409 --> 00:28:58,934
Okay, I won't make it hard for you.

339
00:28:58,934 --> 00:29:00,550
Supervisor Yin.

340
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:07,199
She's celebrating Christmas with Vice President Kang in Hong Kong.

341
00:29:12,392 --> 00:29:15,017

00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:09,517
Sister!

367
00:33:09,517 --> 00:33:11,999
Open and see.

368
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:13,817
Look.

369
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:25,300
<i>ZX, good morning.</i>

370
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:30,520
<i>I'd like to have breakfast with you.</i>

371
00:33:34,892 --> 00:33:36,634
<i>I'm waiting for you.</i>

372
00:33:40,517 --> 00:33:44,192
<i>Look for it at the hotel.</i>

373
00:33:47,018 --> 00:33:48,876
Sister, open it!

374
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:04,900
<i>Please accept my small gift.</i>

375
00:34:15,283 --> 00:34:16,409
Sister, come.

376
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:18,383
Sister, look.

377
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:24,076
Sister, open.

378
00:34:28,183 --> 00:34:32,042
<i>Please wear the dress I prepared for you.</i>

379
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:08,334
Black Cat Detective.

380
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:13,360
Did you become Prince Charming?

381
00:35:15,018 --> 00:35:19,809
ZX, do you like my Christmas gift?

382
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,951
I like everything you've done for me.

383
00:35:27,283 --> 00:35:29,367
Black Cat Detective.

384
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:30,851
Thank you.

385
00:35:30,851 --> 00:35:33,959
This is the happiest holiday I've ever spent.

386
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:39,475
ZX.

387
00:35:40,617 --> 00:35:43,642
I hope in the coming days

388
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:47,051
you can give your heart to me.

389
00:35:47,051 --> 00:35:51,250
I will take good care of it.

390
00:35:52,118 --> 00:35:53,584
Okay?

391
00:36:38,934 --> 00:36:40,951
<i>Keep these photos safe.</i>

392
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:42,934
<i>They'll be useful someday.</i>

393
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,851
<i>A piece of honey can also become a bomb.</i>

394
00:36:45,851 --> 00:36:48,200
<i>Depends on whose hands it's in.</i>

395
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,192
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

396
00:37:36,392 --> 00:37:39,650
Black Cat Detective, let's turn on some music.

397
00:37:40,818 --> 00:37:44,892
Can you call me something other than Black Cat Detective?

398
00:37:44,892 --> 00:37:46,517
Call me something else.

399
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:49,642
Can you call me hus...

400
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:54,159
If you don't like it, then I'll call you Director Kang.

401
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,650
So formal.

402
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:03,690
<i>[Xinyi]</i>

403
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:11,042
What did your ex-girlfriends used to call you?

404
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:16,892
Why are you embarrassed?

405
00:38:16,892 --> 00:38:19,018
Let me hear it.

406
00:38:19,018 --> 00:38:23,034
They just called me Sihan.

407
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,851
I don't believe you.

408
00:38:24,851 --> 00:38:29,199
There's definitely something cheesy.

409
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:31,784
I'm driving, be good.

410
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,475
Hello?

411
00:38:39,475 --> 00:38:41,575
Princess.

412
00:38:41,575 --> 00:38:42,617
You're back.

413
00:38:42,617 --> 00:38:44,430
When did you get back?

414
00:38:45,383 --> 00:38:48,400
Okay, of course.

415
00:38:49,492 --> 00:38:51,909
Okay, see you later.

416
00:38:54,142 --> 00:38:56,542
My best friend just returned from abroad.

417
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,492
We're getting dinner tonight.

418
00:38:58,492 --> 00:39:00,000
Do you wish to join?

419
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,584
I've gotten a lot of work recently.

420
00:39:01,584 --> 00:39:03,825
How about next time?

421
00:39:09,976 --> 00:39:12,292
Drive carefully, got it?

422
00:39:12,292 --> 00:39:14,542
Drive carefully.

423
00:39:35,892 --> 00:39:38,040
I can take it up myself.

424
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:40,118
I'll help you.

425
00:39:40,118 --> 00:39:42,142
It's okay.

426
00:39:42,142 --> 00:39:43,942
You should get to work.

427
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:51,080
I had an amazing couple of days.

428
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,517
Thank you.

429
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:56,842
What are you talking about?

430
00:40:10,684 --> 00:40:12,259
Why aren't you picking up?

431
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:13,851
They're spam calls.

432
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,209
Then...

433
00:40:18,342 --> 00:40:20,792
Go inside and rest up.

434
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:23,999
You too.

435
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:25,434
Bye.

436
00:40:26,951 --> 00:40:28,259
Bye.

437
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:21,742
Xinyi, you called?

438
00:41:22,892 --> 00:41:24,634
You're back?

439
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:33,700
Okay, see you later, bye.

440
00:41:51,018 --> 00:41:52,567
Waiter.

441
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:55,442
- Please wait a moment.
- Okay.

442
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,659
Hello, how can I help you?

443
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:00,076
I ordered a Blue Mountain.

444
00:42:00,076 --> 00:42:02,283
What is this?

445
00:42:02,283 --> 00:42:04,100
This is our Blue Mountain.

446
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,909
It's so bad.

447
00:42:05,909 --> 00:42:07,434
Where are the coffee beans from?

448
00:42:07,434 --> 00:42:11,199
How about I get you another coffee?

449
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:13,600
I don't want it. Let me speak to your manager.

450
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,159
Well...

451
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:19,259
I'm sorry, our manager is not around.

452
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:23,700
I'll go get them then.

453
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,059
Miss...

454
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:25,709
Who are you?

455
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,709
Calm down.

456
00:42:27,709 --> 00:42:31,867
Piggy, I missed you!

457
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:34,283
You're still the same.

458
00:42:34,283 --> 00:42:35,309
Still so hot-tempered.

459
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:36,467
Not at all.

460
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:40,040
I just wanted to ask where the coffee beans were from.

461
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:44,450
The coffee is actually pretty good here.

462
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,918
You've just gotten more picky，

463
00:42:46,918 --> 00:42:48,375
so you don't think its as good.

464
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:50,159
Really?

465
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:52,876
Whatever you say goes I guess.

466
00:42:52,876 --> 00:42:54,834
Not at all.

467
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:56,400
You're the princess.

468
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,667
Only you can turn things in your favor.

469
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:01,517
I'm not that unreasonable.

470
00:43:01,517 --> 00:43:04,259
I'm very reasonable.

471
00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:06,550
I know you're reasonable.

472
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:11,542
So we're still eating here, right?

473
00:43:13,575 --> 00:43:15,392
Do you want to order or should I?

474
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:19,110
You can order. I like what you like.

475
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:24,559
Where is your secret boyfriend?

476
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,000
Didn't you say he was coming?

477
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,642
I had something come up today.

478
00:43:29,642 --> 00:43:31,592
He'll come later.

479
00:43:33,517 --> 00:43:35,918
Where is your Black Cat Detective?

480
00:43:35,918 --> 00:43:38,467
When can I meet him?

481
00:43:38,467 --> 00:43:40,517
Next time. He's busy too.

482
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:42,020
He's working overtime.

483
00:43:43,034 --> 00:43:46,092
Is he the one?

484
00:43:51,392 --> 00:43:53,580
It's quite pretty.

485
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:55,826
He's got taste.

486
00:43:55,826 --> 00:43:57,809
You should praise me for having good taste.

487
00:43:57,809 --> 00:43:59,250
Go away.

488
00:44:00,976 --> 00:44:03,459
The emphasis is on this.

489
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:05,442
Too cute.

490
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:08,375
He's creative.

491
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:10,192
He's fine.

492
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:13,392
Don't get too picky.

493
00:44:13,392 --> 00:44:15,642
He might get stolen from you.

494
00:44:18,726 --> 00:44:21,034
I'm getting a call.

495
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,951
He's here. I'll go get him.

496
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,242
Hello?

497
00:44:31,242 --> 00:44:32,659
What?

498
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:36,418
Okay.
