3
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,020
<i>You're really giving this to me?</i>

4
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,287
<i>Of course.</i>

5
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:49,812
<i>We're good friends now.</i>

6
00:01:49,812 --> 00:01:51,329
<i>You can't reject my gift.</i>

7
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,704
<i>What do you like?</i>

8
00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:56,079
<i>I gave you my jacket,</i>

9
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,803
<i>so I'll take your jacket too.</i>

10
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:31,729
Xiaoxiao, I was looking for you.

11
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:32,746
Looking for me?

12
00:02:32,746 --> 00:02:36,145
There's a very good play at the National Theater tonight.

13
00:02:36,145 --> 00:02:38,129
Let's go together.

14
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:40,896
Sihan, let me consider it.

15
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:42,704
I'll call you back tonight.

16
00:04:06,103 --> 00:04:07,437
Can I help you?

17
00:04:07,437 --> 00:04:09,854
Ma Wa,

18
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:12,604
didn't you say you wouldn't fall in love with anyone else?

19
00:04:12,604 --> 00:04:13,579
You fell in love with him.

20
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:17,437
Do you think he can really give you what you want?

21
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:21,446
Did you get the wrong person?

22
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,854
Boss saved my life.

23
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:30,119
He's also my Godfather.

24
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:33,687
I won't betray him like how you betrayed me.

25
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:34,854
Let me tell you.

26
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:37,671
I hate betrayers the most.

27
00:04:38,537 --> 00:04:41,562
They have to pay for what they did.

28
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,604
What are you doing?

29
00:04:48,604 --> 00:04:50,579
Miss Lan, are you okay?

30
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:04,019
Let her go!

31
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,203
Miss Lan.

32
00:05:18,203 --> 00:05:19,979
Miss Lan, are you okay?

33
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:24,862
Zhang Xiao?

34
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,871
Is it the emergency center?

35
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:31,980
I need an ambulance now.

36
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,780
<i>[Outpatient]</i>

37
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:43,620
Doctor, how is she?

38
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:47,312
She's okay. It's not too serious.

39
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:49,138
She'll be fine after a few days.

40
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:52,162
Doctor, is her head okay?

41
00:05:52,162 --> 00:05:54,120
Will she get a concussion?

42
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,954
Sir, don't be nervous.

43
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:57,437
Like I said,

44
00:05:57,437 --> 00:05:59,312
she will be fine after a few days.

45
00:05:59,312 --> 00:06:02,254
But you need an X-ray.

46
00:06:02,254 --> 00:06:04,812
Your injuries look more serious than hers.

47
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:06,370
I'm fine.

48
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:17,187
Nurse, do you have a patient named Zhang Xiao?

49
00:06:17,187 --> 00:06:18,162
Yes, she's inside.

50
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:19,796
- Alright, thank you.
- Let's go.

51
00:06:23,245 --> 00:06:24,454
Xiaoxiao, are you alright?

52
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:26,120
Calm down.

53
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,495
Doctor, is she alright?

54
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:28,604
She's fine.

55
00:06:28,604 --> 00:06:30,646
Don't worry. She'll be fine after a few days.

56
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:32,079
Alright, thank you doctor.

57
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,003
Xiaoxiao.

58
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:38,796
She's awake.

59
00:06:39,604 --> 00:06:41,712
You scared me!

60
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:45,354
Why am I here?

61
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:49,320
We got a message from an unknown number saying that something happened to you so we rushed here.

62
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:54,470
How are you feeling? Where are you hurt?

63
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:57,279
Dizzy.

64
00:06:58,203 --> 00:07:00,479
Who did this?

65
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,554
I don't know him.

66
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:04,829
A man wearing sunglasses.

67
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:08,604
Xiaoxiao, can you recall if anything happened recently?

68
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:11,162
Or if you offended anyone?

69
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:12,854
Who could she have offended?

70
00:07:12,854 --> 00:07:16,437
She's all dressed up, so must've been a pervert.

71
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,120
Damn Huang Di.

72
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,754
You can't say anything nice.

73
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:20,787
I'm kind enough to visit you.

74
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:22,370
I'm just being honest.

75
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,620
Enough, be quiet.

76
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:28,262
Extreme joy begets sorrow.

77
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:31,546
Lan Lan finally accepted me

78
00:07:31,546 --> 00:07:33,887
and gave me her jacket.

79
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,938
But I got attacked once I left the office.

80
00:07:37,938 --> 00:07:40,396
It's alright. As long as you're safe.

81
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:01,295
Lan Lan, why are you here?

82
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:03,429
Your phone has been off all day.

83
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:05,270
You made me worried.

84
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:08,329
It's nothing.

85
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,429
I was a little upset and didn't feel like seeing anyone.

86
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,229
I just want to be by your side.

87
00:08:22,495 --> 00:08:24,462
Who made you upset?

88
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:30,287
It's nothing, I'm just a bit tired.

89
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:31,804
Did you eat yet?

90
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,462
Let's go down and eat.

91
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:38,629
I don't want to eat anything.

92
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,162
Then let's hang out at a bar.

93
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:47,587
No, I don't want to go anywhere.

94
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:53,129
I just want to stay in your arms.

95
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,929
According to the tarot cards,

96
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:02,829
someone evil is around you.

97
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:06,371
I don't think it's Kang Sihan.

98
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,929
Then who is it?

99
00:09:12,162 --> 00:09:13,971
I don't know.

100
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:20,020
But I feel like it's someone you trust.

101
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,038
Assistant Qiao?

102
00:09:22,038 --> 00:09:25,129
No, not her.

103
00:09:26,454 --> 00:09:29,119
Seems like you know who it is.

104
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:31,254
You just don't want to tell me.

105
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:35,012
I really don't know.

106
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,629
I've been feeling like a mess recently.

107
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:42,719
I'm really worried about you.

108
00:09:44,454 --> 00:09:47,120
I know you want what's best for me.

109
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,396
But I don't want you to be too worried about me.

110
00:09:53,938 --> 00:09:59,729
Is there anyone else you trust?

111
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:01,920
Or someone you're close to?

112
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:10,746
You're the one I'm closest to that I trust the most.

113
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:17,345
But I know you will never harm me.

114
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:20,354
So stop speculating, okay?

115
00:10:33,787 --> 00:10:35,437
Zhang Xiao got attacked by a stranger just now.

116
00:10:35,437 --> 00:10:38,245
I suspect this is related to Miss Lan.

117
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:39,646
You're being irrational.

118
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:42,329
Not me, your girlfriend.

119
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:45,520
You should ask her why she exchanged jackets with Zhang Xiao.

120
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:53,245
I don't want to talk to you right now.

121
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:55,987
We'll talk at work.

122
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:00,479
What happened?

123
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:05,203
Nothing.

124
00:11:56,812 --> 00:11:58,537
I checked the cameras.

125
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:01,562
He's the one who attacked Zhang Xiao.

126
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:02,979
This is strange.

127
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:05,412
First Lan Lan gave Zhang Xiao her jacket,

128
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:07,329
then she got attacked.

129
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:10,362
I suspect the actual target is Lan Lan.

130
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:12,729
That's interesting.

131
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:14,729
Do you know who he is?

132
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:15,812
No.

133
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:18,538
But I feel like I met him somewhere before.

134
00:12:21,103 --> 00:12:22,512
Yin Zheng.

135
00:12:23,954 --> 00:12:25,620
Do you know him?

136
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,520
He is the one who attacked Zhang Xiao.

137
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:36,454
How would I know him?

138
00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:48,279
Here, this tea is good.

139
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,537
Is Han Qing here?

140
00:12:59,537 --> 00:13:02,179
I asked him to go back to Bangkok.

141
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:04,412
He should be back by now.

142
00:13:04,412 --> 00:13:08,254
You mean he's been in Bangkok the past couple of days?

143
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:12,979
There was an emergency a few days ago.

144
00:13:12,979 --> 00:13:14,620
Someone needed to go back.

145
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,229
I couldn't go because of my legs, so I asked him.

146
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:21,729
It's hard to find someone so loyal.

147
00:13:21,729 --> 00:13:24,337
He really knows how to take care of my burdens.

148
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:37,495
One of our female employees was attacked near Zhen Tian Park yesterday.

149
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:39,879
We still haven't found the attacker yet.

150
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,704
I heard

151
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:47,196
that the female employee looks like Lan Lan.

152
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,996
That's where the problem lies.

153
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,337
It definitely wasn't a coincidence.

154
00:13:52,996 --> 00:13:54,979
That's strange.

155
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:59,187
Lan Lan is so polite and down to earth.

156
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:02,746
How did she get into this kind of trouble?

157
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,300
Unless...

158
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,646
You're the one they're after.

159
00:14:10,604 --> 00:14:16,354
Don't forget that Lan Lan is Zhen Tian Group's new spokesperson.

160
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:21,687
I know you've mobilize everything to launch Yue-Sai's microfilm.

161
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:24,312
You must do it well.

162
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:30,329
Now everybody, especially Kang Sihan, is watching you.

163
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:33,245
You must not treat this lightly.

164
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:34,729
Don't worry.

165
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:53,938
Boss, I'm back.

166
00:14:53,938 --> 00:14:55,170
You've worked hard.

167
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,562
Go upstairs for some rest.

168
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:58,879
Alright.

169
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:04,270
Second Uncle, don't worry.

170
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,479
The company has arranged more people to protect Lan Lan after this incident.

171
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:10,796
There won't be a chance for anyone to hurt her again.

172
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:12,254
Good.

173
00:15:19,245 --> 00:15:21,395
Han Qing was just in Bangkok for a couple of days.

174
00:15:21,395 --> 00:15:23,520
Why did he bring such a big suitcase?

175
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,020
I missed the dry foods there,

176
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,370
so I asked him to bring me some.

177
00:15:31,912 --> 00:15:33,454
Are you alright?

178
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:35,729
I'm not used to this weather.

179
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:37,762
Do you want me to bring you to see a doctor?

180
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:39,912
This helps.

181
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:49,620
Second Uncle, have some rest then.

182
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,262
I'll get going now.

183
00:16:12,896 --> 00:16:14,420
Lan Lan.

184
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:17,479
Lan Lan.

185
00:16:19,871 --> 00:16:21,337
Lan Lan.

186
00:16:35,854 --> 00:16:37,887
Who let you in?

187
00:16:39,162 --> 00:16:43,120
I saw the door open so I came in to change the flowers.

188
00:16:43,854 --> 00:16:46,412
Still being so rude.

189
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:48,979
Haven't your parent taught you rules?

190
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:51,604
When the master isn't around,

191
00:16:51,604 --> 00:16:54,871
you can't simply come into the master's room.

192
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:57,079
Sorry, Miss Lan.

193
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,245
It's my fault.

194
00:16:59,245 --> 00:17:02,520
But you should also remember to close the door next time.

195
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,537
It's only been a few days since I last saw you.

196
00:17:05,537 --> 00:17:09,512
Not only did you not come to change the flowers, but now you're also telling me what to do?

197
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:13,162
You're being so arrogant.

198
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:16,787
Things are different now that you have support from Director Kang.

199
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:19,120
I was attacked two days ago.

200
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,437
I was on leave because I got hurt.

201
00:17:23,437 --> 00:17:25,829
I only remember that Director Yin said

202
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:29,787
that the magnolias in this room need to be changed every day.

203
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:32,162
They need to always be fresh.

204
00:17:32,162 --> 00:17:34,245
I also remember

205
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:36,738
that you said you wanted to be good friends.

206
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:42,203
But you're back to how you were again.

207
00:17:42,203 --> 00:17:46,179
Aside from changing the flowers, I also have a question for you.

208
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:50,220
You said you're claustrophobic.

209
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,220
Were you telling the truth?

210
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,312
Are you really that stupid?

211
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:03,787
I'm not stupid.

212
00:18:04,562 --> 00:18:07,395
I just never knew you were such a great actress.

213
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:11,019
You came all the way from Australia.

214
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:15,520
Are you avoiding your enemies?

215
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,370
Miss Zhang,

216
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,162
sometimes you are too clever.

217
00:18:21,162 --> 00:18:24,495
You should really check if you're delusional.

218
00:18:24,495 --> 00:18:26,812
I'm not delusional.

219
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:30,829
I thought it through the past couple of days.

220
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:32,987
I feel like you're keeping something a secret.

221
00:18:34,454 --> 00:18:37,919
I'm here because I signed with Zhen Tian.

222
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:40,729
I'm a clean man.

223
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:43,454
How can I have enemies?

224
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:45,420
What secrets would I have?

225
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,754
You have a wild imagination.

226
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,412
I got attacked after I wore the jacket you gave me.

227
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:56,370
He didn't rob my money nor molest me.

228
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,687
He seems to be giving me a warning.

229
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,719
He also said something about Ma Wa.

230
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:08,145
Shut up! Get out!

231
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:09,537
Lan Lan.

232
00:19:09,537 --> 00:19:12,662
Why you behave like a hedgehog?

233
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:15,020
You can tell me your troubles.

234
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,771
There are always solutions.

235
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:19,379
I said get out!

236
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,012
Stop there.

237
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:31,838
If I hear any gossip around the office,

238
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:34,912
I won't let you off so easily.

239
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:12,962
Ma Wa, it's me.

240
00:21:06,838 --> 00:21:10,938
The microfilms for our first ever global-wide custom skincare product,

241
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:14,262
The Secrets of Princess Yuxi, is about to start production.

242
00:21:14,262 --> 00:21:18,662
I heard our company's Youth Skynet is also launching soon.

243
00:21:18,662 --> 00:21:22,320
I think we can have the opening ceremony for The Secrets of Princess Yuxi

244
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,103
and the launch of Youth Skynet happen on the same day.

245
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:29,620
We can have the entire live broadcast on Youth Skynet.

246
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,329
What do you think?

247
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:32,687
This is interesting.

248
00:21:32,687 --> 00:21:33,896
Chairman.

249
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:36,162
It's not just interesting.

250
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,687
I think it holds great significance.

251
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:41,704
The launch of Youth Skynet and the start of the production for the microfilm.

252
00:21:41,704 --> 00:21:43,746
Two happy events at the same time.

253
00:21:43,746 --> 00:21:45,812
With the two events happening together,

254
00:21:45,812 --> 00:21:50,437
it will definitely break the news.

255
00:21:50,437 --> 00:21:54,079
The Secrets of Princess Yuxi and Youth Skynet togehter

256
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,812
will surely create hype for the company.

257
00:21:58,812 --> 00:22:01,145
Donghai, what do you think?

258
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:03,354
I think we can give it a try.

259
00:22:03,354 --> 00:22:07,954
As long as it won't create problems like the auction last time.

260
00:22:07,954 --> 00:22:12,145
Zhen Tian Group is a big enterprise.

261
00:22:12,145 --> 00:22:15,620
We can't allow for scandals to keep happening.

262
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,287
Watch your mouth, Lao Liu.

263
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:20,370
Everyone wants our company to do good.

264
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,395
Why are you diminishing our confidence?

265
00:22:22,395 --> 00:22:26,579
Once bitten, twice shy.

266
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:27,704
Alright.

267
00:22:27,704 --> 00:22:29,329
Since everyone thinks it's worth trying,

268
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:32,319
then we'll go with Director Yin's idea.

269
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:38,437
Sihan, you've been with the company for quite some time now.

270
00:22:38,437 --> 00:22:41,954
Are you familiar with the workings of the company yet?

271
00:22:41,954 --> 00:22:45,120
I've made my rounds through all the departments and gained quite an understanding.

272
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,662
Compared to the British companies you've worked for,

273
00:22:47,662 --> 00:22:49,662
what is your opinion?

274
00:22:49,662 --> 00:22:54,329
I'm not sure if you want to hear the truth.

275
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:56,871
Of course I do.

276
00:22:56,871 --> 00:22:59,562
The company is overall well-run,

277
00:22:59,562 --> 00:23:01,896
but there are problems in management.

278
00:23:01,896 --> 00:23:05,562
Some of the head of departments play favorites and are dictatorial.

279
00:23:05,562 --> 00:23:07,771
Their way of competition is bad.

280
00:23:07,771 --> 00:23:10,604
If we don't try to prevent this,

281
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:12,929
the company will be in chaos.

282
00:23:13,812 --> 00:23:18,120
Director Kang, which head of department are you talking about?

283
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,604
And which departments are you talking about?

284
00:23:20,604 --> 00:23:23,529
Why don't you just say it directly.

285
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,938
Director Yin.

286
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:30,646
I'll organize the problems I addressed just now into a report to submit to the board of directors.

287
00:23:30,646 --> 00:23:32,187
No need for you to worry.

288
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:33,829
Alright.

289
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:37,019
Sihan is new to the company.

290
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:41,395
He's looking at a company from a brand new perspective.

291
00:23:41,395 --> 00:23:44,812
I'll know what to do with his suggestions.

292
00:23:44,812 --> 00:23:49,938
Director Yin, you just focus on your opening ceremony.

293
00:23:49,938 --> 00:23:52,103
Don't screw up this time.

294
00:23:52,103 --> 00:23:53,504
Understood.

295
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:57,412
Sihan, I have a new task for you.

296
00:23:57,412 --> 00:23:59,537
What is it?

297
00:23:59,537 --> 00:24:03,938
Recently, I've been studying the Qing harem health treatments,

298
00:24:03,938 --> 00:24:07,019
and I found out that modern skincare products

299
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:11,520
include way too many cancer-causing elements.

300
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,646
It's been a headache.

301
00:24:13,646 --> 00:24:20,045
Therefore, I want to invent 100% natural ingredients skincare products.

302
00:24:20,854 --> 00:24:24,854
Any workable plan?

303
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:26,403
Donghai.

304
00:24:28,979 --> 00:24:34,119
Our cordyceps facial product consist of more cordyceps polysaccharides

305
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,812
which can generate collagen

306
00:24:36,812 --> 00:24:40,287
and can fully prevent the skin from showing signs of early aging.

307
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:45,687
The director hopes to make adjustments based on that foundation

308
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:48,312
to create a an even better product

309
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:52,662
that can strengthen the rejuvenation of skin.

310
00:24:52,662 --> 00:24:55,938
Sihan, biotechnology is your strength.

311
00:24:55,938 --> 00:24:57,829
This task is yours.

312
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,979
I hope you can help me to look into it.

313
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:02,687
Alright, I got it.

314
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:09,087
We shall now proceed with next project.

315
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:10,504
Alright.

316
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:13,662
Sihan.

317
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:15,145
You're still like how you were as a kid.

318
00:25:15,145 --> 00:25:17,019
A busybody and troublesome.

319
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:19,187
I think you're still like how you were as a kid.

320
00:25:19,187 --> 00:25:20,812
Always playing dumb.

321
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:25,379
We won't know who that person is until the very end.

322
00:25:29,162 --> 00:25:32,019
The youngsters nowadays like the concept of microfilms.

323
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:34,437
The investment for ten microfilms is not small.

324
00:25:34,437 --> 00:25:35,579
That's true.

325
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:37,729
So we need to play our cards right.

326
00:25:37,729 --> 00:25:40,120
Director Yin is always bold with his moves.

327
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,229
Lao Liu.

328
00:25:41,229 --> 00:25:43,938
That's both good and bad.

329
00:25:43,938 --> 00:25:47,329
Tiecheng, keep an eye on Director Yin.

330
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:48,787
Don't worry, Chairman.

331
00:25:48,787 --> 00:25:50,595
Alright, you guys can go.

332
00:25:50,595 --> 00:25:52,845
We'll get going then.

333
00:26:17,646 --> 00:26:20,454
Are you alright, Chairman?

334
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:24,229
I'm fine, just feeling a bit dizzy.

335
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:26,620
Do you need to see a doctor?

336
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,746
No, I'm used to it.

337
00:26:28,746 --> 00:26:30,579
I'll be fine after a bit.

338
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:32,920
Let me help you get back to your office.

339
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,812
I heard from Sihan that you were attacked two days ago.

340
00:26:37,812 --> 00:26:41,245
Yes, but I'm fine now.

341
00:26:41,245 --> 00:26:43,771
What happened?

342
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:45,829
I don't know either.

343
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:48,979
I just got attacked out of nowhere.

344
00:26:48,979 --> 00:26:50,729
I suppose it was bad luck.

345
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:55,654
Sihan said that you were wearing the jacket Lan Lan gave to you that day.

346
00:26:56,979 --> 00:27:00,562
She was being really nice to me that day.

347
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:04,829
Maybe I'm just overthinking it.

348
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:08,162
You're a pretty forgiving girl.

349
00:27:08,162 --> 00:27:11,495
No, my father told me

350
00:27:11,495 --> 00:27:14,287
that there are no bad guys in this world.

351
00:27:14,287 --> 00:27:18,620
I'll get someone to investigate this either way.

352
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:22,270
Of course, I also hope that this had nothing to do with Lan Lan.

353
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:27,120
I actually hoped for you two to become god-sisters.

354
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,954
Then Yin Zheng and Sihan's relationship can get better because of you two.

355
00:27:32,954 --> 00:27:35,604
I have no problem with that.

356
00:27:35,604 --> 00:27:39,019
But Lan Lan might not agree to it.

357
00:27:39,746 --> 00:27:41,554
She doesn't like me.

358
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:45,454
I can understand.

359
00:27:45,454 --> 00:27:51,638
Some people don't like that other people have the same face as them.

360
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,029
Perhaps.

361
00:28:01,203 --> 00:28:02,579
We're here.

362
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:03,871
Thank you.

363
00:28:03,871 --> 00:28:05,387
You're welcome.

364
00:28:08,203 --> 00:28:10,704
Are you really going to be fine?

365
00:28:10,704 --> 00:28:12,954
I feel a lot better, thank you.

366
00:28:12,954 --> 00:28:14,203
Then I'll get going first.

367
00:28:14,203 --> 00:28:15,796
Go ahead.

368
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:44,412
Let's cheers for The Secrets of Princess Yuxi.

369
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:45,829
Thanks.

370
00:28:57,329 --> 00:28:59,620
Have you heard about what happened to Zhang Xiao?

371
00:29:00,395 --> 00:29:03,679
She told me when she brought the flowers today.

372
00:29:05,896 --> 00:29:07,829
Kang Sihan came to see me today.

373
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:12,871
He's so sure that she got attacked after exchanging jackets with you.

374
00:29:12,871 --> 00:29:14,746
What is he trying to say?

375
00:29:14,746 --> 00:29:18,038
So every problem that Zhang Xiao runs into has to do with me?

376
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:21,887
So if she trips over her shoelace, was I the one who untied it?

377
00:29:22,871 --> 00:29:25,454
Maybe that's the way he thinks.

378
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,720
Before I forget.

379
00:29:32,245 --> 00:29:34,845
He also gave me this.

380
00:29:39,996 --> 00:29:41,679
Have you seen him before?

381
00:29:44,287 --> 00:29:45,912
He looks familiar.

382
00:29:46,704 --> 00:29:48,019
You know him?

383
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:51,787
He seems to work for your uncle.

384
00:29:51,787 --> 00:29:54,420
I met him at Chairman's birthday celebration.

385
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:58,320
He was there.

386
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:01,487
Why did Kang Sihan give you this?

387
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,662
He suspects he was the one who attacked Zhang Xiao.

388
00:30:08,537 --> 00:30:12,495
Zhang Xiao again.

389
00:30:14,495 --> 00:30:16,271
Alright.

390
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:19,912
We won't talk about her anymore.

391
00:30:19,912 --> 00:30:21,620
I just want to reassure you

392
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,945
that you don't have to hide anything from me.

393
00:30:25,645 --> 00:30:27,771
I want the whole of you

394
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:29,787
not part of you.

395
00:30:34,746 --> 00:30:38,620
Yin Zheng, I love you so much.

396
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,504
I don't want to leave you.

397
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:44,229
I'm so confused now.

398
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:47,520
What's going on with you?

399
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,120
Nothing.

400
00:30:50,495 --> 00:30:52,687
I just don't want to leave you.

401
00:30:55,254 --> 00:30:56,629
Here.

402
00:30:59,162 --> 00:31:00,837
Don't worry.

403
00:31:01,662 --> 00:31:03,912
This is a good opportunity.

404
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:05,537
- You must-
- Yin Zheng.

405
00:31:05,537 --> 00:31:11,012
Do you still remember the neighbor I told you about?

406
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,250
Yes.

407
00:31:13,762 --> 00:31:18,238
I got a call from my mom two days ago.

408
00:31:18,787 --> 00:31:20,780
She said she went missing.

409
00:31:21,354 --> 00:31:28,637
She must've run away from home because she couldn't stand her stepfather's abuse any longer.

410
00:31:30,871 --> 00:31:35,987
But we don't know her wherebouts.

411
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,829
Her life is so sad.

412
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:46,704
I don't know...

413
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:51,170
If she would be forced to sell her body or drug traffic.

414
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:58,971
Yin Zheng, I don't dare to think about it.

415
00:32:00,912 --> 00:32:02,919
I'm so worried.

416
00:32:05,412 --> 00:32:08,287
Why is God being unfair?

417
00:32:09,746 --> 00:32:12,079
Why is she so miserable?

418
00:32:15,162 --> 00:32:17,046
Don't think about it to much.

419
00:32:18,746 --> 00:32:21,662
You said she ran away from home.

420
00:32:21,662 --> 00:32:24,454
It may be a good thing for her.

421
00:32:24,454 --> 00:32:27,787
At least she can get away from her stepfather.

422
00:32:27,787 --> 00:32:29,771
There's an idiom in China.

423
00:32:29,771 --> 00:32:32,062
"Disaster in disguise."

424
00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:38,896
It means after every bad thing follows a good thing.

425
00:32:38,896 --> 00:32:47,454
Then good things can also turn into bad things, right?

426
00:32:48,554 --> 00:32:50,096
Maybe.

427
00:32:52,996 --> 00:32:55,119
I'm really scared.

428
00:32:56,871 --> 00:33:01,038
I'm worried she'll get hurt.

429
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:02,871
Lan Lan.

430
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:05,129
You're acting so strange today.

431
00:33:06,762 --> 00:33:09,162
If it's because of your neighbor,

432
00:33:09,162 --> 00:33:11,262
you don't need to be like this.

433
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:14,370
If it's because of something that happened to you-

434
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,303
Of course it's not.

435
00:33:16,303 --> 00:33:18,212
It's because of her.

436
00:33:19,762 --> 00:33:21,754
I'm worried about her.

437
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,871
Before I forget,

438
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:30,104
I have something for you.

439
00:33:48,704 --> 00:33:50,454
What are you doing?

440
00:33:50,454 --> 00:33:53,579
I'm going to start filming in a few days.

441
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:55,812
It's not safe with me.

442
00:33:56,479 --> 00:34:03,771
I also wish that you can give it to me on a more special occasion.

443
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:05,746
What kind of occasion?

444
00:34:05,746 --> 00:34:09,354
An occasion you will never forget.

445
00:34:11,595 --> 00:34:13,754
Like a proposal?

446
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,587
You know me well.

447
00:34:35,662 --> 00:34:37,554
I have to take this.

448
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,787
Hello?

449
00:34:43,787 --> 00:34:45,179
Yes.

450
00:34:48,262 --> 00:34:49,662
The online ceremony is tomorrow,

451
00:34:49,662 --> 00:34:50,954
and you're just now telling me there's a problem with the location?

452
00:34:50,954 --> 00:34:53,045
Can you even do your job?

453
00:34:56,203 --> 00:34:58,720
I got it, I'll talk to them.

454
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,620
What's wrong?

455
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,929
There's an issue at the company.

456
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:04,529
I'll go and settle it.

457
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:09,254
Wait, keep this.

458
00:35:43,345 --> 00:35:44,979
- Hello?
- Ma Wa.

459
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:46,954
Boss asks how you've been recently.

460
00:36:14,646 --> 00:36:16,537
<i>Mr. Yin Chenggui,</i>

461
00:36:16,537 --> 00:36:19,329
<i>our cooperation ends here.</i>

462
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:22,454
<i>Don't have Han Qing try anything anymore.</i>

463
00:36:22,454 --> 00:36:26,438
<i>I recorded all our conversations.</i>

464
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,495
<i>I trust that you don't want</i>

465
00:36:30,495 --> 00:36:33,254
<i>for these recordings to be heard by Kang Zhentian and Yin Zheng.</i>

466
00:36:34,287 --> 00:36:36,120
<i>About your background,</i>

467
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,662
<i>I prepared a detailed report.</i>

468
00:36:39,662 --> 00:36:42,229
<i>If I show Yin Zheng,</i>

469
00:36:42,229 --> 00:36:45,270
<i>even if he thinks of you as his own father,</i>

470
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,479
<i>he won't trust you anymore.</i>

471
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:50,895
<i>Take care of yourself, Lan.</i>

472
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,646
Nonsense.

473
00:37:24,646 --> 00:37:26,245
Bitch!

474
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:27,462
Not only does she not do as I say,

475
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:30,045
but she's now working against me.

476
00:37:31,162 --> 00:37:33,229
You know what to do.

477
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:36,804
Yes.

478
00:37:38,203 --> 00:37:39,829
Thank you for the hard work.

479
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:41,604
Go and look around the venue.

480
00:37:41,604 --> 00:37:42,854
Alright.

481
00:37:42,854 --> 00:37:43,829
Director Yin.

482
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:47,162
Chairman and all the board members are coming from Zhen Tian.

483
00:37:47,162 --> 00:37:48,912
They'll be here in 40 minutes.

484
00:37:48,912 --> 00:37:50,203
Are all the departments ready?

485
00:37:50,203 --> 00:37:51,938
Make sure everything goes as planned.

486
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:53,062
Everything is ready.

487
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,287
Everyone is already here.

488
00:37:55,996 --> 00:37:58,829
It's just Miss Lan isn't here yet.

489
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:00,554
Are you joking?

490
00:38:09,404 --> 00:38:12,270
- Hello?
- Where are you, Lan Lan?

491
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,554
Reaching the entrance.

492
00:38:14,554 --> 00:38:17,287
There was a lot of traffic.

493
00:38:17,287 --> 00:38:18,303
Okay.

494
00:38:18,303 --> 00:38:19,562
We're just waiting on you.

495
00:38:19,562 --> 00:38:22,162
Alright, see you soon.

496
00:38:22,162 --> 00:38:23,537
Okay.

497
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,540
<i>[Yin Zheng]</i>

498
00:39:15,579 --> 00:39:16,495
Everybody,

499
00:39:16,495 --> 00:39:19,119
the press conference for The Secrets of Yuxi is going to start soon.

500
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,412
Director Yin, the chairman and all our guests are here.

501
00:39:21,412 --> 00:39:22,954
The livestream is also starting soon,

502
00:39:22,954 --> 00:39:25,538
but Miss Lan still isn't here. What do we do?

503
00:39:29,954 --> 00:39:32,038
I can't reach her.

504
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:34,462
She should've been here ten minutes ago.

505
00:39:39,662 --> 00:39:42,138
You can go in from this direction.

506
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:46,579
Follow me, quick!

507
00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:47,562
What are you doing?

508
00:39:47,562 --> 00:39:49,912
- Lan Lan is here.
- What are you doing?

509
00:39:49,912 --> 00:39:51,604
Sit down.

510
00:39:51,604 --> 00:39:53,846
Director Yin, the videographer is waiting for me.

511
00:39:53,846 --> 00:39:55,871
He doesn't know what to shoot if I'm not around.

512
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:57,971
That's no longer important.

513
00:39:57,971 --> 00:40:01,245
The important thing is you need to remember that you are Lan Lan.

514
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:03,203
Director Yin, what are you talking about?

515
00:40:03,203 --> 00:40:04,746
It's an emergency.

516
00:40:04,746 --> 00:40:06,103
Do what I say.

517
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:10,104
Remember to follow my instructions later.

518
00:40:10,954 --> 00:40:12,203
Put this on.

519
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:13,470
Alright.

520
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:15,495
I didn't promise anything.

521
00:40:15,495 --> 00:40:17,662
Did you eat Zhen Tian's employee meals?

522
00:40:17,662 --> 00:40:19,938
You did! So you're Lan Lan.

523
00:40:19,938 --> 00:40:21,954
Quick, put this on.

524
00:40:21,954 --> 00:40:23,604
Faster.

525
00:40:23,604 --> 00:40:24,871
Don't worry.

526
00:40:24,871 --> 00:40:29,746
I'll give you abundant lips and rosy cheeks.

527
00:40:29,746 --> 00:40:32,529
It'll bring you good luck.

528
00:41:21,595 --> 00:41:25,203
Let us welcome The Secrets of Princess Yuxi's producer,

529
00:41:25,203 --> 00:41:27,787
Mr. Yin Zheng, to give a speech.

530
00:41:27,787 --> 00:41:29,896
Let's give a warm welcome.

531
00:41:36,762 --> 00:41:42,720
First, thank you everyone for being part of the launch of The Secrets of Princess Yuxi.

532
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,520
Let us give a loud applause to welcome the female lead, Lan Lan,

533
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,887
and the male lead, Mr. He Kun. Welcome!

534
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:12,145
Be careful.

535
00:42:12,145 --> 00:42:14,871
Miss Lan Lan seems very nervous today.

536
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:18,262
She wants to greet us like how they did in the Qing Dynasty.

537
00:42:21,554 --> 00:42:25,362
This microfilm is Zhen Tian Group's first attempt.

538
00:42:25,362 --> 00:42:28,354
We wish to use this microfilm to witness how Yue-Sai

539
00:42:28,354 --> 00:42:31,687
will lead the traditional Chinese medicine trend

540
00:42:31,687 --> 00:42:34,962
to present the great beauty of China.

541
00:42:40,604 --> 00:42:46,196
We would like to invite both to fill up this champagne tower of success and victory.

542
00:43:04,787 --> 00:43:07,395
We wish for the success of the shooting

543
00:43:07,395 --> 00:43:11,037
and also pre-celebrate the success of Yue-Sai's rainbow bottle product

544
00:43:11,037 --> 00:43:14,119
and the official launch of Youth Skynet.

545
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:24,829

Miss Lan Lan, we know this is your first acting job.

00:43:44,412 --> 00:43:47,619
Are you confident of bringing out the character of Princess Roujia?

I'm confident, very confident.

550
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,412
You look very nervous.

551
00:43:55,412 --> 00:43:56,704
This isn't your usual style.

552
00:43:56,704 --> 00:43:58,804
Can you talk about how you feel?

553
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:02,112
How I feel?

554
00:44:05,662 --> 00:44:09,270
I'm just too excited.

555
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:12,062
I'm too excited, that's why I'm nervous.

556
00:44:12,062 --> 00:44:15,996
Rumors say that you're dating Yin Zheng, the Vice President of Zhen Tian Group.

557
00:44:15,996 --> 00:44:17,120
Is this true?

558
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,579
Yes, please talk about this.

559
00:44:18,579 --> 00:44:19,979

00:44:19,979 --> 00:44:22,787
Say something.

561
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:25,303
Let me answer this question.

562
00:44:25,303 --> 00:44:27,562
I am dating Miss Lan Lan.

563
00:44:27,562 --> 00:44:32,120
What attracts me the most about her is that she has great potential for acting.

564
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,579
Miss Lan Lan, I heard that in the drama you and Prince Xun go through a lot in your relationship.

565
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:36,804
How is your relationship in real life?

566
00:44:36,804 --> 00:44:40,212
Do you and Mr. Yin Zheng have more sweet moments together or the other way around?

567
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:43,262
Of course we have more sweet moments together.

568
00:44:43,262 --> 00:44:45,103
If that's the case, share your sweetness with us.

569
00:44:45,103 --> 00:44:46,920
Yes, let us witness it.

570
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,619
Come on, kiss him.

571
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:53,087
Kiss him!
