00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,620
<i>[Scarlet Heart 2]</i>

2
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:42,980
<i>[Episode 6]</i>

3
00:01:52,732 --> 00:01:55,315
Princess, it's you.

4
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,165
No, I am ghost.

5
00:01:57,165 --> 00:01:59,874
Who else would call you at this time?

6
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:03,499
Why is your face so red?

7
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,257
Is it?

8
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:07,939
Maybe because I just drank some wine.

9
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:09,339
You wicked girl.

10
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:11,666
I'm over here working hard on my thesis

11
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,174
but you're over there enjoying yourself.

12
00:02:14,174 --> 00:02:16,724
There is no justice.

13
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:19,499
So who did you drink with?

14
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:20,832
Tell me.

15
00:02:20,832 --> 00:02:22,499
What's there to tell?

16
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:24,591
He's just an ordinary friend.

17
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:28,566
The more emphasis on the ordinary,

18
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,582
the less ordinary he is.

19
00:02:30,582 --> 00:02:32,791
Come on.

20
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,332
Once bitten twice shy.

21
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:36,666
After Cheater Huang,

22
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,691
I don't want to date.

23
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:42,749
You won't last being alone.

24
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:44,399
What's he like?

25
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:46,799
Do you want me to check him out?

26
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,591
You've always had terrible taste in men.

27
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:52,749
Look at you.

28
00:02:52,749 --> 00:02:54,666
Where's your boyfriend of two years?

29
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,165
I've never even seen him.

30
00:02:56,165 --> 00:02:58,540
Send me a photo.

31
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,607
Fine.

32
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:01,839
He'll blind you.

33
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,590
What is this?

34
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,540
Facing away from the lens.

35
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,315
He doesn't want to show his face because he's ugly right?

36
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:14,832
You must be joking.

37
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:16,399
My baby is very low-key.

38
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,939
He doesn't like taking photos.

39
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:21,040
He said just his back can attract a lot of women.

40
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,215
If he turns around,

41
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:24,832
women all over the world will go crazy for him.

42
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:26,749
I think he's the crazy one.

43
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:28,424
Send me a photo of his face.

44
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:30,582
There's no time.

45
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:32,440
I have to go talk to my professor about my thesis.

46
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,457
Good luck with your friend. Bye.

47
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:43,224
You come and go so quickly.

48
00:04:52,732 --> 00:04:54,332
I am now at the site

49
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:56,399
of Zhen Tian Group's Qing Treasures Auction.

50
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,939
Since a few days before, the auction's only exhibit,

51
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:02,023
the magnolia jade hairpin from Yongzheng's period was unfortunately stolen,

52
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:04,690
it gained antique lovers' attention.

53
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,791
Compared to last year,

54
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,899
this year's auction is extraordinarily lively.

55
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:09,249
There is also a significant increase

56
00:05:09,249 --> 00:05:10,732
of both individual and business participants compared to last year.

57
00:05:10,732 --> 00:05:13,224
It is reported that the success of the auction

58
00:05:13,224 --> 00:05:17,415
has to do with the previously stolen magnolia jade hairpin.

59
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:21,524
Although the stolen jade hairpin is still missing,

60
00:05:21,524 --> 00:05:24,249
the 131 auction items at the auction

61
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:26,123
were all sold at high prices.

62
00:05:26,123 --> 00:05:29,923
It also creates a historical record for autumn auctions.

63
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:39,674
Drink this bowl of ginseng soup while it is still hot.

64
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:42,482
With an untroubled heart,

65
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:47,400
even bread and water can be tasty.

66
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:49,840
With a troubled heart,

67
00:05:50,357 --> 00:05:53,649
delicacies are just like eating wax.

68
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:58,649
The food is cold.

69
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,666
I'll have Aunt Rong heat up the food, okay?

70
00:06:02,415 --> 00:06:05,382
Okay, heat them up for you to eat.

71
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,374
I really have no appetite.

72
00:06:08,374 --> 00:06:10,207
The auction is successful,

73
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:11,999
you should relax a bit.

74
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:14,849
If you continue to be like this, it is not good for your body.

75
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:19,290
Getting back the hairpin is more important than anything right now.

76
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:25,858
The cycle of regaining it and losing it again.

77
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:28,507
This feeling is really upsetting.

78
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:31,399
Since you have lost,

79
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,507
thinking about it is doing nothing.

80
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:36,666
Haven't the police started investigating?

81
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,524
The whole thing will come to light.

82
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,632
I am afraid of the truth.

83
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:42,674
What truth?

84
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:47,707
Is it related to Zheng'er?

85
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,660
How would it be?

86
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,707
I thought about it,

87
00:06:50,707 --> 00:06:52,874
but you're thinking about it more than me.

88
00:06:55,524 --> 00:06:57,082
Please.

89
00:06:57,874 --> 00:07:02,082
Chairman, the police caught the person who stole the hairpin.

90
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:03,123
Who is it?

91
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,165
The Public Security Bureau just faxed this over.

92
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:06,839
It's him.

93
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:11,499
They found him on the cameras.

94
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:14,707
I heard he has a criminal record.

95
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:15,832
Was the hairpin found?

96
00:07:15,832 --> 00:07:17,107
Someone has been sent to find it.

97
00:07:17,107 --> 00:07:19,149
I'm sure we'll hear back soon.

98
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:21,774
Since the police caught the thief,

99
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,874
you can enjoy this meal now.

100
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:26,816
Secretary Hou, sit down and have dinner with us.

101
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:28,107
Madam, I am not free now.

102
00:07:28,107 --> 00:07:29,774
I have to go.

103
00:07:29,774 --> 00:07:31,132
Okay.

104
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:35,939
I want to talk to you about something.

105
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:38,774
The fifth of next month is your sixtieth birthday.

106
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:40,774
How are you going to celebrate?

107
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:43,649
The older I get, the more afraid I am to celebrate my birthday.

108
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:45,190
It means I have one less year of my life.

109
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,040
Zhentian.

110
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,858
I am already sixty years old.

111
00:07:48,858 --> 00:07:51,457
I don't know how many years I left.

112
00:07:51,457 --> 00:07:53,582
Don't think like that.

113
00:07:53,582 --> 00:07:55,799
I am thinking about the company.

114
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:58,916
Don't worry about the company.

115
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,624
I am thinking

116
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:03,540
of how to spend our future time.

117
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,540
After I appoint a successor for the company,

118
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,691
I'll have more time to spend with you.

119
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,332
Well, let's eat.

120
00:08:12,332 --> 00:08:13,758
Okay.

121
00:08:23,682 --> 00:08:24,582
What happened?

122
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:26,390
It's you?

123
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:29,165
Black Cat Detective.

124
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:31,839
What happened to you?

125
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,540
It's out of electricity.

126
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,749
Get in the car, I'll take you.

127
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,707
Then I accept your offer.

128
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:39,140
Thank you so much.

129
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,274
Is my office on the way?

130
00:08:52,274 --> 00:08:55,023
Yes, don't worry.

131
00:08:55,023 --> 00:08:56,858
Thank you.

132
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:57,939
You are welcome.

133
00:08:57,939 --> 00:09:00,174
This is the company's car anyways.

134
00:09:02,874 --> 00:09:05,649
What does your boss look like?

135
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:08,839
Is he a bald old man?

136
00:09:10,357 --> 00:09:13,607
My boss is pretty good-looking.

137
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:15,249
He can be considered a handsome guy.

138
00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:16,440
Really?

139
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,691
Why? You don't believe me?

140
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:22,499
I can't find his photo in the internet.

141
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:26,165
If he is a handsome guy, he is too low-key.

142
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,880
He's usually low-key.

143
00:09:29,457 --> 00:09:32,840
It's like you're saying he's perfect.

144
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:35,965
He's not bad. Let's go.

145
00:09:50,982 --> 00:09:52,457
Thank you.

146
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:56,590
You already said thank you so many times this morning.

147
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,365
Bye.

148
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:36,207
Director Yin. The scapegoat has been caught.

149
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:37,499
When?

150
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:39,040
Last night.

151
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,249
The Public Security Bureau faxed his photo to Secretary Hou.

152
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:44,223
What else?

153
00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:07,415
Yes, it is the hairpin.

154
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:09,649
I'll go back with you to close the case.

155
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:11,399
- Okay.
- Please.

156
00:11:20,274 --> 00:11:22,499
I think they found the fake hairpin.

157
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,832
It may have already been taken to the chairman.

158
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:26,190
What was his reaction when he saw it?

159
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,607
I'm not sure yet.

160
00:11:27,607 --> 00:11:30,065
But I'll inform you as soon as I hear.

161
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,482
Okay.

162
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,016
Good morning, Director Yin.

163
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:42,430
Why are you still working here?

164
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,216
How many benefits are you getting from the chairman?

165
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,639
Director Yin,

166
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,374
the chairman didn't give me any benefits.

167
00:11:51,374 --> 00:11:52,858
Please don't worry.

168
00:11:52,858 --> 00:11:54,290
After the police closes the case,

169
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,257
I will resign.

170
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:03,624
Ice face.

171
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:07,549
Chairman,

172
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:11,190
a photo of Director Yin and the thief has been spreading on the internet.

173
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,624
The media suspects that the stealing of the hairpin

174
00:12:12,624 --> 00:12:15,707
is Zhen Tian Group's internal embezzlement.

175
00:12:15,707 --> 00:12:18,390
I forwarded the photo to your inbox.

176
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,374
You can have a look.

177
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:29,732
Zhentian, what's wrong?

178
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:30,732
Uncomfortable again?

179
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:33,210
Aunt Rong, get me his heart pills.

180
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,482
Are you okay?

181
00:12:34,482 --> 00:12:35,940
I am fine.

182
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:01,666
Assistant Qiao,

183
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,923
come to my office immediately.

184
00:13:04,457 --> 00:13:05,866
Director Yin.

185
00:13:07,107 --> 00:13:08,732
I used my internal connections

186
00:13:08,732 --> 00:13:10,691
to hold down the major media.

187
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:13,290
The Weibo posts are starting to get deleted.

188
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,732
Tomorrow, we'll hold a press conference

189
00:13:15,732 --> 00:13:18,939
to issue a public statement and clarify the matter as rumors.

190
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:21,165
I have written the manuscript for you.

191
00:13:21,165 --> 00:13:23,582
I believe this thing will soon be able to quell.

192
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:25,466
You don't have to worry too much.

193
00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:28,082
Thank you.

194
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:29,207
You are welcome.

195
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:31,299
It's my job.

196
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:34,816
There are still some risks with this.

197
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,082
I don't want to drag you into this thing.

198
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,832
Don't say that.

199
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:41,116
You helped me stay afloat a few years ago.

200
00:13:41,116 --> 00:13:43,749
I'm afraid I won't ever be able to repay you.

201
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:45,582
I feel more at ease

202
00:13:45,582 --> 00:13:47,715
now that I can do something for you.

203
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,407
I still feel a little uneasy

204
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:52,499
to involve you into this matter.

205
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,090
I know that it's difficult for you.

206
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,099
Director Yin,

207
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:57,357
please don't say that.

208
00:13:57,357 --> 00:14:00,649
I'm just worried I can't do everything you ask well.

209
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:04,332
But, it is absolutely not difficult for me.

210
00:14:04,332 --> 00:14:06,166
I just think

211
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,266
that Zhang Xiao will suffer quite a bit due to this.

212
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,707
They found the thief who stole the hairpin,

213
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:18,599
and it can prove Zhang Xiao innocent.

214
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,524
Although I don't hate her,

215
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:23,224
I still don't want her to stay in the company.

216
00:14:23,224 --> 00:14:25,707
I suspect she works for the chairman.

217
00:14:25,707 --> 00:14:28,866
I'm still unable to figure her out.

218
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:30,649
I understand.

219
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:32,357
But you should prepare

220
00:14:32,357 --> 00:14:35,149
for what you're going to say to the chairman later.

221
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:37,315
Don't worry. There won't be a problem for me.

222
00:14:37,315 --> 00:14:39,923
Okay, then I'll go now.

223
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:07,916
I just want to know where the real hairpin is.

224
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,540
That's what I'm trying to explain to you.

225
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,916
I really don't know about the hairpin's whereabouts.

226
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:14,832
Lie.

227
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:16,974
I'm not lying.

228
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:19,899
I did instruct someone to steal the hairpin,

229
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:21,816
but he disappeared after he succeeded.

230
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:24,249
I've been looking for him too.

231
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:27,040
I previously promised to give him 100,000.

232
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,357
I guess he wants more.

233
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:32,249
I suspect he is now going to sell the hairpin.

234
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:34,774
But I have no idea whether he sold it or not yet.

235
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:36,499
I can't believe you would do such a thing

236
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:38,582
to create buzz for the auction.

237
00:15:38,582 --> 00:15:42,082
Do you know the consequences if this gets out?

238
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:44,082
I will take responsibility for this.

239
00:15:44,082 --> 00:15:45,790
How will you take responsibility?

240
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,858
Do you want me to send you to jail?

241
00:15:47,858 --> 00:15:51,466
To let your mom feel sad and worry about you every day?

242
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:53,640
Or do you think that I wouldn't dare to do anything to you

243
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,666
because of your mom?

244
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,832
Is this your way of trying to avenge me?

245
00:16:00,832 --> 00:16:03,532
I am now just thinking of how to solve this.

246
00:16:04,557 --> 00:16:06,999
I will take care of the crisis management.

247
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,280
I believe that the situation will get better tomorrow.

248
00:16:09,874 --> 00:16:13,332
The public opinion of us is very unfavorable.

249
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:16,149
How much impact will this butterfly effect have?

250
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:17,832
No one knows.

251
00:16:17,832 --> 00:16:20,658
You are playing with fire.

252
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:24,749
Chairman,

253
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:27,065
I will accept your punishment.

254
00:16:27,065 --> 00:16:29,082
I will bear the consequences of my own acts.

255
00:16:29,082 --> 00:16:32,999
I will clean up this mess myself.

256
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:36,123
I will let the public point their opinions to me alone

257
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:39,474
to minimize the group's losses.

258
00:16:39,474 --> 00:16:41,249
The only thing I'm unable to do for you

259
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:43,616
is to get back the real hairpin.

260
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,799
I don't expect your forgiveness,

261
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:49,432
but I just want to tell you,

262
00:16:50,624 --> 00:16:52,899
I am really sorry.

263
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:54,374
Stop.

264
00:16:54,374 --> 00:16:56,815
I want you to pay for this.

265
00:17:01,557 --> 00:17:03,415
Excuse me.

266
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:05,465
Right?

267
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,257
It's true.

268
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,165
Zhang Xiao.

269
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,582
You are innocent.

270
00:17:14,582 --> 00:17:16,149
You are innocent, Zhang Xiao.

271
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:17,399
What happened?

272
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:19,415
They found the thief who stole the hairpin.

273
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:21,332
You are fine now.

274
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,374
Really?

275
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,040
You'll have to treat us to a meal this afternoon.

276
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,415
Of course.

277
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:26,940
Who stole the hairpin?

278
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,032
Haven't you heard?

279
00:17:28,032 --> 00:17:31,207
Director Yin got a professional thief to steal it.

280
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:33,999
This is embezzlement.

281
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:35,832
Don't say that so loud.

282
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:37,774
The company seems to be looking for ways

283
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:39,274
to deal with this matter.

284
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:42,499
Are you trying to get in trouble talking about it so loudly?

285
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:44,424
Dismiss.

286
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:45,939
Okay, let's go.

287
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,399
You're fine.

288
00:17:54,332 --> 00:17:57,499
The board has made a decision

289
00:17:57,499 --> 00:18:00,107
regarding the stolen hairpin.

290
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:03,207
Yin Zheng, vice president of Zhen Tian Group

291
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,391
has to assume full responsibility.

292
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:08,457
No bonuses

293
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:11,558
and all year-end prizes are withheld.

294
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,858
From today on, you'll leave Beijing headquarters

295
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:20,624
and act as the general manager at the group's Lancheng branch Biochemistry Department.

296
00:18:20,624 --> 00:18:22,882
Anything you want to say?

297
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,465
Chairman,

298
00:18:27,624 --> 00:18:30,107
I request to stay in Beijing headquarters.

299
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:33,123
I'm willing to accept all the other penalties.

300
00:18:33,123 --> 00:18:36,457
It is the board's decision to have you go to Lancheng.

301
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:40,749
All directors,

302
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:44,149
I am willing to pay any price to stay here.

303
00:18:48,832 --> 00:18:51,374
Since you wish to stay,

304
00:18:51,374 --> 00:18:54,140
I will give you a chance to stay.

305
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:57,666
As your father,

306
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,023
as the chairman of the group,

307
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:03,832
I want you to stand at the entrance of the Zhen Tian building

308
00:19:03,832 --> 00:19:08,107
and bow and apologize to our 3,700 employees.

309
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:11,823
You won't be able do it.

310
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,840
I hope you will reflect on today's results.

311
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,340
Go pack your things.

312
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,039
I booked your flight for the day after tomorrow.

313
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,407
Chairman.

314
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:34,099
I came prepared to face anything.

315
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:38,299
You are the chairman and I am a subordinate.

316
00:19:38,939 --> 00:19:42,732
I will do as you say.

317
00:19:49,874 --> 00:19:51,874
I hope you won't change your mind.

318
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,666
Zhang Xiao.

319
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,249
Come on, let's go and take a look.

320
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:13,940
What are we looking at?

321
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,816
You will know after you see.

322
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:17,515
Excuse me.

323
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,932
Look.

324
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:26,707
I feel bad for Director Yin.

325
00:20:26,707 --> 00:20:29,566
He did this to himself.

326
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:30,666
Did you hear?

327
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:34,332
Director Yin and the chairman's relationship has always been pretty bad.

328
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:36,732
Chairman is his stepfather.

329
00:20:36,732 --> 00:20:38,816
I heard that before his father death,

330
00:20:38,816 --> 00:20:40,999
his father and the chairman were good friends.

331
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:44,274
I heard that Zhen Tian Group's initial principal

332
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:47,257
was the money left by Director Yin's father.

333
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:49,123
Director Yin was still young at the time

334
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,916
and the chairman had custody.

335
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,607
So he used the money to invest into real estate.

336
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:55,916
He made ten times the money in a short period of time.

337
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,232
That's how Zhen Tian Group was born.

338
00:20:58,232 --> 00:21:00,399
Chairman is really cruel.

339
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:03,791
It is a big shame for Director Yin.

340
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:08,732
<i>So he saddles heavy burden left by the previous generation.</i>

341
00:21:14,832 --> 00:21:17,765
Be careful when you talk behind people's backs.

342
00:21:17,765 --> 00:21:19,223
You're talking about the chairman behind his back.

343
00:21:19,223 --> 00:21:20,974
Do you still want your job?

344
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:42,340
The chairman probably did this to destroy Director Yin's arrogance.

345
00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:06,732
Chairman.

346
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,207
Zhang Xiao, I was looking for you.

347
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:13,582
You were wrongly accused.

348
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,840
I hope you can forgive Yin Zheng.

349
00:22:18,374 --> 00:22:19,807
In fact,

350
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:22,374
I can understand Director Yin's overall approach.

351
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:25,730
He did this for the auction.

352
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,415
Although it was a bit extreme and caused adverse effects,

353
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:32,574
his intentions were for the interests of the company.

354
00:22:33,223 --> 00:22:35,340
You still speak positively of him.

355
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:38,907
Everyone makes mistakes.

356
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:43,140
Maybe he just needed to sacrifice me

357
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,382
to take control of the overall situation.

358
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:08,215
<i>Every father has it hard.</i>

359
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:15,099
Director Yin is so smart.

360
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:18,490
He will understand your good intentions.

361
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:24,024
Not everyone endowed with wisdom like you.

362
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,823
Go do your work.

363
00:23:58,607 --> 00:24:00,732
I don't need any sympathy.

364
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:02,032
Go.

365
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:09,499
I am not qualified to sympathize with you.

366
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:13,691
I am here because you visited me in the hospital.

367
00:24:16,082 --> 00:24:18,082
I don't think

368
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:21,040
you need to be so callous.

369
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,399
- You don't have to be so-
- You're so full of yourself.

370
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,499
Do you really think you understand others?

371
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:30,791
Although it's embarrassing for me to stand here,

372
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:34,582
no one is qualified to talk to me.

373
00:24:34,582 --> 00:24:35,965
Go.

374
00:24:39,457 --> 00:24:42,249
I just know you are an ordinary person.

375
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:44,432
A man of flesh and blood.

376
00:24:45,223 --> 00:24:47,640
You don't need to try to be brave here.

377
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:21,730
♫ <i>Stars are always glittering in the sky</i> ♫

378
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:25,215
Go to the place where there is scarcity of water,

379
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:28,116
sit and watch the clouds rise.

380
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:36,023
♫ <i>I'm always in this gray area</i> ♫

381
00:25:36,023 --> 00:25:39,040
Director Yin, Chairman has agreed to let you go in to avoid the rain.

382
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,899
Go inside.

383
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:43,107
Help me thank him for his kindness.

384
00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:44,290
Director Yin, don't be stubborn.

385
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,390
You will get sick. Let's go inside.

386
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,582
He asked me to stand here to have everyone see me as a joke.

387
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:55,557
If I go in to avoid the rain, everyone will despise me even more.

388
00:25:55,557 --> 00:25:57,107
You all go.

389
00:25:58,499 --> 00:26:00,090
Go.

390
00:26:00,774 --> 00:26:03,940
If we wanted to see you as a joke, we've already seen enough.

391
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,791
No one is going to watch you from the window the entire day.

392
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:08,774
The chairman has allowed you to go in,

393
00:26:08,774 --> 00:26:10,732
but you are still innocently standing here.

394
00:26:10,732 --> 00:26:12,691
Now that's a big joke.

395
00:26:12,691 --> 00:26:15,266
You are not qualified to say that to me.

396
00:26:16,939 --> 00:26:18,582
I will leave,

397
00:26:18,582 --> 00:26:20,416
but I want to finish my words.

398
00:26:21,624 --> 00:26:26,149
An angel and a devil coexists in a the human's heart.

399
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:31,832
But I hope you know that there are more good people in this world.

400
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:35,799
I hope the demon in your heart disappears soon.

401
00:26:42,415 --> 00:26:48,374
♫ <i>My love is like dust, scattered in the border zone</i> ♫

402
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:50,982
Director Yin, go inside.

403
00:26:51,624 --> 00:26:53,760
Go in.

404
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,390
Go.

405
00:26:56,499 --> 00:27:03,557
♫ <i>A promise is like dust, constantly being buried in time</i> ♫

406
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:19,407
♫ <i>Who stills remember the confession made in heavy rain? ♫</i>

407
00:27:53,165 --> 00:27:56,024
They're together.

408
00:28:01,566 --> 00:28:04,166
Go back and take a hot bath.

409
00:28:05,123 --> 00:28:06,432
Drive faster.

410
00:28:06,432 --> 00:28:08,682
Otherwise, you'll catch a cold.

411
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,249
Drink it first.

412
00:28:20,315 --> 00:28:22,874
Whenever I got a fever when I was a kid,

413
00:28:22,874 --> 00:28:26,107
my mother would make a brown sugar ginger tea for me.

414
00:28:26,107 --> 00:28:27,674
Me too.

415
00:28:38,858 --> 00:28:42,807
During my childhood, my mother was my only family.

416
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:47,157
Ever since she married the old man,

417
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,424
I was always worried that she would leave me.

418
00:28:52,374 --> 00:28:55,490
Then I would live like a wretch who's always depending on others.

419
00:28:56,249 --> 00:28:58,832
I lived in fear.

420
00:28:58,832 --> 00:29:01,566
I feared that people would take away all my stuff.

421
00:29:04,249 --> 00:29:06,332
I understand how you feel.

422
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:08,840
You don't understand.

423
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:12,358
You grew up in a happy family.

424
00:29:13,123 --> 00:29:15,507
You wouldn't understand how I feel.

425
00:29:16,065 --> 00:29:17,520
No,

426
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,200
I understand.

427
00:29:22,566 --> 00:29:26,782
Do you still remember my neighbor that I told you about?

428
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:30,207
Every time she played with me,

429
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:32,682
she would told me her stories.

430
00:29:32,682 --> 00:29:36,832
One time, she came to my room after she got abused by her stepfather.

431
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:40,132
I wanted to protect her.

432
00:29:40,832 --> 00:29:43,023
But when night time came,

433
00:29:43,023 --> 00:29:45,490
her stepfather would always take her away.

434
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:50,491
I really wanted to help her.

435
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:54,449
But I was too weak at that time.

436
00:29:56,832 --> 00:29:59,199
I hate myself.

437
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,523
I really hate myself.

438
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:12,324
You really are a very kind person.

439
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:14,916
But there are a lot of areas

440
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:17,399
where we are unable to help.

441
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,107
It seems that we only look strong.

442
00:30:31,332 --> 00:30:35,582
No, you're different from me.

443
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,024
You are able to protect me.

444
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:43,165
Last time when you took me back to the hotel,

445
00:30:43,165 --> 00:30:45,739
I knew that it would be difficult for me to find another person who could understand me as well as you do.

446
00:30:51,707 --> 00:30:53,040
I...

447
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,257
I can't lose you.

448
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:16,007
I've never seen a girl who could drink a large cup of coffee

449
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,123
after eating a lot of hot pot.

450
00:31:19,123 --> 00:31:20,874
Food digestion.

451
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:24,232
I'll give you a word of advice.

452
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,732
I look for her in vain.

453
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:29,999
When I turn my head,

454
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:32,649
I found her around the rice buckets.

455
00:31:34,732 --> 00:31:36,639
Are you a rice bucket?

456
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:42,666
You can eat so much.

457
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:44,023
are you falling out of love?

458
00:31:44,023 --> 00:31:45,990
Break my heart?

459
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,090
No.

460
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:54,315
I got into a car accident three months ago.

461
00:31:54,315 --> 00:31:57,315
After that, everything hasn't been going so smoothly.

462
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:00,566
I even lost some memories.

463
00:32:00,566 --> 00:32:02,457
And then?

464
00:32:02,457 --> 00:32:04,199
And then...

465
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:07,939
Why do you want to know so much about me?

466
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:10,607
I want to know everything about you.

467
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:20,249
I am a curious person.

468
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,299
Are you working at Zhen Tian Group?

469
00:32:26,082 --> 00:32:27,399
Yes.

470
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:32,290
Then you should know Yin Zheng.

471
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,965
You know him?

472
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:40,582
Crown prince of Zhen Tian Group.

473
00:32:40,582 --> 00:32:42,382
Everyone knows.

474
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:49,707
What do you think of him?

475
00:32:52,207 --> 00:32:54,182
I feel...

476
00:32:55,749 --> 00:32:57,466
I feel bad for him.

477
00:32:58,415 --> 00:33:02,074
He doesn't know that he's being controlled by the demon inside his heart.

478
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,165
Why do you think so?

479
00:33:07,165 --> 00:33:08,650
Intuition.

480
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,260
Woman's intuition.

481
00:33:14,374 --> 00:33:15,749
Come, let's go.

482
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:17,249
Where are we going?

483
00:33:17,249 --> 00:33:20,123
A person with strong intuition should have a good sense of smell.

484
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,424
Let's go.

485
00:33:24,249 --> 00:33:25,449
Come.

486
00:33:27,457 --> 00:33:29,749
Shops are closed. Why are we here?

487
00:33:29,749 --> 00:33:32,007
Let's go.

488
00:33:36,791 --> 00:33:39,290
Z&X.

489
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,549
Come.

490
00:33:44,624 --> 00:33:46,215
Feel free.

491
00:33:52,832 --> 00:33:54,791
We came here so late.

492
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:57,799
Will your boss fire you if he finds out?

493
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:00,899
It's okay. The store hasn't opened yet.

494
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:03,774
No? When does it open?

495
00:34:03,774 --> 00:34:05,839
Next week, November 22nd.

496
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,540
Really?

497
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,290
That's my birthday.

498
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,599
Such a coincidence.

499
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,223
Really?

500
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,840
Then pick something.

501
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,482
A birthday gift from me.

502
00:34:19,482 --> 00:34:22,374
No, how can I just pick?

503
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:23,249
If your boss finds out-

504
00:34:23,249 --> 00:34:24,958
Don't worry.

505
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:27,340
I will pay my boss.

506
00:34:29,607 --> 00:34:31,249
Come, this way.

507
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:33,174
Just pick.

508
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:36,674
Thank you.

509
00:34:40,482 --> 00:34:41,874
Say.

510
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:44,816
When did perfumes get invented?

511
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,499
Perfume.

512
00:34:47,499 --> 00:34:49,082
It derives from Latin,

513
00:34:49,082 --> 00:34:51,440
meaning passing through smoke.

514
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,899
The Romans believed

515
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:55,707
that if the incense smoke of the worship goddess gets interrupted,

516
00:34:55,707 --> 00:34:58,415
the entire Rome will fall into the abyss of hell.

517
00:34:58,415 --> 00:35:00,040
Therefore, there was a group of female followers

518
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,432
that dedicated their lives to maintaining the incense smoke.

519
00:35:04,432 --> 00:35:08,899
Egypt's history of using perfume can be traced back to around 3000 BC.

520
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:13,358
The earliest human invention of perfume was invented by Egyptians.

521
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:17,415
However, due to the refined method of high purity alcohol not having been invented yet,

522
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:21,165
their perfume was actually fragrant oil.

523
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:23,899
It was specially manufactured by priests and pharaohs.

524
00:35:23,899 --> 00:35:27,265
Persian perfume is particularly interesting.

525
00:35:27,265 --> 00:35:30,832
In the palace, the emperor is the most fragrant.

526
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:33,466
Because he is the symbol of identity and status.

527
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:37,039
During Queen Elizabeth rule in Britain,

528
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:40,207
there was a bottle of with alcohol from Hungary,

529
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:43,482
which was later officially known as perfume.

530
00:35:48,165 --> 00:35:51,190
You are simply a perfume encyclopedia.

531
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,349
My job is related to this.

532
00:35:54,132 --> 00:35:58,774
But you know so much.

533
00:35:58,774 --> 00:36:02,315
You can be a perfumer

534
00:36:02,315 --> 00:36:05,916
or an aroma researcher.

535
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,582
Long way to go.

536
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:11,090
I'm just getting started.

537
00:36:15,082 --> 00:36:18,716
Why do you choose this job?

538
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:22,624
Because I think

539
00:36:22,624 --> 00:36:25,432
perfume can relax a person's mood.

540
00:36:25,432 --> 00:36:27,649
And help you forget about unpleasant things.

541
00:36:27,649 --> 00:36:29,432
Hearing you say that,

542
00:36:29,432 --> 00:36:32,858
your career is quite interesting.

543
00:36:33,832 --> 00:36:38,207
I actually don't really know much about your industry.

544
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:41,524
If you want a perfume to sooth someone,

545
00:36:41,524 --> 00:36:46,540
does a perfumer need to have sad experiences

546
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,315
in order to modulate an aroma

547
00:36:49,315 --> 00:36:52,199
to make people feel good?

548
00:36:53,624 --> 00:36:55,799
Perhaps.

549
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:59,624
When a person has sad experiences,

550
00:36:59,624 --> 00:37:04,390
he will better understand the needs to regulate mood.

551
00:37:11,832 --> 00:37:17,165
You have quite a lot up your sleeve.

552
00:37:17,165 --> 00:37:19,440
Thank you for the compliment.

553
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:23,666
In fact, putting on perfume in the English language is called "wearing perfume".

554
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:25,290
Which means to wear.

555
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:28,566
Aroma is like invisible underwear.

556
00:37:28,566 --> 00:37:32,282
The more exquisite woman knows more on picking lingerie.

557
00:37:35,058 --> 00:37:37,107
Unfortunately,

558
00:37:37,107 --> 00:37:40,765
I am not an exquisite woman.

559
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:44,666
But some women

560
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:48,466
are very pure and kind hearted.

561
00:37:48,982 --> 00:37:54,874
They use their intuitive feeling to pick perfume.

562
00:37:54,874 --> 00:37:56,632
Do you believe me?

563
00:37:56,632 --> 00:37:59,558
I can guess what kind of perfume you prefer.

564
00:38:00,457 --> 00:38:02,165
Really?

565
00:38:02,165 --> 00:38:04,207
Why don't we do an experiment?

566
00:38:04,207 --> 00:38:05,499
Okay.

567
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,940
Now the experiment starts.

568
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:13,916
I have written down the aromas that I think you will like on this card.

569
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,916
Now it is the time for you to choose.

570
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:17,665
Choose three.

571
00:38:37,457 --> 00:38:39,532
Choose carefully.

572
00:38:40,607 --> 00:38:44,249
Now it's time for me to reveal my answers.

573
00:38:44,249 --> 00:38:46,165
See for yourself.

574
00:38:51,982 --> 00:38:55,349
You're amazing.

575
00:38:56,858 --> 00:38:59,039
Do you like it here?

576
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,023
Yes.

577
00:39:00,023 --> 00:39:03,340
Since you like it here,

578
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,949
hopefully this place can become a good place for you to relax.

579
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:11,582
Remember to come often.

580
00:39:18,249 --> 00:39:22,549
ZX, happy birthday.

581
00:39:28,357 --> 00:39:29,899
Thank you.

582
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:36,774
I also wish for the business of Z&X to boom.

583
00:40:07,123 --> 00:40:09,591
<i>Why did he give me balloons?</i>

584
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:13,440
<i>Why did I grab his hand?</i>

585
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:17,939
<i>What happened between me and him?</i>

586
00:40:17,939 --> 00:40:19,749
<i>If we know each other,</i>

587
00:40:19,749 --> 00:40:22,249
<i>why are we so unfamiliar?</i>

588
00:40:24,582 --> 00:40:26,507
<i>Why?</i>

589
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:50,357
Lan Lan.

590
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,323
Good morning.

591
00:40:53,223 --> 00:40:54,107
Good morning.

592
00:40:54,107 --> 00:40:56,540
Try my breakfast.

593
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,374
You're usually alone with no one to take care of you.

594
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:02,174
Do you feel the feeling of happiness now?

595
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,582
Eat up.

596
00:41:05,582 --> 00:41:08,899
Don't you have a press conference later?

597
00:41:31,624 --> 00:41:33,949
I've never given you a gift.

598
00:41:35,415 --> 00:41:40,216
Consider this magnolia hairpin our token of love.

599
00:41:43,682 --> 00:41:47,791
I didn't just keep this hairpin

600
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:51,115
to create buzz for the auction.

601
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:56,110
It's also because the first time I saw your magnolia tattoo,

602
00:41:56,916 --> 00:42:01,382
I thought it belongs to you.

603
00:42:04,249 --> 00:42:07,324
What? You don't like it?

604
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,440
No, I like it.

605
00:42:15,415 --> 00:42:17,415
It's just so sudden.

606
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:20,540
This hairpin is too precious.

607
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,039
I am a bit...

608
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,082
Fate brought you to me,

609
00:42:25,082 --> 00:42:29,482
and also found this hairpin its owner.

610
00:42:29,482 --> 00:42:31,165
Why?

611
00:42:36,165 --> 00:42:38,123
25 years ago,

612
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:40,207
the old man and my father

613
00:42:40,207 --> 00:42:42,832
went to Ganlin on an expedition

614
00:42:42,832 --> 00:42:44,758
to find the legendary treasure box of Yongzhong.

615
00:42:45,707 --> 00:42:50,339
This magnolia hairpin was inside that box.

616
00:42:50,874 --> 00:42:54,299
Unfortunately, that adventure ended in tragedy.

617
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,624
My father died

618
00:42:57,624 --> 00:43:01,723
and that treasure box was once again buried in the sand.

619
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:06,357
Until a month ago,

620
00:43:06,357 --> 00:43:11,432
the old man knew found out about this magnolia hairpin from others.

621
00:43:11,432 --> 00:43:13,916
He used a very high price to buy it back

622
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:17,940
to exhibit it as the treasure of this auction.

623
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:22,457
If it wasn't for the trip he took 25 years ago,

624
00:43:22,457 --> 00:43:25,623
he wouldn't be so fond of this hairpin.

625
00:43:25,623 --> 00:43:28,874
He also wouldn't care so much about the auction.

626
00:43:28,874 --> 00:43:34,457
And I wouldn't have gone to the Qing Treasures Exhibition

627
00:43:34,457 --> 00:43:37,016
where I met you for the first time.

628
00:43:39,582 --> 00:43:41,732
If I didn't go to the museum,

629
00:43:41,732 --> 00:43:44,290
I wouldn't have gotten the idea to have a survival show competition,

630
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:47,107
and we wouldn't have met for the second time.

631
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:56,290
This hairpin is like a road sign to us.

632
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:59,307
I has significant meaning for the old man.

633
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,299
And for me as well.

634
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:07,082
Therefore, I kept it to give it to you.

635
00:44:09,165 --> 00:44:11,491
I'll only think its safe

636
00:44:12,332 --> 00:44:14,523
if it's kept by your side.

637
00:44:19,165 --> 00:44:20,858
Why are you crying?

638
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,707
Fool, don't cry.
