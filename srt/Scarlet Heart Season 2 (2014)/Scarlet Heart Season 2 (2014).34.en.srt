<i>[Episode 34]</i>

3
00:01:45,754 --> 00:01:48,495
Mom, Zhang Xiao went to Yunnan.

4
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:51,620
She wants to help Meng Xinyi fulfill the two wishes she had when she was still alive.

5
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,203
I want to go back to see my dad first.

6
00:01:53,203 --> 00:01:54,787
Then I'll go find her, okay?

7
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:56,103
Don't worry about your dad.

8
00:01:56,103 --> 00:01:57,495
I'm taking care of him.

9
00:01:57,495 --> 00:01:59,829
Zhang Xiao is a girl out there all on her own.

10
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,329
She's also emotionally unstable right now.

11
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,746
What if something happens to her?

12
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:06,562
Go find her now.

13
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:09,595
That's also your dad's wish.

14
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,079
Alright.

15
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:14,479
Mom, if anything happens at home,

16
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,938
remember to tell me.

17
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:18,462
Okay.

18
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,038
Siyu, where have you been all day?

19
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:42,179
You should go. Don't be late for your flight back to Beijing.

20
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:45,437
Mom just called me.

21
00:02:45,437 --> 00:02:47,062
She said Dad is very worried about Zhang Xiao.

22
00:02:47,062 --> 00:02:49,604
She wants me to go find her.

23
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:51,846
You're going to find Zhang Xiao?

24
00:02:54,203 --> 00:02:56,712
Is it only because Dad misses her?

25
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:00,446
Not exactly.

26
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:10,062
I can't believe Zhang Xiao made her way through all three of us brothers.

27
00:03:10,062 --> 00:03:12,838
Now it's finally your turn.

28
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:16,596
Brother, what are you trying to say?

29
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:24,619
Where is Ma Yinuo?

30
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,596
She left last night.

31
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:31,254
Brother.

32
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,579
I know you've been through a lot.

33
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,962
But having so much hate in your heart doesn't solve anything.

34
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:41,520
I don't know what kind of person Ma Yinuo is,

35
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,320
but I do feel that she really loves you.

36
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:49,271
Brother, don't fight with Big Brother anymore, okay?

37
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,120
Take a look.

38
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,580
<i>[Kang Sihan's memorial service will be held the day after tomorrow.]</i>

39
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,329
You're asking me to stop fighting with him?

40
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:06,812
He's using my memorial service to climb up the ranks and win over the hearts of the people at the company.

41
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:10,854
Do you think I can let someone like him off?

42
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:20,562
Alright, I got it, Brother.

43
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,146
Take good care of yourself.

44
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:30,562
Why aren't any of you saying anything?

45
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,662
Am I the only one with ideas?

46
00:04:32,662 --> 00:04:33,979
If you're all acting like this,

47
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:37,646
how are we going to come up with a plan to advertise Yue-Sai's new product?

48
00:04:37,646 --> 00:04:39,020
Am I right?

49
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:42,579
Chairman.

50
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:45,771
Chairman, we're having a meeting right now.

51
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:48,179
Do you have any interest to join?

52
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:53,454
Chairman.

53
00:04:53,454 --> 00:04:54,987
Take your seats.

54
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,270
What are you guys talking about?

55
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,996
Chairman, since the company just had a major blow,

56
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:05,162
we're coming up with new ideas to advertise for Yue-Sai.

57
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:07,740
Especially this custom formula.

58
00:05:08,412 --> 00:05:10,203
Also,

59
00:05:10,203 --> 00:05:11,787
these are our designs.

60
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:13,220
Take a look.

61
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,370
Chairman, we will focus on these points.

62
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:24,620
And we'll keep using Princess Yuxi.

63
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,612
This can deepen our target audience's impression on our products.

64
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:35,229
<i>Looking back on my life,</i>

65
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:37,310
<i>I missed a lot of precious moments in my life</i>

66
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,379
<i>because I was blinded by revenge.</i>

67
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:46,187
<i>Family, love.</i>

68
00:05:46,187 --> 00:05:48,437
<i>If I want to start fresh,</i>

69
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:50,796
<i>then I need to stop rushing my way through life</i>

70
00:05:50,796 --> 00:05:55,912
<i>and ask myself what I want in life.</i>

71
00:05:56,938 --> 00:06:00,580
Chairman.

72
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:04,579
I offered my ideas.

73
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:06,600
Can you give me some suggestions?

74
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,962
What do you want in life?

75
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:11,329
Sorry, can you say that again?

76
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,429
Our topic will be "What you want in life."

77
00:06:14,429 --> 00:06:17,162
At least with the music video,

78
00:06:17,996 --> 00:06:21,219
we want to convey the idea that people tend to get lost in life.

79
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:23,687
They chase after imaginary desires.

80
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:26,019
I hope to use this music video

81
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:29,229
to tell people to give up on their delusions

82
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:31,379
and seek the beautiful things in life.

83
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,104
Yes, that's great.

84
00:06:39,954 --> 00:06:41,562
Huang Di.

85
00:06:41,562 --> 00:06:43,695
I'll leave this to you.

86
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:53,796
♫ <i>My love is like dust, scattered in the border zone</i> ♫

87
00:06:53,796 --> 00:07:00,854
♫ <i>No longer expecting anything from anyone, is this considered freedom?</i> ♫

88
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:06,170
♫ <i>A promise is like dust, constantly being buried in time</i> ♫

89
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,646
<i>Zhang Xiao.</i>

90
00:07:07,646 --> 00:07:10,520
<i>When I finally understand,</i>

91
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,462
<i>I lost you.</i>

92
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,896
<i>I hope you can come back.</i>

93
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:19,254
<i>Let me make up for my faults.</i>

94
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:26,929
Chairman.

95
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,604
This is Wang Tiecheng's list.

96
00:07:29,604 --> 00:07:32,520
The names on here are all Kang Zhentian's loyal subordinates.

97
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,229
Wang Tiecheng's exact words were,

98
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:37,771
for the sake of the future, he suggests that you remove these obstinate individuals

99
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:40,112
from Zhen Tian Group as soon as possible.

100
00:07:44,562 --> 00:07:45,712
Is it that urgent?

101
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:49,103
Chairman, even if you don't want to remove them now,

102
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:51,495
they're not willing to work under you.

103
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:55,612
They're all waiting for you in the meeting room to hand in their resignation.

104
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:10,354
Chairman Yin.

105
00:08:10,354 --> 00:08:15,254
We don't think Zhen Tian Group needs us oldies anymore.

106
00:08:15,254 --> 00:08:18,171
So we are here to resign.

107
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,329
Is everyone on the list here?

108
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:28,229
Yes.

109
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:30,520
Since you already know why we're here,

110
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,520
then we don't have much to say.

111
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,771
See you.

112
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:35,119
Wait.

113
00:08:37,562 --> 00:08:41,829
Those who dare to resign now are capable people.

114
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:46,195
So I hope you can all stay and run Zhen Tian Group with me.

115
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:52,929
Chairman has lost his ability to move.

116
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:55,312
But he still has a clear mind.

117
00:08:55,312 --> 00:08:58,170
I don't think you want him

118
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,287
to watch the company you all worked together on fall apart just like that.

119
00:09:06,287 --> 00:09:08,687
So, for him,

120
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:10,637
I ask you to stay.

121
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:24,596
There is actually just one person in this room who needs to go.

122
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:27,579
Who?

123
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:30,771
Uncle Wang, don't look around.

124
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,129
It's you.

125
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:33,746
Me?

126
00:09:33,746 --> 00:09:37,712
I thought you would restrain yourself after I sent Second Uncle to jail.

127
00:09:37,712 --> 00:09:39,796
But you are still the same.

128
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:43,896
For Zhen Tian Group,

129
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:45,546
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:59,687
I had it coming.

131
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:03,312
Xiao Zheng. Chairman Yin.

132
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:08,060
Great job.

133
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:14,020
Assistant Qiao, help him get the paperwork done.

134
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,329
Yes.

135
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,112
Go away.

136
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:40,504
Chairman Yin, can I say something?

137
00:10:40,504 --> 00:10:41,287
Go ahead.

138
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:44,379
We won't change our beliefs because you asked us to stay.

139
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:45,919
I work for Zhen Tian Group.

140
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,320
For Chairman, not for you.

141
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:52,120
I understand that.

142
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,729
Now I just have a favor to ask you.

143
00:10:55,704 --> 00:10:59,303
My dad picked the date for Sihan's memorial service.

144
00:11:00,096 --> 00:11:02,429
I know you and Sihan were really close.

145
00:11:02,938 --> 00:11:07,229
So I'll leave it to you and Zhuo Yue to handle.

146
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:08,738
Is that okay?

147
00:11:16,938 --> 00:11:21,079
Uncle, I'm here for my dad.

148
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:25,437
He started to speak after seeing your photo yesterday.

149
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:28,170
He said Zhang Xiao's name.

150
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,812
My mom said our family owes Zhang Xiao.

151
00:11:31,812 --> 00:11:34,019
So we hope to make it up to her.

152
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,646
Okay, Siyu. Then let me ask you.

153
00:11:35,646 --> 00:11:38,446
You said your dad started to speak.

154
00:11:38,446 --> 00:11:40,087
What did you mean by that?

155
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:46,729
My dad had a stroke.

156
00:11:46,729 --> 00:11:50,140
He can't speak nor move.

157
00:11:50,954 --> 00:11:53,662
But he still remembers you.

158
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:58,112
Uncle.

159
00:11:58,112 --> 00:12:00,503
Can you tell me where Zhang Xiao is?

160
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:41,754
Sihan.

161
00:12:47,437 --> 00:12:49,771
What are you doing here?

162
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:53,003
I decided to go with you.

163
00:12:53,003 --> 00:12:55,687
Don't you want to start a new life?

164
00:12:56,662 --> 00:13:00,154
You're included in my new life.

165
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,354
Don't forget.

166
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:05,679
I won't give up on revenge.

167
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:09,604
Then I won't give up either.

168
00:13:09,604 --> 00:13:13,587
I believe that I can change you.

169
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,479
I've already changed a lot.

170
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:21,429
There's no going back.

171
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:09,020
Come over for a meeting.

172
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,520
Go there first.

173
00:15:04,229 --> 00:15:06,187
First bow.

174
00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:09,187
Second bow.

175
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:12,038
Third bow.

176
00:15:13,354 --> 00:15:15,112
Last bow.

177
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:18,129
You may pay your respects now.

178
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,120
Please.

179
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,812
- Please accept my condolences.
- First bow.

180
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:30,112
- Please accept my condolences.
- Second bow.

181
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:33,030
- Please accept my condolences.
- Third bow.

182
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:35,796
- Please accept my condolences.
- Last bow.

183
00:15:35,796 --> 00:15:36,687
You may pay your respects now.

184
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:37,771
Why did he get so drunk?

185
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:38,754
Right.

186
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:41,003
- We're in a funeral hall.
- How disrespectful.

187
00:15:42,712 --> 00:15:44,412
Why?

188
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,354
Sihan died for no reason.

189
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:50,571
Why is no one questioning it?

190
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:56,462
Sihan, my best friend.

191
00:15:56,462 --> 00:15:59,145
You died an unjust death.

192
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:01,920
All alone in a foreign land.

193
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,980
We can't even find your bones.

194
00:16:05,687 --> 00:16:07,896
If you come back a ghost,

195
00:16:07,896 --> 00:16:10,712
don't let those who harmed you get away with it.

196
00:16:10,712 --> 00:16:11,979
Calm down.

197
00:16:11,979 --> 00:16:14,395
The kidnappers killed him.

198
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:15,812
They will get their punishment.

199
00:16:15,812 --> 00:16:18,303
Yes, the kidnappers did kill him.

200
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:21,354
But that's because we didn't pay the ransom in time.

201
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:25,437
Director Liu, why don't you listen to what others are saying?

202
00:16:25,437 --> 00:16:28,103
A skinny camel is still bigger than a horse.

203
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:33,420
Zhen Tian Group just let the kidnappers kill their second son.

204
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,019
Why didn't the news of the kidnapping get to us on time?

205
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:42,079
Why did we wait until Chairman asked to get the money ready?

206
00:16:42,738 --> 00:16:46,729
Those who let him die are also the murderers.

207
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:48,103
You had too much to drink.

208
00:16:48,103 --> 00:16:49,787
Please leave.

209
00:16:50,812 --> 00:16:53,471
Director Liu, we all know.

210
00:16:54,237 --> 00:16:58,262
You all got won over by someone's words.

211
00:16:58,262 --> 00:17:00,296
I understand you.

212
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,604
But I...

213
00:17:03,604 --> 00:17:06,271
My relationship with Sihan.

214
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,595
I have to speak up for Sihan today.

215
00:17:12,103 --> 00:17:14,729
That man killed Sihan.

216
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:19,729
And he's still trying to use his death to shed crocodile tears and win popular support.

217
00:17:21,337 --> 00:17:26,295
Do you think Sihan will rest in peace?

218
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,112
Do you think he will rest in peace?

219
00:17:31,045 --> 00:17:34,487
Will he rest in peace?

220
00:17:40,354 --> 00:17:42,703
Zhuo Yue, calm down.

221
00:17:46,212 --> 00:17:48,403
First bow.

222
00:17:53,796 --> 00:17:55,200
Second bow.

223
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,040
Calm down.

224
00:17:58,295 --> 00:18:00,446
Third bow.

225
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,754
Last bow.

226
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,003
You may pay your respects now.

227
00:18:10,629 --> 00:18:13,937
Yin Zheng, how dare you still come here?

228
00:18:14,979 --> 00:18:17,412
Sihan is my brother.

229
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:19,546
Why wouldn't I dare to come pay my respects to him?

230
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:22,187
Zhuo Yue, it's okay to be sad.

231
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:23,895
But don't make trouble.

232
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:47,337
Sihan.

233
00:18:47,337 --> 00:18:50,754
I'm sorry for being useless.

234
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,700
I couldn't fight for justice for you.

235
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:58,054
Brother, rest in peace.

236
00:19:04,604 --> 00:19:06,003
Zhuo Yue.

237
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:10,229
I know you and Sihan were close.

238
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:14,754
Speak out whatever you want to say today.

239
00:19:16,412 --> 00:19:20,454
Okay, I'll say it.

240
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:23,546
At worst, I just won't work in this industry anymore.

241
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:26,019
Chairman Yin, you know this well.

242
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:28,646
Sihan is wise, generous, and kindhearted.

243
00:19:28,646 --> 00:19:30,387
If the kidnappers didn't kill him,

244
00:19:30,387 --> 00:19:33,437
he would've been Zhen Tian Group's successor.

245
00:19:33,437 --> 00:19:38,604
Are you saying that I let him die to get this position?

246
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:39,820
Not only that.

247
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,704
Zhuo Yue.

248
00:19:40,704 --> 00:19:43,020
Who switched out the video at the wedding

249
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,729
and made Sihan go to Ganlin?

250
00:19:45,729 --> 00:19:49,371
Chairman Yin, I'm sure you know.

251
00:19:51,245 --> 00:19:54,537
Sihan has such a loyal friend like you.

252
00:19:54,537 --> 00:19:58,338
He's better than me in that regard already.

253
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:04,303
I know things aren't as you expected.

254
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,371
But regarding Sihan's death,

255
00:20:08,604 --> 00:20:11,087
I could've done better.

256
00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:15,119
So I hope that you can stay with Zhen Tian Group, Zhuo Yue.

257
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,329
Stand up to me at any time.

258
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:22,412
Give me the chance to learn from Sihan's strengths.

259
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:26,096
Additionally,

260
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:30,437
I'll set aside money from Zhen Tian Group's earnings every year

261
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:34,671
to start a foundation in Sihan's name,

262
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:36,719
focusing on philanthropy.

263
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,538
If you're willing,

264
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,112
I'll put you in charge of this.

265
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:47,479
Is this just for show?

266
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,546
Can I trust you?

267
00:20:56,812 --> 00:20:58,245
Sihan.

268
00:20:59,938 --> 00:21:02,054
I only now realized

269
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:07,695
that family, friendship,

270
00:21:08,604 --> 00:21:10,246
and love

271
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,587
are more important than anything.

272
00:21:20,103 --> 00:21:23,203
I really hope that if you're alive,

273
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:27,929
you can come and manage Zhen Tian Group with me.

274
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:37,687
Excellent! Great!

275
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:39,312
So great!

276
00:21:39,312 --> 00:21:41,312
Sihan.

277
00:21:41,312 --> 00:21:44,145
What is happening?

278
00:21:44,145 --> 00:21:45,495
Is this real?

279
00:21:45,495 --> 00:21:47,454
Sihan, you're really here.

280
00:21:47,454 --> 00:21:48,379
Is it you, Sihan?

281
00:21:48,379 --> 00:21:51,504
Yes, I'm still alive.

282
00:21:51,504 --> 00:21:53,520
Am I dreaming?

283
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,812
Sihan, they all said you were dead.

284
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:00,187
Alright, Brother.

285
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:02,729
Can't you see I'm fine?

286
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:05,795
I escaped from the kidnappers.

287
00:22:07,354 --> 00:22:10,687
Then why did Siyu say you were dead on the phone?

288
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:15,270
He still hadn't found me at that time.

289
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:20,362
I didn't expect for my memorial service to be so soon.

290
00:22:20,362 --> 00:22:22,570
So many people came.

291
00:22:23,287 --> 00:22:25,771
Even someone I didn't expect to come.

292
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:38,437
I'm really happy that you're back safely.

293
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,145
Big Brother.

294
00:22:47,145 --> 00:22:51,437
I'm also very happy to see you.

295
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,562
Come and manage Zhen Tian Group with me.

296
00:22:53,562 --> 00:22:56,387
I heard everything you just said.

297
00:22:56,387 --> 00:22:57,996
I'm touched.

298
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:02,200
I'm glad you're back.

299
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,810
Welcome back.

300
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,646
Chairman Kang, don't be sad.

301
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:21,437
Sihan knows it's not convenient for you to see him off.

302
00:23:21,437 --> 00:23:23,920
He won't blame you.

303
00:23:27,412 --> 00:23:29,229
Zhentian, look.

304
00:23:29,229 --> 00:23:31,487
Look who's back.

305
00:23:33,838 --> 00:23:35,229
Dad.

306
00:23:36,996 --> 00:23:38,454
Dad.

307
00:23:38,454 --> 00:23:40,103
Dad, I'm back.

308
00:23:40,103 --> 00:23:41,712
I'm Sihan, I'm back.

309
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:45,771
Dad.

310
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:47,854
Zhentian, don't get too excited.

311
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:49,604
- Zhentian.
- Dad.

312
00:23:49,604 --> 00:23:51,337
Auntie Rong, get the medicine.

313
00:23:51,337 --> 00:23:53,354
- Dad. Get the medicine!
- Okay.

314
00:23:53,354 --> 00:23:55,145
Water. Give me the medicine.

315
00:23:55,145 --> 00:23:55,862
Dad.

316
00:23:55,862 --> 00:23:57,080
- Zhentian, here.
- Chairman Kang.

317
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,830
Here.

318
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,596
Zhentian, drink some water.

319
00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:05,003
- Come on.
- Dad.

320
00:24:05,003 --> 00:24:07,012
Zhentian.

321
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,550
Dad!

322
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,979
Zhentian.

323
00:24:09,979 --> 00:24:12,019
Zhentian, don't get too excited.

324
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:13,754
Your dad is too excited to see you.

325
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:15,629
Help him to bed.

326
00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:17,187
Zhentian.

327
00:24:17,187 --> 00:24:19,129
Come, Zhentian.

328
00:24:26,062 --> 00:24:29,162
Your dad's blood vessels are getting worse.

329
00:24:29,162 --> 00:24:32,387
He was too excited to see you.

330
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:37,620
Dad.

331
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,638
Dad, it's all my fault.

332
00:24:42,412 --> 00:24:44,738
I came back late.

333
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:51,420
<i>Dad, Yin Zheng did this to you.</i>

334
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:57,437
<i>I swear. For your pain and my pain,</i>

335
00:24:57,437 --> 00:25:00,510
<i>I'll make him pay back double.</i>

336
00:25:01,045 --> 00:25:03,929
Sihan, get up.

337
00:25:06,787 --> 00:25:10,629
Sihan, you've been through a lot.

338
00:25:10,629 --> 00:25:12,562
How could we blame you?

339
00:25:12,562 --> 00:25:14,162
It's all my fault.

340
00:25:14,162 --> 00:25:16,229
I couldn't rescue you in time

341
00:25:16,229 --> 00:25:18,690
and I didn't take good care of your dad.

342
00:25:20,412 --> 00:25:22,771
Madam, Xiao Zheng is here again.

343
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,395
He's standing in the yard.

344
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:28,046
He asks for your permission to see Chairman Kang.

345
00:25:29,687 --> 00:25:30,462
Then...

346
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:34,270
Dad, wake up.

347
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,746
I would rather take your place.

348
00:25:35,746 --> 00:25:37,729
Wake up.

349
00:25:39,646 --> 00:25:41,520
What is he doing here?

350
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,671
Tell him to leave.

351
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:45,462
Auntie Lan, don't say that.

352
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:48,604
Big Brother has it tough too.

353
00:25:48,604 --> 00:25:50,687
After Dad had a stroke,

354
00:25:50,687 --> 00:25:54,296
Zhen Tian Group might've already shut down if it wasn't for Big Brother.

355
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:57,587
Sihan.

356
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:01,000
You are really a kind boy.

357
00:26:01,537 --> 00:26:04,537
Zhen Tian Group should've belonged to you.

358
00:26:04,537 --> 00:26:07,562
If he doesn't manage it with you like he said today,

359
00:26:07,562 --> 00:26:09,771
I'll never forgive him.

360
00:26:09,771 --> 00:26:12,579
Auntie Rong, tell him my exact words.

361
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:14,771
Auntie Rong, wait.

362
00:26:14,771 --> 00:26:19,504
Auntie Lan, please don't blame him.

363
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:21,729
He has it tough too.

364
00:26:21,729 --> 00:26:26,030
Sihan, he owes you.

365
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:29,170
Auntie Rong, go.

366
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,712
Sihan.

367
00:26:38,996 --> 00:26:40,790
I'm sorry.

368
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,070
I'm sorry.

369
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:49,162
Xiao Zheng.

370
00:26:49,162 --> 00:26:52,287
They don't want to see you.

371
00:26:52,287 --> 00:26:57,170
How about I give you a call?

372
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:00,812
I'll get back inside then.

373
00:27:00,812 --> 00:27:02,671
Thank you, Auntie Rong.

374
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:06,479
Auntie Rong.

375
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:08,270
Are you leaving?

376
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:10,479
Big Brother.

377
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:12,395
Sihan.

378
00:27:13,287 --> 00:27:16,687
A lot has happened recently.

379
00:27:16,687 --> 00:27:19,000
I'll talk to her.

380
00:27:20,312 --> 00:27:22,195
Are you going home now?

381
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,079
Yes, I'm going home.

382
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:30,103
I've never taken you home.

383
00:27:30,103 --> 00:27:31,771
Let me drive you home today.

384
00:27:31,771 --> 00:27:33,146
Get in.

385
00:27:34,103 --> 00:27:36,154
<i>What is he trying to do?</i>

386
00:27:37,762 --> 00:27:39,238
Why are you still standing there?

387
00:27:39,238 --> 00:27:41,346
It's windy. Get in the car.

388
00:27:44,395 --> 00:27:46,854
<i>Let's see what you're up to.</i>

389
00:28:14,145 --> 00:28:15,662
Big Brother.

390
00:28:16,437 --> 00:28:20,812
This used to be Z&X's office.

391
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:23,879
I still remember when you came to tell me you wanted you acquire it.

392
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:25,620
I didn't agree.

393
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,370
Honestly, I'm quite attached to it.

394
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,545
Back then you said,

395
00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:34,296
that you want to feel what it's like to win.

396
00:28:36,787 --> 00:28:39,437
That was wrong of me back then.

397
00:28:39,437 --> 00:28:41,760
But I had my difficulties.

398
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,038
If it were today,

399
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:49,687
I would think that your dream is more important than my job.

400
00:28:51,437 --> 00:28:53,379
<i>It's only the two of us here.</i>

401
00:28:53,379 --> 00:28:55,546
<i>Why are you still pretending?</i>

402
00:28:55,546 --> 00:28:57,495
<i>You hypocritical wolf.</i>

403
00:28:57,495 --> 00:28:58,954
What's wrong?

404
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:01,562
Aren't you going to invite me in?

405
00:29:01,562 --> 00:29:04,437
I want to hear about your experience in Ganlin.

406
00:29:04,437 --> 00:29:06,590
Come, this way please.

407
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:17,462
Yinuo.

408
00:29:28,896 --> 00:29:30,646
Let me introduce you.

409
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:33,245
This is my Big Brother, Yin Zheng.

410
00:29:33,245 --> 00:29:35,270
This is Ma Yinuo.

411
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:38,329
She saved me in Ganlin.

412
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:40,362
Thank you for saving him.

413
00:29:45,871 --> 00:29:47,938
Have a seat.

414
00:29:47,938 --> 00:29:49,754
I'll get you some coffee.

415
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,487
Have a seat.

416
00:30:16,938 --> 00:30:18,671
<i>I'm not Lan Lan.</i>

417
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:20,871
<i>I'm Ma Yinuo.</i>

418
00:30:20,871 --> 00:30:22,871
<i>Lan Lan is dead.</i>

419
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:25,312
<i>I'm Ma Yinuo now.</i>

420
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:35,019
All that happened to you in Ganlin?

421
00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:36,929
Yes.

422
00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:40,912
When the kidnappers found out I could be exchanged for 50 million,

423
00:30:40,912 --> 00:30:43,479
they treated me like VIP.

424
00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:45,829
They didn't even dare to curse at me.

425
00:31:13,287 --> 00:31:15,779
There's one more thing I want to tell you.

426
00:31:18,746 --> 00:31:20,437
Zhang Xiao and I...

427
00:31:22,162 --> 00:31:25,854
Big Brother, I know.

428
00:31:25,854 --> 00:31:30,050
Zhang Xiao and I are a thing of the past.

429
00:31:30,562 --> 00:31:32,787
Congratulations.

430
00:31:32,787 --> 00:31:35,354
Are you being honest?

431
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:39,338
Let bygones be bygones.

432
00:31:41,687 --> 00:31:43,754
Stop lying to me.

433
00:31:44,495 --> 00:31:47,646
I know everything you said were all lies.

434
00:31:47,646 --> 00:31:49,900
You still hate me.

435
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,354
You must've suffered a lot in Ganlin.

436
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:57,019
If I experienced the same things you did,

437
00:31:57,019 --> 00:31:59,245
I wouldn't forgive you so easily.

438
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,787
But we can't change the past.

439
00:32:06,787 --> 00:32:10,787
The only thing I can do now is try my best to make it up to you.

440
00:32:10,787 --> 00:32:12,104
Don't worry.

441
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:15,187
I'll find the best doctor to treat Dad.

442
00:32:15,187 --> 00:32:16,771
As for Zhen Tian Group,

443
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:20,646
I'll have the board of directors officially invite you back as CEO.

444
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:23,003
Manage the company with me.

445
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,671
<i>No way.</i>

446
00:32:25,671 --> 00:32:28,038
<i>He's sounding me out.</i>

447
00:32:29,912 --> 00:32:32,395
Big Brother, I think you misunderstood.

448
00:32:32,395 --> 00:32:36,229
I'm approaching life differently after my trip in Ganlin.

449
00:32:36,229 --> 00:32:40,329
I'm no longer interested in the company.

450
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:43,120
You can handle the management.

451
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,003
You know more than me.

452
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:50,395
I know you won't believe me.

453
00:32:50,395 --> 00:32:52,287
That makes sense.

454
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:57,329
I know I've done a lot of wrong things in the past.

455
00:32:57,329 --> 00:32:59,262
No matter what,

456
00:32:59,262 --> 00:33:01,287
I'm being sincere.

457
00:33:01,287 --> 00:33:03,262
Time will tell.

458
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:05,329
Rest for a couple of days

459
00:33:05,329 --> 00:33:07,745
then come back to the company.

460
00:33:16,354 --> 00:33:17,787
Thank you.

461
00:33:26,412 --> 00:33:28,230
I'm glad you're back.

462
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,400
Cheers.

463
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:41,019
It's late.

464
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,546
I'll get going now.

465
00:33:42,546 --> 00:33:44,087
I'll see you out.

466
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:51,920
Please.

467
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:58,812
Rest up.

468
00:33:58,812 --> 00:34:00,354
I'll get going now.

469
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:01,838
Go ahead.

470
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,854
<i>Yin Zheng, you old fox.</i>

471
00:34:19,854 --> 00:34:22,520
<i>I'd like to see how much longer you can hold out.</i>

472
00:34:42,354 --> 00:34:44,379
You are thinking about Yin Zheng.

473
00:34:46,746 --> 00:34:48,312
No.

474
00:34:48,312 --> 00:34:51,938
I'm just thinking about what he just said.

475
00:34:51,938 --> 00:34:54,079
He sounded sincere.

476
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,554
Really? That's what you think?

477
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:01,479
If you're still worried,

478
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:03,587
I can help you sound him out.

479
00:35:05,162 --> 00:35:07,038
What did you say?

480
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,312
You want to help me sound him out?

481
00:35:11,287 --> 00:35:14,062
Whether his kindness is real or just an act,

482
00:35:14,062 --> 00:35:16,287
or if it's a trap.

483
00:35:16,287 --> 00:35:18,729
I think I can tell the difference.

484
00:35:18,729 --> 00:35:21,787
Besides, if he's being sincere,

485
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:24,287
you can let go of your hatred,

486
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:26,504
and we can start our new life.

487
00:35:26,504 --> 00:35:28,103
You just saw your old flame

488
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:30,579
and now you're in a rush to see him again.

489
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:32,520
Sihan.

490
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,970
I already put the past behind me.

491
00:35:35,704 --> 00:35:38,437
You have to trust me.

492
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:40,871
The look in your eyes just now

493
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:43,454
tell me that you still miss him.

494
00:35:43,454 --> 00:35:45,812
Now you're saying you want to see him.

495
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:47,771
How am I supposed to know what you're trying to do?

496
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,387
Sihan.

497
00:35:49,387 --> 00:35:52,912
Did you forget that you told me that I'm the only one you trust?

498
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,296
Why did you become like this?

499
00:35:57,704 --> 00:36:00,287
My experience in Ganlin tells me

500
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:04,804
that nothing lasts forever.

501
00:36:05,554 --> 00:36:08,038
Zhang Xiao told me she loved me.

502
00:36:08,038 --> 00:36:09,495
But in secret,

503
00:36:09,495 --> 00:36:12,262
she's having affairs with Yin Zheng.

504
00:36:17,996 --> 00:36:19,470
So,

505
00:36:19,996 --> 00:36:22,520
if you really put your past behind you,

506
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,454
don't go see him.

507
00:36:27,637 --> 00:36:29,120
Sihan.

508
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,620
Can you stop being so paranoid?

509
00:36:32,145 --> 00:36:34,662
Can you let go of your hatred

510
00:36:34,662 --> 00:36:36,620
and let Yin Zheng be?

511
00:36:38,846 --> 00:36:40,996
Don't put it so nicely.

512
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:43,020
Don't you just want to see Yin Zheng?

513
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,454
I won't give you that chance.

514
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:47,262
I won't let you leave this house.

515
00:36:47,262 --> 00:36:52,145
Sihan.

516
00:36:53,287 --> 00:36:55,079
Sihan.

517
00:36:56,454 --> 00:37:04,520
Sihan.

518
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:26,604
♫ <i>The whole room is empty</i> ♫

You're here.

538
00:38:56,896 --> 00:38:58,079
I knew it.

539
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,495
I'm such an upscale and classy handsome man.

540
00:39:00,495 --> 00:39:02,819
Someone would definitely come visit me.

541
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,145
Don't be so full of yourself.

542
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:08,312
I went out for lunch with my friend.

543
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:11,520
We had some leftovers and I didn't want it to go to waste.

544
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,719
I'll let you finish it.

545
00:39:15,412 --> 00:39:17,020
Is that so?

546
00:39:18,704 --> 00:39:22,545
I'm so disappointed and sad.

547
00:39:24,203 --> 00:39:26,704
If there is butter-baked scallops,

548
00:39:26,704 --> 00:39:27,812
chicken in rose soy sauce,

549
00:39:27,812 --> 00:39:28,954
turnip cake in XO sauce,

550
00:39:28,954 --> 00:39:31,812
and peach barbecued pork without too much tomato sauce,

551
00:39:31,812 --> 00:39:33,729
I can manage to finish it.

552
00:39:36,495 --> 00:39:38,379
Just three words.

553
00:39:40,454 --> 00:39:42,462
Go to die.

554
00:39:50,537 --> 00:39:52,162
Have I told you?

555
00:39:52,162 --> 00:39:55,103
I only eat the soy sauce chicken that comes out of the oven at 5 PM

556
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:57,346
from the restaurant twenty meters left of the office

557
00:39:57,346 --> 00:40:00,220
and at the end of the block after you make a right.

558
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:04,087
Why isn't she back to hit me?

559
00:40:05,187 --> 00:40:08,120
Hey, you in the back!

560
00:40:08,662 --> 00:40:10,270
Me?

561
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,762
Chairman.

562
00:40:14,762 --> 00:40:17,938
I was actually working very hard

563
00:40:17,938 --> 00:40:20,245
before I started eating the soy sauce chicken.

564
00:40:20,245 --> 00:40:21,495
It's okay.

565
00:40:21,495 --> 00:40:24,038
Dating is a serious matter.

566
00:40:24,038 --> 00:40:26,387
You should learn to treasure those around you.

567
00:40:28,987 --> 00:40:30,296
Get to work.

568
00:40:38,429 --> 00:40:39,260
Hello?

569
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,838
Hello, I'm Ma Yinuo.

570
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:43,520
I'm Sihan's friend.

571
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,312
Miss Ma, do you need something?

572
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,629
I want to speak to you.

573
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,062
It's about Sihan.

574
00:40:50,062 --> 00:40:51,103
Sure.

575
00:40:51,103 --> 00:40:53,412
I'm at Zhen Tian Group's film studio.

576
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,730
I'll wait for you here.

577
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:19,479
Look at the information in your hands first.

578
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:23,020
The scene we are looking at is called "Reborn".

579
00:41:24,012 --> 00:41:28,454
A person in despair walks to the beach alone with all hope lost.

580
00:41:28,454 --> 00:41:31,954
She wanted to jump into the sea to end her life.

581
00:41:31,954 --> 00:41:33,896
But at that moment,

582
00:41:33,896 --> 00:41:36,420
she was taken aback by the magnificent sunset.

583
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,020
It's a beautiful view she's never seen before.

584
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,370
In that moment she realized,

585
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:46,303
how small humans are in front of the creator.

586
00:41:46,846 --> 00:41:50,620
And that her troubles are extremely insignificant.

587
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:56,562
All of it was like a pipe dream.

588
00:42:00,954 --> 00:42:05,487
She watches the sunset slowly sink into the sea.

589
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,254
She feels at peace.

590
00:42:11,871 --> 00:42:13,503
Slowly,

591
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,454
she crosses her legs and sits down.

592
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:20,138
Looking at the sunset,

593
00:42:21,145 --> 00:42:24,495
and watching the last bit of residual light.

594
00:42:24,495 --> 00:42:30,729
This endless night helped her see the hope of rebirth.

595
00:42:30,729 --> 00:42:35,419
Tomorrow, the sun will still rise.

596
00:42:37,203 --> 00:42:42,254
And what she needs is the courage to be reborn.

597
00:42:42,854 --> 00:42:45,604
She stands up slowly.

598
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,620
Hands together.

599
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,612
A smile creeps at the corners of her mouth.

600
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,037
The phoenix rises from the ashes.

601
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:07,562
If she can let go of her burdens

602
00:43:07,562 --> 00:43:09,796
and put the past behind her,

603
00:43:11,245 --> 00:43:14,210
then she can embrace a new life.

604
00:43:14,871 --> 00:43:20,287
<i>That's exactly how I felt before I chose to be reborn.</i>

605
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:24,003
<i>He described it so accurately.</i>

606
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,554
Miss Ma, you are here.

607
00:43:37,495 --> 00:43:39,312
Let's talk outside.
