3
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:51,107
Okay, fire is ready.

4
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:08,065
Roll 8, scene 18, shot 8, take 1.

5
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:16,124
Three, two, one. Run!

6
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:27,499
Director Yin.

7
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:28,782
Have a seat.

8
00:02:33,249 --> 00:02:39,265
Fire.

9
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:40,999
Where is Miss Lan Lan?

10
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:42,965
She's inside.

11
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:49,499
It's a big fire.

12
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:52,032
Don't worry. She's wearing a fireproof suit.

13
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:58,207
Help! There's a fire.

14
00:02:58,207 --> 00:02:59,940
Cut, good.

15
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,515
Hurry up.

16
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,482
Extinguish the fire.

17
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:04,799
Hurry up.

18
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,290
Is it going to be okay?

19
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,090
Should be fine.

20
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:23,774
Come help!

21
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:25,040
Hurry up.

22
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,291
I can't open it.

23
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,940
- It's not opening.
- Hurry.

24
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,920
Break it.

25
00:03:32,524 --> 00:03:34,123
Don't panic.

26
00:03:34,123 --> 00:03:35,649
Is Lan Lan inside?

27
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,415
Yes.

28
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:45,499
Step aside.

29
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,223
Lan Lan.

30
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,732
Lan Lan.

31
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:56,074
Call the ambulance!

32
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,082
Doctor, how is she?

33
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,840
Lan Lan.

34
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:13,415
Are you okay?

35
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:17,107
Lan Lan, you're awake.

36
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:18,640
I'm Zhang Xiao.

37
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,958
You're Zhang Xiao? Where is Lan Lan?

38
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,732
Lan Lan isn't feeling well,

39
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:25,082
so I stepped in for her.

40
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:26,566
What's wrong with her?

41
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,957
She had a nightmare last night.

42
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:33,249
I...

43
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:35,666
Don't worry, you're fine.

44
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,632
Luckily we moved quick.

45
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:54,666
That was close, someone almost died.

46
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,332
Don't take on scenes with fire.

47
00:04:56,332 --> 00:04:59,207
The little money is not worth sacrificing your life for.

48
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:01,182
I heard she almost died in the fire.

49
00:05:01,182 --> 00:05:02,923
Really?

50
00:05:13,832 --> 00:05:15,324
Are you okay?

51
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:23,165
Director Yin, Miss Lan Lan got into an accident.

52
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:32,939
Lan Lan.

53
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:36,374
Don't get in our way.

54
00:05:36,374 --> 00:05:38,039
I'm her boyfriend.

55
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,666
Lan Lan.

56
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:48,507
I'm Yin Zheng.

57
00:06:10,624 --> 00:06:12,265
Don't worry.

58
00:06:12,265 --> 00:06:15,540
You'll be fine.

59
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,149
Hang in there.

60
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,340
<i>[In Surgery]</i>

61
00:06:44,165 --> 00:06:46,274
Lan Lan.

62
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:48,674
Doctor, how is she?

63
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,232
Don't get riled up.

64
00:06:50,232 --> 00:06:52,839
There are large burns on the patient's skin.

65
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,649
They're considered severe burns.

66
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:58,039
Her lungs are also injured.

67
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:02,082
Fortunately, she wasn't too close to the origin of the explosion.

68
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:05,315
Otherwise, she would've died.

69
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:09,424
We performed the debridement procedure and respiratory intubation.

70
00:07:09,424 --> 00:07:13,666
She is currently stable.

71
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:19,457
But the patient experienced large burns in the upper body.

72
00:07:19,457 --> 00:07:24,440
Although we can consider skin graft surgery,

73
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,432
it's basically impossible

74
00:07:28,432 --> 00:07:29,832
to restore her original appearance.

75
00:07:29,832 --> 00:07:32,791
Doctor, please.

76
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,265
As long as you can restore her face,

77
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:36,290
I'm willing to spend as much as it takes.

78
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,415
I understand how you feel.

79
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:40,766
But we already did our best.

80
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:43,882
I'm so sorry.

81
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,716
Assistant Qiao, contact plastic surgery hospitals overseas.

82
00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:01,740
Immediately.

83
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:09,699
Why are you still here?

84
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:12,090
Leave!

85
00:08:14,782 --> 00:08:16,758
Sorry.

86
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:19,858
It's useless to say sorry.

87
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:20,958
Let me ask you.

88
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,457
Is this how you take care of her?

89
00:08:22,457 --> 00:08:24,682
Why did you stand in for her at the shoot?

90
00:08:24,682 --> 00:08:26,765
Why was there gunpowder in her car?

91
00:08:27,832 --> 00:08:29,340
Tell me!

92
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:34,039
I really don't know.

93
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,666
It's your fault.

94
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,860
It's your fault!

95
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,760
What are you doing? Let go of her!

96
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:45,458
Xiaoxiao, are you okay?

97
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:48,749
Did you come here to laugh at me?

98
00:08:48,749 --> 00:08:50,582
No.

99
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:52,732
What happened?

100
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,190
Lan Lan's car exploded.

101
00:08:56,207 --> 00:08:59,374
Leave now.

102
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:01,123
Yin Zheng.

103
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,399
I hope you can calm down.

104
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:06,249
Zhang Xiao is just her assistant,

105
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:07,791
she isn't her bodyguard.

106
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:08,899
Are you trying to say she deserved it?

107
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:10,624
That's not what I meant.

108
00:09:10,624 --> 00:09:13,557
Lan Lan is a complicated woman.

109
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:15,240
Shut up.

110
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:19,165
Stop.

111
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:21,774
Just leave him alone.

112
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:24,340
Let's go.

113
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,632
Lan Lan.

114
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:21,139
Don't be afraid.

115
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:25,649
It'll be fine.

116
00:10:28,182 --> 00:10:30,116
Take a rest.

117
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:42,207
Hang in there, okay?

118
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:45,716
Just hang in there.

119
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:51,040
Please hang in there.

120
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,758
You will be fine.

121
00:10:57,207 --> 00:11:02,732
I don't know what happened.

122
00:11:04,357 --> 00:11:06,065
But don't worry.

123
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,415
I will find out who did it.

124
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:11,058
Don't worry.

125
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:22,999
You don't need to hide anything from me.

126
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:25,116
I already guessed it.

127
00:11:26,082 --> 00:11:28,507
The neighbor you always mention,

128
00:11:29,874 --> 00:11:32,249
it's you, right?

129
00:11:36,332 --> 00:11:38,258
Like I said,

130
00:11:38,849 --> 00:11:41,257
no matter what happens,

131
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,815
I can accept everything about you.

132
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,191
I'll always be with you.

133
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:52,040
Lan Lan.

134
00:12:00,123 --> 00:12:05,007
You're fine. I'm here.

135
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,374
Don't think about it too much.

136
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,474
Don't always think it's your fault.

137
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:34,216
This has nothing to do with you.

138
00:12:35,374 --> 00:12:37,874
I'm thinking about last night.

139
00:12:37,874 --> 00:12:40,524
What happened last night?

140
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:43,332
She had a nightmare last night.

141
00:12:43,332 --> 00:12:45,199
When I went to visit her,

142
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:48,999
she was shivering.

143
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:52,249
It seemed like a very terrible nightmare.

144
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:56,165
Ever since you got attacked,

145
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:58,165
I've been suspecting her identity.

146
00:12:58,165 --> 00:13:00,440
Don't suspect her anymore.

147
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,632
She's been through enough.

148
00:13:03,374 --> 00:13:07,899
I can't stop thinking about what happened today.

149
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:09,315
It's terrifying.

150
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:13,624
Why did she ask you to step in for her for the fire scene?

151
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:16,123
It's obvious she wanted to kill you.

152
00:13:16,123 --> 00:13:18,758
It was just an accident. She didn't know about it.

153
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:23,082
You're too naive.

154
00:13:26,582 --> 00:13:28,507
I believe her.

155
00:13:31,182 --> 00:13:36,482
Moreover, I think someone wants to kill her.

156
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,207
What you need to do now is forget everything.

157
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:42,615
Have a good sleep when you get back.

158
00:13:45,766 --> 00:13:47,740
My dad came to Beijing.

159
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:50,540
I have to go home.

160
00:13:51,182 --> 00:13:52,949
I'll help you request for leave.

161
00:14:13,315 --> 00:14:17,132
Han Qing, I want to go down.

162
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:27,290
Did you hear me? I want to go down.

163
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,582
Come help me.

164
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:37,439
Did you hear me? I want to go down.

165
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,599
Why are you still sitting there?

166
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:50,624
Come help me up.

167
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,832
Why did you do that to her?

168
00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:55,040
Did you really have to hurt her?

169
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:58,299
What's going on with you?

170
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,882
Who do you think you are?

171
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:05,340
You're just a riffraff.

172
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,874
A dog, a clown.

173
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:14,039
Yes, you never thought of me as human.

174
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,930
I don't think of you as human?

175
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,030
I treat you as my own son.

176
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:22,791
I've given you everything you have.

177
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,540
What can that woman give you?

178
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,007
All she does is hurt you.

179
00:15:28,707 --> 00:15:31,032
How about you?

180
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:34,215
You betrayed me for her.

181
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,607
I really regret it.

182
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:40,290
I regret saving you from the streets.

183
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,040
Don't forget she is the vice president's woman.

184
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,758
She isn't Ma Wa, she's Lan Lan.

185
00:15:47,457 --> 00:15:49,123
Stupid.

186
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,165
Boss.

187
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,799
Can you give Ma Wa what she wants?

188
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,216
Ma Wa wants money and power.

189
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,716
She won't sit in the same boat with you.

190
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:33,858
She isn't like that.

191
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:35,715
She...

192
00:16:39,474 --> 00:16:43,466
Han Qing, you must remember.

193
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,765
Never want love from a woman.

194
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:54,007
Just forget her.

195
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:58,990
Your Ma Wa no longer exists.

196
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,182
Dad, you're really something.

197
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:18,816
Why didn't you tell me to pick you up?

198
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:21,524
You didn't have to. I know the way.

199
00:17:21,524 --> 00:17:23,332
I'm just taking a rest at your place.

200
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:28,640
I have to go to the hospital in a few days for a surgery.

201
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,749
Surgery?

202
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,182
Don't scare me.

203
00:17:32,182 --> 00:17:34,374
Can you finish your words at once?

204
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:37,016
Daughter, I'm fine.

205
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:38,582
Let me tell you.

206
00:17:38,582 --> 00:17:40,624
While I was leading the exploration team,

207
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:42,415
I accidentally had a bad fall.

208
00:17:42,415 --> 00:17:45,582
When I went to check at the hospital, I was fine from the fall,

209
00:17:45,582 --> 00:17:48,339
but the doctor found a tumor.

210
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:50,139
He suggested me to do surgery in Beijing,

211
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:51,440
so that's why I'm here.

212
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,958
Dad, why do you always have me worrying about you?

213
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,891
You're getting old. Don't lead a team anymore.

214
00:17:57,891 --> 00:17:59,707
Now you have a tumor.

215
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:01,415
What do we do about that?

216
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,540
Daughter.

217
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,807
Don't cry, I'm fine.

218
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:08,949
I'm very healthy.

219
00:18:09,582 --> 00:18:14,439
The doctor guaranteed it's just a benign tumor.

220
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:20,916
Just like the pimples you got when you were younger.

221
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,624
Don't worry, I'm fine.

222
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:25,274
Come.

223
00:18:25,274 --> 00:18:28,090
Look what I brought you.

224
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:33,290
Red jujube from our hometown.

225
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,123
Lilies for soup.

226
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:37,874
You didn't have to bring so many things.

227
00:18:37,874 --> 00:18:39,999
I can buy all this online.

228
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,958
No, I brought it from our hometown.

229
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,691
Take it.

230
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:45,466
Put it away.

231
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:43,415
Zhuo Yue, try your best to minimize the loss.

232
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,874
We can't get back the money that we already spent.

233
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:48,832
Make sure to budget well for all future expenses.

234
00:19:48,832 --> 00:19:52,357
Make sure to have this settled before the chairman gets back.

235
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:52,999
Okay.

236
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:55,207
Otherwise, he'll get angry.

237
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:59,274
Also, pay the crew some hush money

238
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:01,223
to prevent the situation from escalating.

239
00:20:01,223 --> 00:20:03,499
Handle this crisis well

240
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:06,182
and cooperate with police to solve the case soon.

241
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:07,816
No problem.

242
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:10,939
Regarding Lan Lan...

243
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:12,932
We already verified with Australia.

244
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:15,582
The contact number and address that Lan Lan gave aren't real.

245
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,965
There was also no email reply.

246
00:20:21,332 --> 00:20:23,432
Ask our friends in Australia to keep helping us.

247
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,607
Let's try to figure out her real identity soon.

248
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:27,007
Okay.

249
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:29,999
Come in.

250
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:34,557
- Director Kang.
- What is it?

251
00:20:34,557 --> 00:20:39,410
Documents with viruses showed up on our website this morning.

252
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,249
The computer shut down automatically after opening it.

253
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:46,332
If untouched for three hours, it will automatically modify the details of the website.

254
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:49,799
Our maintenance staff deleted it immediately.

255
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,520
After investigation,

256
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,210
we found out that the files were uploaded from Miss Lan's personal laptop.

257
00:20:56,707 --> 00:20:58,099
That's strange.

258
00:20:58,099 --> 00:20:58,916
Yes.

259
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,174
So I came to inform you about this matter.

260
00:21:02,182 --> 00:21:03,958
Thank you, Manager Lu.

261
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,207
Keep this between us for now.

262
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:07,207
Keep looking into it.

263
00:21:07,207 --> 00:21:10,123
Inform me immediately if you find anything new.

264
00:21:10,123 --> 00:21:13,058
It's best if you can find the laptop.

265
00:21:13,058 --> 00:21:14,332
Okay.

266
00:21:29,965 --> 00:21:34,932
Yin Zheng, there's something I think you should know.

267
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:39,307
The company's records of Lan Lan's information are all fake.

268
00:21:39,307 --> 00:21:44,874
This morning, her laptop automatically uploaded documents with viruses to the company's website.

269
00:21:44,874 --> 00:21:47,749
And when her car exploded,

270
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:49,374
the explosive was black powder.

271
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,232
With all this happening together,

272
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,816
don't you want to know who Lan Lan actually is?

273
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,874
What are you trying to say?

274
00:21:56,874 --> 00:22:00,832
What I'm trying to say is don't be too sad before knowing the truth.

275
00:22:00,832 --> 00:22:04,666
Maybe the Lan Lan you know isn't who she really is.

276
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,416
Shut up, don't slander her.

277
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,766
Who let you come in?

278
00:22:38,432 --> 00:22:40,240
Sorry, Director Yin.

279
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:42,582
I didn't know you were here.

280
00:22:42,582 --> 00:22:44,432
I'll get out.

281
00:22:44,432 --> 00:22:45,839
Stop.

282
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,582
What did I tell you?

283
00:22:49,582 --> 00:22:52,415
I asked you to change the flowers in Lan Lan's lounge every day.

284
00:22:52,415 --> 00:22:54,582
Don't let a single flower petal drop on the floor.

285
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,432
See for yourself.

286
00:22:56,432 --> 00:22:58,557
How many days has it been since you changed the flowers?

287
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:00,124
What have you been doing?

288
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:04,849
Don't think that you can stop just because Lan Lan isn't here right now.

289
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:06,557
Listen.

290
00:23:06,557 --> 00:23:08,499
As long as you still work here,

291
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:10,591
you have to change the flowers everyday.

292
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,424
You have to make sure you do it just as if Lan Lan was still here.

293
00:23:14,982 --> 00:23:16,749
Understand?

294
00:23:20,374 --> 00:23:21,839
Yes.

295
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:24,174
Leave.

296
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,474
Assistant Qiao,

297
00:24:27,474 --> 00:24:29,858
help me find an expert.

298
00:24:29,858 --> 00:24:33,158
I have a shredded file that needs recovering.

299
00:24:36,332 --> 00:24:38,891
Miss Lan, it's time to change medicine.

300
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:37,816
Director Yin, this is the file from the expert.

301
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:34,916
<i>Do you remember the neighbor I told you about?</i>

302
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:39,265
<i>I received a call from my mom today.</i>

303
00:27:39,874 --> 00:27:41,758
<i>She said she's missing.</i>

304
00:27:43,207 --> 00:27:48,274
<i>I think she couldn't stand her stepfather's abuse any longer,</i>

305
00:27:48,274 --> 00:27:50,274
<i>so she ran away from home.</i>

306
00:27:51,265 --> 00:27:56,423
<i>But we don't know if she's dead or alive.</i>

307
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,799
<i>It's really sad.</i>

308
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:08,982
<i>You don't have to hide anything from me.</i>

309
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,774
<i>I already guessed it.</i>

310
00:28:16,724 --> 00:28:19,349
<i>The neighbor that you talk about,</i>

311
00:28:20,557 --> 00:28:22,840
<i>it's you, isn't it?</i>

312
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:47,939
<i>Lan Lan,</i>

313
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:51,823
<i>I don't care about your past.</i>

314
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:55,749
<i>It's all in the past.</i>

315
00:28:55,749 --> 00:28:58,340
<i>I will protect you.</i>

316
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,899
Dad, I'm back.

317
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:12,866
You're back, come.

318
00:29:17,207 --> 00:29:19,732
Dad, do you have a guest?

319
00:29:19,732 --> 00:29:24,632
No, I want to eat dumplings with your mom today.

320
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:26,224
Come sit.

321
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:44,266
Xiaoxiao.

322
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:48,082
Aside from seeing the doctor, I came to Beijing this time

323
00:29:48,082 --> 00:29:53,049
because I have something important to tell you.

324
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,640
What is it?

325
00:29:56,832 --> 00:29:58,540
Don't scare me.

326
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,130
It's not about me.

327
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,830
It's something that has to do with you.

328
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:05,323
Me?

329
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:13,939
I didn't tell you about this

330
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,882
because I don't know how to say it.

331
00:30:23,749 --> 00:30:28,557
Dad, stop hesitating.

332
00:30:29,482 --> 00:30:31,299
Just tell me.

333
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:38,107
I said I wanted to have dumplings with your mom today

334
00:30:38,107 --> 00:30:42,949
because I wanted to tell you this in front of your mom.

335
00:31:01,732 --> 00:31:05,290
Isn't that me?

336
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,274
This is you,

337
00:31:07,274 --> 00:31:11,432
the one beside you is your twin sister.

338
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:14,958
Twin sister?

339
00:31:18,232 --> 00:31:20,791
Are you kidding?

340
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:21,666
Last time didn't you say...

341
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:24,965
I lied.

342
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:30,839
What's going on?

343
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,249
I...

344
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,850
Actually,

345
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,140
you aren't my real daughter.

346
00:31:52,582 --> 00:31:55,932
Xiaoxiao, listen to me.

347
00:31:55,932 --> 00:32:00,916
I had a lot to think about before deciding to tell you about this.

348
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:02,666
I hesitated for a long time.

349
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:05,749
I didn't know when it was the right time to tell you about this.

350
00:32:05,749 --> 00:32:10,290
If you would hate me after I told you.

351
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:13,290
Or if you would stay away from me.

352
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:16,249
I chose to tell you the truth today

353
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:18,999
because I think you're all grown up now.

354
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:20,974
You're independent now.

355
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:26,232
Since you asked me if you had a sister last time,

356
00:32:27,315 --> 00:32:30,549
I've been feeling uneasy.

357
00:32:32,207 --> 00:32:36,024
So I decided to tell you today.

358
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,424
Zhang Zejiang.

359
00:32:40,707 --> 00:32:42,882
You sure kept this to yourself for a long time.

360
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:48,107
Is there anything else I don't know about?

361
00:32:48,107 --> 00:32:49,899
Who is my father?

362
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:52,424
I don't know who he is either.

363
00:32:53,315 --> 00:32:55,791
When I met your mother 25 years ago,

364
00:32:55,791 --> 00:33:00,666
she was on her last breath.

365
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:04,874
She was on the brink of death when I got her to the hospital.

366
00:33:04,874 --> 00:33:07,058
After the procedure,

367
00:33:11,607 --> 00:33:14,258
only the two of you survived,

368
00:33:15,832 --> 00:33:18,007
and she passed away.

369
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:24,916
Xiaoxiao, at that time...

370
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:28,249
I didn't have money at that time.

371
00:33:28,249 --> 00:33:30,616
I didn't know how to take care of a child.

372
00:33:31,874 --> 00:33:35,615
I couldn't raise both of you.

373
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,774
So I passed your sister

374
00:33:43,082 --> 00:33:46,207
to a young couple.

375
00:33:46,207 --> 00:33:48,258
They're nice people.

376
00:33:50,207 --> 00:33:52,691
They took good care of your sister.

377
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,824
Before leaving her,

378
00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:04,565
I separated the white magnolia earrings that your mom left.

379
00:34:06,082 --> 00:34:08,049
One for her,

380
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,316
one for you.

381
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,691
Don't cry.

382
00:34:57,249 --> 00:35:02,040
I'm sorry for telling you so much at once.

383
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,139
I know you're sad.

384
00:35:04,707 --> 00:35:09,190
You can't accept this all at once.

385
00:35:10,774 --> 00:35:15,166
Since you know I'm not your dad,

386
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:18,532
from now on,

387
00:35:19,374 --> 00:35:21,940
you don't have to call me Dad.

388
00:35:24,182 --> 00:35:29,550
Dad, you will be my dad forever.

389
00:35:30,315 --> 00:35:35,732
Don't cry.

390
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:37,674
I'm sorry.

391
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:39,215
Dad.

392
00:35:42,357 --> 00:35:45,674
I'm crying for my sister.

393
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:52,958
Xiaoxiao, have you met your sister?

394
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:55,457
Her name is Lan Lan.

395
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:56,940
Lan Lan?

396
00:36:00,766 --> 00:36:01,816
Where is she?

397
00:36:01,816 --> 00:36:04,316
Where is she? Tell me.

398
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,649
Tell me where she is.

399
00:36:10,649 --> 00:36:12,932
Tell me.

400
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,950
<i>[Outpatient]</i>

401
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:24,140
Sister.

402
00:36:27,182 --> 00:36:29,799
Nurse, where is the patient?

403
00:36:30,374 --> 00:36:31,916
I didn't see her.

404
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:34,016
Did she go to the bathroom?

405
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:43,999
The blanket is cold.

406
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:47,024
She's probably been gone for a while.

407
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:56,424
Dad.

408
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:08,082
Lan Lan.

409
00:37:08,082 --> 00:37:12,480
It's her.

410
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,090
Hello?

411
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:09,858
What? She's missing?

412
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:18,749
Mr. Yin, we went to every corner of the hospital with you.

413
00:38:18,749 --> 00:38:21,039
Miss Lan really isn't here.

414
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,415
What do you guys even do?

415
00:38:22,415 --> 00:38:23,999
You can't even watch over a patient.

416
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:25,649
Sorry, Mr. Yin.

417
00:38:25,649 --> 00:38:28,123
She can't go far with her injuries.

418
00:38:28,123 --> 00:38:29,415
We already called the police.

419
00:38:29,415 --> 00:38:31,440
I believe we can find her soon.

420
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,749
But it's late now.

421
00:38:32,749 --> 00:38:34,140
Stop it.

422
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,374
I'll wait for her here.

423
00:38:35,374 --> 00:38:37,215
Go find her.

424
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:38,990
Okay.

425
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,665
Why are you here?

426
00:39:23,457 --> 00:39:26,120
I have something to tell you.

427
00:39:27,482 --> 00:39:28,958
Lan Lan

428
00:39:30,374 --> 00:39:32,874
is my twin sister.

429
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:34,624
Who told you that?

430
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:37,039
My dad.

431
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:39,316
So what if you're her sister?

432
00:39:40,582 --> 00:39:42,774
I won't forgive you.

433
00:39:44,207 --> 00:39:46,682
She's gone missing.

434
00:39:51,999 --> 00:39:54,299
This is Lan Lan's earring.

435
00:39:55,082 --> 00:39:57,249
It was my mom's.

436
00:39:58,123 --> 00:40:00,323
We each have one.

437
00:40:13,082 --> 00:40:15,916
<i>Why are you wearing just one earring?</i>

438
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:18,190
<i>Because I only have one.</i>

439
00:40:22,165 --> 00:40:27,082
♫ <i>In the late night</i> ♫

440
00:40:27,082 --> 00:40:33,182
♫ <i>The pedestrians crowd the streets</i> ♫

441
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:37,939
♫ <i>Stopping in place</i> ♫

442
00:40:37,939 --> 00:40:43,366
♫ <i>Not knowing how to keep going</i> ♫

443
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,082
♫ <i>I hug you tightly</i> ♫

444
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:50,123
♫ <i>The words of deep love</i> ♫

445
00:40:50,123 --> 00:40:55,274
♫ <i>Like the end of a movie, separated by each scene</i> ♫

446
00:40:55,274 --> 00:40:57,232
♫ <i>It falls to the bottom of my heart</i> ♫

447
00:40:57,232 --> 00:40:58,666
Lan Lan.

448
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,315
Lan Lan.

449
00:41:11,307 --> 00:41:13,082
Where were you?

450
00:41:13,082 --> 00:41:14,682
I've been looking for you.

451
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:16,549
They say I'm crazy.

452
00:41:17,182 --> 00:41:19,149
They say I can't find you.

453
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:25,415
I finally found you.

454
00:41:25,415 --> 00:41:27,415
Promise me.

455
00:41:27,415 --> 00:41:30,374
No matter what happens,

456
00:41:30,374 --> 00:41:32,539
don't ever leave me.

457
00:41:35,582 --> 00:41:37,374
Sorry.

458
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:41,250
I came to say goodbye to you.

459
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,632
What did you say?

460
00:41:45,691 --> 00:41:47,632
Forget about me.

461
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:53,300
Pretend I never existed.

462
00:41:57,165 --> 00:41:58,591
No way.

463
00:42:00,058 --> 00:42:02,265
I won't let you leave me.

464
00:42:02,265 --> 00:42:03,816
I don't want you to leave me.

465
00:42:03,816 --> 00:42:05,582
I have to go.

466
00:42:07,832 --> 00:42:10,500
We will never meet again.

467
00:42:12,482 --> 00:42:14,124
Forget about me.

468
00:42:16,474 --> 00:42:21,249
♫ <i>Who remembers the day we broke up?</i> ♫

469
00:42:21,249 --> 00:42:26,691
♫ <i>It was still raining</i> ♫

470
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:32,123
♫ <i>We promised not to give up</i> ♫

471
00:42:32,123 --> 00:42:37,958
♫ <i>We were really stupid</i> ♫

472
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:40,832
♫ <i>Now I'm left all alone</i> ♫

473
00:42:40,832 --> 00:42:42,182
Brother.

474
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,123
Assistant Qiao says you've been here for a whole day.

475
00:42:46,123 --> 00:42:47,749
You should go home first.

476
00:42:47,749 --> 00:42:49,140
Mom is worried about you.

477
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,791
It doesn't help to wait for her here.

478
00:42:51,791 --> 00:42:54,374
Did you find her?

479
00:42:54,374 --> 00:42:55,958
Still no news of her.

480
00:42:55,958 --> 00:42:58,557
We've mobilized all our forces to find her.

481
00:42:58,557 --> 00:43:01,207
They'll inform me as soon as they hear anything.

482
00:43:01,207 --> 00:43:05,123
Find her no matter what.

483
00:43:05,123 --> 00:43:07,091
Find her!
