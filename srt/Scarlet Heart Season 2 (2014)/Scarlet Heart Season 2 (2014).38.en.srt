<i>[Episode 38]</i>

3
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,420
Welcome.

4
00:01:50,062 --> 00:01:51,520
Yinuo.

5
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:55,300
A moment, please.

6
00:01:56,312 --> 00:01:57,687
Sister.

7
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:05,479
I wanted to thank you personally,

8
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,687
but I thought it wouldn't be good to bump into Sihan.

9
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,003
Thank you.

10
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,245
You're welcome.

11
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:16,696
Sihan isn't a bad guy.

12
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:20,254
After all that's happened,

13
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:24,762
I believe that we'll keep getting better.

14
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,612
Happy to hear that.

15
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,303
Are you leaving for Yunnan soon?

16
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,137
All the best.

17
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:40,287
Miss, please sign here.

18
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:45,220
Thank you.

19
00:02:47,812 --> 00:02:49,138
Bye.

20
00:02:54,712 --> 00:02:56,045
Thank you.

21
00:02:56,662 --> 00:02:59,479
Sir, your friend forgot her card.

22
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,379
I'll get it back to her.

23
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:01,971
Please check out first.

24
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,254
Yinuo.

25
00:03:17,546 --> 00:03:20,420
Yinuo, your card.

26
00:03:21,354 --> 00:03:22,704
Thank you.

27
00:03:25,245 --> 00:03:27,479
When are you leaving?

28
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,254
Tomorrow.

29
00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:33,896
Are you planning on settling down there?

30
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:37,287
Yes, that's the plan for now.

31
00:03:39,996 --> 00:03:44,187
My very best wishes to you both.

32
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:51,871
There's something I still want to remind you of.

33
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:55,395
I think Sihan will get better

34
00:03:55,395 --> 00:03:57,796
after Zhang Xiao and I leave Beijing.

35
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,896
But he's holding on to so much hatred.

36
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,154
I'm afraid he won't get past this so easily.

37
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:11,070
However, I believe time can change everything.

38
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,404
Hello?

39
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:24,045
Yinuo, where are you?

40
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:26,812
I am shopping now.

41
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:28,579
Alone?

42
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:35,587
Yes. Just shopping alone.

43
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:37,354
Don't always be alone.

44
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:39,203
You will feel bored.

45
00:04:41,671 --> 00:04:43,245
Did you need something?

46
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:46,087
You were right yesterday.

47
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:48,312
If you see Yin Zheng,

48
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:50,979
please apologize to him on my behalf.

49
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:52,812
Okay.

50
00:04:52,812 --> 00:04:55,796
Bye.

51
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:02,729
Sihan wants to to apologize to you on his behalf.

52
00:05:04,812 --> 00:05:06,629
It's in the past now.

53
00:05:08,454 --> 00:05:10,312
Take care of him.

54
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:12,870
Give us a call if you need anything.

55
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:16,129
Bye.

56
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,062
Yin Zheng.

57
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:31,620
Since you are leaving soon,

58
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,729
we may not see each other again.

59
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:37,854
I have something to tell you.

60
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:45,387
Then let's find somewhere to talk.

61
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,187
Come.

62
00:05:55,896 --> 00:05:57,546
For two? This way, please.

63
00:05:57,546 --> 00:05:59,019
Okay, take your seat first.

64
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:00,904
I need to make a call.

65
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,646
- Hello?
- Hello?

66
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:20,071
Zhang Xiao.

67
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:23,162
I bumped into a friend.

68
00:06:23,162 --> 00:06:26,512
Go home first. I'll be back soon.

69
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:28,387
Okay.

70
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:45,646
If it wasn't for you leaving,

71
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:48,845
I would keep this secret forever.

72
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,303
However, since you're both leaving here forever,

73
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:57,262
I think I should tell you this.

74
00:06:58,145 --> 00:07:00,479
First, it's to let go of all my burdens.

75
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:05,804
Secondly, it's so you can leave here with no strings attached.

76
00:07:07,646 --> 00:07:09,787
Is this about Sihan?

77
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:15,646
It's about Lan Lan.

78
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:21,620
She is still alive.

79
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:24,795
Impossible.

80
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:27,045
I saw her dead body with my own eyes.

81
00:07:30,554 --> 00:07:32,704
If Lan Lan is still alive,

82
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,554
where is she now?

83
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,187
She fell apart

84
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:44,279
after she was injured.

85
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:47,537
She was thinking about committing suicide.

86
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,996
But before she did it,

87
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:53,219
she suddenly woke up

88
00:07:54,437 --> 00:07:56,796
and gave up on the idea.

89
00:07:57,437 --> 00:08:01,910
After that, she had cosmetic surgery,

90
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:05,337
got a new identity,

91
00:08:05,337 --> 00:08:07,887
and started her new life.

92
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,237
I don't think it's necessary for me to describe

93
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:17,003
the details of her story.

94
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:21,504
Because I'm sure you've had a similar experience.

95
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:24,762
And so, you thought of the idea, "What I want in life".

96
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:32,579
You are Lan Lan.

97
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:35,879
I'm Ma Yinuo now.

98
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,504
I am just telling you

99
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:45,104
about a person I don't even know anymore.

100
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:49,045
Keep going.

101
00:08:51,145 --> 00:08:56,104
Lan Lan believes in rebirth.

102
00:08:57,562 --> 00:09:01,445
She also hopes for her friends

103
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:04,810
to find their happiness.

104
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:11,203
She's very happy to see

105
00:09:11,203 --> 00:09:13,546
that you and Zhang Xiao are happily together.

106
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:16,129
Genuinely.

107
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:18,454
How about you?

108
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:24,838
I am pretty good.

109
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:29,962
Sihan and I went through some hardships together

110
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:32,870
and we mutual support each other.

111
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:39,795
Although he was once blinded by revenge,

112
00:09:41,854 --> 00:09:46,738
he's changed because of love.

113
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:50,337
I do hope this guy

114
00:09:53,312 --> 00:09:55,554
can treat Lan Lan well.

115
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,879
And never fail her.

116
00:10:19,838 --> 00:10:22,103
Thank for telling me all this.

117
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:29,212
I do hope that while I'm not at Lan Lan's side,

118
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,629
she can take good care of herself.

119
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:45,912
I need to go.

120
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:55,754
Yinuo.

121
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,920
Zhang Xiao misses Lan Lan very much.

122
00:11:06,996 --> 00:11:11,104
Did you tell her about Lan Lan yet?

123
00:11:15,771 --> 00:11:20,329
Let bygones be bygones.

124
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:26,796
I think this is the happy ending for us all.

125
00:11:32,687 --> 00:11:34,820
The magnolia hairpin.

126
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,554
Give it to Xiaoxiao.

127
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,996
Take care.

128
00:11:45,812 --> 00:11:47,437
You too.

129
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:56,537
We will be good.

130
00:12:02,729 --> 00:12:04,671
Everything will be good.

131
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:03,212
Sihan, why are you here?

132
00:13:14,854 --> 00:13:16,579
It's nothing.

133
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:19,387
I know you're leaving soon,

134
00:13:19,387 --> 00:13:21,112
so I came to say goodbye to you.

135
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,046
Thank you for everything.

136
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:30,429
You listened to Yinuo to put your grudges behind you.

137
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:32,295
We are so happy.

138
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,379
Is that so?

139
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:41,746
With Yinuo by your side,

140
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:44,162
we have nothing to worry about

141
00:13:44,162 --> 00:13:46,237
after we leave.

142
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:50,771
You are right.

143
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:53,879
Luckily, Yinuo is always here to advise me.

144
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,479
I did some very wrong things.

145
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:02,537
Is there still a chance

146
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:06,987
for us to sit down to have a chat and make up peacefully?

147
00:14:09,604 --> 00:14:11,100
Sure.

148
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,879
Let me talk to Yin Zheng.

149
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:16,337
Great, it's a deal then.

150
00:14:17,354 --> 00:14:19,629
Consider it a farewell party.

151
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:22,604
Okay.

152
00:14:22,604 --> 00:14:24,270
I'll be waiting for your call.

153
00:14:53,954 --> 00:14:55,679
Didn't you

154
00:14:57,812 --> 00:15:00,340
give this hairpin to my sister?

155
00:15:02,454 --> 00:15:05,070
After going around in circles for so long,

156
00:15:06,354 --> 00:15:10,604
this hairpin should belong to the girl I first met at the museum.

157
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,087
You are its true owner.

158
00:15:20,162 --> 00:15:21,804
Don't be upset.

159
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:29,829
Your sister just changed her identity

160
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:32,546
and is living a good life in another world.

161
00:15:33,495 --> 00:15:35,412
Do not forget.

162
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:37,954
It's called having faith.

163
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:42,487
I trust that she gives us her blessings.

164
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:54,245
We're flying out tomorrow.

165
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:58,679
The boss of the teahouse in Yunnan shouldn't have teary eyes.

166
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:06,312
By the way,

167
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:08,746
there's something I need to talk to you about.

168
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:12,820
I saw Sihan downstairs.

169
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:18,037
He seems to have really changed.

170
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:22,771
He admitted that he's done a lot of extreme things.

171
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:26,262
He wants to invite us for dinner to apologize.

172
00:16:27,604 --> 00:16:29,587
After so many things has happened,

173
00:16:31,187 --> 00:16:34,454
I just can't believe that he turned around so quickly.

174
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,319
I'm worried he's going to try something.

175
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:45,479
I understand.

176
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:48,079
You're always worried about Sihan.

177
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:53,245
But maybe he's really come around.

178
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,779
It's a chance for us to reconcile with him.

179
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,520
After that, we can go to Yunnan with ease.

180
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,003
Don't you think so?

181
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:05,746
And,

182
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:09,246
this is your dad's wish too.

183
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,312
I should meet with Sihan

184
00:17:20,312 --> 00:17:23,003
to understand what is on his mind now.

185
00:17:24,938 --> 00:17:26,696
Let's do it.

186
00:17:29,162 --> 00:17:31,287
I'll change our flight then.

187
00:18:56,062 --> 00:18:57,620
Baby.

188
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:00,520
Are you not happy with Mom

189
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,404
for not telling Dad about you?

190
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,145
Zhang Xiao.

191
00:19:16,145 --> 00:19:18,796
Okay, see you tonight.

192
00:19:46,287 --> 00:19:50,220
I didn't expect you to invite them.

193
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:56,979
I didn't tell you because I wanted to give you a surprise.

194
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:58,579
Zhang Xiao is your younger sister.

195
00:19:58,579 --> 00:20:00,962
Although you have no intentions to tell her,

196
00:20:01,495 --> 00:20:05,454
you might still want to see them before they leave.

197
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:10,312
I know you put in a lot of effort

198
00:20:10,312 --> 00:20:13,120
to make things right with them.

199
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,919
I get it.

200
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:25,219
After tonight,

201
00:20:26,262 --> 00:20:29,038
we can start our new life,

202
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,187
Right?

203
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,520
Of course.

204
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:43,103
Be confident in Sihan, okay?

205
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:45,462
Don't look so worried.

206
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,470
Your phone.

207
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:53,729
Huang Di.

208
00:20:53,729 --> 00:20:55,662
Zhang Xiao.

209
00:20:55,662 --> 00:20:57,520
You have no heart.

210
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,203
You didn't even tell me that you were going to Yunnan soon.

211
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:02,287
I am sorry.

212
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:04,479
So many things have been happening recently.

213
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:08,337
I planned on inviting you all after I settled down.

214
00:21:08,337 --> 00:21:09,938
It's okay.

215
00:21:09,938 --> 00:21:12,604
I'm very kind to my friends.

216
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,354
I always put myself in other people's shoes.

217
00:21:15,354 --> 00:21:17,395
I'll give you a chance to make it up to me.

218
00:21:17,395 --> 00:21:19,838
Where are you? I'll come pick you up.

219
00:21:19,838 --> 00:21:22,537
Huang Di, thank you.

220
00:21:22,537 --> 00:21:25,587
But I have plans tonight.

221
00:21:25,587 --> 00:21:27,838
Zhang Xiao.

222
00:21:27,838 --> 00:21:31,412
Time is like water in the sponge.

223
00:21:31,412 --> 00:21:33,879
Squeeze it in and there's always some extra free time.

224
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:36,203
It's just a matter of whether or not you're willing to come.

225
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:39,312
What happened?

226
00:21:39,312 --> 00:21:41,103
Nothing.

227
00:21:41,103 --> 00:21:42,329
I just have something to tell you.

228
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:45,595
I will tell you upon your arrival.

229
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,604
What is it?

230
00:21:47,604 --> 00:21:49,929
I'll tell you when you get here.

231
00:21:51,312 --> 00:21:53,637
How dare you bite me?

232
00:21:55,262 --> 00:21:57,350
Did something happen?

233
00:21:57,871 --> 00:22:00,687
Huang Di says he wants to say goodbye to me.

234
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:02,379
We'll talk about this later.

235
00:22:14,537 --> 00:22:16,495
You're here.

236
00:22:16,495 --> 00:22:17,871
Yinuo.

237
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:21,979
I'm glad to be able to see you before we leave.

238
00:22:21,979 --> 00:22:24,019
Me too.

239
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:25,471
Come in please.

240
00:22:32,354 --> 00:22:33,796
Welcome.

241
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:35,395
Thanks for your invitation.

242
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,838
Take a seat.

243
00:22:44,187 --> 00:22:45,896
I didn't expect

244
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:50,062
for all four of us to be able to sit here and chat today.

245
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,671
Yin Zheng, to say I don't hate you anymore,

246
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:57,712
not only would you not believe that, but neither do I.

247
00:22:57,712 --> 00:23:00,579
I am not a saint, I am not that great.

248
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:05,120
However, to hate someone is to cause oneself to suffer.

249
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,038
I'm just hurting those around me.

250
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:10,462
I don't want to keep doing this.

251
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:14,595
Come on, let's drink.

252
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,312
To make peace.

253
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:28,395
Sihan, I hope you can understand.

254
00:23:28,395 --> 00:23:30,712
Revenge not only destroys others,

255
00:23:30,712 --> 00:23:32,679
it also destroys oneself.

256
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,495
Just like how Dad was so tolerant to me,

257
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:38,704
but I treated him so cruelly.

258
00:23:40,187 --> 00:23:42,438
I still regret it now.

259
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:46,354
I do hope you can put all your resentment behind you.

260
00:23:46,354 --> 00:23:48,046
Okay.

261
00:23:48,046 --> 00:23:50,587
Let's put an end to all of it today.

262
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:55,729
This is for Meng Xinyi.

263
00:23:55,729 --> 00:23:57,162
Drink up.

264
00:24:02,646 --> 00:24:03,962
Sihan.

265
00:24:03,962 --> 00:24:07,404
There's no need to drink so much.

266
00:24:09,312 --> 00:24:11,879
You're so considerate.

267
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:20,412
Yinuo means that alcohol should be enjoyed slowly.

268
00:24:22,354 --> 00:24:24,370
It's okay.

269
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:29,187
Since Sihan mentioned that we're putting an end to all the resentment today,

270
00:24:29,187 --> 00:24:32,812
I can drink as many as you want.

271
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,720
This is for Dad.

272
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,250
Drink up.

273
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,337
For Dad. I drink.

274
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:40,354
I prepared two bottles.

275
00:25:40,354 --> 00:25:42,771
The liquor just now

276
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:46,579
represented our miserable past.

277
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,771
Yin Zheng finished his drinks.

278
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:51,646
This indicates that our past has been written off.

279
00:25:51,646 --> 00:25:53,604
The next bottle is red wine,

280
00:25:53,604 --> 00:25:59,029
representing our comfortable life in the future.

281
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:02,437
Come on, cheers.

282
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,979
Come on, cheers.

283
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:45,771
Come in.

284
00:26:47,162 --> 00:26:48,729
What are you doing here?

285
00:26:48,729 --> 00:26:50,312
Not bad.

286
00:26:50,896 --> 00:26:53,771
Director Kang, Director Yin, you're both here.

287
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:55,437
What are you doing here?

288
00:26:55,437 --> 00:26:56,871
I...

289
00:26:56,871 --> 00:26:59,646
I'm leaving to Yunnan with Yin Zheng tomorrow.

290
00:26:59,646 --> 00:27:02,095
Huang Di wanted to say goodbye to me.

291
00:27:03,062 --> 00:27:04,162
You better go away now.

292
00:27:04,162 --> 00:27:06,129
You're spoiling the mood.

293
00:27:07,854 --> 00:27:11,771
It's my mistake.

294
00:27:11,771 --> 00:27:16,096
There's a reason I'm asking Zhang Xiao to come with me.

295
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:20,854
Because I have decided...

296
00:27:20,854 --> 00:27:24,146
to propose to Ling Dang.

297
00:27:25,838 --> 00:27:29,045
You want to get married?

298
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:34,871
I feel that Ling Dang is my confidant.

299
00:27:34,871 --> 00:27:38,412
I feel comfortable with her.

300
00:27:38,412 --> 00:27:41,912
She can give me a sense of security.

301
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,019
Let Zhang Xiao go.

302
00:27:46,646 --> 00:27:47,687
Come back soon.

303
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:49,529
We'll wait for you while we eat.

304
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,660
Wait.

305
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:58,854
We will let you go only if you finish your drink.

306
00:28:00,996 --> 00:28:04,062
You can drive my car. It'll be faster.

307
00:28:04,062 --> 00:28:06,038
I will finish her drink.

308
00:28:11,771 --> 00:28:13,804
Just kidding.

309
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,420
Just go.

310
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,871
We'll wait for you.

311
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:21,254
Okay, I'll be back soon.

312
00:28:23,812 --> 00:28:26,271
Thank you. Sorry for disturbing.

313
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:37,145
Director Kang looked so scary just now.

314
00:28:37,145 --> 00:28:38,971
I was so scared.

315
00:28:39,812 --> 00:28:42,687
Sihan has been getting easily irritated nowdays.

316
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:44,262
It's fine.

317
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:46,996
Okay.

318
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,312
Friends.

319
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,954
My best friend Zhang Xiao is here.

320
00:29:10,954 --> 00:29:12,219
Huang Li, Zhang Xiao.

321
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:13,954
Come here.

322
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:17,245
Ling Dang.

323
00:29:17,245 --> 00:29:19,579
Thanks for saying farewell to me.

324
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:21,579
You're welcome. Take a seat.

325
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:22,754
Come on.

326
00:29:28,412 --> 00:29:31,245
I want to say something.

327
00:29:31,245 --> 00:29:36,103
My best friend Zhang Xiao is going to Yunnan to settle down with her boyfriend.

328
00:29:36,103 --> 00:29:38,854
I wish her all the best

329
00:29:38,854 --> 00:29:40,420
and for her to have a good future.

330
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,629
Cheers.

331
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:44,229
Cheers!

332
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:47,029
Thank you.

333
00:29:51,954 --> 00:29:53,919
Thank you.

334
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,295
You're welcome.

335
00:29:58,162 --> 00:29:59,880
I'll drink with you later.

336
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,070
Come here.

337
00:30:04,379 --> 00:30:06,504
This is Miss Liu.

338
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,270
She always takes care of me at the company.

339
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,145
Nice to meet you. Thank you for taking care of him.

340
00:30:10,145 --> 00:30:12,045
You're welcome.

341
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,430
<i>[Don't worry about me. You just have your fun. Don't rush back.]</i>

342
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:31,079
Don't you have something to say?

343
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,654
You can say it now.

344
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:35,771
I have two reasons.

345
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:39,254
First, if I propose to her and she rejects me,

346
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,896
that would be so embarrassing.

347
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,520
Second,

348
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,754
if I propose to her,

349
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:47,229
many ladies' hearts will be broken.

350
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:48,704
Ling Dang.

351
00:30:49,203 --> 00:30:51,654
Huang Di has something to tell you.

352
00:30:51,654 --> 00:30:52,929
What are you doing?

353
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:55,020
I don't know what I'm going to say yet.

354
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,003
I am helping you.

355
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,003
What happened?

356
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:05,170
The weather is great today.

357
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,062
Ling Dang.

358
00:31:16,337 --> 00:31:18,896
Do you want...

359
00:31:18,896 --> 00:31:23,270
to have a good looking man who is good at cooking

360
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:26,987
and generous to be your husband?

361
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:41,462
Ling Dang, I've loved you for a long time.

362
00:31:41,462 --> 00:31:44,120
I hope you'll marry me.

363
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,087
Why should I marry you?

364
00:31:47,687 --> 00:31:49,287
Why?

365
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:50,270
I've been with you for so long.

366
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,896
I never scolded you for bullying me.

367
00:31:51,896 --> 00:31:54,187
That's because you can't win in an argument.

368
00:31:54,187 --> 00:31:55,629
I also never fight with you.

369
00:31:55,629 --> 00:31:58,103
That's because you can't beat me.

370
00:31:58,103 --> 00:31:59,462
I sing for you.

371
00:31:59,462 --> 00:32:02,438
That's because you want me to buy you a drink.

372
00:32:03,896 --> 00:32:05,354
Yes, I want you to buy me a drink.

373
00:32:05,354 --> 00:32:07,012
I like your cocktails.

374
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:09,170
Can't I want to drink them for the rest of my life?

375
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,938
Alright.

376
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:14,896
I know what you're both trying to say.

377
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:18,437
Huang Di, what you're trying to say

378
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:22,262
is that Ling Dang has converted you from a person with no future plan

379
00:32:22,262 --> 00:32:25,670
to the responsible person you are now.

380
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,938
And you wish to be with Ling Dang for the rest of your life.

381
00:32:27,938 --> 00:32:29,687
Yes.

382
00:32:29,687 --> 00:32:33,096
Ling Dang, what you're trying to say

383
00:32:33,096 --> 00:32:36,103
is that although Huang Di has many bad habits,

384
00:32:36,103 --> 00:32:39,429
you are still willing to tolerate them for the rest of your life.

385
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:46,320
I just knew this would happen.

386
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:51,087
Such a waste.

387
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:55,896
I knew it.

388
00:32:55,896 --> 00:32:58,079
I knew you would say yes.

389
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:00,879
Let me put it on for you.

390
00:33:04,646 --> 00:33:07,029
We're together now.

391
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:26,020
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

392
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,579
<i>You just have your fun.</i>

393
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:29,512
<i>Do not rush back.</i>

394
00:33:38,537 --> 00:33:40,029
Sihan.

395
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:46,245
Miss, you can't go in right now.

396
00:33:46,245 --> 00:33:47,904
The police aren't here yet.

397
00:33:52,287 --> 00:33:56,946
I proposed for the four of us to get together.

398
00:33:57,979 --> 00:34:01,704
Because Yin Zheng and I had a lot of conflict,

399
00:34:01,704 --> 00:34:06,462
I wanted to resolve them with this gathering.

400
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:09,162
However, I didn't expect

401
00:34:09,162 --> 00:34:15,162
to get into a fight with him during the gathering.

402
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:21,370
After that, Yinuo lay on the floor in blood.

403
00:34:22,912 --> 00:34:25,719
What is Yin Zheng and Ma Yinuo's relationship?

404
00:34:28,145 --> 00:34:32,871
Ma Yinuo is Lan Lan after cosmetic surgery.

405
00:34:34,287 --> 00:34:37,495
She and Yin Zheng used to date.

406
00:34:37,495 --> 00:34:40,003
Then what is your relationship with Ma Yinuo?

407
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:46,779
We are friends.

408
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:50,954
What about you and Yin Zheng?

409
00:34:52,562 --> 00:34:58,045
Yin Zheng and I are step-brothers.

410
00:34:58,746 --> 00:35:00,019
Miss Zhang.

411
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:01,838
What's your relationship with Lan Lan?

412
00:35:02,812 --> 00:35:05,145
Lan Lan is my elder sister.

413
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:08,854
But she has been missing for quite some time.

414
00:35:08,854 --> 00:35:11,520
However, according to Mr. Kang Sihan,

415
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,187
Ma Yinuo is Lan Lan.

416
00:35:13,187 --> 00:35:17,854
She changed her look through cosmetic surgery

417
00:35:17,854 --> 00:35:20,487
in hopes of getting back together with Yin Zheng.

418
00:35:23,495 --> 00:35:28,295
Ma Yinuo is Lan Lan?

419
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:33,162
Do you know if Yin Zheng and Ma Yinuo had any conflicts before?

420
00:35:38,729 --> 00:35:41,604
If Ma Yinuo is Lan Lan,

421
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,519
Yin Zheng will not hurt her.

422
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:52,412
Please tell me the truth about what happened.

423
00:35:52,412 --> 00:35:54,595
I heard a man shout

424
00:35:54,595 --> 00:35:56,729
so I broke into the room.

425
00:35:56,729 --> 00:36:00,287
What did you see after you broke in?

426
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:04,329
I saw a man and a lady lay in blood.

427
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,437
Another man was squatting down inside the room.

428
00:36:07,437 --> 00:36:10,954
You and Kang Sihan are step-brothers, right?

429
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,003
Do you have good rapport with him?

430
00:36:16,103 --> 00:36:19,871
Why was Miss Ma Yinuo laying in blood?

431
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:29,754
And why did you faint?

432
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:38,962
I accidentally hurt her.

433
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,254
I thought I killed her,

434
00:36:44,762 --> 00:36:47,095
so I tried to commit suicide in fear of punishment.

435
00:36:48,912 --> 00:36:50,345
Take him away.

436
00:37:16,938 --> 00:37:20,720
I have no fault. I have no fault.

437
00:37:22,595 --> 00:37:24,971
This is not my fault.

438
00:37:25,796 --> 00:37:27,129
Yes.

439
00:37:28,345 --> 00:37:31,454
This is not my fault.

440
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:43,587
Why are you here?

441
00:37:45,395 --> 00:37:47,304
I just saw the doctor.

442
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:51,812
She said Yinuo is still under observation.

443
00:37:53,979 --> 00:37:55,370
Wait.

444
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,329
I know you won't listen to anything I have to say.

445
00:38:03,454 --> 00:38:05,429
But I still want to tell you.

446
00:38:06,812 --> 00:38:10,740
Love can make someone forget about resentment,

447
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:15,879
but resentment can cause someone to be oblivious to love.

448
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:22,271
I believe Yin Zheng is innocent.

449
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:33,771
I know he wants to use love to let you forget about resentment.

450
00:38:36,495 --> 00:38:38,229
However,

451
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:42,029
I personally feel like it's not a good idea

452
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:45,290
for him to be your scapegoat.

453
00:38:46,187 --> 00:38:49,645
But I really hope that you can see his kind intentions.

454
00:38:52,896 --> 00:39:01,204
Impossible. Impossible.

455
00:39:01,846 --> 00:39:03,296
Impossible.

456
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:08,145
Impossible.

457
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:11,850
Yin Zheng and Yinuo still have feelings for each other.

458
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,970
Impossible.

459
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,771
Yinuo is still unconscious.

460
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:22,019
She can't talk right now.

461
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,920
But look at these photos.

462
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,845
Then you'll know how much she loves you.

463
00:39:34,229 --> 00:39:36,095
This is her cellphone.

464
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:02,370
♫ <i>In the late night</i> ♫

465
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:07,587
♫ <i>The pedestrians crowd the streets</i> ♫

466
00:40:09,038 --> 00:40:12,729
Yinuo took all these photos.

467
00:40:14,062 --> 00:40:16,871
She has record of every moment with you.

468
00:40:18,771 --> 00:40:21,329
Think about it.

469
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:24,154
Would someone who took these photos be entwined with another man?

470
00:40:26,562 --> 00:40:29,300
You are the one she loves,

471
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,670
Kang Sihan.

472
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,646
She loves me.

473
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,203
She loves me.

474
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,120
I know.

475
00:40:50,454 --> 00:40:53,179
Love needs trust.

476
00:40:54,771 --> 00:40:56,929
I trust Yin Zheng.

477
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:05,070
I do not know how Yinuo got hurt that night.

478
00:41:06,846 --> 00:41:08,395
But I know

479
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:12,196
that Yinuo loves you.

480
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,287
No question about it.

481
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,329
<i>Zhang Xiao's phone is off.</i>

482
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:33,495
<i>It's okay, we don't have to wait for her.</i>

483
00:41:33,495 --> 00:41:37,054
<i>Let's have fun tonight.</i>

484
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,912
<i>Sihan, what are you doing?</i>

485
00:41:43,912 --> 00:41:44,812
<i>This is none of your business.</i>

486
00:41:44,812 --> 00:41:46,196
<i>Yinuo.</i>

487
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:51,103
<i>Yin Zheng, I can't stand it anymore.</i>

488
00:41:51,103 --> 00:41:53,520
<i>I've been tolerating you since we were young.</i>

489
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,729
<i>Even now.</i>

490
00:41:55,729 --> 00:41:59,145
<i>Dad send me overseas at a young age.</i>

491
00:41:59,145 --> 00:42:01,120
<i>That was all because of you.</i>

492
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,712
<i>It's fine, I tolerated it.</i>

493
00:42:02,712 --> 00:42:04,612
<i>But then I started dating Zhang Xiao when I returned</i>

494
00:42:04,612 --> 00:42:06,662
<i>and you took her away from me.</i>

495
00:42:06,662 --> 00:42:08,719
<i>What do you want exactly?</i>

496
00:42:10,454 --> 00:42:12,662
<i>Don't think I don't know</i>

497
00:42:12,662 --> 00:42:14,979
<i>that you still haven't cut off ties with Ma Yinuo.</i>

498
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:17,304
<i>What is it that you want?</i>

499
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:23,312
<i>I was confused and made some big mistakes.</i>

500
00:42:23,312 --> 00:42:25,787
<i>If you want my life to make it up to you,</i>

501
00:42:25,787 --> 00:42:27,546
<i>just take it.</i>

502
00:42:28,203 --> 00:42:31,537
<i>Yinuo and Zhang Xiao are innocent.</i>

503
00:42:31,537 --> 00:42:33,219
<i>Let them go please.</i>

504
00:42:37,229 --> 00:42:38,671
<i>Your wine...</i>

505
00:42:40,562 --> 00:42:42,596
<i>You put poison into it.</i>

506
00:42:49,187 --> 00:42:50,879
<i>Kang Sihan.</i>

507
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:54,620
<i>You put poison into it.</i>

508
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,237
<i>Did you want all of us to die?</i>

509
00:42:57,237 --> 00:43:00,938
<i>We die together.</i>

510
00:43:00,938 --> 00:43:03,162
<i>Yinuo, go.</i>

511
00:43:03,162 --> 00:43:04,520
<i>Go!</i>

512
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:09,403
<i>No.</i>

513
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,050
<i>Get up.</i>

514
00:43:16,646 --> 00:43:18,479
<i>Yinuo.</i>

515
00:43:18,479 --> 00:43:23,604
<i>My baby...</i>

516
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:25,187
<i>Yinuo!</i>

517
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:35,670
<i>[42 Days with Sihan]</i>

518
00:44:27,495 --> 00:44:28,846
Doctor.

519
00:44:28,846 --> 00:44:30,954
Miss Zhang.

520
00:44:30,954 --> 00:44:34,829
We just gave the patient an X-ray.

521
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:38,754
We found that she was pregnant before the accident.

522
00:44:41,704 --> 00:44:43,190
Doctor.

523
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:47,130
Please try your best to keep my sister's baby.

524
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:52,470
Her body is weak after injury.

525
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:55,079
We didn't know she was pregnant when trying to rescue her.

526
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:57,145
We gave her an X-ray

527
00:44:57,145 --> 00:45:00,595
and a lot of antibiotics.

528
00:45:00,595 --> 00:45:02,971
So, the fetus may not survive.

529
00:45:02,971 --> 00:45:04,629
Very sorry.

530
00:45:09,345 --> 00:45:13,079
Doctor, you said may not survive.

531
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:15,920
So there's still hope, right?

532
00:45:16,704 --> 00:45:19,145
Please, you must save this baby.

533
00:45:19,145 --> 00:45:22,762
We can't save it unless there's a miracle.

534
00:45:27,287 --> 00:45:28,412
Something happened.

535
00:45:28,412 --> 00:45:29,912
I went to refill some water

536
00:45:29,912 --> 00:45:32,712
and the patient was missing when I came back.

537
00:46:17,919 --> 00:46:19,529
Siyu.

538
00:46:29,262 --> 00:46:30,662
Got it.
