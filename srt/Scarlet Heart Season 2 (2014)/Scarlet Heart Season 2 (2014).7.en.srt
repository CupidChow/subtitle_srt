00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,170
<i>[Episode 7]</i>

3
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:49,107
Madam, the soup is ready.

4
00:01:49,107 --> 00:01:50,123
You can get back to your work.

5
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:51,515
Yes.

6
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:57,307
Where are you going?

7
00:01:58,274 --> 00:02:00,691
To visit my son.

8
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:02,858
Yin Zheng has been sick after being in the rain.

9
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:05,440
I made him fish soup to help him get better.

10
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,899
You're spoiling him.

11
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:10,274
He will realize his mistakes.

12
00:02:10,274 --> 00:02:12,374
You already yelled at him and punished him.

13
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:14,290
Don't go overboard.

14
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,023
Just forgive him.

15
00:02:16,023 --> 00:02:19,440
Do you know how big of a mistake he made?

16
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,940
An inside job, losing the treasure.

17
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,691
He lied to everyone and fooled the media.

18
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:26,982
He almost single-handedly destroyed Zhen Tian.

19
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:29,023
His intentions were good.

20
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,816
You've known that he's always been competitive.

21
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:35,082
So you're saying I'm making a big fuss over nothing.

22
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,357
Yin Zheng has always been arrogant.

23
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:42,666
He doesn't like showing his weakness in front of others.

24
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,540
You let him bow in front of the entire staff in the pouring rain.

25
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,257
Isn't that enough?

26
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:49,649
I'm trying to get rid of his pride.

27
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:51,791
I want him to know that while working at Zhen Tian,

28
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:55,015
he has to follow the rules and stay grounded.

29
00:02:56,332 --> 00:02:59,374
Even if you're really unsatisfied with him,

30
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:02,265
you should consider how I feel as his mother.

31
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,858
What are you trying to say?

32
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:09,882
You think I'm deliberately working against him?

33
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:11,940
He's made so many mistakes over the years.

34
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,332
I swallow my pride every time.

35
00:03:14,332 --> 00:03:16,290
Again and again.

36
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,249
He keeps challenging my bottom line.

37
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:22,415
Now he's completely out of control.

38
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:26,207
And you're still making excuses for him after such a big mistake.

39
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,916
You're still taking his side.

40
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,682
Have you considered how I feel?

41
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:37,215
Zhentian, are you okay?

42
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:39,207
Zhentian, don't get angry.

43
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:40,691
Calm down.

44
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:42,899
I won't go, okay?

45
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:45,007
Don't be angry, Zhentian.

46
00:03:48,524 --> 00:03:50,832
Zhentian.

47
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:52,624
Go ahead.

48
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,607
Go.

49
00:04:03,832 --> 00:04:05,799
Take my car there.

50
00:04:19,082 --> 00:04:22,932
Xiao Hou, help me arrange a car.

51
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:31,974
Come, drink it while it's still hot.

52
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:37,524
It tastes strange.

53
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:39,357
Can I not drink it?

54
00:04:39,357 --> 00:04:43,732
You think it tastes weird because you're too sick to have an appetite.

55
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,574
Drink it.

56
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:49,790
Drink up.

57
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,923
- Be good.
- It's so bitter.

58
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,674
Be good.

59
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,732
I wonder what sins I've committed in my previous life

60
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:05,082
to meet with you two in this life.

61
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:07,457
Whenever I hear you got into some trouble at the company,

62
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:09,107
I get really jacked up.

63
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:12,107
I even dream about you two quarreling.

64
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:15,074
Do I win?

65
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,649
How are you still making jokes?

66
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:20,174
What do you think?

67
00:05:24,482 --> 00:05:25,832
Mom.

68
00:05:28,082 --> 00:05:30,939
I've always had a question for you.

69
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,074
What is it now?

70
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:39,849
Why did you marry Kang Zhentian after my dad passed away?

71
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:48,874
I was a 30 year old woman with a child.

72
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:51,124
What choices did I have?

73
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,207
Zhentian is righteous and treats us well.

74
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:57,566
He was also your dad's friend.

75
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,732
I'm not a kid anymore.

76
00:05:59,732 --> 00:06:02,182
Stop lying to me.

77
00:06:02,874 --> 00:06:06,374
They met with the sandstorm together.

78
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:08,858
Why is my dad dead instead of him?

79
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:12,939
Plus, there are lots of women in the world.

80
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,624
Why did he marry his deceased friend's wife?

81
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:18,491
I would never believe that there isn't something fishy about this.

82
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,340
Zheng'er.

83
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:28,074
The grudges of the previous generation isn't something that can be explained.

84
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:32,058
I don't want you to dwell on the things of the past.

85
00:06:32,732 --> 00:06:35,232
The more you know, the more tiring your life will be.

86
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:37,616
You don't deserve this.

87
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,190
No matter what you think of me,

88
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,899
I just want you to know one thing.

89
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:45,524
I've never let you down,

90
00:06:45,524 --> 00:06:48,340
and I've never let your father or my own conscience down.

91
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,916
Mom.

92
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:55,358
Alright, let's not talk about this anymore.

93
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,524
I'm leaving.

94
00:06:58,524 --> 00:07:00,732
If you don't want me to worry about you,

95
00:07:00,732 --> 00:07:04,274
get better and don't cause trouble.

96
00:07:04,274 --> 00:07:06,915
You can just put it there. Someone will clean it up.

97
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:13,399
How can you just leave this ring lying around?

98
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,440
Your father gave this to you as a protective talisman.

99
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,758
You should wear it, it's good for you.

100
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,832
Got it.

101
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:27,490
Take care.

102
00:08:01,707 --> 00:08:03,374
What are you looking at?

103
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,607
Sorry.

104
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:23,716
I didn't want you to get annoyed by my mother asking you questions, so...

105
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:25,950
I understand.

106
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,560
It's okay.

107
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:33,240
Did you hear everything we talked about?

108
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:40,774
It's tough for your mom to be in between

109
00:08:40,774 --> 00:08:42,515
you and the chairman.

110
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:46,357
And it's also very awkward for you to be in between

111
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:48,415
your mother and the chairman.

112
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:53,107
Why don't you want to leave?

113
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:57,099
I will not go away.

114
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:01,791
Everything Zhen Tian Group is now

115
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,440
originally belonged to my father.

116
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,790
It's the Yin's assets.

117
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:14,424
I will take back everything Kang Zhentian took from my dad.

118
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:19,474
I see.

119
00:09:22,374 --> 00:09:24,940
I will support you.

120
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:45,549
Young bartender, you have some skills.

121
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:47,374
Dad, what are you doing here?

122
00:09:47,374 --> 00:09:48,415
What's wrong?

123
00:09:48,415 --> 00:09:50,940
Your old man isn't welcome at this hip bar?

124
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,939
That's not it.

125
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:54,832
My bar is honored by your presence.

126
00:09:54,832 --> 00:09:57,691
That's great. Start me off with a double whisky.

127
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:59,549
Your treat.

128
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,649
What's the matter?

129
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:05,774
If mom finds out that I gave you liquor,

130
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:07,791
it's over for me.

131
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,340
She doesn't know I'm with you.

132
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,657
Okay, then just one glass.

133
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:16,099
Just one glass.

134
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,290
What's wrong, Dad? Is something bothering you?

135
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,574
Are you worried about Big Brother?

136
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:59,791
Good news goes on crutches, but bad news travels fast.

137
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,549
You're also arguing with mom about this, aren't you?

138
00:11:03,357 --> 00:11:06,749
I can't hide anything from you.

139
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:11,290
It's been over 20 years,

140
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,499
and your brother hasn't changed at all.

141
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,807
I think I treat him pretty well,

142
00:11:16,807 --> 00:11:20,107
but he keeps disappointing me.

143
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:23,624
Alright, Dad. Stop worrying about the past.

144
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:26,739
I'll go fishing with you the weekend. We can go horse riding too.

145
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:33,299
Siyu, how old are you now?

146
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:35,732
I'm 24.

147
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:38,958
You're not that young anymore.

148
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,591
You can't just spend your days having fun.

149
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:44,982
Do you have any plans for the future?

150
00:11:44,982 --> 00:11:47,540
Plans? Not really.

151
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,774
My plan is to be happy every day.

152
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:53,016
To be happier each day.

153
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:58,315
Are you really planning on feeding horses and bartending for the rest of your life?

154
00:11:58,315 --> 00:12:00,165
I don't see what's wrong with that.

155
00:12:00,165 --> 00:12:05,858
Only fools are lucky enough to be happy every day.

156
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,357
You are my son.

157
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:10,990
Being my son comes with responsibilities.

158
00:12:11,874 --> 00:12:14,499
Dad, I told you when I graduated from college.

159
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:17,332
I have no interest in business.

160
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:20,082
Your dad is getting old.

161
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:23,349
Zhen Tian Group can't go a day without a leader.

162
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,566
Although your brother is capable,

163
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:29,399
he loves taking risks

164
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,123
and his temper is unpredictable.

165
00:12:32,123 --> 00:12:34,815
I don't like the idea

166
00:12:34,815 --> 00:12:37,257
of handing the company over to him.

167
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,649
Dad.

168
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:41,999
Do you know why I hate the company?

169
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:43,374
Why?

170
00:12:44,332 --> 00:12:46,123
Because ever since I could remember,

171
00:12:46,123 --> 00:12:48,816
you always came back from the office looking upset.

172
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:50,707
If you weren't coming back drunk from socializing with your clients,

173
00:12:50,707 --> 00:12:52,940
you were yelling into the phone.

174
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,858
When Big Brother started working for the company, he was the same.

175
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,499
The only difference

176
00:12:57,499 --> 00:13:01,832
was that you would continue your arguments from the office back at home.

177
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:04,074
This isn't the life I want to live.

178
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,099
I can't believe it.

179
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:17,332
The life I've always been so proud of

180
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:21,399
is something my son views as terrible.

181
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,999
Dad, I don't mean that.

182
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,490
Sorry.

183
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,123
We're family.

184
00:13:28,123 --> 00:13:30,932
There is nothing to be sorry about.

185
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,816
What is this?

186
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,923
Didn't I order whisky?

187
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:41,232
Mom gave me her orders.

188
00:13:41,232 --> 00:13:42,566
I can't defy her.

189
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:44,382
She said to only let you drink this.

190
00:13:44,382 --> 00:13:46,257
I can't defy her.

191
00:13:47,774 --> 00:13:50,439
Did you know that Second Brother is back?

192
00:13:54,582 --> 00:13:56,032
I know.

193
00:14:01,832 --> 00:14:03,232
This drink is good.

194
00:14:03,232 --> 00:14:05,624
Right?

195
00:14:05,624 --> 00:14:07,774
Can I get another one?

196
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:10,430
Alright, I'll get you another one.

197
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:16,858
<i>[Music House]</i>

198
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:19,232
Chairman, are you going home now?

199
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:20,457
I would like to go somewhere first.

200
00:14:20,457 --> 00:14:21,707
Alright.

201
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:34,457
Don't take the subway on such a cold day.

202
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,466
Drive my car back, I'm not using it anyways.

203
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:39,107
It's a new car. What if I scratch it?

204
00:14:39,107 --> 00:14:40,399
That's even better.

205
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,582
You can work for free for me for a year.

206
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:43,566
Nice try.

207
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:45,632
Alright, get going.

208
00:14:45,632 --> 00:14:48,816
Alright, bye.

209
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:07,232
Drive.

210
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:16,132
<i>If I go back to my world,</i>

211
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,465
<i>will you really come find me?</i>

212
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,332
Hello?

213
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:41,590
Sorry for waking you, Director Yin.

214
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,023
I found the translator for the ring

215
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:45,415
and sent him a photo.

216
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:48,207
He translated it quickly.

217
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:49,939
Is it that urgent?

218
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:51,774
I just think it's so interesting.

219
00:15:51,774 --> 00:15:54,090
So I wanted to tell you as soon as possible.

220
00:15:54,607 --> 00:15:56,982
Don't keep me guessing.

221
00:15:56,982 --> 00:15:58,899
The text on the ring says,

222
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:00,707
"If you can't come to my world,

223
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:02,591
then I'll come to yours."

224
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:05,739
Don't you think it's interesting?

225
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:40,040
♫ <i>Stars are always glittering in the sky</i> ♫

226
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:48,040
♫ <i>Waiting for the sun, only leaving after getting tired</i> ♫

227

228

230
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:07,849
♫ <i>Only then can I see the faint existence of you</i> ♫

231
00:17:09,774 --> 00:17:11,858
<i>Don't go.</i>

00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:15,032
<i>I thought you were someone I knew.</i>

233

236
00:17:34,858 --> 00:17:36,510
Go.

237
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,290
I'll crash you.

238
00:17:42,315 --> 00:17:44,732
The case of the hairpin has come to an end.

239
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:46,232
Thank you.

240
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,040
You are welcome.

241
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,607
You should give back the money.

242
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:51,315
No need to give it back.

243
00:17:51,315 --> 00:17:53,399
I borrowed it from a friend.

244
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:55,040
He's a rich second generation.

245
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,540
That money is just pocket money to him.

246
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,691
My friend said that I don't have to pay that money back until I make five million dollars.

247
00:18:01,691 --> 00:18:05,582
Since when did you have such a generous friend?

248
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:07,716
I'm well-liked.

249
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:11,691
Since you're so well-liked, why are you still depending on others for a living?

250
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,858
Why aren't you staying at your friend's mansion?

251
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:16,123
Why are you still staying with me?

252
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:18,190
Be honest with me. Where did you get this money?

253
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,482
I told you, don't worry about it.

254
00:18:21,482 --> 00:18:23,123
When a man gives you money to spend,

255
00:18:23,123 --> 00:18:26,007
just see what you can buy with 100,000 yuan.

256
00:18:38,274 --> 00:18:40,149
What are you doing?

257
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:42,774
If you don't tell me,

258
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:44,832
I will use punishment.

259
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:47,082
I'll tell you.

260
00:18:48,332 --> 00:18:52,440
I scammed a rich second generation for the money.

261
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,499
Another rich second generation?

262
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:56,732
It's the guy you know.

263
00:18:56,732 --> 00:18:58,357
The tall, rich, and handsome man.

264
00:18:58,357 --> 00:19:00,770
Someone I know?

265
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,760
Mr. Horseshit?

266
00:19:03,315 --> 00:19:05,274
How could you take his money?

267
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:08,023
Haven't you heard of the saying, "Poor but proud?"

268
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:09,149
I...

269
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,449
I did it for you.

270
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:18,791
Then give the money back.

271
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,420
No.

272
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,250
Return it yourself.

273
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:43,958
Hello.

274
00:19:45,582 --> 00:19:46,816
I would like to ask.

275
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:49,382
Is your boss Siyu?

276
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:52,374
Why are you looking for him?

277
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:54,732
I have something important to give him.

278
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:56,839
I will help you pass it on.

279
00:19:57,566 --> 00:19:59,040
No.

280
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,207
I have to give it to him myself.

281
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:06,582
Is it very important?

282
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,182
Very Important.

283
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,549
A token of love?

284
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:14,290
Why do you look so familiar?

285
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,123
Are you his new girlfriend?

286
00:20:16,123 --> 00:20:18,382
No, you got the wrong person.

287
00:20:18,382 --> 00:20:21,999
Then are you his college classmate?

288
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:23,023
No.

289
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:24,732
His neighbor?

290
00:20:24,732 --> 00:20:26,165
No.

291
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:29,999
Where is he now?

292
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:32,899
Are you wooing him?

293
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,032
Of course not.

294
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,123
You have a crush on him?

295
00:20:37,123 --> 00:20:38,415
No.

296
00:20:39,165 --> 00:20:40,591
Then what's your relationship?

297
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:42,440
We're enemies.

298
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,999
Enemies?

299
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:46,440
Well, not really.

300
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:49,791
I have no relationship with him.

301
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,382
No? Then why do you have something important for him?

302
00:20:55,107 --> 00:20:56,839
Who are you?

303
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,182
Me?

304
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,939
I'm his girlfriend.

305
00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:04,274
You have great taste.

306
00:21:04,274 --> 00:21:06,082
We have different taste in men,

307
00:21:06,082 --> 00:21:08,357
so I have no interest in him.

308
00:21:08,357 --> 00:21:12,539
You can trust me with where he is.

309
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:27,839
According to the photo,

310
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,157
he should be at a suburban stud-farm.

311
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:34,907
Stud-farm?

312
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,791
Did you come to scam me again?

313
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:25,274
Wasn't the 100,000 your boyfriend got from me enough?

314
00:22:25,274 --> 00:22:27,982
What did you come for today?

315
00:22:27,982 --> 00:22:29,524
I'm here to pay back the money.

316
00:22:29,524 --> 00:22:32,424
Pay back? Did I hear you wrong?

317
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,940
That's 100,000.

318
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,632
Count it.

319
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,040
Leaving already?

320
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,524
You still owe me money.

321
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:42,307
Still owe you?

322
00:22:42,307 --> 00:22:44,958
I haven't touched that money.

323
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:48,299
Haven't you heard about interest?

324
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,070
Interest?

325
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:53,315
You're asking for interest on two weeks?

326
00:22:53,315 --> 00:22:55,832
The bank gives me interest even after a day.

327
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,749
Are you trying to scam me again?

328
00:22:58,749 --> 00:23:00,290
Who's scamming?

329
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,732
It's just two weeks of interest.

330
00:23:01,732 --> 00:23:04,249
Calculate how much two weeks of interest is.

331
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:07,049
I'll double it.

332
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:10,874
It's fine.

333
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,357
Wait.

334
00:23:32,874 --> 00:23:35,023
How does she know how to do that?

335
00:24:20,082 --> 00:24:22,107
That was pretty cool.

336
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:25,274
Did your handle-carrier boyfriend teach you that?

337
00:24:25,274 --> 00:24:26,732
He isn't my boyfriend.

338
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:28,816
He's just a friend.

339
00:24:28,816 --> 00:24:30,449
Friend?

340
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:33,165
You have unique taste.

341
00:24:33,165 --> 00:24:35,899
He's pretty foolish.

342
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:38,149
You have unique taste.

343
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:40,249
Your girlfriend seems like she's from the census bureau.

344
00:24:40,249 --> 00:24:41,624
My girlfriend?

345
00:24:41,624 --> 00:24:44,382
What? Do you have multiple?

346
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,691
I have none.

347
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:48,007
Drop the act.

348
00:24:48,007 --> 00:24:52,491
The punk girl at the bar told me she was your girlfriend.

349
00:24:53,415 --> 00:24:56,123
She's my best friend, not my girlfriend.

350
00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:58,023
You might as well say she's my daughter.

351
00:24:58,023 --> 00:24:59,874
I'm not in the mood to argue with you.

352
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:02,123
Did you calculate the interest?

353
00:25:02,123 --> 00:25:05,549
Fine, since you want me to calculate it.

354
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:12,249
The interest rate for a 100,000 deposit over five years is 4.75%.

355
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:14,939
So that's 47,500 a year.

356
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:17,091
For two weeks,

357
00:25:18,457 --> 00:25:21,691
that's 1,952.50.

358
00:25:21,691 --> 00:25:23,457
Doubling it,

359
00:25:24,582 --> 00:25:26,791
it's 3,904.11.

360
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:30,316
So you still need to pay me 3.904.11.

361
00:25:31,107 --> 00:25:32,707
That much?

362
00:25:32,707 --> 00:25:35,039
Do you need me to calculate it again?

363
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,440
No.

364
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,758
I'll give you the change first.

365
00:25:46,624 --> 00:25:48,524
That's 4.50, keep the change.

366
00:25:48,524 --> 00:25:51,732
I'll pay the other 3,900 back to you at a later time.

367
00:25:51,732 --> 00:25:54,580
I always pay back my debts.

368
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:07,382
She is so gullible.

369
00:26:11,524 --> 00:26:13,440
Director Yin hasn't come to work in a few days.

370
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,357
Did something happen?

371
00:26:15,357 --> 00:26:17,774
He made the chairman really furious this time.

372
00:26:17,774 --> 00:26:20,082
He might even get fired.

373
00:26:20,082 --> 00:26:21,149
No way.

374
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:22,691
Why not?

375
00:26:22,691 --> 00:26:26,374
A stepfather's intentions are like tails of hornets, full of poison.

376
00:26:26,374 --> 00:26:27,807
That's not good for us.

377
00:26:27,807 --> 00:26:30,107
We're associated as on Director Yin's side.

378
00:26:30,107 --> 00:26:33,265
Our future days won't go well.

379
00:26:37,332 --> 00:26:40,249
Let's get some Cantonese food tonight.

380
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:41,939
Okay.

381
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:45,382
Cantonese food is good. Light and healthy.

382
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:50,023
Count me in.

383
00:26:50,023 --> 00:26:52,024
Director Yin.

384
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:55,315
What's that about hornets' tails you just mentioned?

385
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:57,399
Nothing, I was just saying things.

386
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:59,607
Director Yin, please forgive me.

387
00:26:59,607 --> 00:27:02,274
Director Yin, you look great today.

388
00:27:02,274 --> 00:27:04,791
We missed you while you were gone.

389
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:05,732
Right.

390
00:27:05,732 --> 00:27:07,165
Missed me?

391
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:09,123
Then get to work.

392
00:27:09,707 --> 00:27:11,040
Okay.

393
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,107
Let's go.

394
00:27:13,107 --> 00:27:14,707
Assistant Qiao.

395
00:27:17,165 --> 00:27:19,232
Good morning, Director Yin.

396
00:27:19,232 --> 00:27:20,982
Good morning.

397
00:27:20,982 --> 00:27:23,566
Anything happen at the office while I was away?

398
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:26,191
Liu Donghai led a few directors

399
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:28,065
to propose a no-confidence motion against you,

400
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:30,649
but Director Wang rejected it.

401
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,249
What's the old man saying?

402
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:34,165
It's not very clearly yet.

403
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:37,899
But the chairman asked you to see him as soon as you are back.

404
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:40,774
I don't know if it's good or bad.

405
00:27:40,774 --> 00:27:43,816
If it's a blessing, it's not a curse. If it's a curse, it cant be avoided.

406
00:27:43,816 --> 00:27:45,940
Things are sensitive right now.

407
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,791
You must be cautious.

408
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,549
Don't worry. Let's go.

409
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:01,165
Come in.

410
00:28:05,874 --> 00:28:07,607
Chairman, you asked for me?

411
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,258
I heard from your mom that you've been seriously ill.

412
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:15,540
Are you feeling better?

413
00:28:16,332 --> 00:28:18,958
Don't worry, I'm still alive.

414
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:21,249
I know you're still mad.

415
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:25,039
But I hope you can separate business from personal affairs.

416
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:25,874
In this regard...

417
00:28:25,874 --> 00:28:28,582
I caused the loss in this regard.

418
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,774
I will take all responsibility.

419
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,332
It's a thing of the past.

420
00:28:33,332 --> 00:28:36,540
You received your punishment.

421
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,382
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

422
00:28:38,899 --> 00:28:42,640
That's rare of you to say.

423
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:49,039
I didn't ask you to come here today to complain and argue.

424
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,774
Otherwise, we can't continue our conversation.

425
00:28:59,858 --> 00:29:02,666
I know you have your opinions about me.

426
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:05,165
But those are family matters.

427
00:29:05,165 --> 00:29:11,182
I don't want you to put your future on hold because of those little things.

428
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,457
Zhen Tian Group won't belong to the Kangs forever.

429
00:29:15,457 --> 00:29:17,160
In my opinion,

430
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,940
everyone who has been loyal

431
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:26,615
and has contributed to our company has the chance to take control.

432
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:29,257
Including you.

433
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,666
Your ability is obvious.

434
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:37,549
But the incidents that happened recently have become such a big deal.

435
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:40,357
It can be used against you.

436
00:29:40,357 --> 00:29:45,874
So if you don't do something to redeem yourself,

437
00:29:45,874 --> 00:29:47,791
then in the future,

438
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:50,340
even if I want to stand on your side,

439
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,449
it'll be difficult to convince the others.

440
00:29:55,707 --> 00:29:58,023
I will make up for my mistakes.

441
00:29:58,023 --> 00:29:59,482
Alright.

442
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:04,107
There's a new cosmetics company.

443
00:30:04,107 --> 00:30:05,939
Z&X.

444
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:09,023
Their main products are perfume and skin care.

445
00:30:09,023 --> 00:30:10,958
They're very popular.

446
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:15,457
They're now our main competitor.

447
00:30:15,457 --> 00:30:18,632
If this continues,

448
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:20,982
it won't be good.

449
00:30:20,982 --> 00:30:22,524
Don't worry.

450
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:25,540
I will have them disappear from the market in a month.

451
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:30,458
Alright, I will wait for your good news.

452
00:30:36,691 --> 00:30:38,474
What are you doing here?

453
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:41,482
I'm here to resign with the chairman.

454
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:43,939
You can just do that with your department head.

455
00:30:43,939 --> 00:30:46,165
No need to talk to the chairman.

456
00:30:46,165 --> 00:30:47,816
Because of what happened with the hairpin,

457
00:30:47,816 --> 00:30:50,874
I think I need to talk to the chairman.

458
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,582
Then, it's up to you.

459
00:30:53,582 --> 00:30:54,916
Wait.

460
00:30:55,624 --> 00:30:59,023
You still owe me a few words.

461
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:04,107
What words?

462
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,649
Your apology.

463
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:10,523
If you want my apologies, I won't give you one.

464
00:31:11,457 --> 00:31:14,749
But the case of the hairpin has come to a conclusion.

465
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:17,290
You can go any time.

466
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,039
Director Yin.

467
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,374
Do you get reminded of the hairpin every time you see me?

468
00:31:22,374 --> 00:31:24,666
No.

469
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:26,732
It's because you helped me avoid the rain.

470
00:31:27,607 --> 00:31:29,982
I don't accept commiseration from anyone.

471
00:31:33,082 --> 00:31:37,157
Alright, you can rest assured.

472
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:41,516
From now on, we will never meet again.

473
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,882
Remember your words.

474
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,639
Zhang Xiao, Chairman asked you to go in.

475
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,357
Assitant Qiao.

476
00:32:00,357 --> 00:32:04,507
- Get me the background on Z&X.
- Director Yin.

477
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,716
Do you really want to resign?

478
00:32:09,674 --> 00:32:11,223
Sorry.

479
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:13,816
Because of Yin Zheng?

480
00:32:13,816 --> 00:32:16,391
No, it has nothing to do with him.

481
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:20,774
I can guess even if you don't tell me.

482
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:23,765
He must be giving you a lot of trouble behind your back.

483
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:26,499
No.

484
00:32:26,499 --> 00:32:30,290
Then why are you resigning?

485
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,974
I was the one who lost the hairpin.

486
00:32:32,974 --> 00:32:35,357
Though the case has been closed,

487
00:32:35,357 --> 00:32:37,923
the hairpin is still missing.

488
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,799
Plus, it was your most precious item.

489
00:32:42,415 --> 00:32:45,149
I can't get over it.

490
00:32:46,207 --> 00:32:50,249
No matter how precious the hairpin is, it's still a worldly possession at the end of the day.

491
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:52,140
If it's lost, it's lost.

492
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:56,499
I don't want to lose an honest, innocent,

493
00:32:56,499 --> 00:32:59,174
and righteous employee because of it.

494
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:04,499
Zhen Tian Group is successful today

495
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:07,782
because we value our talents.

496
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:10,558
Do you understand?

497
00:33:11,858 --> 00:33:13,649
I have forgiven Yin Zheng.

498
00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:15,965
I have no reason not to forgive you.

499
00:33:16,482 --> 00:33:18,190
You've forgiven Director Yin?

500
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,540
Did you not want me to?

501
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,691
It's not that.

502
00:33:20,691 --> 00:33:24,674
I do wish that you and Director Yin can become reconciled.

503
00:33:24,674 --> 00:33:29,532
I'm sure you heard of my relationship with Yin Zheng.

504
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:33,457
Do you think I'm a bad step-father?

505
00:33:33,457 --> 00:33:35,310
No.

506
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:38,970
I actually think you care about him a lot.

507
00:33:39,832 --> 00:33:43,432
I think he had his reasons for doing what he did.

508
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:51,149
You're so young but so considerate and kind.

509
00:33:53,457 --> 00:33:56,232
I like your designs.

510
00:33:56,232 --> 00:33:58,666
It has personality.

511
00:33:58,666 --> 00:34:00,957
Continue to work for our company.

512
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:05,007
Alright.

513
00:34:05,858 --> 00:34:10,958
Director Yin, I have the information on Z&X.

514
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:14,774
This brand opened their first specialty store in London two years ago.

515
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:17,374
They do research and development of high-grade, handmade perfume.

516
00:34:17,374 --> 00:34:20,123
They hired the best perfumers in the world

517
00:34:20,123 --> 00:34:23,482
and use top-grade raw material from Grasse, the perfume city of southern France,

518
00:34:23,482 --> 00:34:26,749
to make 22 kinds of unisex perfume.

519
00:34:26,749 --> 00:34:29,566
They revolutionized perfumes in the industry.

520
00:34:29,566 --> 00:34:33,339
Z&X's specialty stores have open experimental rooms

521
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:36,457
allowing customers to freely experience the products.

522
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:39,082
Even though this brand is still quite new,

523
00:34:39,082 --> 00:34:41,949
their sales are increasing tremendously.

524
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:45,023
They've now started to research and develop skincare

525
00:34:45,023 --> 00:34:48,357
and are exploring the possibilities to mix perfumes with skincare products.

526
00:34:48,357 --> 00:34:51,758
Their perfumers have also joined the R&D for skincare.

527
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,858
According to the latest information,

528
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:57,290
the founded of Z&X moved their headquarters to Beijing.

529
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:00,558
Wait, who's the founder?

530
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,691
How can you not know such basic information?

531
00:35:04,691 --> 00:35:08,482
It's Kang Sihan.

532
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:10,123
Kang Sihan?

533
00:35:11,457 --> 00:35:14,366
I also thought it was strange when I first found out.

534
00:35:15,123 --> 00:35:17,874
But after double checking,

535
00:35:17,874 --> 00:35:21,839
I confirmed that the founder of Z&X is indeed Kang Sihan.

536
00:35:27,732 --> 00:35:29,524
Alright, you can leave now.

537
00:35:29,524 --> 00:35:31,240
I'll get going then.

538
00:35:58,007 --> 00:36:01,040
<i>Mom, this house is really big.</i>

539
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,399
<i>Yes, this is our home now.</i>

540
00:36:03,399 --> 00:36:04,491
<i>Really?</i>

541
00:36:04,491 --> 00:36:06,340
<i>Then I want the penthouse room.</i>

542
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,982
<i>So I can look at the stars at night.</i>

543
00:36:07,982 --> 00:36:09,582
<i>Alright.</i>

544
00:36:09,582 --> 00:36:10,774
<i>Madam.</i>

545
00:36:10,774 --> 00:36:12,357
<i>Sir just called.</i>

546
00:36:12,357 --> 00:36:15,315
<i>He said to leave the penthouse room for Sihan.</i>

547
00:36:15,315 --> 00:36:17,566
<i>He said that Sihan loves looking at the stars.</i>

548
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:20,315
<i>When he grows up, he'll become the next Coper...</i>

549
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:21,457
<i>Coper what?</i>

550
00:36:21,457 --> 00:36:23,758
<i>- Copernicus.
- Yes, Copernicus.</i>

551
00:36:23,758 --> 00:36:24,774
<i>Mom.</i>

552
00:36:24,774 --> 00:36:27,299
<i>Sure, we'll follow Mr. Kang's orders.</i>

553
00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:29,658
<i>Okay. Let's go.</i>

554
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,032
<i>Yin Zheng.</i>

555
00:36:32,032 --> 00:36:35,482
<i>You can come to my room and watch the stars with me in the future.</i>

556
00:36:35,482 --> 00:36:38,232
<i>But remember to knock.</i>

557
00:36:39,832 --> 00:36:41,774
<i>I don't care.</i>

558
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:09,123
<i>Thief, stop!</i>

559
00:37:09,123 --> 00:37:11,232
<i>Let go of that! That belongs to my mom!</i>

560
00:37:11,232 --> 00:37:13,399
<i>No, this belongs to my mom!</i>

561
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:15,190
<i>Give it to me, thief!</i>

562
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,482
<i>- This belongs to my mom!
- It belongs to my mom!</i>

563
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:19,791
<i>I'm not a thief! This belongs to my mom.</i>

564
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:21,457
<i>You and your mom are thieves!</i>

565
00:37:21,457 --> 00:37:23,190
<i>How dare you talk about my mom?</i>

566
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,482
<i>Thief! Give it to me!</i>

567
00:37:24,482 --> 00:37:26,682
<i>It belongs to my mom!</i>

568
00:37:44,049 --> 00:37:45,107
Who is it?

569
00:37:45,107 --> 00:37:46,615
Sihan.

570
00:37:48,374 --> 00:37:50,558
Have time for a drink?

571
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,399
What is it?

572
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,023
We'll talk when we meet.

573
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,082
Just spit it out.

574
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:16,139
You still have the same temper.

575
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:20,939
Before talking about other things, shouldn't you call me Big Brother first?

576
00:38:20,939 --> 00:38:22,540
Do you think you deserve it?

577
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,707
Since I was kicked out of the Kang residence 20 years ago,

578
00:38:25,707 --> 00:38:29,332
I no longer have a so-called Big Brother.

579
00:38:29,332 --> 00:38:32,132
You're still mad about such little things?

580
00:38:32,707 --> 00:38:34,999
But don't be mistaken.

581
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:37,165
I wasn't the one who forced you out of the home.

582
00:38:37,165 --> 00:38:38,858
It was your father.

583
00:38:39,582 --> 00:38:44,332
But now it seems that it wasn't a bad decision.

584
00:38:44,332 --> 00:38:48,440
At least, it created a dark horse of the perfume industry.

585
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,515
I heard that your Z&X has entered the mainland market.

586
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:55,666
But sadly it's too weak.

587
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,357
It can't bear any risks.

588
00:38:58,357 --> 00:39:03,982
Z&X is a brand I started from scratch on my own.

589
00:39:03,982 --> 00:39:05,732
I'm not like a certain someone.

590
00:39:05,732 --> 00:39:08,440
Repeatedly saying that he is not one of the Kangs,

591
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,691
but still shamelessly taking the road paved by his father.

592
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:15,257
The winner is the king and the loser is the outlaw.

593
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:17,716
It's not important what steps I take.

594
00:39:18,749 --> 00:39:20,723
The important thing is the result.

595
00:39:29,607 --> 00:39:33,249
Zhen Tian Group is acquiring Z&X.

596
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:34,440
Did you know that?

597
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,082
You and I don't interfere with each other.

598
00:39:37,082 --> 00:39:38,507
Why are you working against me?

599
00:39:38,507 --> 00:39:41,282
I just want to know what it's like to win.

600
00:39:41,899 --> 00:39:44,282
Do you remember this court?

601
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,357
Your dad used to always take us here.

602
00:39:47,357 --> 00:39:49,232
I do remember.

603
00:39:49,774 --> 00:39:52,274
You never beat me.

604
00:39:57,499 --> 00:40:00,074
<i>Focus, be confident.</i>

605
00:40:08,149 --> 00:40:10,165
<i>You have bad habits.</i>

606
00:40:10,165 --> 00:40:11,907
<i>Sihan, give it a try.</i>

607
00:40:19,758 --> 00:40:22,382
<i>Great.</i>

608
00:40:22,382 --> 00:40:24,132
<i>Like father, like son.</i>

609
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:25,482
<i>Great.</i>

610
00:40:25,482 --> 00:40:28,207
That is of the past.

611
00:40:28,207 --> 00:40:30,716
I'm no longer the person I was before.

612
00:40:32,357 --> 00:40:34,707
Cut to the chase.

613
00:40:34,707 --> 00:40:36,290
Tell me.

614
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:38,665
Why did you ask me to come here?

615
00:40:39,582 --> 00:40:41,699
To acquire Z&X.

616
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,466
Do you think that's possible?

617
00:40:45,466 --> 00:40:49,023
Don't blame me for not warning you when you're knocked down.

618
00:40:49,023 --> 00:40:51,282
I won't give you that chance.

619
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:54,149
Over-confidence is arrogance.

620
00:40:54,149 --> 00:40:57,816
Whatever, I'll keep you company.

621
00:40:57,816 --> 00:40:59,890
Guess we'll wait and see.

622
00:41:29,674 --> 00:41:32,082
- Give it to me!
- No.

623
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:33,649
- No.
- Give me it.

624
00:41:33,649 --> 00:41:34,882
No.

625
00:41:34,882 --> 00:41:35,839
- Give me it.
- No.

626
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,515
- Give it to me.
- No.

627
00:41:39,324 --> 00:41:40,791
<i>- Thief!
- No!</i>

628
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:43,682
<i>This belongs to my mom!</i>

629
00:41:43,682 --> 00:41:45,732
<i>I'm not a thief! This belongs to my mom!</i>

630
00:41:45,732 --> 00:41:47,732
<i>You and your mom are thieves!</i>

631
00:41:47,732 --> 00:41:48,982
<i>How dare you talk about my mom!</i>

632
00:41:48,982 --> 00:41:50,399
<i>Give it to me! It's my mom's!</i>

633
00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:51,949
<i>Brothers, what are you doing?</i>

634
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:53,591
<i>- Give it to me!
- Don't fight.</i>

635
00:41:53,591 --> 00:41:56,182
<i>It's my mom's!</i>

636
00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:02,666
<i>Siyu!</i>

637
00:42:04,249 --> 00:42:05,774
<i>Siyu! Oh my God.</i>

638
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:07,915
<i>Zhentian!</i>

639
00:42:07,915 --> 00:42:09,107
<i>Call an ambulance!</i>

640
00:42:09,107 --> 00:42:10,290
<i>Siyu is bleeding!</i>

641
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,607
<i>What happened?</i>

642
00:42:11,607 --> 00:42:12,899
<i>He pushed Siyu.</i>

643
00:42:12,899 --> 00:42:13,649
<i>I didn't.</i>

644
00:42:13,649 --> 00:42:14,816
<i>Yes, you did.</i>

645
00:42:14,816 --> 00:42:17,357
<i>Because you stole my mom's box first.</i>

646
00:42:18,082 --> 00:42:21,040
<i>Sihan, why did you take it?</i>

647
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,140
<i>Why did you take Mom's box?</i>

648
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:27,340
<i>Zhentian.</i>

649
00:42:40,107 --> 00:42:42,591
- Our counter must be cleaned.
- Okay.

650
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:43,791
Keep it clean.

651
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:45,990
- And then color coordinate things, okay?
- President Kang.

652
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,149
- Got it?
- Got it.

653
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:48,874
President Kang, what are you doing here?

654
00:42:48,874 --> 00:42:49,858
I came to have a look.

655
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,574
Hello, President Kang.

656
00:42:57,415 --> 00:42:59,799
In a bad mood?

657
00:43:02,065 --> 00:43:05,249
Jin Sanshun makes cakes when she's feeling down,

658
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,123
and President Kang makes perfumes.

659
00:43:08,123 --> 00:43:10,040
Seems like when people are feeling down,

660
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,382
they always find things that they are good at to alleviate their sadness.

661
00:43:13,982 --> 00:43:17,239
A person's hobbies is the best way to alleviate sadness.

662
00:43:17,774 --> 00:43:20,640
What can you smell from this?

663
00:43:22,899 --> 00:43:25,140
Sadness.

664
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:28,165
How are the two stores?

665
00:43:28,165 --> 00:43:30,891
Don't worry. They'll open on time.

666
00:43:30,891 --> 00:43:34,391
We're set for our shops in Xin Tian Di Bai Sheng and Yin Suo.

667
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,558
What can you smell from this?

668
00:43:43,274 --> 00:43:46,749
Still sadness.

669
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,482
Alright, get to work.

670
00:43:48,482 --> 00:43:50,382
- Go on.
- Alright, see you.
