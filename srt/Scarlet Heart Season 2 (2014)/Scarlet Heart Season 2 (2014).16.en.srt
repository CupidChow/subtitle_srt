3
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,020
Yeah, kiss her!

4
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,045
Let us be the witness.

5
00:01:47,045 --> 00:01:54,587
Kiss her!

6
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,771
Ladies and Gentlemen, the opening ceremony has come to an end.

7
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:41,212
Save your question to next time.

8
00:02:41,212 --> 00:02:43,495
Okay, goodbye.

9
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:47,229
Lan Lan.

10
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:50,562
Let me explain.

11
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:53,887
What is there to explain?

12
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:56,370
Do you think I'm blind?

13
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,846
I heard you were a playboy.

14
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,203
But I guess you don't even choose your target.

15
00:03:01,203 --> 00:03:02,912
Don't say things you don't mean.

16
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:04,245
You didn't come on time.

17
00:03:04,245 --> 00:03:06,579
The ceremony couldn't start without you.

18
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:08,437
You know that it wasn't easy to get this project.

19
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:10,812
I can't afford any mistakes with the old man.

20
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:12,520
I asked Zhang Xiao to replace you.

21
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,479
I was looking out for you.

22
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,412
Looking out for me?

23
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:18,579
So you kissed her?

24
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,395
What's next?

25
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:23,120
Don't be so childish.

26
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,270
Yeah, I'm so childish. That's why I believed your lies!

27
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,537
I never lied to you.

28
00:03:28,537 --> 00:03:31,437
Who do you think I work so hard for?

29
00:03:31,437 --> 00:03:33,103
Who?

30
00:03:33,103 --> 00:03:35,604
You work hard for yourself.

31
00:03:35,604 --> 00:03:39,712
You want everything that belongs to Kang Sihan.

32
00:03:41,562 --> 00:03:43,229
That includes his woman.

33
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:45,279
Say that again.

34
00:03:47,537 --> 00:03:49,279
Say that again!

35
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:01,587
Yin Zheng, I'm so afraid.

36
00:04:02,787 --> 00:04:04,870
I don't want to lose you.

37
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,896
Don't be afraid, okay?

38
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:09,129
You won't lose me.

39
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,745
Promise me.

40
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:14,687
Don't leave me. Don't stop loving me.

41
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:18,204
I promise you.

42
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:21,295
You swear?

43
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:25,312
I want you to swear.

44
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:27,829
Don't be difficult, okay?

45
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:29,187
What's going on with you?

46
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:31,604
You said you were downstairs when I called.

47
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,345
But you never came.

48
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:35,229
Did something happen?

49
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:36,838
Where have you been?

50
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:42,620
I didn't do anything.

51
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,587
My car broke down.

52
00:04:44,587 --> 00:04:46,104
Lan Lan,

53
00:04:46,104 --> 00:04:49,354
I feel like you're in some trouble.

54
00:04:49,354 --> 00:04:51,062
Is something going on?

55
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:56,171
No, I'm fine.

56
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:05,579
I made a mistake.

57
00:05:06,896 --> 00:05:08,879
I should've waited for you.

58
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:11,537
I shouldn't have been so selfish.

59
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:13,529
I shouldn't have been worried about making the old man angry.

60
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:17,337
Forgive me, okay?

61
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,919
Okay?

♫ <i>My love is like dust, scattered in the border zone</i> ♫

<i>Kang Sihan, watch yourself.</i>

67
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:14,546
<i>This is none of your business.</i>

68
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:27,229
<i>Mind your own business.</i>

69
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:29,520
<i>I don't want to.</i>

70
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,187
<i>You want everything that belongs to me, right?</i>

71
00:06:33,187 --> 00:06:35,003
<i>She doesn't belong to you.</i>

72
00:07:07,154 --> 00:07:08,687
Xiaoxiao.

73
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:11,038
You don't want to say hello to me?

74
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:12,495
Director Kang, I think you got the wrong person.

75
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:13,620
Impossible.

76
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,020
We also met here the other day.

77
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,646
You said you'd call me later.

78
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:18,079
I'm sure it's you.

79
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,245
I'm sorry.

80
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:21,854
I don't have time to argue with you.

81
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:25,270
I want to know why you pretended to be Zhang Xiao.

82
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,620
I don't know what are you talking about.

83
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,687
You look like her.

84
00:07:29,687 --> 00:07:31,854
Your body figure, and your appearance.

85
00:07:31,854 --> 00:07:33,662
Others will find it's difficult to differentiate you two.

86
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,420
But you missed something.

87
00:07:37,787 --> 00:07:40,646
She always calls me Black Cat Detective.

88
00:07:40,646 --> 00:07:42,796
She doesn't call me Sihan.

89
00:07:43,512 --> 00:07:46,646
<i>There's a good play at the National Theater tonight.</i>

90
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:48,871
<i>Let's go together.</i>

91
00:07:48,871 --> 00:07:50,504
<i>Sihan, I need to think about it first.</i>

92
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:53,312
<i>I will call you tonight, I have to go.</i>

93
00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:55,587
That's not the weirdest part.

94
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:57,479
After she put on your jacket,

95
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,754
she was suddenly attacked.

96
00:07:59,754 --> 00:08:01,562
Tell me.

97
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:05,537
Who was the attacker's actual target?

98
00:08:07,495 --> 00:08:09,219
Miss Lan.

99
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:10,919
You are Yin Zheng's woman.

100
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,687
I don't know and I also don't want to know who you are.

101
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:16,562
Why did you pretend to be Zhang Xiao?

102
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,720
Now that Zhang Xiao got attacked I have to do something about it.

103
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,546
I'm warning you.

104
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,812
Do not try to hurt her.

105
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:27,496
Otherwise you need to bear the consequences.

106
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,212
Black Cat Detective.

107
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:34,145
Let's go.

108
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:35,454
Don't go.

109
00:08:36,512 --> 00:08:40,470
If you don't do anything this time, it might happen again next time.

110
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:44,687
Enough, let's go.

111
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:46,395
Don't go.

112
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:49,938
Just now your Black Cat Detective said that I pretended to be you.

113
00:08:49,938 --> 00:08:52,687
Talking about pretending,

114
00:08:52,687 --> 00:08:56,562
I should let him know how you pretended to be me.

115
00:08:56,562 --> 00:08:57,479
Lan Lan.

116
00:08:57,479 --> 00:09:01,496
What? Feeling nervous?

117
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,754
Director Kang, aren't you curious?

118
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:06,329
I don't want to know.

119
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:09,595
I'm not interested at all in what you're going to tell me.

120
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,812
But if you insist,

121
00:09:12,812 --> 00:09:15,054
I will listen.

122
00:09:15,562 --> 00:09:17,687
But I trust Zhang Xiao.

123
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:21,487
Even if she pretended to be you, she would never do anything to hurt you.

124
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,938
It's okay, let her continue.

125
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:29,812
During the opening ceremony,

126
00:09:29,812 --> 00:09:33,854
I was not the one who was on stage.

127
00:09:33,854 --> 00:09:36,079
I knew you would mention that.

128
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,454
It's spreading all over the internet.

129
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:39,604
It's not news anymore.

130
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:44,620
Then couldn't you tell that she was pretending to be me to seduce Yin Zheng?

131
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,812
Lan Lan, Director Yin asked me to stand in for you.

132
00:09:49,812 --> 00:09:51,138
Miss Lan.

133
00:09:51,138 --> 00:09:54,287
Don't you think what you said is funny?

134
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:56,120
Zhang Xiao is my girlfriend.

135
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,912
Why would she go to seduce Yin Zheng without any reason?

136
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:04,162
I know her well enough to believe she would never do such a thing.

137
00:10:04,162 --> 00:10:07,245
On the contrary, you should go ask Yin Zheng.

138
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:10,462
Why did he force Zhang Xiao to do that?

139
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,303
And since you mentioned seduction,

140
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:22,896
I advise you to go back and look after your man.

141
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:26,637
Don't let him out to seduce someone else's girlfriend.

142
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,671
Forget about it, let's go.

143
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,454
Last warning.

144
00:10:32,454 --> 00:10:33,912
Stay away from Zhang Xiao.

145
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:35,896
If something happens to her,

146
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:37,579
I'll give you a hard time.

147
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,212
Let's go.

148
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,454
Drive.

149
00:11:28,495 --> 00:11:30,162
Ma Wa.

150
00:11:30,162 --> 00:11:32,879
I received your email.

151
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:36,619
I read it with tears and snivel.

152
00:11:37,604 --> 00:11:39,479
Ma Wa, no.

153
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:43,580
Lan Lan. Miss Lan.

154
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:46,687
I picked you up off the streets back in the day,

155
00:11:46,687 --> 00:11:49,838
and this is how you repay me?

156
00:11:49,838 --> 00:11:51,671
Yin Chenggui.

157
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:54,546
Stop acting pitiful.

158
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,270
I worked for you for many years.

159
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,520
I earned you a lot of money.

160
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,429
I've repaid you enough already.

161
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,020
Just let me go.

162
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,896
I know you're capable.

163
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:12,419
I've always seen you as my own daughter.

164
00:12:12,954 --> 00:12:16,954
But you betrayed me.

165
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:19,854
It's fine if you just ran away like that,

166
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:24,103
but now you're even using phone recordings to threaten me.

167
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:26,337
You can't blame me for that.

168
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:31,495
You taught me to doubt everything.

169
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:36,245
You were the one who told me to not trust anybody.

170
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:41,871
So you're cutting me off?

171
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:45,287
I wrote it very clear in my email.

172
00:12:45,287 --> 00:12:47,479
I don't want to repeat what I said.

173
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,320
What a shame.

174
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:53,854
Yin Zheng wanted to boost your career

175
00:12:53,854 --> 00:12:58,279
but your betrayal spoiled it.

176
00:13:00,354 --> 00:13:04,279
What are you going to do?

177
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:10,596
You want to be famous?

178
00:13:11,979 --> 00:13:17,320
Your picture will be on every newspaper and website tomorrow.

179
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:20,387
But...

180
00:13:21,495 --> 00:13:24,329
It's hard to take a nice picture of you.

181
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:27,754
Han Qing.

182
00:13:30,896 --> 00:13:32,562
How did she betray you last time?

183
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,020
You still remember, right?

184
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,062
You've been looking for her for three years.

185
00:13:37,062 --> 00:13:39,203
She makes you suffer and frustrated.

186
00:13:39,203 --> 00:13:41,429
She has you working like a slave.

187
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:44,495
However many times she stabbed you in the heart,

188
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:48,120
use this knife to scratch her face just as many times.

189
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,312
Destroy the face that you miss for days and nights.

190
00:13:51,312 --> 00:13:54,120
Then you won't miss her again.

191
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,270
And it will heal your pain of looking for her for three years.

192
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,638
Take this.

193
00:14:01,537 --> 00:14:03,095
Take it.

194
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:20,729
Yin Chenggui, you're really ruthless.

195
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:28,704
You're an expert at making two lovers hurt each other.

196
00:14:28,704 --> 00:14:30,820
You did it to Yin Zheng.

197
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,629
And now you're doing the same thing to Han Qing.

198
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:38,896
You're using Han Qing to incite our relationship?

199
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:40,854
I'm not trying to incite.

200
00:14:40,854 --> 00:14:42,979
I just want to tell you.

201
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:47,287
Do you really think that I'm so stupid to keep your phone recordings in my house?

202
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:51,245
I've uploaded them to a safe website.

203
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:53,546
If I don't log in for three days,

204
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:57,103
they will be sent to every main website.

205
00:14:57,103 --> 00:15:03,719
Then everyone will see your true colors.

206
00:15:04,354 --> 00:15:06,646
You're so vicious.

207
00:15:06,646 --> 00:15:09,429
I've worked with you for many years.

208
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:11,970
Of course I've learned something from you.

209
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:16,287
Han Qing, come.

210
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:19,929
Put all the hatred you've had over the years on my face now.

211
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:28,654
Alright.

212
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:32,603
You win, I give up.

213
00:15:35,312 --> 00:15:37,854
I won't tell anybody about your past.

214
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,504
Just continue to be a model.

215
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,270
I hope you don't expose my secret either.

216
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,938
I'll give you a property in Canada.

217
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:50,779
What do you think?

218
00:15:53,562 --> 00:15:55,412
That's not possible.

219
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,712
Why not?

220
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:58,454
I won't leave here.

221
00:15:58,454 --> 00:16:00,562
Because of Yin Zheng?

222
00:16:00,562 --> 00:16:02,720
I've fallen in love with Yin Zheng.

223
00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:05,062
I won't leave him.

224
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:09,396
No deal will cause us to be apart, no matter what.

225
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:14,879
Ma Wa.

226
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,420
Did you forget what I told you?

227
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,629
When you've truly fallen in love with somebody,

228
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:24,646
then you're done for.

229
00:16:26,162 --> 00:16:28,854
Han Qing was like this.

230
00:16:29,854 --> 00:16:32,703
You want to be like him?

231
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:36,138
I'm different from him.

232
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,812
He fell in love with the wrong person.

233
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,920
I didn't.

234
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:50,620
You better have Han Qing protect me 24/7.

235
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,054
If something happens to me,

236
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:55,645
you'll regret it.

237
00:16:56,312 --> 00:16:59,546
Han Qing, bring her home.

238
00:17:00,412 --> 00:17:02,170
Just go.

239
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,740
<i>[Yin Zheng]</i>

240
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,719
Hi.

241
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:16,212
I'm on the way back.

242
00:18:16,938 --> 00:18:20,003
I had a meal with my friend just now.

243
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,254
Okay, goodbye.

244
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,570
<i>[Chaowai Square]</i>

245
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,671
<i>Don't do the fire scene.</i>

246
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,612
<i>Boss will kill you.</i>

247
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,437
What?

248
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:51,838
You want Zhang Xiao to become your assistant?

249
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:54,579
Can't I?

250
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:58,979
Are you still mad at me?

251
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:02,103
No.

252
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:04,429
This has nothing to do with what happened that day.

253
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,019
Then why?

254
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:11,819
I thought about it the past few days.

255
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,896
Zhang Xiao's a great person.

256
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:18,896
I just haven't been nice to her.

257
00:20:18,896 --> 00:20:22,479
So I want to take this chance to get along with her.

258
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:24,919
Maybe she doesn't like me.

259
00:20:25,595 --> 00:20:28,245
But I want to give myself a chance to explain to her.

260
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:34,171
This is good.

261
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,796
But...

262
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,620
She's Kang Sihan's girlfriend.

263
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,704
So what?

264
00:20:42,704 --> 00:20:45,912
She'll be my assistant, not my maid.

265
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:48,771
Moreover,

266
00:20:48,771 --> 00:20:51,312
isn't she your assistant?

267
00:20:51,312 --> 00:20:55,487
If you tell her, she wouldn't refuse.

268
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,754
Come in.

269
00:21:27,812 --> 00:21:29,646
This is the drafted design from the Design Department.

270
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:32,320
Please sign if it's approved.

271
00:21:38,454 --> 00:21:41,903
How should I thank you for the release conference?

272
00:21:42,495 --> 00:21:43,996
No need, you're welcome.

273
00:21:45,245 --> 00:21:47,537
If you say so.

274
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:49,629
Then I'll consider it I don't owe you any favors.

275
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:53,254
Wait.

276
00:21:55,103 --> 00:21:57,287
I want to ask you a question.

277
00:21:58,495 --> 00:21:59,938
What is it?

278
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:04,462
What do you think of Lan Lan?

279
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:08,212
You want my honest opinion?

280
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:10,754
I only want the truth.

281
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,604
She is emotional.

282
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:21,029
Sometimes she even can't even control herself.

283
00:22:21,979 --> 00:22:25,337
She told me that she's claustrophobic.

284
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:28,019
I don't know whether it's true or not.

285
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:29,437
She didn't lie.

286
00:22:29,437 --> 00:22:31,796
She does have it.

287
00:22:32,604 --> 00:22:35,354
Then I should treat her like a patient.

288
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:40,937
But I feel like there's other reasons.

289
00:22:41,938 --> 00:22:46,004
Some people might look fierce,

290
00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:50,690
but actually they're very sensitive and weak inside.

291
00:22:51,562 --> 00:22:54,220
That's why they pretend like they're aggressive

292
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,912
to scare people off and protect themselves.

293
00:22:57,912 --> 00:23:02,612
Maybe Miss Lan isn't as strong as she seems.

294
00:23:03,812 --> 00:23:05,919
I knew I was right about you.

295
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,829
You do know Lan Lan well.

296
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:11,287
Something's been on my mind the past few days.

297
00:23:13,996 --> 00:23:18,270
Can you become her assistant and go shoot her offsite scenes with her?

298
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,938
What?

299
00:23:19,938 --> 00:23:23,354
I just want you to spend some time with her.

300
00:23:23,354 --> 00:23:25,312
She has to go away so far all on her own

301
00:23:25,312 --> 00:23:27,520
and stay for two months.

302
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,629
I'm worried about her.

303
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,312
I don't want to.

304
00:23:36,437 --> 00:23:38,979
I know you don't like her.

305
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:41,879
Nobody can tolerate her temper.

306
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:45,379
But maybe it's like what you said.

307
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:49,954
This is how she covers her weaker side.

308
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,704
I am not saying I don't like her.

309
00:23:53,704 --> 00:23:58,395
But the best way for us to get along is to not see each other.

310
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:02,537
She may seem arrogant and aggressive.

311
00:24:02,537 --> 00:24:04,162
But she's not a bad person.

312
00:24:04,162 --> 00:24:06,145
There are many people in the company.

313
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:08,146
Why me?

314
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,504
I just want you to do it.

315
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:17,019
Of course I won't force you.

316
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:19,412
Do consider it.

317
00:24:19,412 --> 00:24:23,870
But for me, it's just a part of your job.

318
00:25:05,854 --> 00:25:09,079
Lan Lan, what happened?

319
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:15,379
Are you okay? Don't scare me.

320
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:19,620
Somebody turned off the light just now.

321
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:23,087
It was so dark.

322
00:25:23,087 --> 00:25:25,045
You're fine now.

323
00:25:26,312 --> 00:25:27,919
Don't cry.

324
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:30,954
I'm claustrophobic.

325
00:25:30,954 --> 00:25:32,504
I know.

326
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:36,354
But it's okay, even if it's a blackout,

327
00:25:36,354 --> 00:25:37,962
I'm still by your side.

328
00:25:37,962 --> 00:25:41,596
Xiaoxiao, thank you.

329
00:25:42,454 --> 00:25:44,404
Thank you so much.

330
00:25:45,103 --> 00:25:47,720
I'm feeling a lot of pressure.

331
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,403
I have to shoot my offsite scenes soon.

332
00:25:51,495 --> 00:25:53,520
But I'm worried I can't do it well

333
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,029
and disappoint Yin Zheng.

334
00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:58,204
People will laugh at me.

335
00:25:59,662 --> 00:26:01,295
I'm worried

336
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,562
that I'll get a panic attack.

337
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:07,854
Why do you keep thinking about the bad things?

338
00:26:07,854 --> 00:26:12,654
Because my disease is a fact.

339
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:39,529
She's claustrophobic.

340
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:44,529
People who have this disease will become emotional and lose control.

341
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:46,404
I don't believe what she said.

342
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:49,320
All words coming out from her mouth are lies.

343
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,462
But I have a strange feeling towards her.

344
00:26:52,462 --> 00:26:54,037
What feeling is it?

345
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,520
I don't know why.

346
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,154
But I always want to forgive her actions.

347
00:27:03,437 --> 00:27:06,687
You are just being too kind.

348
00:27:06,687 --> 00:27:07,987
Just eat.

349
00:27:07,987 --> 00:27:09,295
No.

350
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,003
What else could it be then?

351
00:27:12,003 --> 00:27:14,246
I don't know how to say this.

352
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,119
I just feel...

353
00:27:17,712 --> 00:27:19,920
Like I know her very well.

354
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,362
And I'm sure I've seen her magnolia earring before.

355
00:27:24,362 --> 00:27:26,779
This is getting complicated.

356
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,770
Every time I see her,

357
00:27:29,787 --> 00:27:33,794
I feel a kind of intimacy.

358
00:27:33,794 --> 00:27:36,594
Intimacy?

359
00:27:36,594 --> 00:27:38,386
With that cold face?

360
00:27:38,386 --> 00:27:41,169
Only Yin Zheng can feel intimacy towards her.

361
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:44,069
I actually feel bad for her.

362
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:48,910
Sometimes those who seem aggressive are actually weak inside.

363
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:52,759
Xiaoxiao, I don't think so.

364
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:53,869
You hate her that much?

365
00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:55,469
No.

366
00:27:55,469 --> 00:27:56,486
I just have my doubts about her.

367
00:27:56,486 --> 00:27:58,260
I doubt everything about her.

368
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,027
You have to trust my judgement.

369
00:28:01,027 --> 00:28:03,111
Stay away from her.

370
00:28:07,902 --> 00:28:09,197
By the way,

371
00:28:09,197 --> 00:28:11,130
you said you wanted to discuss something with me.

372
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,847
What is it?

373
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,144
Nothing.

374
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,730
<i>[The Secrets of Princess Yuxi]</i>

375
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,063
Dad.

376
00:28:45,063 --> 00:28:48,189
You haven't called in two months.

377
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:51,840
You're coming to Beijing?

378
00:28:53,615 --> 00:28:57,499
But I'm on a work trip now.

379
00:28:57,499 --> 00:28:58,858
Yes.

380
00:28:58,858 --> 00:29:02,190
How about you come in a week?

381
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,065
I'll ask for leave from my company.

382
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,457
No problem.

383
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:08,323
It won't disturb my work.

384
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:12,440
Alright, I've got to go, goodbye.

385
00:29:21,082 --> 00:29:22,607
Aunt Lan knows this guy too?

386
00:29:22,607 --> 00:29:23,774
It was a coincidence.

387
00:29:23,774 --> 00:29:24,939
Mom seldom comes to my place.

388
00:29:24,939 --> 00:29:27,207
But she came yesterday.

389
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:29,566
She looked at this picture for a long time.

390
00:29:29,566 --> 00:29:30,674
So I asked my mom,

391
00:29:30,674 --> 00:29:32,774
Mom, do you know this guy?

392
00:29:32,774 --> 00:29:36,440
She said he looks like Big Brother's uncle's subordinate.

393
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,207
He was at Zhen Tian for dad's sixtieth birthday celebration.

394
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:42,816
But we didn't go on the day.

395
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:44,315
Right.

396
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:48,816
Yin Zheng's uncle's subordinate?

397
00:29:48,816 --> 00:29:52,223
What do you think his relationship is with Lan Lan?

398
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:55,357
Zhang Xiao said the hitman mentioned something about his boss.

399
00:29:55,357 --> 00:29:59,482
Do you think that Yin Zheng's uncle is Lan Lan's boss?

400
00:29:59,482 --> 00:30:00,982
In that case,

401
00:30:00,982 --> 00:30:03,524
Lan Lan's background isn't simple.

402
00:30:03,524 --> 00:30:05,190
If it is true,

403
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,307
this has gotten more complicated.

404
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:18,816
Zhuo Yue, go to the Personnel Department to check Lan Lan's personal details.

405
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:21,132
Ask a friend from Australia to verify the information too.

406
00:30:21,132 --> 00:30:23,249
Keep this a secret.

407
00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:24,540
Okay.

408
00:30:25,065 --> 00:30:26,965
You're suspicious of Lan Lan?

409
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:29,932
After the incident,

410
00:30:29,932 --> 00:30:32,132
I've been suspecting her.

411
00:30:38,165 --> 00:30:43,582
Roujia, who is the crown prince to you?

412
00:30:43,582 --> 00:30:46,215
And who am I to you?

413
00:30:46,215 --> 00:30:51,591
Prince Xun, you mean...

414
00:30:51,591 --> 00:30:53,040
Yes.

415
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,774
I'm telling you how I feel.

416
00:30:55,774 --> 00:30:58,290
I'm confessing to you.

417
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,607
Do you get it?

418
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,215
I...

419
00:31:01,215 --> 00:31:03,507
You must answer me.

420
00:31:03,507 --> 00:31:05,240
Don't try to escape.

421
00:31:06,716 --> 00:31:11,099
Are you willing to spend the rest of your life with me?

422
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:16,566
When will this water cease?

423
00:31:16,566 --> 00:31:19,524
When will this hatred end?

424
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:22,682
I wish for your heart to be with mine,

425
00:31:23,274 --> 00:31:26,124
then it will not disappoint my love for you.

426
00:31:27,107 --> 00:31:32,999
To see this jade is like seeing me.

427
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:35,149
Wait until I come back from the battlefield.

428
00:31:35,149 --> 00:31:38,632
I will go to beg His Majesty to grant us this marriage.

429
00:31:47,332 --> 00:31:49,474
I will always carry it with me.

430
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,999
It will always be with me.

431
00:31:54,749 --> 00:32:00,107
And it will become the most precious thing to me.

432
00:32:00,107 --> 00:32:02,274
Cut, good one.

433
00:32:02,274 --> 00:32:04,065
Next will be the ninth scene.

434
00:32:04,065 --> 00:32:06,090
Alright, take a break.

435
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:16,749
Give me some water.

436
00:32:33,566 --> 00:32:38,816
I remember when I first saw you.

437
00:32:38,816 --> 00:32:41,591
You were wearing Qing Dynasty's costume too.

438
00:32:41,591 --> 00:32:45,649
Do you mean when I was shooting for the promotional poster?

439
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:50,266
When you were auditioning to be the auction's ambassador.

440
00:32:51,582 --> 00:32:53,566
Did we meet before?

441
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:55,899
You fell down from the staircase.

442
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:59,440
I wanted to help you up but I was blocked by the security guards.

443
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,939
I guess you didn't see me.

444
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:03,374
No.

445
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:07,899
After I got shocked by electricity,

446
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:10,132
I lost part of my memory.

447
00:33:10,939 --> 00:33:14,165
When I saw you dressing like this,

448
00:33:14,165 --> 00:33:16,482
that memory came back again.

449
00:33:16,482 --> 00:33:19,057
I remembered when I first saw you.

450
00:33:19,816 --> 00:33:23,999
Weren't you singing Snow Plum?

451
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:25,791
Yes.

452
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:27,215
So it's true.

453
00:33:28,515 --> 00:33:30,549
I really remembered.

454
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:38,416
Maybe I'll gradually get back my lost memories.

455
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:43,691
Can we really get back the things that we've lost?

456
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:47,316
I don't know, I guess so.

457
00:33:49,374 --> 00:33:51,791
You're too naive.

458
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:56,249
You can never get them back.

459
00:33:56,249 --> 00:33:57,370
Excuse me, Miss Lan Lan.

460
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,566
Mr. Director asks you to come over to discuss the later scenes.

461
00:33:59,566 --> 00:34:01,815
Okay, thanks.

464
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,149
Zhang Xiao didn't come to work today?

465
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:21,939
She went with Lan Lan to film.

466
00:34:21,939 --> 00:34:23,307
What?

467
00:34:24,023 --> 00:34:26,149
You didn't know?

468
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:27,858
Since when?

469
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:30,366

Lan Lan, what happened?

531
00:40:32,939 --> 00:40:36,858
Maybe it's because I had a nightmare and couldn't sleep last night.

532
00:40:36,858 --> 00:40:38,982
I had a stomachache.

Don't, I'm used to it.

Should I ask the director to shoot the other's scenes first?

00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,232
No.

541
00:41:10,232 --> 00:41:13,123
It's a taboo with film crews.

542
00:41:13,123 --> 00:41:16,440
Before coming here Yin Zheng told me

543
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,229
to not give the filming crew any trouble.

544
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:22,187

00:41:22,187 --> 00:41:23,504
Then what do we do?

546
00:41:23,504 --> 00:41:26,704
You can't shoot in this condition.

00:41:29,062 --> 00:41:30,619

The first scene is the fire scene.

550
00:41:39,754 --> 00:41:41,646
Then a change of set.

551
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:44,262
Another two action scenes for this afternoon.

552
00:41:46,729 --> 00:41:48,329
How about this?

553
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:51,662
The first fire scene doesn't require any talking.

554
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,587
Stand in for me.

555
00:41:54,587 --> 00:41:56,395
Me?

556
00:41:56,395 --> 00:41:57,979
I can't act.

557
00:41:57,979 --> 00:42:00,520
It's fine, you don't need to talk.

558
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,229
Just go through the motions and expressions.

559
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:03,970
It's simple.

560
00:42:04,919 --> 00:42:06,562
But...

561
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,087
Just help me this once.

562
00:42:12,145 --> 00:42:13,754
I'll give it a try.

563
00:42:13,754 --> 00:42:16,337
If I really can't do it, you have to do it.

564
00:42:16,337 --> 00:42:20,587
Should I ask the director to shoot the other's scenes first?

565
00:42:20,587 --> 00:42:22,320
No.

566
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,854
Don't let the director know about this.

567
00:42:25,854 --> 00:42:28,138
Otherwise our efforts will be wasted.

568
00:42:30,854 --> 00:42:33,438
Just think of yourself as me.

569
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,545
Believe that you're me.

570
00:42:37,545 --> 00:42:39,578
I'm you.

571
00:42:40,247 --> 00:42:44,395
Please, help me do this.

572
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,337
I just need to rest and I think I can get back to shooting this afternoon.

573
00:42:47,337 --> 00:42:50,820
Alright, take a rest then.

574
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,362
Here.

575
00:42:56,014 --> 00:42:57,771
What is that?

576
00:42:57,771 --> 00:42:59,440
The asbestos suit the crew dropped off.

577
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,504
They told you to put it on for the fire scene.

578
00:43:02,504 --> 00:43:04,662
Remember to wear it then.

579
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,087
Can you drive faster?

580
00:43:16,087 --> 00:43:17,087
I'm driving a truck.

581
00:43:17,087 --> 00:43:19,779
This is the fastest speed.

582
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,510
Hello?

583
00:43:24,103 --> 00:43:25,587
Secretary Qiao.

584
00:43:28,087 --> 00:43:29,879
I'm visiting Lan Lan.

585
00:43:29,879 --> 00:43:33,295
Tell them to wait until I'm done.

586
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:37,370
Okay, talk to you soon.

587
00:43:41,103 --> 00:43:42,896
Here.

588
00:43:42,896 --> 00:43:43,962
Lan Lan.

589
00:43:43,962 --> 00:43:47,337
This scene is about the crown prince sending people to burn Prince Xun's house

590
00:43:47,337 --> 00:43:49,919
because he envies him.

591
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,896
Princess Roujia rushes here after hearing the news

592
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:55,440
and rushes into the fire to look for the one she loves.

593
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,457
But she couldn't find him and her body catches fire.

594
00:43:59,457 --> 00:44:03,082
At that moment, she hears Prince Xun shouting for help at the east wing.

595
00:44:03,082 --> 00:44:04,607
So she risks her life to run to there.

596
00:44:04,607 --> 00:44:09,499
But one of Prince Xun's servant who holds a grudge on him locks her in the room.

597
00:44:09,499 --> 00:44:10,732
She is locked at the east wing.

598
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:12,357
That's the overall storyline.

599
00:44:12,357 --> 00:44:14,315
When your body is lit on fire,

600
00:44:14,315 --> 00:44:16,566
and you hear Prince Xun's scream, run in quickly.

601
00:44:16,566 --> 00:44:19,007
And the servant will lock the door, right?

602
00:44:19,007 --> 00:44:21,415
You just need to stand in the room for...

603
00:44:21,415 --> 00:44:22,624
Let me think.

604
00:44:22,624 --> 00:44:25,316
Ten seconds at most.
