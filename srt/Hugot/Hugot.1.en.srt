1
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:36,779
Shit! It’s starting.

2
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:39,646
Don’t stop!
I just need two more minutes.

3
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:12,651
Get down, quick!

4
00:01:18,865 --> 00:01:21,282
Pass the ball!

5
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:22,570
Where were you?

6
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:26,340
Coy, go!

7
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,500
Substitute with Muñoz.
Go. Hurry up.

8
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,304
Bring the ball down! Hurry!

9
00:01:43,913 --> 00:01:45,915
Look for an opening!

10
00:01:50,373 --> 00:01:51,641
Take the shot!

11
00:01:51,673 --> 00:01:52,899
Take the shot!

12
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:54,307
Yes!

13
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:56,994
You gotta do better than that!

14
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:00,045
Let me see some defense!

15
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,221
Hey, Aaron.

16
00:02:01,962 --> 00:02:04,533
I was wondering if
you’d like to add ten grand?

17
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:07,136
Come on, get the ball!

18
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:09,768
- Ten grand?
- We can do ten more.

19
00:02:09,793 --> 00:02:10,993
Ten more, yeah.

20
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,535
Set shot. Play set.

21
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:18,270
Let me see some defense!

22
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:21,667
Other side, over there.

23
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,182
Hustle down! Hustle down!

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,175
Pass! Pass!

25
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,644
Nice one!

26
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,980
Pass the ball!

27
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,628
Yes, that’s it!

28
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:56,228
Sprain! Sprain!

29
00:03:56,253 --> 00:03:57,354
Can he play?

30
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:58,616
He can’t, sir.

31
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:00,800
Medic! Medic!

32
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,459
- You sure it’s only a sprain?
- Yes.

33
00:04:02,484 --> 00:04:04,253
Get him up and bring him to the bench.

34
00:04:04,307 --> 00:04:05,404
I’ll help him.

35
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:06,831
Take him to the bench.

36
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:09,958
Come on.

37
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:12,761
Okay, Coy.

38
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,905
Let’s go for a simple play.

39
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:16,907
Pass to Martin,

40
00:04:17,332 --> 00:04:18,876
then cut to the middle.

41
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,327
Cut here.

42
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:22,996
The big man will give you a screen.

43
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:24,373
Screen here.

44
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:26,208
Make sure that Coy makes it here.

45
00:04:26,612 --> 00:04:27,938
Once you’re there,

46
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:30,401
Martin will hit you.

47
00:04:30,693 --> 00:04:32,564
Martin, pass the ball to Coy.

48
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:33,961
Take the shot.
The last shot.

49
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:35,675
- Okay, Coach.
- You got this.

50
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:37,346
You get it?

51
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:39,413
Damn it, Martin, don't force it!

52
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,477
You have four teammates!

53
00:04:40,502 --> 00:04:42,712
You have three guards
and still take the shot?

54
00:04:42,737 --> 00:04:44,432
Use your head!

55
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,528
Coy, you got this.

56
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:47,596
Okay, Madam.

57
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,651
Coy. Take your shot.

58
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:53,610
Let’s go! Let’s go!

59
00:05:23,232 --> 00:05:24,484
Congrats.

60
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:25,971
Keep up the good work.

61
00:05:27,073 --> 00:05:29,611
Okay, next. Martin.

62
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:31,378
Madam.

63
00:05:31,657 --> 00:05:33,190
That’s how you play.

64
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:34,660
Keep it up.

65
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:37,964
Thank you, Madam.

66
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:41,307
Cocoy, come here.

67
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:43,666
Good enough!

68
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:49,385
Here.

69
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:51,612
Thank you, Madam.

70
00:05:51,637 --> 00:05:55,971
Here’s another two thousand
for your winning shot.

71
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,353
You know… the other team
is protesting against you.

72
00:06:00,545 --> 00:06:03,549
Good thing the Barangay Chief
listed you as an import.

73
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:06,595
Anyway, congratulations.
You deserve it.

74
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,871
- Thank you, Madam.
- No problem.

75
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:09,856
- Coach.
- Coy, sit with me for a minute.

76
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:15,859
Chin, come here.

77
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,096
Coy, David’s holding
a tryout this week.

78
00:06:22,277 --> 00:06:24,738
I’ll try, Coach… you know how my dad is.

79
00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:27,542
He hates basketball.

80
00:06:27,974 --> 00:06:30,510
Make a way, Coy.

81
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,306
You have a better
chance with this tryout.

82
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:36,917
There’s only a slim chance of
getting scouted for the MPBL.

83
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:41,571
If you get in, you can play professionally
sooner than you think.

84
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:44,382
Remember this...

85
00:06:46,315 --> 00:06:48,192
If you get to play professionally,

86
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:49,677
that’s a long term career.

87
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:51,120
A long term relationship.

88
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:54,148
You’ll get a bigger pay than
what you’re getting now.

89
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,435
Make your dad understand.

90
00:06:57,323 --> 00:06:59,174
I’ll try, Coach.

91
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:01,615
Do it, Coy.

92
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:03,259
Make sure you get to the tryout.

93
00:07:04,463 --> 00:07:06,103
Alright, Coach.

94
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:09,351
Thank you again, Madam.

95
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:10,488
Take care.

96
00:07:24,742 --> 00:07:27,161
Didn’t I tell you I was lucky!

97
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,440
Stop bothering me, Japok.

98
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:31,818
I’ll stop if you make me your girlfriend.

99
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:34,370
We already do it all the time.

100
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:38,298
Damn you! I love you!

101
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:51,089
Mom!

102
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:54,806
You won, didn’t you?

103
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,556
When did I ever lose?

104
00:07:57,447 --> 00:07:58,658
That’s my son.

105
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:03,391
Coach said there’s a tryout
this week in Monumento.

106
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,167
Should I go?

107
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,494
Let me handle your dad.
Go to the tryout.

108
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:09,672
Here.

109
00:08:11,582 --> 00:08:15,056
Wow! You didn’t have to
but thank you, Coy.

110
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,101
Coy, I’m done!

111
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,378
Can you check on your dad, Coy?
I think he’s done.

112
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:42,932
Wait, wait.

113
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,847
Slowly, slowly.

114
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:02,416
Slowly, slowly.

115
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,846
How much did you win?

116
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:09,284
Five thousand.

117
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:12,049
Give me two thousand.

118
00:09:12,748 --> 00:09:14,333
I need it for my medication.

119
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,853
Here, Dad.

120
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:22,760
I brought some noodles.

121
00:09:22,785 --> 00:09:23,847
Okay.

122
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:31,776
The seaman application form
is on the table.

123
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:33,408
Sign it now.

124
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:37,600
I had Carlo rush it,
so you better sign it.

125
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:40,252
Sign it now!

126
00:09:45,574 --> 00:09:47,826
Coy, pass me your uniform.

127
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:48,852
I’ll wash it now.

128
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:53,675
Thanks, Mom.

129
00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:58,651
I'll just go up.

130
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:00,237
Go on, go on.

131
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:01,563
Thank you.

132
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:59,651
Everyone!

133
00:10:59,996 --> 00:11:03,416
Join us as we make this hot,
hot afternoon even hotter!

134
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:09,005
All the way from Barangay San Mateo,
the hot and spicy, Trixie!

135
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:15,276
And the sexiest lady in all of
Barangay San Nicholas, Japok!

136
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:17,679
And the newest fantasy from San Joaquin.

137
00:11:17,704 --> 00:11:22,333
The boombastic bombacious, Tina!

138
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:51,256
No touching, no contact but
drooling is 100 percent allowed!

139
00:12:59,532 --> 00:13:00,366
Pass the ball!

140
00:13:08,082 --> 00:13:09,208
Pass the goddamn ball!

141
00:13:10,184 --> 00:13:11,561
How am I supposed to pass?

142
00:13:11,586 --> 00:13:12,917
You have two defenders.

143
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:13,963
Find free space.

144
00:13:13,988 --> 00:13:16,628
Are you blind?
I’ve been free this whole time!

145
00:13:17,675 --> 00:13:20,053
You’re just unlucky today,
maybe next time.

146
00:13:23,995 --> 00:13:25,040
Good job.

147
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:37,045
Nice pass inside!

148
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,729
He shoots. And it counts!

149
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,060
Rosario, making a play...

150
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:52,500
And takes a three!

151
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:54,579
Another miss!

152
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:03,557
Make better plays.

153
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:07,149
Why did you throw my ball?

154
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:10,453
Don't you swear at me!

155
00:14:10,478 --> 00:14:11,729
I'm telling you!

156
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:12,696
Don't you dare!

157
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:14,649
Sir, relax.

158
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,610
I’m sure she didn’t
mean to throw your son’s ball.

159
00:14:17,635 --> 00:14:19,680
Relax? Relax?

160
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:22,298
How about you apologize to my son?

161
00:14:22,346 --> 00:14:23,954
And help us look for the ball.

162
00:14:25,201 --> 00:14:26,427
That's all we're asking.

163
00:14:26,452 --> 00:14:28,287
I’m sorry, Sir.

164
00:14:28,312 --> 00:14:29,649
Madam regrets it, I'm sure.

165
00:14:31,521 --> 00:14:33,940
Here's one thousand pesos.

166
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:35,592
Buy ten balls and get over it!

167
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:38,336
Not everything can be bought with money.

168
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:41,587
All we’re asking for is respect.

169
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:46,561
You're all acting tough,
yet you're not from here.

170
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:48,699
Let’s go, son.

171
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,548
I’m sorry, sir.

172
00:14:51,644 --> 00:14:53,493
The audacity!

173
00:14:54,313 --> 00:14:55,665
Who is he to curse at me?

174
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,358
And you're the one
asking for forgiveness?

175
00:14:57,383 --> 00:14:59,218
You were the one
that threw the ball.

176
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:01,134
Coy, let’s drink!

177
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,086
Just one.

178
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,671
My dad might smell me.

179
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:07,782
Our star player is
scared of his daddy?

180
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,251
Such a baby!

181
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:11,477
Botchok, shot.

182
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:13,507
I’m good. Thanks.

183
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:17,048
It’ll help with your bum knee.

184
00:15:17,446 --> 00:15:18,713
I’m good, man.

185
00:15:18,971 --> 00:15:20,806
That’s why your knee is so shit…

186
00:15:24,802 --> 00:15:26,008
By the way...

187
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:30,282
My girlfriend, Tina.

188
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:33,501
Botchok. Cocoy.

189
00:15:33,644 --> 00:15:36,647
You see them in my games, right?

190
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,000
But this one.

191
00:15:38,344 --> 00:15:40,343
He plays like he's always drunk!

192
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,187
Three travels?

193
00:15:42,384 --> 00:15:44,291
Don't you know how to dribble?

194
00:15:45,255 --> 00:15:47,851
I got called three times.

195
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:49,210
That's really traveling.

196
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,013
- Because you're drunk.
- You always move your pivot foot.

197
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:54,373
And you complained
too much to the referee.

198
00:15:54,398 --> 00:15:56,234
Of course, you’d get a technical.

199
00:15:56,434 --> 00:15:57,685
But what about him,

200
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,650
he travels all the time.

201
00:16:00,273 --> 00:16:02,000
He never gets called.

202
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:05,466
That’s called Superstar protection.

203
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:11,522
How about you teach us
your MVP moves, Coy?

204
00:16:12,524 --> 00:16:15,269
You can’t play Madam’s favorite forever.

205
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:17,079
Yeah, show us!

206
00:16:17,188 --> 00:16:21,446
Fine. I’ll show you
why you were traveling.

207
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:22,488
Wow.

208
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:26,047
You gotta make sure that
your pivot foot doesn’t move.

209
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:29,367
And add force to your back,

210
00:16:29,392 --> 00:16:31,540
so you can move past your opponent.

211
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:37,166
See my pivot?

212
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,627
That's an MVP move!

213
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:42,813
Heat check!

214
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:44,257
You smoking, bro!

215
00:16:44,382 --> 00:16:45,550
What did you do?

216
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:47,610
I’m so sorry.

217
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:48,768
He’s drunk.

218
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:49,877
Don't say sorry.

219
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,914
He's used to playing around.

220
00:16:53,242 --> 00:16:55,279
Right, Coy?

221
00:16:57,204 --> 00:16:59,149
I'm alright, thanks.

222
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,693
It’s just a joke, okay?

223
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,278
Pass it over here, Bro.

224
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:09,008
You can really feel the
Superstar difference.

225
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,665
Take this, Bro!

226
00:17:12,743 --> 00:17:13,618
Stop it.

227
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:15,766
I’m gonna take a piss.

228
00:17:16,973 --> 00:17:18,516
Babe, come with me.

229
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:23,821
Let’s grab more drinks inside.

230
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,074
Bro, we’ll be back in a bit.

231
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:43,232
Damn, why are you so irritable?

232
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,772
Babe, babe. Do that later.

233
00:17:48,797 --> 00:17:50,424
Come here for a bit.

234
00:17:51,198 --> 00:17:54,702
I said do that later
and come here now!

235
00:18:00,227 --> 00:18:04,003
Damn, my baby is so hot.

236
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,967
Please stop being annoyed already.

237
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,665
I just want one kiss from my baby.

238
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:14,655
Your friends are right there.

239
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,640
Who cares?

240
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:18,719
It’s not like they don’t do it too.

241
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,085
Let's do a quickie.

242
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,639
I know you want it too.

243
00:20:26,528 --> 00:20:28,105
Pass it here!

244
00:20:28,481 --> 00:20:30,149
Bro, pass it here. I'm open!

245
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:46,342
Wake up!

246
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:51,512
Sign this goddamn form
already and get it over with.

247
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,200
You’re getting on my nerves, boy.

248
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:56,961
What’s happening?

249
00:20:56,986 --> 00:21:00,270
Your son doesn’t know
what to do with his life.

250
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:01,372
But Dad,

251
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:03,723
I really don’t want to work on a ship.

252
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:05,367
And what's your plan?

253
00:21:05,392 --> 00:21:06,936
How are you gonna make money?

254
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:09,489
And don’t tell me basketball.

255
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,482
How much do you earn per game?

256
00:21:11,723 --> 00:21:13,406
Two thousand?
Three thousand?

257
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:16,270
And that’s if you win!
What if you lose?

258
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:17,389
What then?

259
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:21,176
Can we live off your trophies?

260
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,840
Can we eat your medals?

261
00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:27,620
MVP! MVP! I’ve had enough.

262
00:21:27,718 --> 00:21:29,303
What about helping your mom?

263
00:21:29,328 --> 00:21:31,830
Her back’s near broken washing clothes!

264
00:21:32,155 --> 00:21:34,074
Enough. The neighbors can hear you.

265
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:37,081
I don't care.

266
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:41,589
You're wasting a big opportunity here.

267
00:21:41,963 --> 00:21:44,841
Dad, I’ll return the money you spent.

268
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:45,918
Really?

269
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:47,237
You’ll return the money?

270
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:49,006
Why? You have money?

271
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:50,597
You have one hundred thousand?

272
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:54,183
Give it to me now
and I'll stop nagging.

273
00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:57,431
Just sign the goddamn paper!

274
00:21:57,456 --> 00:21:58,534
Pido!

275
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,362
Carlo is waiting outside, hurry!

276
00:22:07,424 --> 00:22:08,361
Pido.

277
00:22:08,386 --> 00:22:09,885
Complete your payment,

278
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,870
so I can expedite his papers.

279
00:22:12,554 --> 00:22:14,264
- Okay.
- You want it rushed, right?

280
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:16,261
Yes, I'm expecting a pension payment.

281
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:17,416
I need it soon.

282
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:40,710
Forgive your father, okay?

283
00:22:40,803 --> 00:22:42,221
You know how he is.

284
00:22:43,043 --> 00:22:45,462
Just follow what he says
and he’ll be at peace.

285
00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:49,483
But, Mom, I really don’t want
to work on a ship…

286
00:22:49,508 --> 00:22:51,677
And I’ll be apart from you.

287
00:22:53,183 --> 00:22:54,429
You know what,

288
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:59,559
just make sure
you do great at the tryouts.

289
00:23:01,703 --> 00:23:03,872
If you get in,
he can’t do anything anymore

290
00:23:03,897 --> 00:23:05,899
because you’ll be earning money.

291
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,151
I promise.

292
00:23:09,361 --> 00:23:11,738
When you go professional,

293
00:23:12,214 --> 00:23:14,925
I’ll be there in every game.

294
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,956
I’ll be your number one cheerleader.

295
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,137
Okay, Mom.

296
00:23:19,162 --> 00:23:20,690
Just do your best.

297
00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:29,982
Coy, Madam’s been stabbed!
We gotta go to the hospital now.

298
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:31,581
Hurry, bro. Get in!

299
00:23:47,112 --> 00:23:51,586
All of this because of a ball.
You almost died!

300
00:23:51,611 --> 00:23:53,071
You got stabbed because of it!

301
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:56,496
Did they say how long
you’ll be here for?

302
00:23:57,511 --> 00:23:59,761
The doctor said around two weeks.

303
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:00,839
Damn.

304
00:24:01,831 --> 00:24:05,333
Cocoy, you have to find
other ways to make cash.

305
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,570
I don’t want to finance games

306
00:24:07,686 --> 00:24:09,688
if I’m not there to monitor the bets.

307
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:11,308
Don’t worry, Madam.

308
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,295
Focus on getting better first.

309
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,609
I can't stay long,
my wife is waiting.

310
00:24:22,726 --> 00:24:26,121
You’ll leave us here hanging?

311
00:24:26,146 --> 00:24:27,647
Just for tonight, man.

312
00:24:27,672 --> 00:24:30,698
Once my knee heals,
I'll be back on the court.

313
00:24:30,796 --> 00:24:32,955
That will still take months.

314
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:34,480
Cocoy.

315
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,370
Cocoy, drink!

316
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,856
What's happening?

317
00:24:41,862 --> 00:24:43,081
You all right?

318
00:24:45,624 --> 00:24:47,834
Bro, Madam’s been stabbed.

319
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:49,978
- What?
- She can’t finance for awhile.

320
00:24:50,003 --> 00:24:51,546
How’s Madam? Is she okay?

321
00:24:52,297 --> 00:24:53,479
She’s okay.

322
00:24:53,528 --> 00:24:56,465
You know anyone who can
lend me a hundred grand?

323
00:24:57,758 --> 00:25:00,300
So I don’t have to work on a ship.

324
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:02,140
My dad’s been nagging hard.

325
00:25:02,927 --> 00:25:04,679
I don’t have a hundred grand on me.

326
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:06,879
But you see those two?

327
00:25:07,527 --> 00:25:09,800
They'll suck your dick for
one thousand five hundred.

328
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,065
That’s hella lot of dick sucking.

329
00:25:14,653 --> 00:25:15,862
But, dead serious.

330
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:18,010
You wanna make money?

331
00:25:18,596 --> 00:25:20,042
We’ll teach you how to knock.

332
00:25:22,695 --> 00:25:23,737
Knock?

333
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:30,377
Are we expecting company?

334
00:25:36,224 --> 00:25:38,252
Mr. Basketball!

335
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:41,692
To what do I owe this pleasure?

336
00:25:47,584 --> 00:25:50,081
Sit down.
You’re already in the house.

337
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:51,370
Please.

338
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:57,222
Sit down.

339
00:25:57,495 --> 00:25:58,573
Sit.

340
00:25:59,168 --> 00:26:01,504
He said sit down. So, sit down.

341
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,669
You speak English, yes?

342
00:26:07,245 --> 00:26:08,373
Small, Sir.

343
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,540
I speak Tagalog.

344
00:26:12,088 --> 00:26:13,299
Small too.

345
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:15,213
Clay!

346
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:23,346
I’ll get it, Boss.

347
00:26:36,693 --> 00:26:37,903
Excuse me.

348
00:26:49,164 --> 00:26:50,498
What I’m gonna need you to do…

349
00:26:56,703 --> 00:27:00,377
is take this item
to a certain school,

350
00:27:02,646 --> 00:27:04,198
to a certain teacher.

351
00:27:06,514 --> 00:27:07,641
You give it to him.

352
00:27:10,644 --> 00:27:13,050
In return, he’ll give you something back,

353
00:27:15,148 --> 00:27:16,775
and you’ll bring that to me.

354
00:27:19,953 --> 00:27:21,019
That’s it.

355
00:27:25,033 --> 00:27:27,928
All you have to do is
give this to the teacher.

356
00:27:27,953 --> 00:27:32,526
And, he’ll give you something in exchange.

357
00:27:33,893 --> 00:27:36,471
I can understand his English.

358
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:43,581
Just have to do it three times.

359
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,963
That’s it.

360
00:27:45,684 --> 00:27:47,352
One time only, Sir.

361
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:50,878
Clay.

362
00:27:56,971 --> 00:27:58,628
Three times.

363
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,784
Minimum.

364
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:09,448
He said three times minimum
or more.

365
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,399
Cigarette, please.

366
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:15,003
Shot for Boss.

367
00:28:20,494 --> 00:28:21,550
Come here.

368
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,520
I want you to take care of this.

369
00:28:37,272 --> 00:28:39,362
Like you take care of the basketball.

370
00:28:43,653 --> 00:28:45,280
Smoke.

371
00:28:54,581 --> 00:28:56,333
I need assurance.

372
00:29:02,464 --> 00:29:04,378
I don’t want you fooling me.

373
00:29:06,948 --> 00:29:14,292
So I want you to do Trixie,
or you do Gina.

374
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:27,595
Pick one!

375
00:29:28,424 --> 00:29:29,588
No, Sir.

376
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:35,080
Give me a coin.

377
00:29:52,514 --> 00:29:55,517
Heads, Trixie.

378
00:29:57,018 --> 00:30:00,487
Tails, Gina.

379
00:30:04,025 --> 00:30:06,111
There's the coin.

380
00:30:12,237 --> 00:30:13,440
Hurry up.

381
00:30:15,617 --> 00:30:17,036
Do it, Coy.

382
00:30:17,122 --> 00:30:19,003
Toss it, stupid.

383
00:30:26,253 --> 00:30:27,542
Heads, Sir.

384
00:30:30,526 --> 00:30:31,987
Sorry, babe.

385
00:30:38,026 --> 00:30:40,136
Do her.

386
00:30:41,377 --> 00:30:42,636
Do her, go!

387
00:30:42,661 --> 00:30:45,608
Do it already.

388
00:30:46,951 --> 00:30:50,854
Sir, what’s the assurance here?
I don't understand.

389
00:30:51,585 --> 00:30:56,994
The assurance is that
you won’t fool me,

390
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,957
so you do her.

391
00:31:02,052 --> 00:31:03,261
Now, please.

392
00:31:08,565 --> 00:31:10,190
- Go on.
- Let's go, Coy.

393
00:31:12,177 --> 00:31:16,014
You better do her,
or someone else will.

394
00:31:18,808 --> 00:31:19,839
My hits.

395
00:31:20,249 --> 00:31:21,456
My hits.

396
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,495
Is he really like that?

397
00:31:41,915 --> 00:31:43,222
His trip.

398
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:48,582
Let’s do this already
so you can deliver.

399
00:31:48,922 --> 00:31:52,592
Can’t we just say we did it?

400
00:31:54,258 --> 00:31:58,900
He’ll find out
if we didn’t do it.

401
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:01,476
How?

402
00:32:01,696 --> 00:32:02,964
I’ll tell him.

403
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,635
Let's go.

404
00:34:46,537 --> 00:34:50,474
Cocoy, we’ll drop you off at Pogi’s store.

405
00:34:50,499 --> 00:34:54,036
When you get there, you’ll tell Pogi…

406
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:59,722
I'll take Jane to school, she'll be late.

407
00:35:00,238 --> 00:35:02,192
It’s almost 9 o’clock.

408
00:35:03,508 --> 00:35:07,011
He’ll offer you food.
You’ll order four Kwek-Kwek.

409
00:35:07,036 --> 00:35:08,559
No more than four.

410
00:35:08,663 --> 00:35:12,965
You hungry?
I have Tinola, Menudo, Egg.

411
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:15,105
Here’s Hotdog.

412
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,731
- Batchoy?
- Just Kwek-Kwek.

413
00:35:20,748 --> 00:35:21,885
How many?

414
00:35:22,215 --> 00:35:23,361
Four.

415
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:26,854
Make it five?

416
00:35:28,602 --> 00:35:29,939
I’m good with four.

417
00:35:35,335 --> 00:35:39,397
Jane! It’s 9 o’clock,
you’re gonna be late.

418
00:35:39,422 --> 00:35:40,745
Your ride is here.

419
00:35:52,835 --> 00:35:54,165
Still hot.

420
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:12,059
I'll put your pin.

421
00:36:14,611 --> 00:36:19,250
There you go.
Have a great day at school, okay?

422
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:21,611
Be careful on your way there with…

423
00:36:21,986 --> 00:36:23,029
Cocoy.

424
00:36:23,054 --> 00:36:25,166
Cocoy will take you there.

425
00:36:36,752 --> 00:36:42,713
When you get to the school,
give the Kwek-Kwek to the entrance guard.

426
00:36:52,634 --> 00:36:53,802
It’s over here.

427
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,711
Go straight to room ten.

428
00:37:22,893 --> 00:37:23,959
This one?

429
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:25,932
Abakada!

430
00:37:26,354 --> 00:37:27,527
Very good.

431
00:37:27,552 --> 00:37:28,903
And this one?

432
00:37:28,928 --> 00:37:30,805
Ube.

433
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,331
And, what does Ube taste like?

434
00:37:32,658 --> 00:37:34,684
You’ll spot the teacher inside.

435
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:37,895
He’ll come out
to do the exchange with you.

436
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:43,935
Okay, class.

437
00:37:44,502 --> 00:37:46,921
I’m stepping out for a bit.

438
00:37:46,946 --> 00:37:50,065
Go to page 17.

439
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,155
Okay.

440
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,327
Answer questions numbers one to ten.

441
00:37:53,352 --> 00:37:55,897
When I get back, make sure
everything’s been answered. Okay?

442
00:37:56,022 --> 00:37:57,348
Okay.

443
00:37:57,373 --> 00:37:59,674
I just need to talk to someone.

444
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,550
Aren’t you gonna check?

445
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:05,971
Oh, yes.

446
00:39:25,169 --> 00:39:27,713
You got any more questions, Bro?

447
00:39:28,456 --> 00:39:30,354
You got this, Cocoy.

448
00:40:03,196 --> 00:40:04,739
Good job, Mr. Basketball.

449
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:10,873
Take your money and go.

450
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:14,127
Thanks, Boss.

451
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:03,096
Girl.

452
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:05,502
Woman.

453
00:42:06,247 --> 00:42:08,082
Hope.

454
00:43:22,426 --> 00:43:24,884
You really are, Mr. Basketball!

455
00:43:25,806 --> 00:43:27,166
Yes, Sir.

456
00:43:31,582 --> 00:43:32,416
Coy.

457
00:43:33,292 --> 00:43:34,001
Coy.

458
00:43:34,501 --> 00:43:38,923
Make that shot and
Tina says she’ll suck your dick.

459
00:44:38,232 --> 00:44:39,375
Coy.

460
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,317
Coy, wake up.

461
00:44:40,342 --> 00:44:41,385
We're here.

462
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:18,596
Almost there!

463
00:45:18,621 --> 00:45:19,330
Yes.

464
00:45:23,675 --> 00:45:25,052
Sorry. Sorry.

465
00:45:32,492 --> 00:45:33,560
Let’s go.

466
00:45:55,149 --> 00:45:56,265
Stop.

467
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,898
Screw you. Stop it!

468
00:46:15,996 --> 00:46:17,206
- Clay.
- Yeah?

469
00:46:18,017 --> 00:46:19,285
Step out of the car.

470
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:20,000
Why?

471
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,460
We’ll just do a quick session.

472
00:46:21,485 --> 00:46:24,539
Why? I’m not even
bothering you guys.

473
00:46:24,564 --> 00:46:26,632
Hurry up.

474
00:46:26,657 --> 00:46:28,158
Screw you, man.

475
00:46:40,746 --> 00:46:42,289
There’s your teacher.

476
00:46:42,314 --> 00:46:42,981
Oh, yeah.

477
00:46:42,981 --> 00:46:44,483
Is that your math teacher?

478
00:46:44,508 --> 00:46:47,469
Yes. Over there is my English teacher.

479
00:46:49,863 --> 00:46:53,033
Do you know those kids?

480
00:46:53,033 --> 00:46:56,453
Yeah they're my playmates!

481
00:46:57,162 --> 00:47:00,582
We play after class.

482
00:47:06,338 --> 00:47:08,215
Try playing volleyball sometime.

483
00:47:12,194 --> 00:47:14,113
Why are they outside?

484
00:47:14,138 --> 00:47:18,475
I’ll let you know when
I hear something, Sir…

485
00:47:18,475 --> 00:47:20,071
Give me your phone number.

486
00:47:20,096 --> 00:47:21,228
Okay.

487
00:47:21,486 --> 00:47:25,824
If I see anything unusual,
I'll let you know.

488
00:47:28,652 --> 00:47:30,008
Hurry up.

489
00:47:32,781 --> 00:47:33,657
Why?

490
00:47:36,414 --> 00:47:37,119
Come on.

491
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,871
But that’s our room!

492
00:47:44,168 --> 00:47:45,878
Hurry, you have two more minutes.

493
00:48:40,572 --> 00:48:44,312
Damn assholes.
You could have included me at least!

494
00:49:08,203 --> 00:49:09,312
Boss.

495
00:49:11,922 --> 00:49:13,423
Her hair pin.

496
00:49:27,354 --> 00:49:28,605
Hurry. Hurry.

497
00:49:32,432 --> 00:49:33,964
Hurry. Hurry.

498
00:49:36,863 --> 00:49:38,448
Everyone stay in the area!

499
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:49,543
You're all under arrest!

500
00:49:50,252 --> 00:49:52,129
Stop resisting!

501
00:49:59,886 --> 00:50:01,013
Shit!

502
00:50:05,065 --> 00:50:08,478
Where are you going?

503
00:50:55,108 --> 00:50:56,401
I bought merienda.

504
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,471
Son?

505
00:50:59,571 --> 00:51:00,627
Coy?

506
00:51:01,657 --> 00:51:02,752
Coy!

507
00:51:23,261 --> 00:51:24,221
Shit.

508
00:51:31,103 --> 00:51:33,480
Dad, where’s my money?

509
00:51:35,357 --> 00:51:35,941
What?

510
00:51:37,067 --> 00:51:38,527
I worked hard for that!

511
00:51:38,794 --> 00:51:40,295
Where’s my money?

512
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,792
What did you say?

513
00:51:42,781 --> 00:51:45,175
You greedy bastard.

514
00:51:45,342 --> 00:51:49,471
You know I only take
my medication once a day?

515
00:51:49,496 --> 00:51:52,249
I’m supposed to take
that three times a day!

516
00:51:52,499 --> 00:52:00,613
And, then I find out that you’re
hoarding a ton of cash up there?

517
00:52:01,024 --> 00:52:02,526
Ungrateful shit!

518
00:52:02,551 --> 00:52:05,303
Your money’s yours
but if it’s our money,

519
00:52:05,328 --> 00:52:06,489
it’s yours too?

520
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,863
Do you see how messed up that is?

521
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,254
But I worked hard for that money.

522
00:52:11,702 --> 00:52:16,861
I’ll tell you the truth.
I gave it to Carlo.

523
00:52:16,886 --> 00:52:19,126
I had to pay for your papers or
we'll go nowhere.

524
00:52:19,151 --> 00:52:20,944
I’m tired of both of you!

525
00:52:21,862 --> 00:52:23,780
What’s wrong with you?

526
00:52:23,805 --> 00:52:24,885
Cocoy!

527
00:52:27,284 --> 00:52:28,577
Pido, that was too much.

528
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,454
Irritating shit!

529
00:52:33,165 --> 00:52:34,458
That was your son’s money.

530
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:36,084
It’s mine also!

531
00:52:41,089 --> 00:52:44,628
I used it for his future anyway.

532
00:52:45,177 --> 00:52:49,706
When he becomes a seaman,
he’ll make more money.

533
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:52,642
He’ll make back everything I got and more.

534
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:55,128
I don’t understand you anymore.

535
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:15,370
Hey.

536
00:53:17,542 --> 00:53:18,627
What’s your problem?

537
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:21,421
Nothing.

538
00:53:30,858 --> 00:53:32,526
Why aren’t you with Martin?

539
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,339
Don’t ever say his name again.

540
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:39,529
What happened?

541
00:53:39,625 --> 00:53:41,894
I caught him texting another girl,

542
00:53:42,387 --> 00:53:43,889
he still doesn't want to admit it.

543
00:53:44,856 --> 00:53:46,323
What’s your problem?

544
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:50,128
Girl?

545
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:52,104
Family.

546
00:53:54,454 --> 00:53:56,289
So we both have problems.

547
00:53:57,123 --> 00:53:58,834
Guess we're meant to be together.

548
00:54:24,985 --> 00:54:26,862
We’re back on the court tomorrow.

549
00:54:29,155 --> 00:54:30,615
Madam’s fully recovered.

550
00:54:33,493 --> 00:54:35,745
Back to basketball again.

551
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:40,959
Want a puff?

552
00:54:42,335 --> 00:54:44,170
Athletes can’t smoke.

553
00:54:47,032 --> 00:54:49,968
It’s just one puff.
You’re not gonna die from one.

554
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:55,454
I didn’t say puff from here…

555
00:58:15,845 --> 00:58:17,859
Happy birthday!

556
00:58:17,884 --> 00:58:19,886
Happy birthday, Cocoy!

557
00:58:19,886 --> 00:58:20,929
It’s my son’s birthday!

558
00:58:20,929 --> 00:58:23,306
A little takeout would be nice.

559
00:58:23,331 --> 00:58:25,041
Where’s my basketball uniform?

560
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:26,807
Right here.

561
00:58:26,832 --> 00:58:31,551
I hung it last night
right after I washed it.

562
00:58:32,565 --> 00:58:33,858
Where did it go?

563
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:44,077
I’m sure it was here. Maybe it fell…

564
00:58:44,077 --> 00:58:45,703
It’s not upstairs either.

565
00:58:45,703 --> 00:58:49,048
I’m sure I washed it last night.

566
00:58:49,916 --> 00:58:53,837
We’ll borrow a uniform so he can play.
I mean it’s just a uniform.

567
00:58:54,229 --> 00:58:55,688
That’s against the rules.

568
00:58:55,713 --> 00:58:57,085
It’s his birthday.

569
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:58,967
Maybe you can make an exception.

570
00:58:58,967 --> 00:59:01,010
Let him play as his birthday gift.

571
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:03,263
We can’t just go bending
the rules for one person.

572
00:59:03,263 --> 00:59:05,598
No uniform means no game.

573
00:59:07,282 --> 00:59:10,082
How about this?
I’ll pay for the penalty.

574
00:59:10,107 --> 00:59:10,899
How much do you want?

575
00:59:10,937 --> 00:59:12,306
Is two thousand enough?

576
00:59:12,347 --> 00:59:15,391
Look, if he was from here
then this wouldn’t be a problem

577
00:59:15,773 --> 00:59:18,509
but he’s not from this district.

578
00:59:21,234 --> 00:59:24,050
Sir, our player’s not an import.

579
00:59:24,075 --> 00:59:25,149
He isn’t!

580
00:59:27,829 --> 00:59:29,414
Is there nothing else we can do?

581
00:59:29,439 --> 00:59:31,566
There’s nothing else I can do for you.

582
00:59:36,337 --> 00:59:36,754
Coy.

583
00:59:39,132 --> 00:59:42,040
I’m sorry but you can’t play today.

584
00:59:42,969 --> 00:59:45,013
Anyway, it’s your birthday.
Go home and celebrate.

585
00:59:45,388 --> 00:59:49,148
I’m sorry, Coach. This is my fault…
I didn’t even make it to the tryout.

586
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:52,634
Come here.

587
00:59:58,735 --> 01:00:01,446
You know Bert, right?
Madam’s driver?

588
01:00:01,471 --> 01:00:02,891
Yes, Coach.

589
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:05,158
We played ball together.

590
01:00:07,035 --> 01:00:10,413
He's never joined a league
where he hasn’t won a championship.

591
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:14,306
Hell, even the Mayor
used to import him.

592
01:00:16,836 --> 01:00:21,007
I haven’t seen anyone
play as good as Bert.

593
01:00:21,134 --> 01:00:24,688
One time we were supposed
to try out for Mapua together.

594
01:00:25,331 --> 01:00:28,196
We were supposed to meet at the gym.

595
01:00:28,431 --> 01:00:33,416
Next morning, I was there
but he didn’t show up.

596
01:00:34,585 --> 01:00:36,212
He said he didn’t have
money to get to Mapua.

597
01:00:36,752 --> 01:00:38,129
So I made it to varsity alone.

598
01:00:38,893 --> 01:00:41,586
Why didn’t he just
borrow money from you?

599
01:00:41,611 --> 01:00:46,157
Coy, you think that
was the real reason?

600
01:00:48,466 --> 01:00:50,802
You can make an excuse you got nervous.

601
01:00:51,829 --> 01:00:53,438
Your heart wasn’t in it.

602
01:00:54,332 --> 01:00:55,500
Family problems.

603
01:00:56,501 --> 01:00:57,752
But these are excuses.

604
01:00:59,212 --> 01:01:00,657
So.

605
01:01:02,257 --> 01:01:03,591
Rest up, okay?

606
01:01:04,133 --> 01:01:05,009
Enjoy.

607
01:01:06,135 --> 01:01:06,928
Happy birthday.

608
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:08,263
Thank you, Coach.

609
01:01:12,016 --> 01:01:12,725
Bro.

610
01:01:30,098 --> 01:01:31,172
Cocoy.

611
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,243
Bro, how’d you get out so fast?

612
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:38,134
Let’s just say our
boss is a heavyweight.

613
01:01:38,251 --> 01:01:39,168
Where are you headed?

614
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,951
Gonna cool off somewhere.

615
01:01:41,004 --> 01:01:42,130
I’ll go with you.

616
01:01:42,505 --> 01:01:43,172
It’s fine.

617
01:01:43,197 --> 01:01:44,407
I’ll call you later.

618
01:01:44,632 --> 01:01:45,675
Happy birthday.

619
01:01:45,925 --> 01:01:46,634
Thanks.

620
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:13,411
Shit.

621
01:02:35,421 --> 01:02:36,547
Happy birthday.

622
01:02:39,941 --> 01:02:41,230
Give that to me.

623
01:02:41,848 --> 01:02:43,058
Kiss me first.

624
01:02:43,277 --> 01:02:44,486
Didn’t you miss me?

625
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:46,816
We almost died the other day!

626
01:02:47,648 --> 01:02:49,275
Damn you, that's serious.

627
01:02:49,322 --> 01:02:51,949
Our driver got shot.

628
01:02:52,847 --> 01:02:55,237
It’s like you’re a newbie.

629
01:02:55,703 --> 01:02:58,456
People get shot all the time.

630
01:03:12,678 --> 01:03:14,222
That's my ass!

631
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:17,472
It hurts!

632
01:03:34,534 --> 01:03:36,027
Shit!

633
01:03:38,037 --> 01:03:40,748
This is what thieves like you deserve.

634
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:44,335
It really hurts!

635
01:03:59,058 --> 01:04:00,393
It really hurts.

636
01:04:20,721 --> 01:04:22,232
Damn you!

637
01:04:56,157 --> 01:04:57,300
Happy Birthday.

638
01:04:57,325 --> 01:04:59,058
So, are we a couple now?

639
01:05:00,578 --> 01:05:01,777
Sorry, Japok.

640
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:03,979
You’re only good for a quickie.

641
01:05:05,486 --> 01:05:06,917
I'm sorry.

642
01:05:07,251 --> 01:05:09,198
I can’t see you anymore than that.

643
01:05:22,475 --> 01:05:24,268
It was Martin who stole that.

644
01:05:33,127 --> 01:05:34,896
Bro, shot.

645
01:05:34,921 --> 01:05:40,243
I think we should let the
kids have more basketball training.

646
01:05:41,065 --> 01:05:43,159
The more they train,
the better they'll get.

647
01:05:43,184 --> 01:05:45,039
As long as it's free, sure.…

648
01:05:45,064 --> 01:05:48,476
Count my kid in…

649
01:05:48,501 --> 01:05:53,965
Pido was one the best players here before.

650
01:05:54,244 --> 01:05:56,495
Yeah, let’s stop talking about this shit.

651
01:05:56,581 --> 01:05:58,583
I’m tired of talking about basketball.

652
01:05:58,608 --> 01:06:00,972
Nothing good comes out of it.

653
01:06:00,997 --> 01:06:04,253
Look at me now.
I can’t walk anymore.

654
01:06:04,308 --> 01:06:07,311
I don’t want to talk about this shit.

655
01:06:07,995 --> 01:06:10,331
We’re out of cigarettes?

656
01:06:10,356 --> 01:06:11,073
Totoy!

657
01:06:12,108 --> 01:06:12,775
Come here.

658
01:06:15,528 --> 01:06:17,863
Go buy us some cigarettes.

659
01:06:19,407 --> 01:06:20,633
How about you guys?

660
01:06:20,658 --> 01:06:23,119
Your son is really a good player.

661
01:06:23,144 --> 01:06:25,263
I think he'd make it.

662
01:06:25,288 --> 01:06:32,206
Why won’t he try PBA?
Or even MPBL.

663
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:37,191
You guys are reaching.
He won’t make it.

664
01:06:37,216 --> 01:06:38,759
He doesn't have the height.

665
01:06:38,784 --> 01:06:40,945
Let the kid try, at least.

666
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:42,179
I agree.

667
01:06:42,204 --> 01:06:43,831
He won’t make it.

668
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:49,619
Happy birthday!

669
01:06:51,511 --> 01:06:52,734
Happy birthday!

670
01:06:52,982 --> 01:06:54,456
Thank you, Mom.

671
01:06:54,692 --> 01:06:55,737
Here’s my gift.

672
01:06:57,278 --> 01:06:58,696
Wow, that's really yellow.

673
01:07:06,662 --> 01:07:07,496
Try it on.

674
01:07:08,531 --> 01:07:12,702
Mom, even if it's blinding bright.
I’ll wear it for you.

675
01:07:12,835 --> 01:07:16,130
It’s so I can see you
on the court right away!

676
01:07:16,881 --> 01:07:18,382
You know how bad my eyes are.

677
01:07:19,133 --> 01:07:20,718
There you go.

678
01:07:23,179 --> 01:07:25,431
Make sure you show this part.

679
01:07:27,642 --> 01:07:29,393
My son is so handsome!

680
01:07:30,394 --> 01:07:32,146
Thanks, Mom!

681
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:35,566
Let’s stop this nonsense.

682
01:07:35,591 --> 01:07:36,901
The cake is here.

683
01:07:36,926 --> 01:07:41,572
Happy birthday to you!

684
01:07:43,633 --> 01:07:45,551
Cocoy, come here now.

685
01:07:45,576 --> 01:07:47,495
Birthday boy, a gift from your dad.

686
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,055
Come here, hurry!

687
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,873
Here you go, birthday boy.

688
01:07:50,898 --> 01:07:54,485
Hurry and make a wish!

689
01:07:54,606 --> 01:07:57,245
Don't keep us waiting!

690
01:07:57,546 --> 01:07:59,231
Here you go, birthday boy.

691
01:07:59,256 --> 01:08:00,966
Blow out the candles already!

692
01:08:00,991 --> 01:08:04,804
Happy birthday! Clap everyone! Clap!

693
01:08:04,829 --> 01:08:06,013
Shot!

694
01:08:06,722 --> 01:08:08,949
Put that inside first.

695
01:08:08,974 --> 01:08:11,661
I have a gift for you, Coy.

696
01:08:11,686 --> 01:08:12,787
What’s that?

697
01:08:12,812 --> 01:08:14,188
Here's your seaman’s book.

698
01:08:14,213 --> 01:08:15,923
You’re boarding next month!

699
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:21,027
Congrats, congrats!

700
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:26,701
Keep it safe.

701
01:08:27,051 --> 01:08:29,512
Coy, keep it safe inside.

702
01:08:29,537 --> 01:08:31,205
I have something for you too.

703
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,794
Here you go, son.

704
01:08:36,819 --> 01:08:39,572
Go ahead. Open it!

705
01:08:40,111 --> 01:08:41,982
There you go.

706
01:08:42,007 --> 01:08:43,526
Try it on!

707
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:47,179
I heard it can go
cold on the ship.

708
01:08:47,204 --> 01:08:50,182
Go ahead, try it on.

709
01:08:50,599 --> 01:08:52,268
You look handsome, son!

710
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:54,871
I have a wish for you though.

711
01:08:55,187 --> 01:08:56,564
When you board next month.

712
01:08:56,589 --> 01:08:58,274
Yes, next month.

713
01:08:58,299 --> 01:09:03,629
I hope they have a
basketball court on your ship.

714
01:09:03,654 --> 01:09:06,365
Yes, since it’s a Norwegian cruise ship.

715
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:07,725
Good news!

716
01:09:07,908 --> 01:09:09,118
Yes, I’m sure.

717
01:09:09,118 --> 01:09:10,453
Perfect!

718
01:09:10,453 --> 01:09:13,080
At least I have a use for this family.

719
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:13,998
What did you say?

720
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:17,084
What did you say?

721
01:09:17,084 --> 01:09:20,847
Did I say something wrong?

722
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,439
All I have done is
think about your future.

723
01:09:23,809 --> 01:09:26,823
What is basketball gonna do for you?

724
01:09:27,966 --> 01:09:29,259
You’ll just end up with a bad leg.

725
01:09:29,284 --> 01:09:30,737
Pido, that’s enough.

726
01:09:31,098 --> 01:09:32,175
Let's just drink.

727
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:36,854
Your mom is breaking
her back washing clothes.

728
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,317
And this is how you repay her?

729
01:09:39,482 --> 01:09:40,983
You’re the worthless one here, Pido.

730
01:09:41,834 --> 01:09:44,128
I will gladly break my back for my son.

731
01:09:44,153 --> 01:09:47,823
Don’t you dare throw this back at us
just because you’re unhappy.

732
01:09:48,908 --> 01:09:52,761
All your son wants to do
is play basketball.

733
01:09:54,246 --> 01:09:57,230
Can't we just give it to the kid?

734
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,902
Give him a chance.
It's his dream.

735
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:05,257
Just because you lost your dreams
when you became a cripple,

736
01:10:05,883 --> 01:10:07,802
doesn’t mean your son has to lose his too!

737
01:10:47,883 --> 01:10:52,120
Mom, we just have a practice
at Barangay Manggahan.

738
01:10:52,572 --> 01:10:55,173
I’ll go straight home right after.

739
01:11:07,171 --> 01:11:08,445
Take care, son.

740
01:11:08,917 --> 01:11:10,272
Sleep tight, mom.

741
01:11:14,201 --> 01:11:15,312
Dad.

742
01:11:15,926 --> 01:11:17,413
Go to sleep.

743
01:11:17,438 --> 01:11:18,564
I want to rest.

744
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:04,788
Coy!

745
01:14:05,539 --> 01:14:06,733
Coy!

746
01:19:14,348 --> 01:19:15,307
Mom!

747
01:26:18,938 --> 01:26:20,565
You sure you had an injury?

748
01:26:21,775 --> 01:26:23,526
Getting better, Bro! Getting there.

749
01:26:27,379 --> 01:26:28,403
Coy.

750
01:26:28,471 --> 01:26:29,558
Coy, you okay?

751
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:33,912
Coy, how are you?

752
01:26:35,121 --> 01:26:36,122
I’m okay, Coach.

753
01:26:37,707 --> 01:26:40,668
I didn’t want to ask out of respect,

754
01:26:41,628 --> 01:26:44,047
but can you make it to
the tryouts tomorrow?

755
01:26:45,173 --> 01:26:46,399
Sorry, Coach.

756
01:26:46,424 --> 01:26:47,842
My heart isn’t there yet.

757
01:26:49,803 --> 01:26:52,096
Three games and
you’ll be back in no time.

758
01:26:52,347 --> 01:26:53,556
Don’t worry about it.

759
01:26:54,432 --> 01:26:55,266
Let's shoot.

760
01:27:33,289 --> 01:27:34,347
One more time.

761
01:27:43,398 --> 01:27:47,902
Thank god Japok is being true to herself.

762
01:27:49,195 --> 01:27:50,697
She knows she's a slut.

763
01:27:50,989 --> 01:27:52,448
Not like other whores out there,

764
01:27:53,408 --> 01:27:54,576
pretending to be demure.

765
01:27:54,868 --> 01:27:56,035
But really a bitch!

766
01:27:56,369 --> 01:27:57,579
I’m not a whore!

767
01:27:58,037 --> 01:28:00,557
So, are you saying I’m a whore?

768
01:28:00,582 --> 01:28:01,766
I didn’t say that.

769
01:28:01,791 --> 01:28:04,419
You think you’re so pretty, huh?

770
01:28:06,210 --> 01:28:07,718
This is nice!

771
01:28:08,089 --> 01:28:09,960
Whore versus slut.

772
01:28:10,633 --> 01:28:11,968
This is a one-on-one!

773
01:28:12,385 --> 01:28:14,648
How about we do a 1v1?

774
01:28:17,974 --> 01:28:20,977
Basketball or fist fight?

775
01:28:22,353 --> 01:28:23,187
You choose.

776
01:28:24,314 --> 01:28:25,815
That’s enough.

777
01:28:26,350 --> 01:28:27,382
Martin.

778
01:28:27,959 --> 01:28:28,793
Goddammit.

779
01:28:28,818 --> 01:28:30,904
This will go nowhere.

780
01:28:30,904 --> 01:28:32,113
Just stop it already.

781
01:28:32,238 --> 01:28:35,033
Cool off, you’re still grieving,

782
01:28:35,033 --> 01:28:36,326
You might be next.

783
01:28:38,453 --> 01:28:39,829
You’re full of excuses.

784
01:28:44,417 --> 01:28:45,001
What?

785
01:28:45,877 --> 01:28:47,670
We’ll head off first, Coach.

786
01:28:47,837 --> 01:28:50,131
How about we make it a bet?

787
01:28:51,174 --> 01:28:53,009
Five thousand? Game?

788
01:28:53,389 --> 01:28:54,890
Make it ten thousand!

789
01:28:56,387 --> 01:28:58,139
Fifteen thousand. Set.

790
01:28:58,765 --> 01:29:01,184
I’ll play, but I get to choose the court.

791
01:29:02,018 --> 01:29:02,518
Coy.

792
01:29:03,218 --> 01:29:06,105
Maybe you’ve forgotten what I told you.

793
01:29:07,505 --> 01:29:08,714
Shit.

794
01:29:08,739 --> 01:29:10,408
You’re both on your own.

795
01:29:23,706 --> 01:29:25,291
Pinoy basketball.

796
01:29:25,792 --> 01:29:26,668
One to twelve.

797
01:29:27,293 --> 01:29:28,878
Forty thousand pesos on the line.

798
01:29:28,878 --> 01:29:30,797
Let the side bets begin!

799
01:29:40,348 --> 01:29:46,062
Cocoy! Cocoy!

800
01:30:41,094 --> 01:30:47,946
[chattering]

801
01:32:37,035 --> 01:32:38,035
So?

802
01:32:43,531 --> 01:32:44,657
Screw you!

803
01:32:50,163 --> 01:32:51,588
You asshole!

804
01:34:01,799 --> 01:34:03,175
Start the count!

805
01:34:22,483 --> 01:34:23,902
Hurry, go fast!

806
01:34:26,561 --> 01:34:27,934
Where’s your player?

807
01:34:32,223 --> 01:34:33,666
Hustle guys, hustle!

808
01:34:38,829 --> 01:34:40,049
Coach!

809
01:34:55,588 --> 01:34:57,439
Coach, sorry.

810
01:34:57,464 --> 01:34:58,732
I'm late.

811
01:34:58,757 --> 01:34:59,792
It's okay.

812
01:34:59,817 --> 01:35:01,986
Put your bag down and go play.
