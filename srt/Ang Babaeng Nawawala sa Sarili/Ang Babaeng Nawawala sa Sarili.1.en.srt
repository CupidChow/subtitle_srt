1
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,930
Go ahead, Albina,
you may proceed.

2
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:34,101
Doc,

3
00:00:35,173 --> 00:00:36,841
Doc, help me.

4
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:39,999
Someone wants to get inside of me.

5
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,501
She wants to destroy my life.

6
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:43,669
Who is she?

7
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,338
Do you know her?

8
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,383
Who wants to get inside of your body?

9
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,399
Doc!

10
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,811
Doc, she's already inside of me.

11
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,439
Doc, help me!

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,507
Doc!

13
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,733
Doc!

14
00:01:05,758 --> 00:01:08,469
- Doc, help me!
- Take her to the recreation area.

15
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:10,463
Doc!

16
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:12,281
Let me go!

17
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:16,018
Help me!
Someone wants to get my body!

18
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:45,706
Hi.

19
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,107
Albina Tamayo?

20
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,026
Yes, I am.

21
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,570
This is my set card.

22
00:01:51,743 --> 00:01:53,411
Let's go. Follow me.

23
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,411
Is this your first time in modeling?

24
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:03,557
In a fashion house, yes.

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,418
But I did hand modeling before.

26
00:02:06,443 --> 00:02:08,904
If you do good,

27
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,460
great opportunities await you.

28
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,594
I really hope I get in.

29
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:17,939
Can I ask a question?

30
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,558
For what fashion house is this?

31
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,976
It's Manos.

32
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:26,438
They're not that big in the Philippines
but they are thriving in Shanghai.

33
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:31,042
We will contact you
once the client makes his decision.

34
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:32,573
Thank you.

35
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:33,904
You're welcome.

36
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,243
Don't bail on me!

37
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:42,413
Of course! See you.

38
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:45,838
Let me drive you home.

39
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:49,962
Babe, talk to me. Please.

40
00:02:49,987 --> 00:02:50,987
Can you stop?

41
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:53,644
I'm not your girlfriend anymore.

42
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,485
Babe, let me explain. Please.

43
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,596
What do you want?

44
00:02:59,114 --> 00:03:04,870
You wasted six years, Wendell.
You cheater!

45
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:07,227
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

46
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:09,870
Fuck you!

47
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:20,742
Babe...

48
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,395
Wendell dropped by earlier.
Did you see each other?

49
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:51,982
He didn't know you
had a go-see, did he?

50
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:55,903
Your boyfriend should know
your whereabouts.

51
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:58,905
Oh!

52
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,783
Who brought these flowers?

53
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:04,311
It's from Wendell.

54
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,960
Just use it as an offering.

55
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:13,379
Dear, what's wrong?

56
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,769
Why are you being so pushy?

57
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:18,145
Wendell and I already broke up.

58
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:20,052
Oh, dear.

59
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:25,322
Dear, are you going to waste those years
just because of one mistake?

60
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,229
You should be more
understanding, Albina.

61
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:32,047
Wendell's a good guy.

62
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:01,591
Albina?

63
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:06,492
Albina, what is happening to you?

64
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,926
Wake up, Albina.

65
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,537
Albina, wake up. Wake up.

66
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,333
Here. Go to sleep.

67
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:38,891
Stacey,

68
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,609
who's that guy?

69
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,903
I don't know.

70
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,245
Hey. Go! Leave!
My best friend is here.

71
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,355
Go! Leave!

72
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:50,994
Why are you late?

73
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,604
Sorry, Madam.

74
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,890
I only commuted.

75
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,459
It's a hassle being single, isn't it?

76
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,570
Nobody is going to fetch you.

77
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:02,523
Why don't you hire a driver?

78
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:05,843
You know how crazy Mom is.

79
00:07:05,868 --> 00:07:09,288
Maids and outsiders
are not allowed at home.

80
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,951
You're already old.
You should learn how to drive.

81
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,979
I'm terrified of driving.

82
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:22,559
What if I pass out while driving?
I might die.

83
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:26,940
I don't get you.

84
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:29,193
Let's just drink tequila!

85
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,287
We're gonna get wasted tonight.

86
00:07:32,312 --> 00:07:33,438
Give me that!

87
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:38,625
You're so gross!

88
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:43,787
Gross? But admit it,
you're going to miss me.

89
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,216
Please, don't leave me!

90
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,553
I don't want to waste the opportunity.

91
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:53,866
Don't tell me you're just going
to cry all night?

92
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:57,519
No way! We're going to get wasted
and celebrate tonight!

93
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:37,684
Hey you!

94
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,353
What's your problem?

95
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,772
Are you taking photos of us?

96
00:08:41,948 --> 00:08:43,261
Stacey, calm down.

97
00:08:43,576 --> 00:08:44,577
Give me your phone.

98
00:08:44,602 --> 00:08:47,313
Stacey, relax.
It's embarassing.

99
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:48,714
Why are you taking photos of her?

100
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,370
Are you stalking my friend?

101
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,034
Stalking? No. No.
It's not what you think.

102
00:08:54,426 --> 00:08:57,840
I'm the official photographer for tonight.
The management is aware of this.

103
00:08:57,865 --> 00:09:00,816
I saw your friend.
A good subject.

104
00:09:01,433 --> 00:09:02,684
She's pretty, so...

105
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,503
I'm Lawrence.

106
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,295
Albina.

107
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,339
- Hi Albina.
- This is Stacey.

108
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:12,219
Sorry. It's her send-off party
that's why she's emotional.

109
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:13,887
Let me make it up to you.

110
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:17,040
How about I'll buy you a drink?
The both of you.

111
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,435
Fine, Albina.

112
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:28,110
Do you want to do it at my place?

113
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,739
I'm not into first-date sex.

114
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:35,826
Only makeouts?

115
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,661
Just kiss?

116
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:39,897
Like that?

117
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:48,118
Well…

118
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,006
You're playing hard to get, I see.

119
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,515
Come on. Quick.

120
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,966
Are you okay?

121
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:36,296
You drank too much.

122
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:38,221
I'm fine. I'm fine.

123
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:39,246
Stacey.

124
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:43,035
Do you want me to drive her home?
She's so wasted.

125
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,561
No. It's fine.

126
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:46,438
I already booked a ride.

127
00:10:46,538 --> 00:10:47,539
I'm fine, I promise.

128
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,216
- Are you sure?
- Yeah!

129
00:10:49,304 --> 00:10:50,304
Please,

130
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,615
take care of my friend.

131
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,771
She's still reeling from a break-up.

132
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:58,133
Just spend the night with
him so you won't feel lonely.

133
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,119
I will miss you so much.
I will miss you so much.

134
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:03,105
I will miss you.

135
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:05,724
- Let me drop you home.
- It's okay.

136
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:06,958
I can manage.

137
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,294
I can manage.

138
00:11:12,696 --> 00:11:13,863
Let's go.

139
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,093
Come in.

140
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,012
Don't worry about your shoes.

141
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,020
Feel at home.

142
00:11:29,212 --> 00:11:30,351
So...

143
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:33,830
How long have you been
friends with Stacey?

144
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,280
Since high school.

145
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,916
Oh, since high school.

146
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,135
I think,

147
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:46,853
she's my only friend.

148
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,230
She is my protector

149
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,089
and now I am all alone.

150
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,345
Don't be sad.

151
00:12:01,238 --> 00:12:03,824
Fine. I'm just going to shut up.

152
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,476
I'm kidding.

153
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,270
Don't be too serious.

154
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:14,651
Since Stacey’s gone,
I can be your new protector.

155
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,906
I don't even know you.

156
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,159
Oh, you don't?

157
00:12:22,184 --> 00:12:25,145
I'm Lawrence.

158
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:31,168
I mean, I don't even know
a thing about you.

159
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,985
Like what I do?
I'm into photography.

160
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,424
This is my studio.

161
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:39,760
That's the projector.

162
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,924
Laptop.

163
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:43,262
That's all my stuff.

164
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:44,770
I know that it's a bit
of a mess but...

165
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:46,809
that's just me.

166
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,018
Chill guy.

167
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,346
What kind of answer is that?

168
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:56,026
The truth.
What kind of answer do you want?

169
00:12:56,485 --> 00:13:00,489
Here. This is my room.
It's small but comfortable.

170
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:02,345
Come on.

171
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:05,977
Don't be shy.

172
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,025
Are you sure
you don't wanna try?

173
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:14,163
No.

174
00:13:14,883 --> 00:13:16,468
It's against my rules.

175
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,574
I'm not into first-date sex.

176
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,053
Okay.

177
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,764
I respect that.

178
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,850
Second meeting?

179
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,492
Did we sleep together last night?

180
00:13:56,336 --> 00:14:02,092
Law. Don't go deeper.
It hurts.

181
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,052
Don’t you remember?

182
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,932
I can't remember anything.

183
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,060
That's what you said.

184
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:20,193
You told me you wanted
to see my room and my...

185
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:27,885
Are you serious?
Maybe I was just high.

186
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,540
I don't know.
Wanna have breakfast?

187
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,591
Hello?
Hello, good morning.

188
00:14:43,024 --> 00:14:45,777
My apologies for the late response.

189
00:14:45,856 --> 00:14:48,817
Thank you so much for considering me.

190
00:14:48,842 --> 00:14:50,260
You're welcome.

191
00:14:50,468 --> 00:14:53,179
Mr. Manos liked your set card.

192
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,647
I will text you the date and time
when you should drop by our office, okay?

193
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,984
Okay. Again, thank you so much.

194
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:05,864
I got accepted in the project!

195
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:18,743
Congrats!

196
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:19,603
Thank you.

197
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:22,881
It's my first time to be
accepted in a fashion house.

198
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,884
Congrats! Let's celebrate.

199
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,679
Where do you want to go?
I'll treat you.

200
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,268
Okay, but not today.

201
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:36,602
I gotta go.

202
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:38,830
If not today, then, when?

203
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,749
Next time.

204
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,426
Next time? Wait…

205
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:45,116
Next time?

206
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,908
So there's still a next time?

207
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,660
Yes.

208
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,486
Hello?

209
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:10,511
Hi.

210
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:15,123
It's me, Lawrence. Just making sure
it's not a fake phone number.

211
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:19,979
Fuck you.

212
00:16:28,046 --> 00:16:29,422
Good morning.

213
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:36,454
Thank you for accepting our invite
and we are really happy to see all of you.

214
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:48,508
Today, our owner and creative director,
Greg Manos, wants to see you up close.

215
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,254
Albina, right?

216
00:17:26,392 --> 00:17:28,192
Have your measurements
taken in the next room.

217
00:17:34,274 --> 00:17:35,274
Yes!

218
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,853
First fashion modeling gig.

219
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,009
Congrats, babe!

220
00:17:56,002 --> 00:17:57,518
Babe your face!

221
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,710
The fuck?

222
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:14,147
Yes, babe?

223
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:18,789
Leave me alone or
I will block you, Wendell.

224
00:18:20,107 --> 00:18:21,292
You're so rude.

225
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:24,647
I'm just proud that you have
achieved your dream.

226
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:28,316
Do you know why
I haven't blocked you yet?

227
00:18:28,778 --> 00:18:33,991
Because of what we had.
But I will block you I if have to.

228
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:36,018
I'm sorry.

229
00:18:36,572 --> 00:18:37,675
I love you!

230
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,452
Fuck you!

231
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,455
Will you please leave me alone?!

232
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,608
Wow. Why so intense?

233
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:51,572
It's been so long
since we last talked.

234
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:59,472
Sorry. I thought
you were someone else.

235
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,864
What's up? Are you okay?

236
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:07,355
Nothing. I just miss you.

237
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,357
Why so clingy?

238
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:17,949
Clingy? Not really.
I just stumbled upon your post.

239
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:22,120
Of course, I want
to celebrate with you.

240
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:26,411
Just make sure
your boyfriend won't get mad.

241
00:19:26,895 --> 00:19:30,820
Enough with your old tricks.
Let's go out tonight!

242
00:19:31,063 --> 00:19:33,948
I'll pick you up
and then let's play it by ear.

243
00:19:34,117 --> 00:19:35,118
Game?

244
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,218
See you.

245
00:20:45,219 --> 00:20:48,348
Do I have something on my face?

246
00:20:48,466 --> 00:20:49,491
Nothing.

247
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:51,364
Then why are you staring at me?

248
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:54,236
Will you be my girlfriend?

249
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,381
Why not?

250
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,053
Seriously?

251
00:20:58,301 --> 00:20:59,302
Yes.

252
00:21:38,816 --> 00:21:39,816
Albina.

253
00:21:41,553 --> 00:21:44,581
Switch places with Mika,
I want you front and center.

254
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,157
Greg! Greg!

255
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:06,809
- Ma'am, you're not allowed inside.
- Let me go!

256
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,235
Why are you not
answering my calls?

257
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,888
You don't even bother
calling me back!

258
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:15,877
Have you forgotten?
I should have been in this campaign!

259
00:22:15,998 --> 00:22:17,945
Have you looked at
yourself in the mirror?

260
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,551
We don't entertain sellouts.

261
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,511
Fuck you!

262
00:22:26,223 --> 00:22:27,592
You need to get out, Ma'am.

263
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:31,152
You fucking used me!

264
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:37,231
Remember this, I will get back at you,
you son of a bitch!

265
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:55,749
Hi.

266
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,710
Such a weird day, isn't it?

267
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,801
You have nice shoes.

268
00:23:05,443 --> 00:23:06,819
Thank you.

269
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,513
You look pretty.

270
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,139
Isn't she pretty?

271
00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:11,833
- Yeah. So pretty.
- Gorgeous.

272
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:15,521
Do you have a problem with me?

273
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:20,754
We just noticed that
you're Greg's new favorite.

274
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:22,902
Just be careful.

275
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:26,906
That madwoman earlier?

276
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,950
She's a former model here.

277
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:31,598
She was Greg's favorite.

278
00:23:32,364 --> 00:23:35,534
Now, she's just a piece of trash.

279
00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:40,927
Rumor has it that Greg got her pregnant.
He didn't want the baby.

280
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,255
So she had an abortion?

281
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,676
Yes, and she thought
she can still be a model after.

282
00:23:47,455 --> 00:23:50,137
Just a piece of advice,

283
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:55,059
don't be an ass-kisser,
or else, you'll end up like her.

284
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,602
Understood?

285
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,105
Say it with me.

286
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,275
I don't want to be a piece of trash.

287
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:10,158
I don't want to be a piece of trash.

288
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,910
Such a gullible woman.

289
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,063
Mom, you scared me.

290
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:25,716
The door was open.
I thought there was an intruder.

291
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,153
What are you doing here?

292
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:30,935
What are you looking for?

293
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:36,886
I'm looking for my baby pictures
that I can use.

294
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:41,293
Check it inside the box in your room.

295
00:25:41,318 --> 00:25:42,444
Okay.

296
00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:10,357
Don't you miss this?

297
00:30:10,382 --> 00:30:12,686
Can he make you moan like I can?

298
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:28,911
You son of a bitch!

299
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:42,847
Okay, girls.

300
00:31:42,871 --> 00:31:44,733
Let's have a 15-minute break.

301
00:31:44,758 --> 00:31:49,450
When you come back, make sure you're
wearing the next set of collection. Okay?

302
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:50,450
Okay. Go.

303
00:31:50,546 --> 00:31:51,714
Tuesday.

304
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,630
Come forward please.

305
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:07,722
Yes, Sir?

306
00:32:08,616 --> 00:32:09,694
Drop the sir.

307
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:11,873
You're too formal.

308
00:32:14,302 --> 00:32:15,302
Okay, sir.

309
00:32:15,413 --> 00:32:17,540
I mean, okay.

310
00:32:18,957 --> 00:32:21,626
I saw your file.

311
00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:25,329
Your birthday's coming up.

312
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:28,405
Tuesday.

313
00:32:33,672 --> 00:32:34,944
Happy birthday.

314
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:43,329
I don't accept gifts from my boss.

315
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:44,531
No,

316
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,131
take it.

317
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,009
I bought it for you.

318
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:53,013
You're the only person
I know who declines gifts.

319
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:55,332
Don't you know that
declining a gift brings bad luck?

320
00:32:55,570 --> 00:33:04,537
Sir, instead of giving me a gift,
just attend my dinner party.

321
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:07,102
I'll consider your presence as a gift.

322
00:33:12,202 --> 00:33:13,912
You know, you're...

323
00:33:15,219 --> 00:33:16,473
Very interesting.

324
00:33:17,114 --> 00:33:18,772
I'll check my schedule.

325
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,338
Careful.

326
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,009
Happy birthday, Albina!

327
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:39,835
Good evening.

328
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:45,416
Mom, Dad.
This is Lawrence, my boyfriend.

329
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:49,094
Lawrence. Nice to meet you.

330
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,013
He was the one
who took all my photos.

331
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:56,452
You have good taste...
Lawrence, right?

332
00:33:56,477 --> 00:33:57,883
What are you doing here?

333
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,039
- Albina, he's our visitor. We invited him.
- Sorry. Sorry.

334
00:34:01,064 --> 00:34:03,726
Please, bear with our daughter.

335
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:06,871
- It's okay. She is such a sweet lady.
- What do you do for a living, Lawrence?

336
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,214
He's a photographer, Mom.

337
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:11,216
A professional photographer.

338
00:34:11,942 --> 00:34:13,694
Oh, I thought he's just a hobbyist.

339
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,845
I thought so too.

340
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:20,200
We'll go ahead, Mom.
I'm gonna entertain my other guests.

341
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,101
Sure.

342
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:23,479
- Nice meeting you, Uncle.
- Enjoy. Drinks later, okay?

343
00:34:23,504 --> 00:34:24,838
- Sure, Uncle.
- Alright.

344
00:34:25,092 --> 00:34:26,092
I'm up for it.

345
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,947
Your ex is such a show-off.

346
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:35,512
Let him be.

347
00:34:35,537 --> 00:34:37,633
Besides, I didn't
know he was invited.

348
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:40,367
It's alright.

349
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:43,207
At least we're happy.

350
00:34:43,987 --> 00:34:45,113
Happy birthday.

351
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,921
You need to entertain your other guests.

352
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,255
Yes, okay.

353
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,949
Go ahead.

354
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:11,953
Hey!

355
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:14,071
Happy birthday.

356
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,405
Thank you.

357
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:18,408
Thank you.
I'm glad you're here.

358
00:35:18,433 --> 00:35:19,434
Of course.

359
00:35:20,238 --> 00:35:21,865
You're so beautiful.

360
00:35:24,461 --> 00:35:25,687
- Mom!
- Yes?

361
00:35:25,712 --> 00:35:28,131
This is Greg Manos.

362
00:35:28,156 --> 00:35:29,547
Sir. Ma'am.

363
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,809
You'll get used to Albina.

364
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:45,561
She's like that.

365
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,595
One day, she is addicted to you.

366
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:53,777
The next day,
she wants someone else.

367
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,509
Why do you think we broke up?

368
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,866
It's because you're an asshole, obviously.

369
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,493
Chill, daddy, chill.

370
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:03,387
Don’t call me daddy,
I'm not your daddy.

371
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:04,830
Okay. Okay.

372
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:11,545
You are so lucky to have Babe.

373
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,132
Don't call her babe.

374
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:16,884
You've broken up, right?

375
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:25,075
I remember how her boobs perfectly
fit my hands. I miss them so much.

376
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,100
Asshole.

377
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:27,494
I miss them.

378
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,521
Really? You miss it?

379
00:36:29,546 --> 00:36:31,965
Asshole!

380
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:35,377
You like it? You fucker!

381
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:40,741
You want this? You animal!

382
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:45,228
Asshole!

383
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,774
Baby! Baby! Albina!

384
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,301
Albina! Albina!

385
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,503
What are you doing here?

386
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:41,885
Relax.

387
00:37:42,402 --> 00:37:44,905
Your parents told me
to look after you.

388
00:37:44,968 --> 00:37:46,511
They're just downstairs.

389
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:49,952
How are you feeling?

390
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:51,770
Get away from me!

391
00:37:51,795 --> 00:37:56,091
Get out of my room!
Get out! Leave!

392
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:58,735
Are you fighting again?

393
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,404
I'm sorry.

394
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:05,993
I told you that I don't
wanna see that guy again,

395
00:38:06,843 --> 00:38:10,097
and then you just let him
in here while I'm unconscious?

396
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:14,167
Dear, Wendell's a good guy.
We trust him.

397
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:19,564
Get out of my room.

398
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:20,636
Hold on.

399
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:23,461
I've noticed this for a while now.

400
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:24,919
Where did you get this?

401
00:38:27,615 --> 00:38:29,158
Get out of my room!

402
00:38:29,196 --> 00:38:31,574
Thank you for a memorable birthday party!

403
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:02,412
What do you want?

404
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,773
Wait Albina, can we talk?

405
00:42:04,798 --> 00:42:06,633
Not now, Lawrence.

406
00:42:06,836 --> 00:42:11,166
I have no face to show my boss
because of what you did at the party.

407
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:25,210
Sir, I apologize for what
happened at the party.

408
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,088
Let me make one thing clear.

409
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,090
I like you,

410
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:33,677
but I'm not expecting
anything in return.

411
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,763
I just wanna see you.

412
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,015
I just want you here.

413
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:43,937
Didn't you hire me
for my modeling skills?

414
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,274
That's also a part of it.

415
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:02,864
My god, that is cheap.

416
00:43:02,889 --> 00:43:06,434
Oh my gosh girl stop that,
what is wrong with you?

417
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:09,546
My goodness, I hate her so much.

418
00:43:30,767 --> 00:43:33,979
You fuckers!
Are you talking about me?!

419
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:36,501
Albina.

420
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,950
Albina.

421
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:47,375
Sir, I'm really sorry.

422
00:43:48,168 --> 00:43:51,504
I'm not feeling well.

423
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:54,299
Albina, what's going on?

424
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:58,261
Sir, is it alright
if I call it a day?

425
00:43:59,423 --> 00:44:00,424
Sure.

426
00:44:01,549 --> 00:44:03,677
Thank you and I'm sorry.

427
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:22,139
Albina, your body is mine
and mine alone. I almost have it.

428
00:44:22,397 --> 00:44:25,597
They can't hurt you anymore, Albina.

429
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:30,467
I'm here now.
I'll come and get you. Soon.

430
00:44:30,492 --> 00:44:31,492
Hey!

431
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:35,382
Are you alright?

432
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:38,259
I've been following you.

433
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:41,721
I wanted to get your attention
but you seemed so out of it.

434
00:44:42,197 --> 00:44:43,198
Are you alright?

435
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:45,592
There's something wrong
with me, Lawrence.

436
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:50,021
I'm hearing voices.

437
00:44:50,226 --> 00:44:52,603
I can hear their whispers.

438
00:44:52,628 --> 00:44:54,005
I don't know.

439
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:56,944
They want my body.

440
00:44:57,226 --> 00:45:01,856
Okay. Maybe you are just tired.

441
00:45:02,511 --> 00:45:05,681
Maybe you are stressed at work
or you are overthinking.

442
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:08,506
You need to relax.

443
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:15,335
Do you want to rest at my place?

444
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:16,599
We were doing a
photoshoot earlier, when suddenly,

445
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:20,488
I felt like my co-models
were talking about me.

446
00:46:21,536 --> 00:46:24,581
So I screamed and cursed at them.

447
00:46:24,674 --> 00:46:26,676
Then when I stopped,

448
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:31,453
I realized that no one
was actually talking.

449
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:38,379
Maybe you're just pressured.

450
00:46:39,795 --> 00:46:43,006
You feel pressured because
you want to be good at what you do.

451
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:48,723
Don't worry.

452
00:46:48,898 --> 00:46:51,445
This will calm your nerves.
Just one puff.

453
00:46:51,784 --> 00:46:53,437
No. No, thanks.

454
00:46:55,008 --> 00:46:57,594
Okay. It's alright.

455
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:03,279
I have a better idea.

456
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:06,282
Wait a minute.

457
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:17,668
Okay.

458
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:21,339
This is acid.

459
00:47:22,315 --> 00:47:23,656
If you take this,

460
00:47:24,343 --> 00:47:26,600
you'll remember all your traumas.

461
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:28,043
But don't worry,

462
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:32,475
you'll feel much better after.

463
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,060
I promise.

464
00:47:34,978 --> 00:47:36,896
Have you tried this?

465
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:41,359
When I tried it the first time,

466
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,780
it seemed like I had
a heart-to-heart talk with God.

467
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:51,328
He forgave all my sins.

468
00:47:53,339 --> 00:47:54,508
It was crazy.

469
00:47:57,812 --> 00:47:58,813
So...

470
00:47:59,206 --> 00:48:00,498
But I am not forcing you, okay?

471
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:03,422
Game?

472
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:05,966
Game.

473
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:07,759
Look up.

474
00:48:10,025 --> 00:48:11,485
Just one drop.

475
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:15,810
Close your eyes.

476
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,772
Hold it.

477
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:22,691
Okay.

478
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,069
Then,

479
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,114
When you are ready,

480
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:31,659
open your eyes.

481
00:49:47,547 --> 00:49:48,923
Hi, Mom!

482
00:49:50,136 --> 00:49:52,805
Where have you been all night?

483
00:49:53,733 --> 00:49:57,867
Good thing you are here.
You have a delivery.

484
00:49:58,162 --> 00:49:59,330
Who are these packages for?

485
00:49:59,816 --> 00:50:03,893
They're yours. Everything is under
your name, addressed here.

486
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,712
But I already paid for everything.

487
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,048
I did not order anything.

488
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:10,656
What's inside?

489
00:50:16,933 --> 00:50:18,101
What is this?

490
00:50:26,885 --> 00:50:31,014
I did not order anything, Mom.
Someone's messing with me.

491
00:50:38,921 --> 00:50:40,923
I think I know who did this.

492
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,078
Get ready, bitch.

493
00:50:53,547 --> 00:50:56,654
Girls, next layout.

494
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:57,847
Okay.

495
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:10,251
Does it hurt? Do you also want me to
hit you with the dildo you sent me?

496
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:13,029
What the fuck?!
What are you talking about?!

497
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:18,284
Shit! There's a lot of blood!

498
00:51:18,634 --> 00:51:20,344
Please, take me to the hospital!

499
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:23,122
Take me away from that crazy woman!

500
00:51:29,796 --> 00:51:33,591
Go home! I'll take care of it.

501
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:35,885
I don't want any trouble.

502
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:09,749
One screwdriver.

503
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,508
I can bring you some place good.

504
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:20,847
Charge it on me.

505
00:52:27,762 --> 00:52:29,221
I'm Sahil.

506
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:30,772
Liv.

507
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:41,969
Your husband is cheating on you.

508
00:56:13,379 --> 00:56:15,214
A man is alleged to
have jumped to his death

509
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:18,284
from the rooftop of
a building in Ortigas.

510
00:56:18,644 --> 00:56:22,296
The police are investigating
if there is foul play in the incident.

511
00:56:26,331 --> 00:56:27,331
Dad,

512
00:56:27,446 --> 00:56:29,239
have you seen Albina?

513
00:56:29,264 --> 00:56:30,503
I haven't seen her.

514
00:56:31,238 --> 00:56:33,115
Based on the CCTV footage,

515
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,268
a woman wearing a black dress allegedly
shoved the man to death.

516
00:56:36,293 --> 00:56:39,255
Authorities are searching
for the woman's identity.

517
00:56:41,941 --> 00:56:42,983
Dear?

518
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:48,199
Albina?

519
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:53,077
Dear, is this yours?

520
00:56:55,157 --> 00:56:58,914
It was also delivered last week.

521
00:56:58,939 --> 00:57:00,274
I already threw that away.

522
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,586
Why was it in the garden?

523
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:07,049
I don't know.
Just throw it away, Mom.

524
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:23,732
Is this your boyfriend?

525
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:45,828
Hello.

526
00:57:46,169 --> 00:57:47,534
You called.

527
00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:49,716
Hello?

528
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:52,344
Do you still love me?

529
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:54,263
Of course.

530
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:56,515
Babe, I'm kinda busy...

531
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,767
preparing for a shoot.

532
00:57:58,792 --> 00:58:01,921
Do you want to have dinner
tomorrow night instead?

533
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:05,940
Sure.

534
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:07,692
Bye.

535
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:34,261
Who fucked you?

536
00:58:35,923 --> 00:58:36,923
Did it feel good?

537
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:07,336
You want?

538
00:59:34,331 --> 00:59:36,583
Fuck!

539
00:59:36,608 --> 00:59:38,019
It's so good!

540
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,284
Dad! Dad!

541
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:24,894
Dad, what happened to you? Dad? Dad...

542
01:00:48,421 --> 01:00:49,421
Baby,

543
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:52,511
Sorry... I was late.
Traffic was heavy.

544
01:00:52,737 --> 01:00:53,959
How are you?

545
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:56,445
You've already ordered. Sorry.

546
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:58,389
Yeah. I've ordered for you.

547
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:01,869
I'm kinda full.
I already ate at work.

548
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:04,411
Then why did you
invite me for dinner?

549
01:01:04,772 --> 01:01:07,066
Because I want to see you, baby.

550
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,457
And...

551
01:01:08,537 --> 01:01:11,667
you want to tell me something, right?

552
01:01:12,133 --> 01:01:14,427
I think you're the one
who needs to explain.

553
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:18,549
What do you mean?

554
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:21,387
Are you seeing another woman?

555
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:23,429
What?

556
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:25,140
Baby, no!

557
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:27,643
Where did you get that?

558
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:30,771
Just be honest.

559
01:01:31,163 --> 01:01:32,873
So that I won't look like a fool.

560
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,441
Albina, I'm not seeing someone else.

561
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:36,402
What are you talking about?

562
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,820
Are you sure?

563
01:01:38,654 --> 01:01:39,780
Sure?

564
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:43,075
Sure of what?
That I'm not cheating on you?

565
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,686
I am sure that
I am not cheating.

566
01:01:46,158 --> 01:01:47,951
What the fuck, Albina?

567
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:51,917
Where is this coming from?

568
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:22,823
Where did you get this video?

569
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:29,079
Don’t you miss this?

570
01:02:29,538 --> 01:02:31,915
Can he make you moan like I can?

571
01:02:43,235 --> 01:02:44,570
What do you want from me, Wendell?

572
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:46,180
Where did you get the video?

573
01:02:46,385 --> 01:02:47,385
What video?

574
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:49,765
This.

575
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:53,639
Is that your boyfriend?

576
01:02:54,146 --> 01:02:55,355
Such a performer.

577
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:57,900
It's not funny.
Don't play games with me!

578
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,944
Where did you get the video?
Who's that girl?

579
01:03:01,329 --> 01:03:02,664
I have no idea.

580
01:03:02,889 --> 01:03:04,682
It's my first time seeing that video.

581
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,449
You set him up.

582
01:03:06,505 --> 01:03:09,775
You framed him up
with the girl, she seduced him.

583
01:03:10,096 --> 01:03:11,598
I have nothing to do with it.

584
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,542
You left me...

585
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,171
because I cheated on you.
Yes. I admit.

586
01:03:19,468 --> 01:03:21,370
But to replace me
with another cheater?

587
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:42,361
What do you want from me?
You keep on destroying me.

588
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:44,238
I'm tired.

589
01:03:44,263 --> 01:03:46,515
- I'm just so tired.
- Shhh...

590
01:05:26,998 --> 01:05:30,378
I knew you'll come back to me.

591
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:35,724
Are you there yet?

592
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:38,810
Why? Are you in a hurry?

593
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:42,688
Yes.

594
01:06:14,043 --> 01:06:18,949
A beggar was found dead
on the sidewalk in Makati last night.

595
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:23,745
According to the witness, he was
with a woman wearing a black dress.

596
01:06:23,862 --> 01:06:28,417
The suspect was allegedly
under the influence of drugs.

597
01:06:28,527 --> 01:06:33,214
The police are conducting
an on-going investigation.

598
01:06:35,619 --> 01:06:37,352
Love, isn't this Albina's?

599
01:06:37,955 --> 01:06:40,056
Where did you get that?

600
01:06:41,032 --> 01:06:42,290
Look, there's blood.

601
01:06:43,603 --> 01:06:44,603
See?

602
01:06:56,657 --> 01:06:57,657
Albina!

603
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:01,103
Albina!

604
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,110
Are you messing with me?

605
01:07:04,431 --> 01:07:06,547
I gave you the chance
to tell the truth!

606
01:07:06,572 --> 01:07:08,017
But you still lied to me!

607
01:07:09,235 --> 01:07:10,594
What are you
even talking about?

608
01:07:11,423 --> 01:07:13,899
- What are you saying?
- Look! Watch this!

609
01:07:19,416 --> 01:07:20,416
Okay.

610
01:07:20,814 --> 01:07:22,414
What will I explain?

611
01:07:22,579 --> 01:07:24,445
Who's the girl in that video?

612
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:28,377
Okay.

613
01:07:38,158 --> 01:07:39,838
Don't you remember this?

614
01:07:46,899 --> 01:07:50,930
- Lawrence, I don't understand!
- Neither do I!

615
01:07:51,681 --> 01:07:53,329
I don't get you!

616
01:07:53,626 --> 01:07:56,762
I don't get why you're mad.
I don't understand it!

617
01:08:45,954 --> 01:08:47,298
This is my baby picture...

618
01:09:42,568 --> 01:09:43,568
Sir, please.

619
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,428
Stop it!

620
01:09:48,006 --> 01:09:56,428
Sir, stop it!

621
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,373
All men are the same, Albina.

622
01:10:28,006 --> 01:10:30,732
They just want you
for your body.

623
01:10:31,272 --> 01:10:34,717
They'll use you
until they get sick of you.

624
01:10:35,255 --> 01:10:38,403
They're pests!

625
01:10:38,858 --> 01:10:41,467
They don't deserve to live!

626
01:10:41,803 --> 01:10:44,388
They need to be stopped.

627
01:10:44,413 --> 01:10:46,663
Pests!

628
01:10:47,005 --> 01:10:51,653
They all need to die!
We'll kill them all.

629
01:10:52,069 --> 01:10:56,240
All men are the same, Albina.

630
01:10:56,709 --> 01:10:59,451
They just want you
for your body.

631
01:10:59,952 --> 01:11:03,412
They'll use you
until they get sick of you.

632
01:11:04,123 --> 01:11:05,243
They're pests!

633
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:07,150
They're pests!

634
01:11:07,475 --> 01:11:09,670
They don't deserve to live!

635
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:13,029
They need to be stopped.

636
01:11:13,054 --> 01:11:15,741
Pests!

637
01:11:15,766 --> 01:11:21,373
They all need to die!
We'll kill them all.

638
01:11:21,686 --> 01:11:25,381
All men are the same, Albina.

639
01:11:25,498 --> 01:11:28,365
They just want you
for your body.

640
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:32,349
They'll use you
until they get sick of you.

641
01:11:32,974 --> 01:11:36,037
They're pests!

642
01:11:36,577 --> 01:11:39,037
They don't deserve to live!

643
01:11:39,459 --> 01:11:42,357
They need to be stopped.

644
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:44,717
Pests!

645
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,522
They all need to die!

646
01:11:46,546 --> 01:11:49,420
We'll kill them all.

647
01:11:54,505 --> 01:11:58,271
All men are the same, Albina.

648
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:01,677
They just want you
for your body.

649
01:12:02,175 --> 01:12:05,670
They'll use you
until they get sick of you.

650
01:12:06,153 --> 01:12:09,435
They're pests!

651
01:12:35,592 --> 01:12:36,592
Albina?

652
01:12:44,932 --> 01:12:47,832
Fidel, come with me.
There's something wrong.

653
01:12:53,462 --> 01:12:54,462
Albina?

654
01:12:54,963 --> 01:12:56,260
Albina?

655
01:12:57,487 --> 01:12:59,354
Albina, open the door!

656
01:12:59,581 --> 01:13:00,852
Open the door, Fidel.

657
01:13:03,104 --> 01:13:04,104
Albina!

658
01:13:13,409 --> 01:13:14,409
Albina?

659
01:13:14,713 --> 01:13:16,393
What's going on, Albina?

660
01:13:16,635 --> 01:13:19,302
There's a woman
who wants to possess me!

661
01:13:31,805 --> 01:13:35,273
She's been in my nightmares every night.

662
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:40,273
What are you saying?

663
01:13:40,469 --> 01:13:43,562
She wants to possess my body!

664
01:14:23,742 --> 01:14:25,031
Where is it?

665
01:14:27,946 --> 01:14:29,306
It was just here!

666
01:14:33,008 --> 01:14:36,531
What are you doing here, Albina?

667
01:14:37,796 --> 01:14:41,422
There was a woman here!

668
01:14:41,447 --> 01:14:42,492
What are you saying?

669
01:14:42,656 --> 01:14:45,070
There was a picture of a woman!

670
01:14:45,095 --> 01:14:47,461
She was carrying me
when I was little!

671
01:14:47,486 --> 01:14:48,875
But her face is gone!

672
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,462
It was scratched out!

673
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:53,289
Why won't you believe me?

674
01:14:53,314 --> 01:14:54,367
It's Olivia.

675
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:57,398
Fidel, that's impossible!

676
01:14:59,563 --> 01:15:00,603
Who's Olivia?

677
01:15:01,609 --> 01:15:03,342
She was your nanny before.

678
01:15:04,265 --> 01:15:06,007
But she's dead!

679
01:15:06,032 --> 01:15:11,859
Where is she?
Why is she haunting me?

680
01:15:11,884 --> 01:15:14,172
Albina, have you tried praying?

681
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:19,125
You raped her!

682
01:15:32,617 --> 01:15:35,499
Olivia and I had an affair.

683
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,180
You were still small.

684
01:15:41,274 --> 01:15:43,351
I shower her with gifts.

685
01:15:43,492 --> 01:15:44,804
In exchange for that...

686
01:15:45,047 --> 01:15:47,422
She'd willingly give herself to me.

687
01:15:47,735 --> 01:15:51,469
We do it when your mom
is gone, or when she's asleep.

688
01:16:02,408 --> 01:16:05,595
One night, I felt horny.

689
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:07,604
And I wanted her body.

690
01:16:07,838 --> 01:16:09,518
She was the one I wanted.

691
01:16:10,104 --> 01:16:11,971
But she wasn't feeling well.

692
01:16:12,878 --> 01:16:14,908
She couldn't do it with me.

693
01:16:15,065 --> 01:16:16,510
So, I forced her
to do it with me.

694
01:16:30,025 --> 01:16:32,002
She told me the truth.

695
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:34,393
But I didn't listen to her.

696
01:16:34,659 --> 01:16:36,197
Olivia, you whore!

697
01:16:36,713 --> 01:16:40,260
You're shameless!
How could you do this to me?

698
01:16:40,285 --> 01:16:43,322
I gave you a job,
but what did you do?

699
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:50,939
Nothing would happen
if I argued with your dad.

700
01:16:52,798 --> 01:16:55,635
But, she got pregnant.

701
01:16:55,838 --> 01:16:58,174
But she didn't tell me.

702
01:16:59,846 --> 01:17:01,366
I only knew when...

703
01:17:02,065 --> 01:17:04,447
your dad told me the truth.

704
01:17:05,237 --> 01:17:06,971
I told her...

705
01:17:07,323 --> 01:17:09,233
I won't be held responsible
for the child.

706
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:13,799
I'm an asshole.
I'm selfish!

707
01:17:19,362 --> 01:17:21,057
After that...

708
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:25,174
She tried to get an abortion.

709
01:17:52,299 --> 01:17:54,384
She became insane.

710
01:17:56,706 --> 01:17:58,386
She wandered the streets.

711
01:17:59,393 --> 01:18:02,307
She thought that
you were her lost child.

712
01:18:03,534 --> 01:18:06,354
We thought we wouldn't
see you ever again.

713
01:18:08,823 --> 01:18:13,275
We didn't want to bring her to jail,
because she was already insane.

714
01:18:14,753 --> 01:18:17,619
We just locked her
inside her room.

715
01:18:25,603 --> 01:18:27,627
But we didn't know that...

716
01:18:27,775 --> 01:18:30,221
She had an infection.

717
01:18:30,409 --> 01:18:31,799
Because of her abortion.

718
01:18:31,824 --> 01:18:34,572
She rushed her to the hospital
but it was too late.

719
01:18:35,557 --> 01:18:37,229
She was already dead.

720
01:18:39,299 --> 01:18:40,619
It was too late...

721
01:18:50,431 --> 01:18:52,111
You're unbelievable!

722
01:18:53,182 --> 01:18:54,955
How could you do that?

723
01:18:55,846 --> 01:18:57,619
You're both heartless!

724
01:18:58,791 --> 01:19:00,619
You're both heartless!

725
01:19:01,268 --> 01:19:04,408
We're always plagued
by our guilty conscience!

726
01:19:05,025 --> 01:19:07,931
I've had insomnia
for 20 years already!

727
01:19:09,142 --> 01:19:10,822
She's taking revenge!

728
01:19:13,549 --> 01:19:17,752
I can feel that she's almost
got a grip on my soul!

729
01:19:20,908 --> 01:19:24,057
She's going to possess me!

730
01:19:25,705 --> 01:19:30,393
Call a priest! Help me!

731
01:19:32,526 --> 01:19:36,205
Don't worry,
Olivia won't succeed!

732
01:19:37,892 --> 01:19:39,246
Albina!

733
01:19:39,964 --> 01:19:41,318
Come on, let's go!

734
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:14,560
Olivia,

735
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:17,479
if you can hear us.

736
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:20,566
Please, I'm begging you.

737
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:24,987
Spare our daughter.
Stop messing with Albina!

738
01:20:26,336 --> 01:20:29,931
Yes, we have wronged you.
But it was a long time ago.

739
01:20:30,222 --> 01:20:31,962
Olivia, you are no longer alive.

740
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:36,544
Just let us live in peace.

741
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:43,881
What do you want?

742
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:49,845
I don't need you.
Get off of me!

743
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:54,683
I won't allow it to happen, Albina.

744
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:58,395
You can't survive without me!

745
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:01,945
They are going
to take advantage of you, Albina.

746
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:05,360
And I won't let that happen.

747
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:07,863
Who is going to abuse me?

748
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:09,490
All of them.

749
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:13,911
Olivia, we're already old.

750
01:21:14,943 --> 01:21:17,222
If you want justice,
come after us.

751
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:18,665
Make us pay for our sins.

752
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:20,211
But, please, spare our daughter.

753
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:24,539
I'll take you out of here, Albina.

754
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:29,437
I won't let you suffer
the same fate as ours, Albina.

755
01:21:46,383 --> 01:21:47,509
In the name...

756
01:21:47,993 --> 01:21:51,764
and in the power
of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

757
01:21:53,098 --> 01:21:55,476
I command you,

758
01:21:56,539 --> 01:21:59,031
leave now,

759
01:21:59,257 --> 01:22:01,384
you demon.

760
01:22:02,433 --> 01:22:05,336
Leave the body of this person.

761
01:22:06,823 --> 01:22:10,195
Most cunning and deceitful serpent.

762
01:22:10,845 --> 01:22:11,887
Begone!

763
01:22:12,854 --> 01:22:15,356
Reconcile with our Almighty Father.

764
01:22:15,827 --> 01:22:19,455
Don't be a coward!
Stop hiding inside Albina's innocent body.

765
01:22:20,626 --> 01:22:24,797
Stop hiding inside
Albina's innocent body.

766
01:22:25,172 --> 01:22:30,177
Get out of Albina's innocent body!

767
01:22:31,929 --> 01:22:34,932
Albina, fight her.

768
01:22:35,557 --> 01:22:38,352
Fight the demon inside you.

769
01:22:38,977 --> 01:22:41,397
Don't let the demon
take full possession of your body.

770
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:44,650
Fight her. Fight the demon, Albina!

771
01:23:11,093 --> 01:23:13,387
This is all on you!

772
01:23:15,597 --> 01:23:18,475
Stop blaming the devil for your misdeeds!

773
01:23:18,475 --> 01:23:22,146
You will pay for all of your sins.

774
01:23:30,069 --> 01:23:31,134
Father,

775
01:23:31,613 --> 01:23:33,741
what is happening to my daughter?

776
01:23:34,116 --> 01:23:37,786
Tell us, Father,
is the demon gone?

777
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,995
Let's observe her for a few days.

778
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:44,650
Watch over her closely.

779
01:23:45,708 --> 01:23:48,586
Don't let her leave the room.

780
01:23:49,131 --> 01:23:51,049
When the devil comes back,

781
01:23:52,212 --> 01:23:53,922
contact me right away.

782
01:24:02,949 --> 01:24:06,244
Fidel... Fidel...

783
01:24:32,578 --> 01:24:36,082
Don't do this, Albina.

784
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:37,705
Don't do this, Albina.

785
01:24:38,033 --> 01:24:40,275
Feel me, Fidel.

786
01:24:44,603 --> 01:24:46,355
Dear, I don't wanna do this.

787
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:51,038
Did you like what you did to me?

788
01:24:51,525 --> 01:24:55,072
Olivia, I'm begging you.
Spare my daughter's life.

789
01:24:55,340 --> 01:25:00,486
I'm saving her
from your sins, Fidel.

790
01:25:09,253 --> 01:25:10,713
All lies!

791
01:25:13,131 --> 01:25:16,454
Fuck you, Olivia!

792
01:25:18,084 --> 01:25:20,670
You tolerated him.
You remained silent.

793
01:25:20,735 --> 01:25:23,618
You chose to be blinded.

794
01:25:29,773 --> 01:25:34,570
You are not Olivia.
You're Albina!

795
01:26:38,535 --> 01:26:39,565
Wait.

796
01:26:43,697 --> 01:26:45,198
- Albina?
- Can I come in?

797
01:26:45,223 --> 01:26:47,601
No. What are you doing here?

798
01:26:47,951 --> 01:26:50,454
I just want to apologize.
Can we talk?

799
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:54,316
No. I'm busy.
I have clients.

800
01:26:55,150 --> 01:26:57,277
Let me in!

801
01:31:05,150 --> 01:31:06,818
What do you really want?

802
01:31:08,623 --> 01:31:09,645
You!

803
01:31:10,947 --> 01:31:12,199
What do you want, Albina?

804
01:31:13,366 --> 01:31:15,035
Can you get it?

805
01:31:15,907 --> 01:31:19,327
If you're surrounded
by these people.

806
01:31:23,919 --> 01:31:25,003
Who are they?

807
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:29,106
The people who abused you.

808
01:31:31,551 --> 01:31:33,386
What are you talking about?

809
01:31:43,605 --> 01:31:46,067
I want to give
what you want.

810
01:31:50,017 --> 01:31:51,769
This is what you want, right?

811
01:32:46,146 --> 01:32:49,566
Say, Amen.

812
01:32:56,803 --> 01:32:58,805
Amen.

813
01:33:00,307 --> 01:33:03,268
Amen.

814
01:33:09,718 --> 01:33:15,879
Hello Wendell,
come and pick me up please.

815
01:33:47,937 --> 01:33:49,981
Why didn't you teach me how to drive?

816
01:33:50,006 --> 01:33:51,508
You didn't tell me you want to learn.

817
01:33:52,269 --> 01:33:53,437
I want to.

818
01:33:53,462 --> 01:33:56,949
Alright. When we get home,
I'm going to teach you.

819
01:33:57,862 --> 01:33:59,257
Albina, what are you doing?

820
01:33:59,282 --> 01:34:02,869
What are you doing?
We might get in an accident.

821
01:34:06,014 --> 01:34:08,767
In other news,
the police identified the suspect...

822
01:34:08,792 --> 01:34:11,561
in the gruesome murder
of Romeo San Jose.

823
01:34:11,586 --> 01:34:16,132
According to the police, the man
who allegedly committed suicide...

824
01:34:16,157 --> 01:34:17,984
was actually killed.

825
01:34:18,009 --> 01:34:19,914
Authorities are now
looking for the suspect,

826
01:34:19,938 --> 01:34:24,074
the 20 year old
model, Albina Tamayo.

827
01:34:24,099 --> 01:34:30,582
If you know her whereabouts,
please contact our radio station

828
01:34:30,607 --> 01:34:32,526
or report to the nearest police station.

829
01:34:40,031 --> 01:34:43,993
Do you believe that
Olivia is possessing me?

830
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:45,370
I don't know.

831
01:34:47,082 --> 01:34:48,458
Does it matter?

832
01:34:51,170 --> 01:34:52,880
You need to seek help.

833
01:35:09,477 --> 01:35:13,148
Hello Wendell, how’s it going?
Have you already seen Albina?

834
01:35:13,598 --> 01:35:15,100
She is with me.

835
01:35:15,897 --> 01:35:17,940
We're just having
breakfast in a grill house.

836
01:35:17,965 --> 01:35:20,468
I'll just drop her off after we eat.

837
01:35:32,312 --> 01:35:36,441
I don't know if me cheating on you
has somehow caused this mess.

838
01:35:37,464 --> 01:35:38,465
But I'm sorry.

839
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,469
I'm sorry for cheating on you.

840
01:35:44,929 --> 01:35:49,392
If I could travel back in time,
I would do everything...

841
01:35:50,533 --> 01:35:52,035
not to hurt you.

842
01:35:53,171 --> 01:35:55,506
Maybe this wouldn’t have happened.

843
01:36:01,605 --> 01:36:03,648
It's not too late.

844
01:36:23,301 --> 01:36:26,566
Hello, Stacey. How are you?

845
01:36:26,895 --> 01:36:29,731
Me? I just had breakfast.

846
01:36:30,514 --> 01:36:34,090
Yes, I had steak.
I'm with Wendell.

847
01:37:10,473 --> 01:37:11,975
Doc, Doc!

848
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,544
Someone wants to get inside of me.

849
01:37:15,468 --> 01:37:17,845
She wants to destroy my life.

850
01:37:19,273 --> 01:37:20,357
Who is she?

851
01:37:21,396 --> 01:37:22,814
Do you know her?

852
01:37:23,948 --> 01:37:25,825
Who wants to get inside of your body?

853
01:37:33,958 --> 01:37:37,253
Doc, she's already inside of me.

854
01:37:38,013 --> 01:37:39,723
Doc, help me!

855
01:37:40,353 --> 01:37:42,564
Doc! Doc! Doc!

856
01:37:42,589 --> 01:37:45,133
- Doc, help me!
- Take her to the recreation area.

857
01:37:46,609 --> 01:37:47,193
Doc!

858
01:37:47,218 --> 01:37:49,012
Let me go!

859
01:37:49,037 --> 01:37:52,832
Help me!
Someone wants to get my body!
