11

=Episode 4=

12
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,500
(Lu Man, Liang Yi's stand-in)

13
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,659
Sorry.

14
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,100
Did I startle you?

15
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,580
Mrs. Lin is truly stunning.

16
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,260
No wonder Mr. Lin can't forget you.

17
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,859
Congratulations.

18
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,220
I'm Liang Yi.

19
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,219
(So Song Zhichu planned this long ago.)

20
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,060
(He arranged someone to replace me.)

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,860
(I was kept in the dark the whole time.)

22
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,739
So you're Madam Song.

23
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,500
You must be joking.

24
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,859
Before this,

25
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,020
your wedding with Chief Song
caused a stir across the city.

26
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,619
A wedding turned into a funeral.

27
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,620
Not something worth mentioning.

28
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,179
Mr. Lin, you're truly fortunate.

29
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,019
Have you been well?

30
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,779
Thank you for your concern, Madam Song.

31
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,059
Seeing you and Zhichu
living in such harmony,

32
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,739
so loving,

33
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,220
I'm relieved.

34
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,219
I never thought
that one brief meeting at the wedding

35
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,740
would stay with you.

36
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,179
Your heroic display that day

37
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,620
has lingered in my mind.

38
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,499
That night,

39
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,779
you really sent Liang Yi
to Lin Yun's bed.

40
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,179
So what?

41
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,299
Since you're Liang Yi now,

42
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,099
let's see if you've got what it takes

43
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,220
to keep him in your grasp.

44
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,739
Some brother you are.

45
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,300
You wouldn't even let me marry first.

46
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,260
After you, Chief Song.

47
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,340
Congratulations.

48
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,140
(Ruyi is here too.)

49
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,419
My foot hurts.

50
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,620
I'm going to change my shoes.

51
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,699
(Ruyi must've been fooled by them too.)

52
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,140
(I need to tell her the truth.)

53
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,900
Zhichu.

54
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,660
Do you really have to say this now?

55
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,180
When are you going to marry me?

56
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,299
Why are you bringing this up again?

57
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,139
Didn't I say to wait a bit longer?

58
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,739
We agreed on this.

59
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,339
You'd take me in
after you married the young lady.

60
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,299
Now that she's gone,

61
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,859
when do you plan to...

62
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,379
This is Chengyun Society.

63
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,259
Mind your tongue.

64
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,579
How much longer do you want me to wait?

65
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,859
If it weren't for me covering for her,

66
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,819
that fool Lu Man would've
slipped up long ago.

67
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,899
If anything happens to me,

68
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,139
I promise you,

69
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,339
the evidence
of you ruining the Liang family

70
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,740
will spread through the whole city.

71
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,979
How could I not want to marry you?

72
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,899
It's all because of my father.

73
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,659
Any kind of rumor right now

74
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,180
would affect his run
for provincial governor this year.

75
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,060
So marrying me would damage
the Song family's reputation?

76
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,980
Of course I don't think that.

77
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,339
I'm only worried
my father will overthink it.

78
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,259
I betrayed the young lady
who helped me, all for you.

79
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,819
If you dare disappoint me,

80
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,699
I'll drag you down with me.

81
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,300
Alright, I got it.

82
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,940
Don't talk nonsense.

83
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,260
(So even Ruyi betrayed me.)

84
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,180
Zhichu.

85
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,499
Where did you go?

86
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,740
I've been looking for you.

87
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,099
I was just walking around nearby.

88
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,820
Have you two been here this whole time?

89
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,659
Chief Song, you're our important guest.

90
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,540
We couldn't start without you.

91
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,739
Mrs. Lin's concern
always makes me feel a little...

92
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,259
too intentional.

93
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,780
That was a misunderstanding.

94
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,499
Mr. Lin said

95
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,499
you're his closest brother.

96
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,900
I'll have to toast you
a few more times.

97
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,820
After you, Chief Song.

98
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,180
Alright.

99
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,299
The madams really
do share the same taste.

100
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,700
You're even changing
into the exact same shoes.

101
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,219
Today,

102
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,619
let us all witness

103
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,699
the sacred wedding
of Mr. Lin Yun and Miss Xu Yin.

104
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,299
Now,

105
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,899
please welcome our bride and groom

106
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,620
as they make their grand entrance.

107
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,059
Next,

108
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,420
the bride and groom will
give their vows.

109
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,780
On this important day,

110
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,980
I'll make a promise to Miss Xu Yin.

111
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,939
I will not deceive you.

112
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,259
I will not betray you.

113
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,980
I will be the one you trust most.

114
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,460
I hope we can always
be honest with each other

115
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,580
and grow old side by side.

116
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,139
Today

117
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,419
is the most important moment of my life.

118
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,379
Here,

119
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,219
I make this promise to Mr. Lin Yun.

120
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,339
I will not deceive you.

121
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,699
I will not betray you.

122
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,660
I will be the one you trust most.

123
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,420
We will grow old together.

124
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,460
Miss Xu Yin,

125
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,140
will you marry me?

126
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,020
(I will protect you forever
like my own sister.)

127
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,579
I will.

128
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,060
(I'm sorry. I lied to you.)

129
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,579
Next,

130
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,059
please welcome the witnesses,

131
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,579
Rong City Police Chief
Song Zhichu and his wife,

132
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,859
to offer their blessings
to the newlyweds

133
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,979
and light the flame of love.

134
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,100
Please.

135
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,859
Today is the happiest day

136
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,939
of my dearest buddy, Lin Yun.

137
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,299
I'm honored to light this flame of love

138
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,380
for my brother and sister-in-law.

139
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,699
(Song Zhichu.)

140
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,540
(This time, you're done for.)

141
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,180
Watch out!

142
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,340
(Lin Yun.)

143
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,620
Boss.

144
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,820
Lin Yun!

145
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,220
Are you alright?

146
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,100
Are you alright?

147
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,659
(Lin Yun is way too meticulous.)

148
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,980
(The moment he investigates
the explosion, he'll suspect me.)

149
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,660
(I need to come up with a plan.)

150
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,979
Mr. Lin's arm is injured.

151
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,939
Be cautious.

152
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,139
These next few days, Mrs. Lin
must keep a close eye on him.

153
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,780
Make sure the wound doesn't get wet.

154
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,180
I understand.

155
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,980
When you rushed forward just now,
I nearly died of fright.

156
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,139
I was terrified
something would happen to you.

157
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,220
Is Song Zhichu's life really
more important than your own?

158
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,619
You're still laughing?

159
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,780
I'm done talking to you.

160
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,939
I know you're worried about me.

161
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,140
Don't worry.

162
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,820
I can handle myself.

163
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,139
Since you're injured,

164
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,620
I'll let it go this time.

165
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,339
Chief Song and his wife have left.

166
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,579
I personally saw them off.

167
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,339
Also,

168
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,259
in a trash bin
not far from Chengyun Society,

169
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,820
we found the cake
that was switched out.

170
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,380
It was premeditated.

171
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,579
Boss,

172
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,460
other than Huaying Brothel,

173
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,260
have you dealt with anyone recently?

174
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,259
You think the killer was after me?

175
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,499
Who else? Inviting Chief Song
and his wife to light the candles

176
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,180
was something we discussed last minute.

177
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,059
No one could've

178
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,700
predicted our decision.

179
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,220
Who would use that moment to kill them?

180
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,459
Did you check the bakery?

181
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,579
I sent people to ask.

182
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,259
The day after we ordered our cake,

183
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,419
a woman wearing a veil

184
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,580
ordered the exact same one.

185
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,699
Have you found her?

186
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,100
Not yet.

187
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,259
Keep looking.

188
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,220
Yes.

189
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,020
Where did you go this morning?

190
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,780
You showered
with the bathroom window open.

191
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,100
Nothing eludes your sharp eyes.

192
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,300
It's because of this.

193
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,459
Your wedding gift.

194
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,820
Do you like it?

195
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,579
I actually had it ready last night.

196
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,899
But the shopkeeper said
he needed time to engrave it,

197
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,219
so I had to
sneak out this morning to pick it up.

198
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,699
I wanted to surprise you,

199
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,300
but you still found out.

200
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,579
I'm thirsty.

201
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,819
Pour me a glass of water.

202
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,900
Alright.

203
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,500
Do you remember the first time
your father beat you?

204
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,180
Why bring that up all of a sudden?

205
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,259
It just feels like
after seeing you again,

206
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,540
you're very different
from how you were back then.

207
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,140
People grow up.
Of course things change.

208
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,700
Do you remember
how you used to cling to me every day?

209
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,339
Your father locked you up
just to scare you,

210
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:05,939
but

211
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,580
he never expected
you'd climb out through the window.

212
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,860
I found you in the abandoned temple
behind the mountain.

213
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,819
You were crying your heart out.

214
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,139
After that,

215
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,180
your father never dared scare you again.

216
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,539
He told me he was afraid
you'd run away again

217
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,060
and bad things might happen.

218
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,219
All of a sudden,

219
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,740
I really miss my dad.

220
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,259
Get the file

221
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,620
from the drawer.

222
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,220
Alright.

223
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,260
Do you remember why you cried that day?

224
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,779
What else could it be?

225
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,300
I was scared, obviously.

226
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,459
That year,

227
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,980
you ran away
and hid in that mountain temple.

228
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,660
When I found you,

229
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,660
you were terrified.

230
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,300
You clung to me and cried nonstop.

231
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,500
Remember?

232
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,979
Of course I remember.

233
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,819
I was alone all night.

234
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,380
I was scared to death.

235
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,220
You lured me to Huaying Brothel
on purpose, didn't you?

236
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,660
Who are you really?

237
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,299
Just now,

238
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,179
didn't you swear at the wedding

239
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,179
that I was the one you loved most?

240
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,940
And now you're doubting me?

241
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,899
That table
was painted just two days ago.

242
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,820
The paint underneath isn't even dry.

243
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,899
You touched it with your bare hand,

244
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,980
and nothing happened to you.

245
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,020
Back then,

246
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,059
when the temple was being repainted,

247
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,700
Xu Yin cried because
she was allergic to the paint.

248
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,139
You're full of schemes,

249
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,260
and you won't even spare
the one you love most.

250
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,700
The one I love most?

251
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,460
