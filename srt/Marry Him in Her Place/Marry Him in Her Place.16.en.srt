12
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,272
Go ahead.

13
00:01:36,832 --> 00:01:38,472
Mr. Li, how have you been lately?

14
00:01:38,992 --> 00:01:39,791
Quite well.

15
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:41,272
Thank you for asking.

16
00:01:42,152 --> 00:01:43,272
Madam Lin.

17
00:01:47,912 --> 00:01:49,432
Chief Song.

18
00:01:49,912 --> 00:01:52,792
Why didn't Madam Lin greet the hosts

19
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:54,992
of today's banquet?

20
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:56,712
Afraid of me?

21
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:03,432
Chief Song, you hold my secret
in your hands.

22
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:05,472
Of course, I'm afraid.

23
00:02:07,352 --> 00:02:08,592
Madam Lin.

24
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:10,432
Listen to my advice.

25
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:13,431
Before you act or make decisions,

26
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:15,832
it's best to leave yourself a way out.

27
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,130
Otherwise, if your backers fall,

28
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:19,792
you might lose your life.

29
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:23,367
Thanks for your concern, Chief Song,

30
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,872
but you better save this advice
for yourself.

31
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:29,032
There are many guests today.

32
00:02:29,352 --> 00:02:32,432
If anything embarrassing happens,

33
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:38,547
I wonder if Chief Song
will still remain as calm as now.

34
00:02:46,112 --> 00:02:47,774
Chief Song, ignoring your own wife

35
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:49,591
and all these merchants,

36
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:52,524
chatting so happily with my wife here,

37
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:56,045
shows you really haven't taken
Mayor Song's words to heart.

38
00:02:56,272 --> 00:02:58,324
We've known each other for years.

39
00:02:58,325 --> 00:03:00,271
Your overprotective behavior
for your wife

40
00:03:00,272 --> 00:03:03,512
really opens my eyes.

41
00:03:04,672 --> 00:03:05,951
Alright.

42
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,392
Then I wish you both
a wonderful time today.

43
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:27,072
Guang, go.

44
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:29,712
Mother.

45
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:31,591
Madam Song already has children.

46
00:03:31,592 --> 00:03:33,111
This wealthy family is such a mess.

47
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,792
Why are you here?

48
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:39,752
Take him away.

49
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:41,705
Wait.

50
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:49,312
Chief Song.

51
00:03:49,552 --> 00:03:52,071
Mr. Lu and his son were brought by me.

52
00:03:52,072 --> 00:03:53,512
What do you mean by this?

53
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:58,151
So it was Mr. Lin who brought them.

54
00:03:58,152 --> 00:03:59,751
I thought they were bothering my wife.

55
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:01,899
I thought they were here
to cause trouble.

56
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,139
What a coincidence.

57
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,511
Mr. Lu asked me to find someone for him.

58
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:06,951
Looks like I found them.

59
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:09,352
Mr. Lin, found them.

60
00:04:09,752 --> 00:04:11,352
She's the one I was looking for.

61
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:14,432
You're lying. I don't even know you.

62
00:04:15,937 --> 00:04:17,427
What a scoundrel.

63
00:04:18,937 --> 00:04:19,832
Father.

64
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,449
You, Lu Man.

65
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,969
You lied to me
about making money in the city.

66
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,929
Turns out you were climbing
the social ladder.

67
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,191
Our child is already this big.

68
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:34,986
You, a married woman,

69
00:04:34,987 --> 00:04:37,991
actually did something so shameless.

70
00:04:37,992 --> 00:04:40,831
If my mother hadn't taken
in a lonely and helpless you back then,

71
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:42,871
you wouldn't have the life you have now.

72
00:04:42,872 --> 00:04:44,112
Everyone,

73
00:04:44,712 --> 00:04:46,199
help me judge this.

74
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,760
Is there anyone who bullies
their husband like this?

75
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:52,592
Guang.

76
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,874
Take a good look.

77
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,711
Your mother doesn't want us anymore.

78
00:04:56,712 --> 00:04:58,152
Mother.

79
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:00,191
Mother.

80
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:02,391
Guang, don't listen to him.

81
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:03,899
I don't mean that.

82
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,951
How could Miss Liang have such
a big child?

83
00:05:06,952 --> 00:05:08,351
There's something fishy here.

84
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:09,831
Isn't she Miss Liang?

85
00:05:09,832 --> 00:05:11,391
Why is she called Lu Man?

86
00:05:11,392 --> 00:05:13,792
Could it be that she cheated
on Chief Song?

87
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,871
(Now let's see how you explain this.)

88
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:22,592
Zhichu.

89
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:28,912
What's going on?

90
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:34,272
Come in.

91
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:36,672
(Uncle Er.)

92
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:38,711
Mayor Song.

93
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:39,711
There's something

94
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:41,791
Liang family has hidden this
from you too long.

95
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:44,271
It's been weighing on my conscience.

96
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:46,031
Today I must reveal it

97
00:05:46,032 --> 00:05:47,391
to the public.

98
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:50,311
Liang Yi went missing
for two years at sixteen.

99
00:05:50,312 --> 00:05:50,991
Back then,

100
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:53,791
my eldest brother took Liang Yi
out of town for business,

101
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:56,391
but unexpectedly, she got lost.

102
00:05:56,392 --> 00:05:58,271
Back then my eldest brother was frantic.

103
00:05:58,272 --> 00:05:59,391
He searched everywhere.

104
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,831
He searched for over a year.

105
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:02,031
He finally found her.

106
00:06:02,032 --> 00:06:05,071
But unexpectedly,
it was already too late.

107
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:07,124
The Lu family had bought her
and taken her.

108
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,791
She even had a child.

109
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:10,591
My eldest brother was heartbroken,

110
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:11,991
in deep anguish.

111
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:14,351
But family disgrace shouldn't
be made public.

112
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:17,431
So he hid this part of her past.

113
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:19,111
Besides, my brother truly

114
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,751
cherished the marriage arranged
between Liang Yi and Zhichu.

115
00:06:21,752 --> 00:06:22,951
He was confused at the time

116
00:06:22,952 --> 00:06:24,271
and concealed the truth.

117
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:27,071
In the end, he still decided to marry
Liang Yi into the Song family.

118
00:06:27,072 --> 00:06:28,191
Mayor Song,

119
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:29,471
please be magnanimous.

120
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,271
Considering my brother has passed away,

121
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:32,271
I beg your forgiveness.

122
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:33,674
If there's any blame, put it on me.

123
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:34,751
I'll take it all.

124
00:06:34,752 --> 00:06:35,511
Mayor Song,

125
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:37,511
Liang family has wronged you.

126
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:39,152
We have wronged you.

127
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:41,071
What are you doing?

128
00:06:41,072 --> 00:06:43,471
I won't allow them
to slander me like this.

129
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:44,471
Turning truth into lies.

130
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:46,391
In what identity are you stepping out?

131
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:47,512
Xu Yin?

132
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:49,502
Or Liang Yi?

133
00:07:03,072 --> 00:07:04,592
I sincerely apologize

134
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:07,031
for making everyone witness this.

135
00:07:07,032 --> 00:07:08,712
Regarding today's incident,

136
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:13,151
I hope everyone can understand
the hardship behind it.

137
00:07:13,152 --> 00:07:14,672
Do not speak carelessly.

138
00:07:16,272 --> 00:07:18,231
Take all of them back.

139
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:21,191
This matter is extremely serious.

140
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:23,712
I will interrogate it personally.

141
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:26,432
Mayor Song.

142
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:31,431
Mr. Lu and Guang were brought by me.

143
00:07:31,432 --> 00:07:33,871
Besides, they are also victims.

144
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:35,632
Please allow them to leave.

145
00:07:36,462 --> 00:07:37,471
How about this?

146
00:07:37,472 --> 00:07:40,231
If you need the father
and son to testify,

147
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:42,111
just tell me.

148
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:44,912
I will personally bring them
to your residence.

149
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:47,392
Then I'll trouble you.

150
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:58,192
(So the one who really betrayed
my father was Uncle Er.)

151
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:02,152
You thought capturing the Lu father
and son would give me leverage.

152
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:04,964
Trying to fight me?

153
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:06,445
Too naive.

154
00:08:13,912 --> 00:08:16,151
Xiazhu. I missed you so much.
Give me a kiss.

155
00:08:16,152 --> 00:08:17,032
No.

156
00:08:17,612 --> 00:08:18,551
So pretentious.

157
00:08:18,552 --> 00:08:19,712
Come on, give me a kiss.

158
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:21,752
Pretentious.

159
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:24,071
Xiaojiao.

160
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:24,631
Don't leave.

161
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:25,791
Wait a moment.

162
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:27,152
Wait for me.

163
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,391
Is everything ready?

164
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:34,336
Don't worry.

165
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:35,195
Good.

166
00:08:38,032 --> 00:08:39,832
Second Master has great tolerance
for alcohol.

167
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:43,712
Good wine.

168
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:48,191
Qiushuang, you smell wonderful.

169
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:48,631
Come.

170
00:08:48,632 --> 00:08:50,112
Let me kiss you.

171
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:51,651
Second Master,

172
00:08:51,652 --> 00:08:53,332
let me toast you again.

173
00:08:56,672 --> 00:08:57,751
Your skin is so fair.

174
00:08:57,752 --> 00:08:59,032
So smooth.

175
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:02,111
Qiushuang.

176
00:09:02,112 --> 00:09:04,552
I will be gentle later.

177
00:09:08,752 --> 00:09:10,832
You really can drink.

178
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,740
Good wine.

179
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:17,792
Fill it up.

180
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,900
Second Master.

181
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:30,995
Is this drug reliable?

182
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,191
Don't worry, Madam Lin.

183
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:36,551
When he wakes up, he'll feel weak
and drenched in cold sweat.

184
00:09:36,552 --> 00:09:39,191
Just like being possessed
by something evil.

185
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:40,751
I've cleared the area.

186
00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:43,031
Ask anything you need.

187
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:44,152
Thank you.

188
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:00,967
Someone come!

189
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,872
Is anyone there?

190
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:06,151
Qiushuang!

191
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:07,672
Someone come!

192
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:32,551
Amitabha.

193
00:10:32,552 --> 00:10:35,351
Buddha, please protect me.

194
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:38,232
Return my life to me!

195
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,871
I died so miserably!

196
00:10:40,872 --> 00:10:42,432
Uncle Er.

197
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:44,511
You...

198
00:10:44,512 --> 00:10:45,711
You are...

199
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:46,831
Liang Yi?

200
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:48,471
Uncle Er.

201
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:50,111
Where is my father?

202
00:10:50,112 --> 00:10:52,220
Why can't I find him?

203
00:10:53,512 --> 00:10:55,591
Your father...
Hasn't he already passed away?

204
00:10:55,592 --> 00:10:56,591
Impossible.

205
00:10:56,592 --> 00:10:58,712
How could my father be dead?

206
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,671
It's true. I'm not lying.

207
00:11:00,672 --> 00:11:03,472
Your father had already died
on your wedding day.

208
00:11:03,712 --> 00:11:05,391
Every injustice has a culprit.

209
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:07,680
If you have matters, don't come to me.
Don't come to me.

210
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,391
Go to Song Zhichu.

211
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:09,592
Go to Song Zhichu.

212
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:17,912
Why did Song Zhichu kill my father?

213
00:11:19,632 --> 00:11:20,551
Because...

214
00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:21,360
Say it.

215
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,219
Because your father discovered
that Song Zhichu

216
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,351
and I were secretly
using the Liang family

217
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,551
to transport opium.

218
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:29,351
He wanted to report us to Song Ming.

219
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:30,591
I acted to protect myself,

220
00:11:30,592 --> 00:11:32,791
and quickly informed Song Zhichu.

221
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,031
Who knew Song Zhichu
would be so ruthless?

222
00:11:35,032 --> 00:11:37,631
He's too cruel.

223
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:39,031
He even killed his father-in-law.

224
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,831
So you also perjured yourself
for him against your conscience.

225
00:11:42,832 --> 00:11:44,471
Calling black white.

226
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:46,031
I had no choice.

227
00:11:46,032 --> 00:11:46,791
You know,

228
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:47,711
Song Zhichu

229
00:11:47,712 --> 00:11:48,711
is madman.

230
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:49,831
He is ruthless.

231
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:52,791
Did Song Ming know about you
and Song Zhichu transporting opium?

232
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,191
There's no way he could know.

233
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:56,271
He is the mayor.

234
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:58,391
Moreover, the anti-opium campaign
in Rong City

235
00:11:58,392 --> 00:12:01,192
was your father
and Song Ming's joint effort.

236
00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:05,449
I've said all I can.

237
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,111
Go back to where you came from.

238
00:12:09,112 --> 00:12:12,551
I will make sure to send you more money
so that your life there is well-provided.

239
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:14,832
Alright?

240
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:17,872
I already old. I can't take much fright.

241
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:25,711
Sign this confession.

242
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:26,236
No.

243
00:12:26,237 --> 00:12:28,231
Song Zhichu...

244
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:29,031
He will kill me.

245
00:12:29,032 --> 00:12:30,191
I'll be dead.

246
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:31,271
If you don't sign,

247
00:12:31,272 --> 00:12:34,151
I'll take you to the underworld
to see my father

248
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:36,871
and make you suffer
in hell for eternity.

249
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:38,431
You won't die a good death.

250
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:41,895
I'll sign.

251
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,932
(The sinner)

252
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:53,311
Uncle Er,

253
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:55,831
I will haunt you forever.

254
00:12:55,832 --> 00:12:59,112
You'll never be rid of me in your life.

255
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:04,191
I want you to pay with your life.

256
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:05,792
No!

257
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:31,831
There...

258
00:13:31,832 --> 00:13:33,352
There's a ghost!

259
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,152
There's a ghost!

260
00:13:55,032 --> 00:13:56,791
Making him confess is simple.

261
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:59,151
Why torture yourself like this?

262
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:01,871
Why can brothers use each other

263
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:03,791
and scheme against each other?

264
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:06,751
When my father was alive,
he treated Uncle Er well.

265
00:14:06,752 --> 00:14:09,712
And yet he could betray like this.

266
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:13,311
(I really didn't expect Miss Liang
to be alive.)

267
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:16,952
(If I tell Chief Song about this...)

268
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:24,232
Is there really no karma in this world?

269
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:32,312
If not,

270
00:14:35,272 --> 00:14:37,712
I will fight for justice on your behalf.
