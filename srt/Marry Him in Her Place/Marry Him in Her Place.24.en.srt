12
00:01:23,072 --> 00:01:24,312
Who goes there?

13
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:36,182
I, Liang Yi of Chengyun Society﻿, have come
with my men to greet Staff Officer Wang.

14
00:01:36,752 --> 00:01:38,351
So it's you, Mrs. Lin.

15
00:01:38,352 --> 00:01:41,311
What brings the lady of Chengyun Society

16
00:01:41,312 --> 00:01:43,671
to a staff officer of Yunzhou?

17
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:46,211
I have a business opportunity
I'd like to discuss with you.

18
00:01:46,212 --> 00:01:47,892
What business
could a military officer like me

19
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:49,831
possibly negotiate with you?

20
00:01:49,832 --> 00:01:54,152
One that could set you up for life.

21
00:01:55,752 --> 00:01:56,872
Go on.

22
00:01:57,392 --> 00:01:59,192
I'll be straight with you.

23
00:01:59,212 --> 00:02:01,111
You came a long way in a hurry.

24
00:02:01,112 --> 00:02:02,361
That can't have been easy.

25
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:06,261
Soon, you'll be back on the battlefield
risking your neck.

26
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:07,636
You bleed for the cause.

27
00:02:07,637 --> 00:02:09,882
But, he, Song Ming,
reaps all the rewards.

28
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:11,949
If fate turns on you,

29
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,874
there'll always be

30
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,461
another Staff Officer Zhang
or Staff Officer Li to take your place.

31
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:18,142
You're getting
the short end of the stick.

32
00:02:21,552 --> 00:02:23,232
So, what do you think

33
00:02:23,437 --> 00:02:24,557
I should do?

34
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:28,736
Join hands with Chengyun Society.

35
00:02:28,737 --> 00:02:30,511
Once we succeed, Yunzhou will be yours.

36
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:31,549
Jiangzhou will be mine.

37
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,999
We rule together

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,040
and keep it that way.

39
00:02:40,592 --> 00:02:42,671
You really are the daughter
of a merchant family.

40
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:44,591
You have quite a talent
for sizing things up.

41
00:02:44,592 --> 00:02:47,391
I wonder
what your father-in-law would say

42
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:49,224
if he heard this,

43
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:50,712
Young Madam Song.

44
00:02:50,912 --> 00:02:52,552
How fascinating.

45
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,631
Instead of keeping vigil

46
00:02:57,632 --> 00:02:59,272
at the Song Residence,

47
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:01,792
you're here
plotting the future of the provinces.

48
00:03:02,072 --> 00:03:03,271
That was

49
00:03:03,272 --> 00:03:05,424
a clever plan,

50
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:06,545
I'll give you that.

51
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:08,791
If Governor Song hadn't
made arrangements in advance,

52
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:11,912
you might really have
overturned Rong City today.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
Men, seize her.

54
00:03:13,537 --> 00:03:14,457
Yes, sir.

55
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:25,945
(Rong City Municipal Hall,
Rong City Police Bureau)

56
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:45,249
Staff Officer Wang,
thank you for coming all this way.

57
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,545
If this works out, I'll reward you well.

58
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,420
Liang Yi,

59
00:03:52,672 --> 00:03:54,671
I've overlooked your mistakes
time and time again

60
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:57,071
for your father's sake.

61
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:59,945
Yet, you insist on defying me.

62
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:01,111
To think

63
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:03,872
you'd be as foolish
as that spineless father of yours.

64
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:07,192
Don't blame me for removing an obstacle.

65
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,610
You killed my father.

66
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,620
I did.

67
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:14,620
So what?

68
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:18,999
You really believe you can fight me
when you are already cornered?

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,911
My father did nothing to you.

70
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:23,112
He overreached.

71
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,010
He insisted on investigating
the opium trade.

72
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,486
(Liang's Apothecary Ledger)

73
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:31,127
Song Ming,
look at what your son's gotten into!

74
00:04:33,952 --> 00:04:36,912
I never imagined
that fool would dare touch opium.

75
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,649
Calm down.

76
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,699
I'll deal with him once this is over.

77
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,619
Once this is over?

78
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,071
Don't forget this.

79
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:45,911
When Rong City banned opium,

80
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:47,231
you led the charge.

81
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:49,311
And now you want to cover for your son?

82
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:52,271
Rest assured,
I won't protect him in this.

83
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:54,911
But it is our children's wedding day.

84
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:57,511
You can consider
this day never happened.

85
00:04:57,512 --> 00:05:00,071
The wedding is off!

86
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:01,699
Liang, don't be rash.

87
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,071
Your daughter is so fond of Zhichu.

88
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:05,351
I won't let my Yi

89
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:09,320
marry a man with no integrity.

90
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:28,086
You opposed me,

91
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:29,752
so you must suffer the consequences.

92
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:32,549
Adjutant!

93
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,471
(Righteous Spirit)

94
00:05:35,472 --> 00:05:37,431
Bring him back to the Liang Residence.

95
00:05:37,432 --> 00:05:40,112
Have Zhichu take care of him.

96
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:43,671
Say the head of the Liang family
got drunk

97
00:05:43,672 --> 00:05:45,271
on his daughter's wedding night,

98
00:05:45,272 --> 00:05:46,991
fell into the well,

99
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:49,272
and died by accident.

100
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:52,471
My father trusted you!

101
00:05:52,472 --> 00:05:54,991
You and your son are monsters!

102
00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:58,391
Liang Yi, you're an impressive opponent.

103
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:00,871
You married both my sons,

104
00:06:00,872 --> 00:06:02,991
set them against each other,

105
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:04,951
and got Zhichu killed.

106
00:06:04,952 --> 00:06:07,872
But you won't live beyond today.

107
00:06:09,472 --> 00:06:10,592
Yun.

108
00:06:15,392 --> 00:06:17,392
Everything I have worked for
is about to fall into place.

109
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:20,775
The only rift between us
is that wretched woman.

110
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:23,512
Come here.

111
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:25,832
I'll give you a chance.

112
00:06:30,112 --> 00:06:32,912
Kill her yourself,

113
00:06:35,432 --> 00:06:36,871
and all your past deeds

114
00:06:36,872 --> 00:06:39,112
will be forgiven.

115
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:43,932
From this moment on, you'll be
the only son of the Song family,

116
00:06:44,032 --> 00:06:46,912
the only young marshal of Jiangzhou.

117
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:51,912
Do it.

118
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,761
Staff Officer Wang,
what is the meaning of this?

119
00:06:56,762 --> 00:06:58,499
I've decided to switch my allegiances.

120
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,711
If Governor Song hadn't
made arrangements in advance,

121
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,832
you might really have
overturned Rong City today.

122
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,551
Men.

123
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:05,432
Seize her.

124
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,680
Mrs. Lin!

125
00:07:10,812 --> 00:07:12,092
All of you, stop!

126
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,149
To think this pack of vermin
managed to slip into Jiangzhou.

127
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:21,949
Seize them!

128
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,950
Yes, sir.

129
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:24,111
Wait.

130
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:25,832
I have one request.

131
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:29,432
You think you have
what it takes to revolt?

132
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:30,791
Allow me to enlighten you.

133
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:34,072
Commander Jin
has already surrounded your men.

134
00:07:37,192 --> 00:07:40,112
Miss Liang,
I'll send him on his way now.

135
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:43,951
Yun, I'm your father!

136
00:07:43,952 --> 00:07:45,072
Father?

137
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:47,361
You don't deserve that title.

138
00:07:47,362 --> 00:07:48,561
You think I don't know

139
00:07:48,562 --> 00:07:50,951
you ordered Song Zhichu's mother
to beat my mother and me to death

140
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:54,472
because you hated
that my mother was a servant?

141
00:07:55,112 --> 00:07:58,471
She's dead.
She won't give you any more trouble.

142
00:07:58,472 --> 00:07:59,671
A servant

143
00:07:59,672 --> 00:08:02,271
dreaming she could use a child
to threaten me.

144
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:03,752
Pathetic.

145
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:12,551
I thought

146
00:08:12,552 --> 00:08:13,791
you went after Zhichu

147
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:16,712
because his mother killed yours.

148
00:08:17,392 --> 00:08:20,232
Turns out I was the real target.

149
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:21,512
That's right.

150
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:26,419
I got close to him
so I could investigate you.

151
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,980
I want the Song family
gone from Rong City once and for all.

152
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,432
Staff Officer Wang.

153
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:47,742
He's not worth dirtying your hands.

154
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,632
This is the only courtesy
you'll get from me.

155
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:15,825
Do it yourself.

156
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,392
Let's go home.

157
00:10:31,592 --> 00:10:32,712
Why are you hiding?

158
00:10:34,072 --> 00:10:35,552
You're bullying me again.

159
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:37,074
Who's bullying you?

160
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:39,432
You.

161
00:10:42,672 --> 00:10:43,952
Did I bully you?

162
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:46,752
