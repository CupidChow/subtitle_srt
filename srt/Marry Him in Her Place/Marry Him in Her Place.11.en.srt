Come in.

13
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,720
Drink this.

14
00:01:36,392 --> 00:01:37,471
It's honey water

15
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,632
for your hangover.

16
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:49,232
- Last night...
- Lin Yun...

17
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:53,524
How much did you drink last night
to end up in that state?

18
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:55,445
I don't remember a thing
from last night.

19
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:58,225
Nothing at all?

20
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:05,792
Who changed me?

21
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:11,574
Lin Yun,

22
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:13,574
what we have is a deal. Nothing more.

23
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:15,632
You don't need to fuss over me.

24
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:20,125
Remember what you said.

25
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:22,474
If you get yourself into trouble,

26
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,075
I'm not cleaning up after you.

27
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,111
Boss.

28
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,072
Get lost!

29
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:45,441
I need ten men.

30
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:46,562
How much?

31
00:02:47,472 --> 00:02:49,271
You're a pretty little lady.

32
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:50,872
Why don't you keep me company...

33
00:02:58,752 --> 00:03:00,472
I'll take the job.

34
00:03:02,152 --> 00:03:03,471
30 per head.

35
00:03:03,472 --> 00:03:04,912
Cash up front.

36
00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:08,151
Deal.

37
00:03:08,152 --> 00:03:09,391
Put these clothes on.

38
00:03:09,392 --> 00:03:11,471
For today,
you're all from the Chengyun Society.

39
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:12,671
Got it?

40
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:13,832
Got it.

41
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:19,471
If Mrs Lin loses even a strand of hair,
you answer for it with your life.

42
00:03:19,472 --> 00:03:20,672
Yes, sir.

43
00:03:20,712 --> 00:03:21,751
And

44
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:22,791
don't blow your cover.

45
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:24,871
If she recognizes any of you,

46
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:25,991
you end it the same way.

47
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:26,591
Yes, sir.

48
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,472
Get to work.

49
00:03:34,432 --> 00:03:35,871
Rest assured, Boss.

50
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:37,471
These guys all work at our docks.

51
00:03:37,472 --> 00:03:38,872
She definitely won't recognize them.

52
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,899
So we're just acting as ourselves?

53
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,300
Don't ask questions.

54
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:50,917
Just do what she tells you.

55
00:03:53,712 --> 00:03:55,711
You guys actually do look the part.

56
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:56,631
Of course.

57
00:03:56,632 --> 00:03:58,112
We're professionals.

58
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,520
(Liang's Apothecary)

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,471
Move quickly.

60
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:12,386
The apothecary just finished inventory.

61
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:14,151
I sent
the warehouse keeper home to rest.

62
00:04:14,152 --> 00:04:15,792
At most, you've got an hour.

63
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:17,267
Got it.

64
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:40,432
Good work today.

65
00:04:40,952 --> 00:04:41,551
No,

66
00:04:41,552 --> 00:04:41,911
Mrs. Lin.

67
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:42,831
I can't accept that.

68
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:43,952
What did you call me?

69
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:52,392
Looks like you've got the lines down.

70
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:55,512
Thank you, ma'am.

71
00:04:55,832 --> 00:04:57,872
He's not exactly the brightest.

72
00:05:00,232 --> 00:05:01,592
We'll get going, then.

73
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:05,871
She didn't notice anything, right?

74
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,391
I don't think so.

75
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:08,071
Good.

76
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:09,832
Or else, Boss will have our heads...

77
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:16,431
(Now, we see)

78
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:19,592
(if the fish will take the bait.)

79
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:43,712
You're from Chengyun Society?

80
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:49,992
This lighter belongs to Lin Yun himself.

81
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:52,072
Who do you think I am?

82
00:05:53,872 --> 00:05:55,951
So it's Mr. Liu,
Chengyun Society's second-in-command.

83
00:05:55,952 --> 00:05:57,792
Forgive me for not recognizing you.

84
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:02,471
Someone wants to know

85
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:04,071
whether you'd like a cedar coffin

86
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,152
or a willow one.

87
00:06:07,672 --> 00:06:08,951
Mr. Liu, you jest.

88
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:12,071
My little opium den
has survived all these years

89
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,631
thanks to certain connections.

90
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:16,871
I don't need to explain
what our boss and Song Zhichu are

91
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:18,274
to each other.

92
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:19,635
Truth is,

93
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:23,112
Song Zhichu wants your head.

94
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:27,822
Don't think you can fool me
with a few words.

95
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:33,471
Here.

96
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:34,992
Take a look at this.

97
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:39,631
Looks familiar, doesn't it?

98
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,671
Everything he promised you

99
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:45,031
is piled up in our warehouse right now.

100
00:06:45,032 --> 00:06:46,231
Impossible!

101
00:06:46,232 --> 00:06:47,551
We agreed on

102
00:06:47,552 --> 00:06:48,832
an exclusive deal.

103
00:06:48,912 --> 00:06:51,111
Do you still not get it?

104
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:54,471
Song Zhichu wants a new supply route.

105
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:56,111
You know how business works

106
00:06:56,112 --> 00:06:57,231
better than I do.

107
00:06:57,232 --> 00:06:58,192
Don't you?

108
00:06:58,632 --> 00:07:00,471
Song Zhichu! That scoundrel!

109
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:02,591
All these years,
I've done his dirty work

110
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:03,991
and he takes the biggest cut.

111
00:07:03,992 --> 00:07:06,031
I only wanted a bit more commission.

112
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:09,174
Yet, he said giving me business at all
was already doing me a favor.

113
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:10,214
If you die,

114
00:07:10,215 --> 00:07:12,151
it's just one dog mourning another.

115
00:07:12,152 --> 00:07:13,271
We're all small fry

116
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:15,631
under our bosses.

117
00:07:15,632 --> 00:07:18,152
We only have ourselves to blame

118
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:22,392
for not having anything
to hold over them.

119
00:07:24,752 --> 00:07:25,912
Wait.

120
00:07:26,672 --> 00:07:27,832
I do.

121
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:29,032
What do you have?

122
00:07:29,832 --> 00:07:32,391
Something that can keep him in line.

123
00:07:32,392 --> 00:07:33,991
I have a ledger.

124
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:35,071
Every deal I've done

125
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:37,391
with Song Zhichu is written in it.

126
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:39,271
If it ever gets out,

127
00:07:39,272 --> 00:07:42,432
he can kiss his position
as police chief goodbye.

128
00:07:42,752 --> 00:07:44,231
Let's make a deal.

129
00:07:44,232 --> 00:07:45,711
Let me go,

130
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:47,471
and I'll hand you the ledger.

131
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:50,712
Take it for your protection.

132
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,271
If what you're saying is true,

133
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,311
then I'm spared a sin.

134
00:07:55,312 --> 00:07:56,472
I'll fetch it right now.

135
00:08:01,472 --> 00:08:02,672
Don't worry.

136
00:08:03,152 --> 00:08:04,774

00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:11,351
Thank you.

140
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:14,071
Who dares to pretend
to be one of my men?

151

for Liu Xiu.

152

Yes, sir.

160
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:04,792
What are you going to do to me?

161
00:09:08,062 --> 00:09:09,742
Little Fox,

162
00:09:09,752 --> 00:09:11,592

just ask me for what you want.
