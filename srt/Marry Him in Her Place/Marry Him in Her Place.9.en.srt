=Episode 9=

12
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:13,052
What

13
00:01:13,852 --> 00:01:14,612
are you doing?

14
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:30,852
Sneaking into my room

15
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,372
in the dead of night,

16
00:01:35,187 --> 00:01:36,627
looking for death

17
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:38,972
or me?

18
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:43,412
If you truly wanted me dead,

19
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:45,732
when I accidentally
took opium yesterday,

20
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:47,332
why bother saving me with a kiss?

21
00:01:49,132 --> 00:01:50,132
Or is it

22
00:01:50,972 --> 00:01:52,372
you're afraid if I die,

23
00:01:53,172 --> 00:01:54,692
you'll lose your scapegoat?

24
00:02:03,412 --> 00:02:05,932
You think a single kiss
is enough to soften me?

25
00:02:08,572 --> 00:02:09,372
Liang Yi,

26
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:12,732
those tricks you learned
at Huaying Brothel

27
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,300
are...

28
00:02:14,372 --> 00:02:16,052
Useless against you?

29
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,252
You talk tough, Mr. Lin,

30
00:02:18,252 --> 00:02:20,932
but you're secretly
investigating behind Song Zhichu's back.

31
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,852
Aren't you afraid he'll find out?

32
00:02:23,732 --> 00:02:25,092
Are you threatening me?

33
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:27,812
It's not a threat.

34
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:29,692
You and I,

35
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:32,892
husband and wife, working as one.

36
00:02:32,892 --> 00:02:34,812
We can cut through any challenges.

37
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:40,492
Lu Man is coming tomorrow.

38
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:41,972
Work with me and put on a show.

39
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:52,085
Xu Yin, this invitation of yours
is quite elegant.

40
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:53,492
But I do wonder,

41
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:56,572
what kind of ensnaring banquet
you're hosting today?

42
00:02:56,572 --> 00:02:58,332
Liang Yi, stop teasing me.

43
00:02:58,332 --> 00:03:00,092
During those days we spent together,

44
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:02,652
I was just young and impulsive.

45
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:04,560
But after what happened
at the Dai family yesterday,

46
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,172
I finally saw for myself

47
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:08,972
how vicious society ladies can be.

48
00:03:08,972 --> 00:03:10,652
After thinking it over,

49
00:03:10,652 --> 00:03:12,532
out of all the noblewomen in Rong City,

50
00:03:12,532 --> 00:03:14,172
you're the only one who's genuine

51
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:15,292
and worth befriending.

52
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:19,150
You're now the head lady
of the Chengyun Society.

53
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,350
Why bother trying to form
any sisterhood at all?

54
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:23,652
Oh, you don't know the half of it.

55
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:26,372
My marriage might as well not exist.

56
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,692
I spend every day
alone in an empty room,

57
00:03:28,692 --> 00:03:32,372
and I can't tell if my husband is busy
or just pretending to be.

58
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:36,412
You mean...

59
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:38,892
Lin Yun hasn't shared a room with you?

60
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:41,812
I have no one to complain to.

61
00:03:41,812 --> 00:03:43,012
Liang Yi,

62
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:44,532
I keep feeling

63
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:46,652
there's someone else in his heart.

64
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:48,225
Have you ever heard

65
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:50,665
any rumors about him and another woman?

66
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:52,865
How would I know that?

67
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:54,172
However,

68
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:56,772
your husband certainly draws attention.

69
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:59,572
Whether you can
keep an eye on him is up to you.

70
00:04:01,092 --> 00:04:03,012
Keep an eye on him? How?

71
00:04:03,012 --> 00:04:04,212
I'm an orphan girl.

72
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:06,532
I can't help him with anything.

73
00:04:06,532 --> 00:04:08,932
But Lin Yun often tells me

74
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:11,812
that you're not only beautiful,

75
00:04:11,812 --> 00:04:13,452
but come from a wealthy family,

76
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:15,412
and now you've become
head of the Liang family,

77
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:17,812
managing the Liang family business.

78
00:04:17,812 --> 00:04:21,532
Both in life and in business,
you're a huge help to Chief Song.

79
00:04:21,532 --> 00:04:24,012
You're the kind of wife
people rarely find.

80
00:04:24,012 --> 00:04:25,132
He really said that?

81
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:25,812
Yes.

82
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:27,652
As for me,

83
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:30,012
I'd be lucky to match even half of you.

84
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,012
Isn't that Mr. Lin's car?

85
00:04:35,012 --> 00:04:36,772
Since I'm visiting today,

86
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:37,652
I should at least

87
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,652
go greet him properly.

88
00:04:41,172 --> 00:04:43,332
I get terribly bored
at the Chengyun Society.

89
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:45,812
Those boys

90
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:48,132
call me "Sister-in-law", sure,

91
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:50,052
but everyone knows in their hearts

92
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:52,492
I'm only the daughter
of the man who saved Lin Yun.

93
00:04:53,572 --> 00:04:55,452
Liang Yi, if you're willing,

94
00:04:55,452 --> 00:04:57,052
come visit me more often.

95
00:04:57,052 --> 00:04:59,572
We can talk and keep each other company.

96
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:01,572
Of course.

97
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:04,652
Just don't find me annoying later.

98
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:06,252
How could I?

99
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:08,692
I'd be thrilled if you came.

100
00:05:15,452 --> 00:05:16,852
It was here just now.

101
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:19,532
Madam Li.

102
00:05:20,812 --> 00:05:21,812
Fetch Mr. Lin.

103
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:23,227
Yes.

104
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:30,532
Mr. Lin looks like someone
who kills without blinking,

105
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:34,052
yet his room is decorated so tastefully.

106
00:05:34,787 --> 00:05:36,067
Right?

107
00:05:36,332 --> 00:05:37,972
He's no longer the street hooligan

108
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:40,112
who used to trail behind my father.

109
00:05:40,187 --> 00:05:41,587
No wonder he looks down on me now.

110
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:55,812
Madam Song.

111
00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:03,012
What's this?

112
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:07,412
An earring.

113
00:06:07,412 --> 00:06:08,852
I can see it's an earring.

114
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:10,212
I'm asking whose it is.

115
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:11,852
Isn't it yours?

116
00:06:12,692 --> 00:06:13,652
It's not mine.

117
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:15,092
I don't own anything like this.

118
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:18,372
All this time we've been married,
have you ever bought me real jewelry?

119
00:06:18,372 --> 00:06:20,692
It's all cheap gold-plated rubbish.

120
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:21,332
Speak.

121
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:23,652
Which stray woman does this belong to?

122
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,172
You even kept it on you

123
00:06:26,172 --> 00:06:27,692
so you can think about her, right?

124
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:30,612
When we married, you promised

125
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:32,732
you'd only ever have me.

126
00:06:33,452 --> 00:06:35,452
Now you want the company of wives?

127
00:06:35,652 --> 00:06:37,492
If you don't want this marriage,
just say so.

128
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,092
Instead, you keep me
at home as decoration

129
00:06:40,172 --> 00:06:42,452
while you sneak around with some tramp.

130
00:06:43,475 --> 00:06:44,555
Lin Yun,

131
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:46,892
is this how you repay my late father?

132
00:06:46,892 --> 00:06:47,572
Enough.

133
00:06:49,012 --> 00:06:49,812
Liang Yi,

134
00:06:50,012 --> 00:06:51,732
you tell me if I'm wrong.

135
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:54,572
If he doesn't hand over
that woman today,

136
00:06:54,572 --> 00:06:55,372
I...

137
00:06:56,172 --> 00:06:58,572
I'll hang myself
at the Chengyun Society gates!

138
00:06:58,572 --> 00:06:59,252
Xu Yin.

139
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,572
Calm down.

140
00:07:00,572 --> 00:07:01,887
Calm down? How?

141
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,292
Tell me,
how am I supposed to live like this?

142
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:06,057
Maybe

143
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:07,407
this is a misunderstanding.

144
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,450
Look.

145
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:09,735
Let me ask him.

146
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:11,345
Madam Li,

147
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:12,772
take Madam downstairs.

148
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:14,652
Liang Yi, you have to speak up for me.

149
00:07:14,652 --> 00:07:15,572
Don't worry.

150
00:07:15,572 --> 00:07:16,892
Lin Yun, you scoudrel!

151
00:07:16,892 --> 00:07:17,772
You're heartless!

152
00:07:27,972 --> 00:07:28,932
What

153
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:29,732
are you doing?

154
00:07:40,812 --> 00:07:43,892
I lost one of my earrings yesterday.

155
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:47,092
Never thought
I'd find it here with you, Mr. Lin.

156
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:48,772
So, it belongs to you.

157
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:52,972
You helped me again yesterday.

158
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,972
My wife was the one who helped you.

159
00:07:57,892 --> 00:07:59,812
Today, I finally get to see

160
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,732
just how loving you two are.

161
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:05,195
Lin Yun.

162
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:07,675
Appearances are for outsiders.

163
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:09,172
Only you know

164
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:11,025
where your heart really is.

165
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,345
Why bother pretending otherwise?

166
00:08:46,212 --> 00:08:48,652
You're the great Miss Liang.

167
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:51,172
Is sleeping around

168
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:52,452
all you know what to do?

169
00:08:55,092 --> 00:08:57,612
Blame yourself for being too charming.

170
00:08:57,612 --> 00:09:00,132
No wonder Lu Man is obsessed with you.

171
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:02,535
If we're talking about sleeping around,

172
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:05,172
I'm nothing compared
to you and Song Zhichu.

173
00:09:05,172 --> 00:09:07,252
Don't you remember

174
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:08,372
whose bed I woke up in?

175
00:09:11,172 --> 00:09:14,852
The whole city knows you're my wife now.

176
00:09:14,852 --> 00:09:18,772
And you still pushed your own husband
into another woman's arms.

177
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:20,212
You think that's appropriate?

178
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:23,292
I'm only your wife in name.

179
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:24,492
Did you forget?

180
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,372
Funny, you mention that.

181
00:09:28,372 --> 00:09:29,852
You're actually Madam Song.

182
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,932
You and Song Zhichu grew up together.

183
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:33,772
Childhood sweethearts.

184
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:35,452
Practically destined to marry.

185
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,137
So wouldn't seducing Song Zhichu

186
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:42,815
make a lot more sense?

187
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,172
Xu Yin.

188
00:10:01,487 --> 00:10:03,487
Did you ask him for me?

189
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,512
Which woman has he been messing with?

190
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:08,292
Xu Yin,

191
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:09,772
listen to me.

192
00:10:09,772 --> 00:10:11,052
Men

193
00:10:11,052 --> 00:10:12,652
are always going to stray.

194
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:14,812
Turn a blind eye,

195
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:16,612
and life gets a lot easier.

196
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,645
Ling Yi, tell me.

197
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:21,132
Am I really that bad at satisfying him?

198
00:10:21,132 --> 00:10:24,412
Is that why he's messing around outside?

199
00:10:24,412 --> 00:10:26,692
He's been snapping at me
for no reason these days.

200
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,212
Maybe his qi and blood are blocked.

201
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,825
Why don't you take me
to the Liang shop for some herbs?

202
00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:32,425
I'll brew the medicine for him.

203
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:34,175
Maybe then he'll come back to me.

204
00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:38,412
A physical illness is easy to cure,

205
00:10:38,462 --> 00:10:39,972
but the heart is another matter.

206
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:45,252
Come with me then, Xu Yin.

207
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:46,772
Thank you, Liang Yi.

208
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:02,172
You're here.

209
00:11:02,772 --> 00:11:03,692
Miss.

210
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:04,732
What brings you?

211
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:06,412
Are you feeling unwell?

212
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:08,772
I'm the head of the Liang family now.

213
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:09,732
What?

214
00:11:09,732 --> 00:11:11,532
I can't come unless I'm sick?

215
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:13,612
Or are you hoping I fall ill?

216
00:11:16,932 --> 00:11:18,412
I spoke out of turn.

217
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:18,932
Please,

218
00:11:18,932 --> 00:11:19,772
don't be upset.

219
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:22,212
Since you know your mistake,

220
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:23,972
I'll just dock one month's wages.

221
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:26,852
What?

222
00:11:27,532 --> 00:11:28,972
My word doesn't count anymore?

223
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:30,212
No, no.

224
00:11:30,212 --> 00:11:31,812
You're absolutely right.

225
00:11:31,812 --> 00:11:33,452
I'll take the punishment.

226
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:35,372
Much better.

227
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,942
Give Madam Lin
a prescription for qi stagnation.

228
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,840
Yes.

229
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:43,972
Xu Yin, you're impressive.

230
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:48,972
I heard the Liang family has
a very rare specimen of coptis.

231
00:11:48,972 --> 00:11:50,932
Could I have the honor of seeing it?

232
00:11:50,932 --> 00:11:52,012
Why not?

233
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,732
Come with me.

234
00:11:58,762 --> 00:12:01,492
(Liang's Apothecary)

235
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:02,772
Miss, you can't go in there.

236
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:03,692
Move.

237
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,880
I said move.

238
00:12:06,712 --> 00:12:07,512
Manager.

239
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:08,912
Miss insists on entering.

240
00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:09,672
I...

241
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:12,187
Miss. The Young Master gave strict orders.

242
00:12:12,237 --> 00:12:14,532
No one enters the warehouse but him.

243
00:12:15,372 --> 00:12:16,332
Not even me?

244
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,612
Young master said

245
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:18,892
no one must enter.

246
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,550
Please don't make things hard for us.

247
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:23,092
Liang Yi,

248
00:12:23,092 --> 00:12:24,372
forget it.

249
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:27,852
Looks like your husband is the real
master of the Liang family.

250
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,060
What a joke.

251
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:31,052
This is the Liang family's shop.

252
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:32,972
I'm the head of the Liang family.

253
00:12:32,972 --> 00:12:36,012
Song Zhichu is nothing
but a son-in-law.

254
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:37,452
Why should I listen to him?

255
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:39,012
Miss, please don't be angry.

256
00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:40,852
Should I send someone
to fetch the Young Master?

257
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:41,572
No need.

258
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,252
Today, I'm taking charge myself.

259
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:45,172
Move.

260
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:50,612
Inform the Young Master. Now.

261
00:12:50,612 --> 00:12:51,492
Yes.

262
00:12:53,412 --> 00:12:54,452
Go ahead and look around.

263
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:56,347
Thank you, Liang Yi.

264
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,845
I didn't expect
they hid such good stuff in here.

265
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:08,137
I should've come sooner.

266
00:13:19,012 --> 00:13:21,512
(The opium really is
still in the warehouse.)

267
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:25,002
(I'll have to figure out a way
to get the goods out)

268
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:26,412
(through Lu Man.)

269
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:26,932
Miss,

270
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,012
the Young Master is here.

271
00:13:42,612 --> 00:13:43,612
Zhichu.

272
00:13:43,737 --> 00:13:44,937
Chief Song.

273
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,070
It's getting late.

274
00:13:48,732 --> 00:13:50,292
I'll take Madam Lin home.

275
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:56,652
Please.

276
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:06,092
Take care.

277
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:21,972
Madam Lin.

278
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:25,092
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

279
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:28,167
Chief Song, go ahead.

280
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,327
Why

281
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:33,167
did you purposely befriend my wife?

282
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,812
Chief Song, you misunderstood.

283
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:39,537
Madam Song and I hit it off right away.

284
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:42,217
The day Ruyi died,
what did she say to you?

285
00:14:44,412 --> 00:14:47,172
Just nonsense
a desperate woman blurts out.

286
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:48,772
I didn't take it to heart.

287
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,405
Drop the act.

288
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:58,372
At the banquet, you pushed Liang Yi
onstage to embarrass her.

289
00:14:59,212 --> 00:15:01,287
And today,
you pulled off another scheme.

290
00:15:03,412 --> 00:15:05,372
I really did underestimate you.

291
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:08,285
Chief Song, let's talk this out.

292
00:15:08,372 --> 00:15:10,087
Please take your hand off me.

293
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:10,857
What's wrong?

294
00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:13,655
Weren't you from Huaying Brothel?

295
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:16,257
Married Lin Yun for a few days
and already forgot your roots?

296
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:17,875
Chief Song,

297
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,555
show some respect.

298
00:15:19,555 --> 00:15:20,875
I am Lin Yun's wife.

299
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,475
Great.

300
00:15:22,475 --> 00:15:25,772
Let's see if Lin Yun is really willing
to turn against me for a woman like you.

301
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:28,915
Let go.

302
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:40,915
Cursed woman!

303
00:16:28,492 --> 00:16:29,612
