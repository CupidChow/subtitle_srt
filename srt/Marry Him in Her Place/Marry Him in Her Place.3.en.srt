12
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,579
Liu, where do you want these?

13
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,699
To the warehouse.

14
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,499
Stop piling them.

15
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,180
You're turning this place into a dump.

16
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,339
- Sister-in-law.
- Sister-in-law.

17
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,699
Quit yelling for nothing.

18
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,619
Get to work.

19
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,379
Talk less.

20
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,300
Got it.

21
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,099
Liu Xiu.

22
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,219
These wedding invites still aren't out.

23
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,860
You can't just send wedding invites
whenever you feel like it.

24
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,139
In Chengyun Society,

25
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,220
they go out only
when the boss gives the word.

26
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,299
You mean,

27
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,539
you want me to tell people
you're from Huaying Brothel?

28
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,699
Indeed.

29
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,619
I,

30
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,099
I'm Lin Yun's bride-to-be
from Chengyun Society.

31
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,019
Why?

32
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,419
Aren't you worried people will talk?

33
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,019
That's exactly what I want.

34
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,779
The more they gossip, the better.

35
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,099
Best case,

36
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,420
the whole city hears about it.

37
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,499
Chengyun Society? More like a brothel gang.

38
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,580
What did you say?

39
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,419
Lin Yun married a prostitute.

40
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,460
Chengyun Society's just
a brothel gang now.

41
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,060
Exactly.

42
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,740
What're you doing?

43
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,899
Bad news, Xiu.

44
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,180
The goods caught fire.

45
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,019
Find yourself impressive?

46
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,020
Is that it?

47
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,179
You went out brawling
over some trash talk.

48
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,139
And now all the goods are burned.

49
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,740
You turn
Chengyun Society into a laughing stock!

50
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,420
We're not the ones embarrassing us.

51
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,100
What's that supposed to mean?

52
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,699
You should've heard
how mean they sounded.

53
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,219
They said you married a prostitute.

54
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,499
That Chengyun Society
might as well be a brothel gang.

55
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,619
We worked so hard to get here.

56
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,939
You can take it, but we can't.

57
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,860
So that's what you think too?

58
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,979
Yeah, I think that.

59
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,620
But outsiders don't get to say it.

60
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,620
This is how you lead the guys?

61
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,460
Should Chengyun Society
take your surname then?

62
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,500
So you refuse to admit fault?

63
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,260
Then we start with you.

64
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,940
Boss.

65
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,860
No!

66
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,940
This happened because of me.

67
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,179
I should take the punishment.

68
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,460
Save the fake kindness.

69
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,380
I'm not taking your pity.

70
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,619
I'm from Huaying Brothel.

71
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,900
People will talk behind my back.

72
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,299
That's just the truth.

73
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,939
These brothers speak their minds.

74
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,619
They feel bad for their boss.

75
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,139
But if they get punished for this,

76
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,260
that'd dishearten everyone.

77
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,779
This punishment

78
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,620
should be mine.

79
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,380
Do it!

80
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,900
Do it!

81
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,899
Wedding or not, that's not important.

82
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,139
We're brothers in Chengyun Society.

83
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,259
We can drink among ourselves.

84
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,979
Have a good time.

85
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,900
That's enough.

86
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,940
What say the others?

87
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,739
Sister-in-law.

88
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,339
If anyone dares talk nonsense again,
I'll rip his mouth off.

89
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,379
We were wrong.

90
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,819
We were wrong.

91
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,139
Chengyun Society's sister-in-law

92
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,459
is not a shameful person!

93
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,180
Not a shameful person!

94
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,220
I crawled out of the mud
and darkness myself.

95
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,060
Why would I fear a few filthy words?

96
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,179
Our wedding isn't just happening.

97
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,980
It's going to be grand.

98
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,620
Invite the most honored guests.

99
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,300

102
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,260
