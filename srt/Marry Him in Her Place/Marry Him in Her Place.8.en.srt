smoke opium every day.)

(And it's all thanks to your father.)

Things are tight lately.

16
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,099

If you see a stranger,

18
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,340
don't let them go.

00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,980
You, at the door.

20
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,700
Bring that opium paste inside.

21
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,579
Little witch.

22
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,660
Liu Kui?

23
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,700
I'd recognize those eyes of yours
even if you turned to ashes!

24
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,099
- What are you doing?
- You made me less of a man.

25
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,499
I'll make you pay with your life!

26
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,339
Let go.

27
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,140
Let go of me.

28
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,780
Let go of me.

29
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,860
What's going on in there?

30
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,459
Say...

31
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,260
Be gentle.

32
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,660
Gentle.

33
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,820
Easy, Mr. Kui.

34
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,099
Mr. Kui,

35
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,074
what's going on?

36
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:45,835
Get out.

37
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,900
Thank you, Mr. Kui.

38
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,539
Darn it. He knows how to have fun.

39
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,961
Treating an opium den like a brothel.

40
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:56,939
Liu Kui doesn't even
have his parts anymore,

41
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,060
and he's still that fired up.

42
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,059
Mr. Lin, you really know the act.

43
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,700
You play it
like you've done it for years.

44
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,859
Just that?

45
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,420
And you think you can be my blade?

46
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,019
Wait.

47
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,939
That build...

48
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,739
That's not Liu Kui!

49
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,620
Move!

50
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,099
Mr. Kui is dead!

51
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,019
Go after them!

52
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,459
Go!

53
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,220
Go!

54
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,299
(Why does the opium paste
smell so familiar?)

55
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,699
(I have to figure out)

56
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,420
(what's really going on.)

57
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,860

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,936

70
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,500
Wulingzhi.

00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,060
Why does it smell like wulingzhi?

72
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,620
Wulingzhi…

73
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,300
Only the Liang's Apothecary
has wulingzhi in the whole city.

74
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,739
Impossible.

75
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,219
My father would never do this.

76
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,379
Impossible!

77
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,539
Why not?

78
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,960
You said it yourself.

79
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,739
The opium must have come into the city
mixed with your Liang family's herbs.

80
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,739
Besides,

81
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,939
this stuff makes a fortune.

82
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,939
It's only natural that your father
was chasing profit.

83
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,860
I told you my father
would never do something so cruel!

84
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,099
It was Song Zhichu.

85
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,059
It has to be Song Zhichu.

86
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,420
I'm going to report him.

87
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,580
Report him?

88
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,860
And how would you report him?

89
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,499
Song Ming

90
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,739
is the mayor of Rong City.

91
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,160
With all the awful things
Song Zhichu has done over the years,

92
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,860
his father has always looked away.

93
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,140
Now that Song Ming is running
for provincial chairman,

94
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,540
he'll clean up everything for him.

95
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,699
Besides,

96
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,020
do you trust your father that much?

97
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,020
Why did he marry you off
to Song Zhichu?

98
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,300
Have you ever wondered?

99
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,059
(If the mastermind
really is Song Zhichu,)

100
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,436
(the opium den owner must have proof.)

101
00:06:06,437 --> 00:06:09,219
(If I can get my hands on it,)

102
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,420
(I can clear my father's name.)

103
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,699
You mean

104
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,459
they mixed the opium

105
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,060
into the wulingzhi?

106
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,019
But we checked the Liang herbs.
We never found anything.

107
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,780
They disguised it as an ointment.

108
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,740
What's this invitation?

109
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,780
A Dai family banquet. They invited you,
Song Zhichu, and his wife.

110
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,380
I'm not going.

111
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,980
Of course you're going.

112
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,060
It's a perfect chance
to break this stalemate.

113
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,659
Song Zhichu's opium must still be
in the Liang warehouse.

114
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,379
He'll never let us in.

115
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,299
However,

116
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,220
there's someone who will.

117
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,940
Lu Man.

118
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,739
You just slapped her.

119
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,299
You really think she'll take you inside?

120
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,859
That Dai lady

121
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,579
is the type who'll repay
even the smallest slight.

122
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,739
Aren't you the one who writes plays?

123
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,019
Tell me.

124
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,939
In this next act,

125
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,460
how should the story go?

126
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,459
Come, come.

127
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,340
Make yourselves at home.
Let's begin.

128
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,700
Careful with your sleeve.

129
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:34,477
Ah.

130
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,980
This bracelet looks quite precious.

131
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,385
Madam Lin, you have good eyes.

132
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,779
This jade bracelet

133
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,060
was a token of love
my husband gave me back then.

134
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,900
Madam Dai and Mr. Dai's love
really makes others envious.

135
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,580
Ah!

136
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,140
The bracelet!

137
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,899
I didn't...

138
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,740
Please don't be upset, Madam Dai.
She definitely didn't mean it.

139
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,849
Rumor has it that

140
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,540
after Madam Song married Chief Song,
their love isn't what it used to be.

141
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,979
But even so,

142
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,580
there's no need
to resent other couples being happy.

143
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,059
Chief Song is right here.

144
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,139
It's just a bracelet.

145
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,380
I'll find you
an even better one another day.

146
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,300
Please don't take offense, Chief Song.
Women don't always watch their tongues.

147
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,699
Madam Dai,

148
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,140
my apologies.

149
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,179
(The firewood is ready.)

150
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,140
(Time to fan the flames.)

151
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,579
Good music and good dancing,

152
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,779
both pleasing to the eyes and ears.

153
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,939
I heard Madam Dai studied abroad.

154
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,060
You must dance Western styles well.

155
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,179
I manage.

156
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,660
Madam Dai's tango is legendary
in the foreign concessions.

157
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,580
But if we're talking about breathtaking,

158
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,600
Madam Song's “Evening Primrose”
at the Governor's Mansion back then

159
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,470
even had the French consul entranced.

160
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,579
Since the topic has come this far,

161
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,259
why don't Madam Song and I
dance together today

162
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,020
and see how we compare?

163
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,699
Rather than a comparison,

164
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,579
let's say it's for everyone's enjoyment.

165
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,540
No need to be shy.

166
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,460
(The real show begins.)

167
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,979
Madam Song,

168
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,659
did you learn your steps
from a village troupe?

169
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,779
I hurt my leg before.

170
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,236
I haven't danced in a long time.

171
00:10:45,237 --> 00:10:46,379
Madam Dai,

172
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,286
my apologies.

173
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:48,859
I see.

174
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,740
You...

175
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,099
Madam Song's dancing

176
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,539
has really

177
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,820
opened my eyes.

178
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,099
Watching them dance
is making me eager to join in.

179
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,979
Why don't we take a turn too?

180
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,460
What are you planning?

181
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,979
Helping her out, of course.

182
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,500
Only then will she open up to us.

183
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,140
Let's go.

184
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,180
You helped me again.

185
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,699
If this situation continues,

186
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,180
you could be offending the Song family.

187
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,020
Wait for me.

188
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,019
Madam, what a move.

189
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,374
First, you use me as a weapon,

190
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,499
then you use me as bait,

191
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,899
letting your husband charm
your ex-husband's wife.

192
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,819
Does the method matter?

193
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,099
In times like these,

194
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,820
survival is what matters.

195
00:13:21,787 --> 00:13:23,257
Where's my earring?

196
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,716
Can't you be a little smarter next time?

197
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:28,516
We almost got exposed today, you know?

198
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,374
You didn't come to my help either.

199
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,124
If you can't dance,

200
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,920
simply make up an excuse!

201
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,100
Stay away from Xu Yin from now on.

202
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,499
(Lin Yun,)

203
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,660
(Don't blame me.)

204
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:14,736
(You've been too useful.)

205
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:16,074
What are you

206
00:14:16,075 --> 00:14:17,220
