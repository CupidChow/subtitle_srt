11

=Episode 14=

12
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,391
Anything else?

13
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:21,312
Boss, I really can't figure out
what happened tonight.

14
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:23,592
Wasn't Auntie killed by Song Ming?

15
00:01:23,632 --> 00:01:26,112
Since your goal is to take revenge
on the Song family,

16
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,031
even if you want to protect yourself,

17
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:30,361
you didn't have to actually
hand everything to Song Ming.

18
00:01:30,362 --> 00:01:31,149
Isn't that basically

19
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,350
helping him sit
in the provincial chairman's seat?

20
00:01:33,487 --> 00:01:34,607
Let me ask you.

21
00:01:35,072 --> 00:01:37,751
Back then, when Song Ming followed
Master Jin to take Jiangzhou,

22
00:01:37,752 --> 00:01:40,751
why is it that after Master Jin
became the Jiangzhou commander,

23
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:42,871
he only gave Song Ming
a mayor's position,

24
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:44,592
with no military power at all?

25
00:01:46,737 --> 00:01:49,099
Song Ming's ambition was too obvious.

26
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,420
Master Jin had long started
guarding against him.

27
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:55,231
Because Song Ming wasn't satisfied
with just being mayor,

28
00:01:55,232 --> 00:01:59,112
he secretly went behind Jin's back
and got involved in the opium business.

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,199
But tell me,

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,120
do you really think Song Ming would be
satisfied with those petty gains?

31
00:02:05,872 --> 00:02:07,791
He's such a greedy man.

32
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:08,791
So,

33
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:10,351
what he truly wants

34
00:02:10,352 --> 00:02:13,274
is definitely not that
empty "provincial chairman" title.

35
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:15,111
Now that I'm helping him
as an opportunity,

36
00:02:15,112 --> 00:02:16,751
I can both earn his trust

37
00:02:16,752 --> 00:02:20,861
and find a way to discover
what exactly he's planning.

38
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:22,271
Killing two birds with one stone.

39
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:23,391
As expected of you, Boss.

40
00:02:23,392 --> 00:02:25,352
You always see things
more clearly than I do.

41
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:30,871
And as for Madam Lin.

42
00:02:30,872 --> 00:02:32,351
If you hesitate like this,

43
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,952
you'll never win a girl's heart.

44
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:35,911
None of your business.

45
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:37,032
Go to sleep.

46
00:02:40,672 --> 00:02:41,871
Looks like

47
00:02:41,872 --> 00:02:44,752
this strategist will have
to step in myself.

48
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:58,231
Madam.

49
00:02:58,232 --> 00:03:00,511
How was the food today?

50
00:03:00,512 --> 00:03:01,471
Your cooking

51
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,992
rivals the chefs at Xianhe Restaurant.

52
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:12,151
Madam Li, is there something
you want to tell me?

53
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:13,472
No, nothing.

54
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:15,272
Madam, you eat first.

55
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,874
I just suddenly felt a bit sorry
for Mr. Lin.

56
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,591
That child

57
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:30,899
didn't have a father or mother
to love him.

58
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,871
He had to fend for himself
at such a young age.

59
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:34,951
He's suffered quite a lot.

60
00:03:34,952 --> 00:03:38,752
What he lacks most is someone
who cares for him.

61
00:03:42,232 --> 00:03:42,871
Madam.

62
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:44,191
You might not know this,

63
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:45,991
I used to run a wonton stall.

64
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,072
For a while,

65
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:56,671
Mr. Lin is someone who's cold
on the outside but warm inside.

66
00:03:56,672 --> 00:04:00,631
These years, although he seems
successful on the surface,

67
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:04,391
he's actually very lonely inside.

68
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:07,031
- If only someone could accompany him...
- Madam Li.

69
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:08,191
I'm done eating.

70
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:09,791
Please clean up.

71
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:10,591
Madam.

72
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:11,911
I'm not finished talking yet.

73
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:12,511
Madam.

74
00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:15,072
Have a few more bites, Madam.

75
00:04:23,912 --> 00:04:26,999
Hao, do you remember three years ago,

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,631
when Boss charged alone

77
00:04:28,632 --> 00:04:30,436
into that human traffickers' hideout

78
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,872
to help Aunt Zhang next door
find her grandson?

79
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:34,471
Of course I remember.

80
00:04:34,472 --> 00:04:35,674
How could I forget?

81
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,211
Boss went in alone.

82
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:40,591
By the time we arrived,
he had already finished off everyone.

83
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:42,432
Boss was even stabbed that time.

84
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,461
Poor guy lay in bed

85
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:45,831
for a whole week.

86
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:47,711
Only then could he get out of bed.

87
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:49,591
Good thing Boss has a strong body.

88
00:04:49,592 --> 00:04:50,391
Otherwise,

89
00:04:50,392 --> 00:04:52,474
17 stab wounds...

90
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:53,711
If they'd been on me,

91
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:55,152
I'd have died long ago.

92
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,111
Biggie.

93
00:04:58,112 --> 00:04:59,386
Do you remember that incident?

94
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:00,387
Which one?

95
00:05:03,872 --> 00:05:07,751
Otherwise he would've met
the King Yama.

96
00:05:07,752 --> 00:05:09,191
Who wouldn't say so?

97
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:11,351
Boss has been fighting all these years,

98
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,911
all relying on his sharp mind

99
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:15,512
and exceptional skills.

100
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:21,551
Madam Lin.

101
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:22,992
- What a coincidence.
- Yeah.

102
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:26,071
I told Madam

103
00:05:26,072 --> 00:05:28,751
that our boss is cold outside
but warm inside,

104
00:05:28,752 --> 00:05:30,151
brave and mighty.

105
00:05:30,152 --> 00:05:31,431
Madam believed everything.

106
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,832
Mission overachieved.

107
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:35,112
Not bad.

108
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:38,471
Here, this is for you.

109
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,352
Thank you, Liu.

110
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:42,831
Liu.

111
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:44,192
Look at this.

112
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:52,671
What are you doing?

113
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:54,071
Say something.

114
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:56,472
What heroic deeds did you tell Madam Lin
about our boss?

115
00:05:57,192 --> 00:05:58,112
Cat got your tongue?

116
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:02,911
Boss, Madam Lin.

117
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:04,591
Why is it you two?

118
00:06:04,592 --> 00:06:05,712
It's okay.

119
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,591
I just wanted to come take a look

120
00:06:07,592 --> 00:06:10,071
smart and quick-witted,
great at fighting,

121
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:12,991
Cold outside but warm inside,
yet lonely and without support,

122
00:06:12,992 --> 00:06:14,831
a lonely heart,

123
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:18,191
the pitiful yet admirable leader
of Chengyun Society, Mr. Lin Yun,

124
00:06:18,192 --> 00:06:20,312
what else don't I know?

125
00:06:21,412 --> 00:06:22,692
Don't laugh.

126
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,072
Why are you laughing?

127
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:30,871
I just realized

128
00:06:30,872 --> 00:06:32,552
you're quite humorous.

129
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,431
Have you been too free lately?

130
00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:38,911
No, no.

131
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:40,632
Come on, let's go.

132
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:51,671
Sorry.

133
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:53,072
I didn't know about this.

134
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,089
I saw it last time
when I helped you apply medicine.

135
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,057
All those knife wounds were
from the past few years.

136
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:04,112
Does it still hurt?

137
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,345
It stopped hurting long ago.

138
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:08,072
You...

139
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:10,592
Feel sorry for me?

140
00:07:11,352 --> 00:07:12,472
I...

141
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:28,311
So?

142
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:29,752
My trick worked, right?

143
00:07:31,272 --> 00:07:33,192
What kind of gifts do women usually like?

144
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:35,751
You finally asked the right person.

145
00:07:35,752 --> 00:07:37,152
Cut the crap, hurry up.

146
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:39,351
Simply put, one sentence,

147
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:40,711
only kids make choices.

148
00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:42,311
Adults

149
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:43,432
want everything.

150
00:07:57,312 --> 00:07:58,512
How about this set?

151
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:00,311
Looks good.

152
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,552
You didn't even look
and you said it looks good.

153
00:08:04,592 --> 00:08:06,591
Much better than the previous one.

154
00:08:06,592 --> 00:08:08,551
No, Boss.

155
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:11,299
What's the difference between the two?

156
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,340
See? That's why I say you
have no fashion sense.

157
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:16,751
Boss.

158
00:08:16,752 --> 00:08:19,671
Do you have some important event today?

159
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:20,751
No.

160
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:22,712
Then you must be meeting
someone important.

161
00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:25,512
No.

162
00:08:27,437 --> 00:08:28,631
Boss.

163
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:29,752
Boss.

164
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:32,312
This one looks nice, try it on.

165
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:01,752
Morning, darling.

166
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:03,672
Morning.

167
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,672
Liu Xiu made it.

168
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,872
I made it?

169
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:43,952
Thank you.

170
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:45,312
You're welcome.

171
00:09:50,552 --> 00:09:51,431
Boss.

172
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:54,392
You look like a peacock
showing off right now.

173
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:56,312
Do I?

174
00:09:58,012 --> 00:09:59,071
Pretty handsome, actually.

175
00:09:59,072 --> 00:10:00,712
I'll walk myself.

176
00:10:06,832 --> 00:10:08,231
Where are you taking me?

177
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,432
Shopping.

178
00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:11,432
Sit tight.

179
00:10:13,352 --> 00:10:14,472
Start the car.

180
00:10:23,752 --> 00:10:24,672
Boss.

181
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:26,751
Sir, Madam, welcome.

182
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,951
Bring out the best items in your shop.

183
00:10:28,952 --> 00:10:29,831
They're all here.

184
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:31,591
Lin Yun, what are you trying to do?

185
00:10:31,592 --> 00:10:32,912
Buy you clothes.

186
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,591
The leader of Chengyun Society's woman

187
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,272
wearing those few shabby outfits
every day, so pathetic.

188
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:38,720
I can't bring myself to show you off.

189
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,391
If you won't choose, I'll choose.

190
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:42,751
Not this one, this one's out.

191
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:43,431
The rest,

192
00:10:43,432 --> 00:10:44,631
according to her size,

193
00:10:44,632 --> 00:10:45,431
bring one of each.

194
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:46,992
Alright, please wait.

195
00:10:52,462 --> 00:10:54,457
(Linglong Pavilion Rouge Shop)

196
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:57,357
(Linglong Pavilion Rouge Shop)

197
00:11:07,432 --> 00:11:09,552
Boss.

198
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:11,752
We really can't buy any more.

199
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:12,751
If we keep buying,

200
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:14,592
I'm going to die.

201
00:11:14,712 --> 00:11:16,151
Then that's it for today.

202
00:11:16,152 --> 00:11:16,992
Let's go.

203
00:11:17,432 --> 00:11:18,952
I knew I shouldn't have talked so much.

204
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:26,072
Hello, Boss, Madam.

205
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:30,911
Mr. Lin is here again.

206
00:11:30,912 --> 00:11:32,552
Madam Lin didn't get drunk
this time, right?

207
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:36,511
Today, everyone's Puyuan Pastries

208
00:11:36,512 --> 00:11:38,551
will be paid for by our boss.

209
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:40,992
Thank you, Madam Lin.

210
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:46,231
This is too much.

211
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:47,191
Just take it.

212
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:50,272
But this Puyuan Pastries must
stay open, understand?

213
00:11:51,575 --> 00:11:52,471
Pack two for me.

214
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:53,512
Alright.

215
00:11:58,672 --> 00:11:59,751
Here.

216
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:00,872
Come often.

217
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:02,552
Let's go.

218
00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:04,072
Where now?

219
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:06,192
Xianhe Restaurant.

220
00:12:10,592 --> 00:12:12,872
Sending off Boss and Madam.

221
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:24,552
Eat quickly, it won't taste good
when it gets cold.

222
00:12:27,552 --> 00:12:30,112
I don't know if these dishes
suit your taste.

223
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:34,471
Lin Yun, can we talk?

224
00:12:34,472 --> 00:12:36,271
What's wrong?

225
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:38,272
Is the food not good?

226
00:12:43,952 --> 00:12:45,672
All this today,

227
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:48,231
what does it mean?

228
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:50,231
What do you mean what does it mean?

229
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:53,352
Is there a problem with me taking
my wife shopping?

230
00:12:58,272 --> 00:13:00,151
I'm not your wife.

231
00:13:00,152 --> 00:13:01,992
If you're not my wife, then who is?

232
00:13:07,592 --> 00:13:09,751
The one who married you was Xu Yin,

233
00:13:09,752 --> 00:13:11,472
not me.

234
00:13:13,952 --> 00:13:18,192
What does who you are have
to do with how I treat you?

235
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:21,271
About the ledger,

236
00:13:21,272 --> 00:13:23,351
I would've done the same for anyone.

237
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:25,392
I hope you won't misunderstand.

238
00:13:26,952 --> 00:13:29,472
I never had romantic feelings for you.

239
00:13:30,472 --> 00:13:31,591
From beginning to end,

240
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:34,152
I've only been a woman
using someone else's identity.

241
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:36,046
We agreed from the start.

242
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:38,127
It was just a cooperation.

243
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:42,391
Once I get my revenge,

244
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:44,071
and you achieve your goal,

245
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:47,032
there will be no ties left between us.

246
00:13:58,592 --> 00:14:00,392
I'm telling you this today

247
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:03,072
because I don't want you
to fall too deep.
