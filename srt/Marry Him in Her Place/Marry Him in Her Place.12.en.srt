13
00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:22,115
Why?

14
00:01:22,912 --> 00:01:24,552
What are you referring to?

15
00:01:27,592 --> 00:01:29,392
Aren't we on the same side?

16
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:33,992
Do you really want to stand with me?

17
00:01:34,752 --> 00:01:36,432
We're both sharp enough to know better.

18
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:38,967
There's no point in pretending.

19
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:40,724

why.

21
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,370
Your problem

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,120
is that you're impatient

23
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:53,111
and you act hastily.

24
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:55,151
I'm not here to listen to nonsense.

25
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:57,352

how I got that scar?

(Five years ago,
turning over a new leaf)

28
00:02:16,062 --> 00:02:18,311
Congratulations on your appointment,
Chief Song.

29
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:20,152
This is just a little something from me.

30
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:25,652
Leave him to me.

31
00:02:34,472 --> 00:02:36,311

He cursed me, not you.

35
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:42,112
Move aside.

36
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,992
It's fine.

37
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:52,924
Just admit it.

38
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:54,325
You'll suffer less.

39
00:03:00,352 --> 00:03:03,432
You must think you're invincible.

40
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:06,211
All right.

41
00:03:06,212 --> 00:03:08,012
I'll play with you.

Come on.

00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,072
Let's see how long you can hold out.

44
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:56,992
So you were that mangy mutt back then.

45
00:04:01,587 --> 00:04:04,707
What will it take for you
to hand over the ledger?

46
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,786
Chief Song,
you still don't get me, do you?

47
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:10,620
I don't want anything.

48
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:13,142
I just want

49
00:04:13,872 --> 00:04:16,072
to drag you down.

is suspected of smuggling opium.

52
00:04:26,952 --> 00:04:28,471
Arrest him at once.

53
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:29,574
Anyone who resists

54
00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:31,255
will be shot on the spot.

55
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,270
I dare you!

56
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:49,391
You're as despicable as ever,

57
00:04:49,392 --> 00:04:50,632
Chief Song.

58
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,392
You couldn't beat me back then.

59
00:04:54,612 --> 00:04:56,220
And you still can't.

60

Men.

61
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,780
Take him away.

62
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:06,352
