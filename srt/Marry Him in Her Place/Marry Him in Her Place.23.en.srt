Lin Yun,

88
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:23,692
and you get what you want,

00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:27,251

00:05:29,572 --> 00:05:31,331

your own boundaries.)

95
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:38,692
even for a moment, truly cared for me?

96
00:05:38,892 --> 00:05:40,291
I'm sorry, Lin Yun.

97
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:42,331
My choice is

98
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:43,852
to let you go.

99
00:05:46,452 --> 00:05:49,251

00:05:53,762 --> 00:05:56,082
(why does my heart hurt so much?)

103
00:05:57,692 --> 00:06:01,931
(It feels like it's being
torn apart alive.)

104
00:06:01,932 --> 00:06:05,491

105
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:07,852
(What am I supposed to do?)

106
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,811

that I would definitely acknowledge

00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:08,645
Weren't you afraid I'd fall
into utter despair and only seek death?

131
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:12,127
You wouldn't.

132
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,110
You would only hate me.

133
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:16,131
The more you hate me,

134
00:09:16,132 --> 00:09:19,172

135
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,905
Why are you so foolish?

136
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,490
Foolish enough to think I'd really
bear to take revenge on you?

137
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,372
I think you bore it just fine.

138
00:09:28,132 --> 00:09:29,572
That day at the Song Residence,

139
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,424
you asked me if I was also acting.

140
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:34,424
Song Ming was right outside the door.
Did you know?

141
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:36,293
You almost got me killed.

142
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,352
But at the moment you asked me,

143
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:43,005
my heart warmed.

144
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:46,632
Because it made me feel
that you still trusted me.

145
00:09:49,437 --> 00:09:51,061
So everything you did

146
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:52,807
was to deceive Song Ming?

147
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,495
Why?

148
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,762
Song Ming has been secretly colluding
with Yunzhou for a long time.

149
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:01,120
The opium was merely

150
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,412
one of the channels he used
to funnel benefits to Yunzhou.

151
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,190
What he wants is Yunzhou's
military force,

152
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:08,657
to help him seize Jiangzhou.

153
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:12,451
So you helped him amass money quickly

154
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:15,070
just to push him into rebellion?

155
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,245
Yes.

156
00:10:16,892 --> 00:10:19,261
But what if he really succeeded
in taking Jiangzhou?

157
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:20,632
He won't succeed.

158
00:10:20,972 --> 00:10:22,611
Did you really think

159
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:24,920
I'd hand that money to Yunzhou?

160
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,651
What I wanted

161
00:10:26,652 --> 00:10:29,520
was merely proof
of his exposed ambition.

162
00:10:33,212 --> 00:10:34,532
Lin Yun,

163
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:36,772
promise me,

164
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:41,047
let me deliver the final blow.

165
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:45,091
The one who killed my father

166
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:46,732
was Song Ming.

167
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:34,172
Yi.

168
00:11:50,362 --> 00:11:51,602
Having porridge again?

169
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:53,532
Again?

170
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:02,449
Last time after we had porridge,
we separated.

171
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,182
This time the flavor is different.

172
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:17,292
You're like a dog.

173
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,600
If you run off again,

174
00:12:22,732 --> 00:12:23,324
I'll...

175
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,165
Are you bringing the chain
to lock me to the bed?

176
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,532
Would you bear to?

177
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:31,651
Then swear it

178
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:33,012
that you'll never leave me again.

179
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:34,891
Alright.

180
00:12:34,892 --> 00:12:36,172
I swear.

181
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:38,091
Unless...

182
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,371
Unless I die.

00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:40,449
Liang Yi.

00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,245
I was just joking.

185
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,931
I promise you,

186
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:45,799
I'll live until all our teeth fall out,

187
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,707
and I'll keep pestering you, alright?

188
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:15,752
Why must you go to Yunzhou?

189
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:18,661
If I don't go,

190
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:20,262
Song Ming will grow suspicious.

191
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,020
What if Marshal Jin finds out?

192
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:26,932
This is the arrangement
between me and Marshal Jin.

193
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,585
You still need to stay cautious.

194
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,091
When I left the Song Residence,

195
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:34,451
did Song Ming get suspicious?

196
00:13:34,452 --> 00:13:35,692
No.

197
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:38,549
I told him I had you locked up
by my side

198
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,107
and was torturing you hard.

199
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,812
When are you leaving?

200
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:51,092
The afternoon boat.

201
00:13:55,092 --> 00:13:56,720
Come with me to a place.

202
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:02,824
This fabric suits me.

203
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:04,225
I'll make you a summer shirt.

204
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:06,485
Madam, you truly have good taste.

205
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:09,652
The collar needs silver
cloud embroidery.

206
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:10,972
Noted.

207
00:14:13,692 --> 00:14:16,012
The waist shouldn't be made too wide.

208
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:17,412
You can do this too?

209
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:21,332
I used to measure
all my father's clothes.

210
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,040
Madam, please look here.

211
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:25,491
Spring silk.

212
00:14:25,492 --> 00:14:26,571
Summer gauze.

213
00:14:26,572 --> 00:14:27,571
Autumn velvet.

214
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:28,531
Winter fur.

215
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:29,891
All are here.

216
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:31,931
Yunzhou is spring all year round.

217
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:34,371
You've prepared clothes
for all four seasons.

218
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:36,172
What is all this for?

219
00:14:41,692 --> 00:14:43,571
You wear those black suits all the time.

220
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:44,531
I'm sick of seeing them.

221
00:14:44,532 --> 00:14:46,612
Naturally, these are for you
to wear in the future.

222
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:49,852
I should go.

223
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,832
Be good and wait for me to come back.

224
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:08,570
Safe travels.

225
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:25,292
Mr. Lin.

226
00:15:25,372 --> 00:15:27,680
Governor Song ordered that you
don't need to go to Yunzhou.

227
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,291
Please come with us.

228
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:31,972
Let's go.

229
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:44,971
What are you doing?

230
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:46,451
No need to go to Yunzhou.

231
00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:47,771
Good son.

232
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:49,131
Don't worry about it.

233
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:50,931
Yunzhou's troops have already
entered Rong City.

234
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:52,331
Too bad.

235
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:54,172
Your performance failed.

236
00:15:57,812 --> 00:15:59,674
You said you were going
to Yunzhou in my place.

237
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:01,899
Were you planning to take my life?

238
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,131
Tell me, was ancestral grave
of the Song family chosen wrong?

239
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:08,091
One son reckless and stupid at birth,

240
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,731
and then you,

241
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:11,291
a dagger hidden at the end.

242
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:14,492
Scheming every day to kill your old man.

243
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:20,732
You hid something inside the banner.
Don't think I don't know.

244
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:23,251
(Proof)

245
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:26,451
With this proof,
come to Chengyun Society in a month,

246
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,724
and reclaim all the property
on the donation agreement.

247
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:29,852
The deeds.

248
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:36,851
One month.

249
00:16:36,852 --> 00:16:39,611
You calculated it perfectly.

250
00:16:39,612 --> 00:16:41,761
You're waiting for me to be dead,

251
00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:43,449
then return everything to you.

252
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,011
Will Yunzhou give it back to you?

253
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:48,571
When their troops surround Jiangzhou,

254
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:50,411
do you think they'll agree?

255
00:16:50,412 --> 00:16:51,972
Who will surround it?

256
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,511
Your Chengyun Society?

257
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:55,832
Tell me, who?

258
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:58,172
A treacherous minister
starts a rebellion,

259
00:16:58,692 --> 00:17:00,011
who will suppress it?

260
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:03,052
So you've already colluded
with Marshal Jin in secret.

261
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,925
Planning to join forces to eliminate me.

262
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,371
Cruel enough.

263
00:17:11,372 --> 00:17:13,531
A small-time gangster like you,

264
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,851
Marshal Jin is probably
being played by you as well.

265
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:19,691
You want to borrow someone else's knife

266
00:17:19,692 --> 00:17:21,892
to kill your own father, right?

267
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:23,531
It seems

268
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:26,092
you are even more ruthless than Zhichu.

269
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:32,411
Tell me, what have I been
fighting for half my life?

270
00:17:32,412 --> 00:17:34,052
What's the point?

271
00:17:36,692 --> 00:17:37,932
Meaningless.

272
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:41,611
Even if I become Marshal,

273
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:44,092
no one will take the position
of Young Marshal.

274
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:46,492
Marshal?

275
00:17:48,452 --> 00:17:50,812
You think you deserve it?

276
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:55,371
Why did the Marshal's position
go to Jin back then,

277
00:17:55,372 --> 00:17:56,331
and not you?

278
00:17:56,332 --> 00:17:57,891
You really don't know?

279
00:17:57,892 --> 00:17:59,361
You didn't even dare
raise your own troops.

280
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:01,971
You paid Yunzhou to buy soldiers.

281
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:04,852
Aren't you afraid they'll swallow
you whole later?

282
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:07,451
You let your son kill and burn for you,

283
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:09,851
and when he died, you called him stupid.

284
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:11,452
Song Ming.

285
00:18:12,037 --> 00:18:15,677
Your dream of being Marshal
is utterly ridiculous.

286
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:17,772
Shut up!

287
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:23,351
(Presented to Mr. Wang
Jiangzhou Honorary Citizen)

288
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,682
(Good Man of Rong City
By Lin Yun of Chengyun Society)

289
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,411
Song Ming already sent the money
to Yunzhou long ago.

290
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:32,092
They say Yunzhou's troops
have entered Rong City.

291
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:35,807
Any news of Lin Yun and Song Ming?

292
00:18:36,172 --> 00:18:37,852
The boss's life or death is unknown.

293
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:40,651
Break in!

294
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:44,051
Rescue the boss!

295
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:46,371
Song Ming won't fight to the death.

296
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:49,211
He's not that determined.

297
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,331
Everyone.

298
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:51,331
Follow me.

299
00:18:51,332 --> 00:18:53,052
Yes, Madam Lin.

300
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:56,132
