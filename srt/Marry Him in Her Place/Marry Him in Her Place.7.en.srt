=Episode 7=

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,480
What happened?

13
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,935
Madam Lin really has
her heart set on you.

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,119
She can't even
leave you alone for a minute.

15
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,479
When she went out to look for you,

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,440
the mahjong table collapsed
when she bumped into it.

17
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,680
It hurts.

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,519
Why not have
the family doctor check you out?

19
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,679
You could have a fracture.

20
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,800
Never mind.

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,800
We'll take our leave.

22
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,199
Why did you bring me here?

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,760
To let you enjoy a good show.

24
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,032
(Wedding)

25
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:19,675
Madam, do you know

26
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,639
what actors fear most onstage?

27
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,599
Most people think it's messing up lines
or missing their mark.

28
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,880
Wrong.

29
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,039
It's the audience.

30
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,119
The ones who can't tell
the show from real life.

31
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,960
People like you.

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,439
When you watch "Twin Fates",

33
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,520
are you sure you won't
get carried away?

34
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,159
A beautiful moment
wasted on the wrong person.

35
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,359
A heart given to the wrong man.

36
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,240
Does this wedding scene

37
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,399
look familiar to you?

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:59,440
A hatred so deep
you can't even put it into words.

39
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,039
A stolen life
never truly belongs to you.

40
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,040
And on the road
to the underworld, no one cares.

41
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,360
This is the unfaithful-man routine.

42
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,480
Do you still know it by heart?

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,039
It's just a story.

44
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,400
Why take it seriously?

45
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,680
What's the hurry?

46
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,160
The good part's just starting.

47
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,080
Take a guess. Where do you think
his next blade will land?

48
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,679
You know your theater.

49
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,919
Why not become a storyteller?

50
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,239
Nice idea.

51
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,080
I'll perhaps write something
like "The Substitute Bride",

52
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,039
a lonely ghost
stealing someone else's life.

53
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,039
What do you think?

54
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,199
Where's all that deep love
supposed to be?

55
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,679
It's nothing but fake affection

56
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,600
at the cost of a life!

57
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,559
Why panic?

58
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,439
The show is getting so good,

59
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,960
and you're not watching anymore?

60
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,519
Who stands before the court?

61
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,439
A woman of the Liang family
from Rong City.

62
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,519
I ask you this.

63
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,559
Why do you refuse to reincarnate?

64
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,999
I was wronged.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,599
I was abandoned by a faithless man.

66
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,239
He even dragged my father to his death.

67
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,920
I carry that guilt.

68
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,599
Bold of you, girl.

69
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,559
You forced yourself
into someone else's body.

70
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,639
You should climb the Mountain of Blades

71
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,159
and boil in the Oil Cauldron.

72
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,279
If I can take my revenge,

73
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,760
I will gladly never be reborn.

74
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,439
Have some tea and breathe.

75
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,120
Madam Xu Yin.

76
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,679
I don't like bitter tea.

77
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,960
Bitter?

78
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,559
This tea is called "Soulcaller".

79
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,720
It cures the habit
of playing deaf and mute.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,982
(Book of Life and Death)

81
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:31,586
(Book of Life and Death)

82
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:33,591
(Liang Wenbin. Stabbed
through the chest. Died on the spot.)

83
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:35,752
Madam, does this name look familiar?

84
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,959
Your skill at checking
household records

85
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,319
is far better
than your taste in theater.

86
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,799
It's nothing compared to your acting.

87
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,279
Why don't you teach me

88
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,902
what it feels like

89
00:05:54,903 --> 00:05:56,583
to act like the dead while still alive?

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,320
It's time to end Act Three.

91
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,760
You write it.

92
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,839
If you knew who I was from the start,

93
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,159
why put me through this?

94
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,319
Put you through this?

95
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,264
I'm teaching you.

96
00:06:13,265 --> 00:06:15,199
Before you take revenge,

97
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,240
you must cut out your weakest spot.

98
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,679
Do you know

99
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,120
that with a single squeeze of my finger,

100
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,600
you won't get the chance
to avenge anything?

101
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,960
I won.

102
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,639
How did you know my gun was empty?

103
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,759
Because I knew
you didn't want to kill me.

104
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,319
And why wouldn't I?

105
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,599
You know the reason.

106
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,479
I planted the bomb at the wedding,

107
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,519
but you let me frame Ruyi for it.

108
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,159
Back at the Liang house,

109
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,599
you left that gun on purpose to test me.

110
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,599
You just wanted to see
whether I'd lose control

111
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,959
and kill Song Zhichu.

112
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,119
You knew I was Liang Yi,
yet you didn't kill me.

113
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,399
You didn't even use me
to bargain with Song Zhichu.

114
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,080
So I figured you must have a plan.

115
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,920
And I can help you.

116
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,079
You really are Liang Wenbin's daughter.

117
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,480
Sharp as a knife.

118
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,120
Takes one to know one.

119
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,960
Since we both want to
deal with Song Zhichu,

120
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,920
why don't we work together?

121
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
And why would I work with you?

122
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,400
Liang Wenbin deserved more than death.

123
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,280
How dare you insult my father.

124
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,399
Sir, feel my body.

125
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,600
It's more intoxicating than opium.

126
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,519
Sir.

127
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,480
I just want money
to buy a little smoke.

128
00:08:07,762 --> 00:08:09,682
I'll do whatever you want.

129
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,480
You elites...

130
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,400
Even your bones are soaked in poison.

131
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,119
If you want to live, get out.

132
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,240
You...

133
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,000
Rong City's opium ban
filled the streets with scums.

134
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,560
A real act of “merit,” isn't it?

135
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,510
But if the Liang family
was the true culprit,

136
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,279
this blood is on your hands.

137
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,120
Can you really wash it clean?

138
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,559
Have you never wondered
what your father was doing?

139
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,600
Rong City is crawling
with opium-fed monsters,

140
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,080
all thanks to your Liang family.

141
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,319
Father.

142
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,960
Why are you still up this late?

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,749
I have old debts that need sorting.

144
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,959
You're up late too.

145
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,600
Why aren't you asleep?

146
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,440
Why does the room smell strange?

147
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,799
Does it?

148
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,640
I don't smell anything.

149
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,800
(Impossible.)

150
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,040
(My father would never
do something like this.)

151
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,039
My father hated opium
more than anything in his life.

152
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,559
I know he would never
do something like that.

153
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,119
It was Song Zhichu.

154
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,440
He framed my father.

155
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,960
Framed?

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,240
If you ask me,

157
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,839
Liang Wenbin and Song Zhichu
were just playing roles.

158
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,119
One banned opium,
while the other sold it in secret.

159
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
In the end,
they fought over the profits,

160
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,760
and your father became the scapegoat.

161
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,759
Was your father foolish enough
to let himself be used,

162
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,080
or greedy enough to get himself killed?

163
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,839
Deep down,

164
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,760
you must have a sliver of doubt.

165
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,919
Even if my father was
blind to the truth,

166
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,720
I'll gouge out
Song Zhichu's eyes myself.

167
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,279
If all you want is
to watch me fall apart,

168
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,119
you can run to the Song family now
and claim credit.

169
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,000
But if you trust me just once,

170
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,160
we can work together

171
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,080
to find Song Zhichu's weak spot.

172
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,250
And why would I work with you?

173
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,079
Because I'm the eldest daughter
of the Liang family.

174
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,719
The Liang family?

175
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
You really think
that makes you valuable?

176
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,600
After what Song Zhichu did to me,

177
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,760
I'll do anything.

178
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,799
But I will never allow

179
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,000
anyone to insult my father.

180
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,920
Angry now?

181
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,519
Tomorrow, you're going somewhere.

182
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,360
You'll see how many people
smoke opium every day,
