=Episode 5=

12
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,659
Who exactly are you?

13
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,179
Why did you approach me?
What's your purpose?

14
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,859
Was the explosion related to you?

15
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,579
You're asking so many things at once.

16
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,979
I don't know which one
I should answer first.

17
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,580
Let's see how long
you can keep pretending.

18
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,419
Talk.

19
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,379
Talk or not?

20
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,259
If you kill me,

21
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,099
you'll never know anything about Xu Yin.

22
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,740
Where is Xu Yin?

23
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,220
She's already dead.

24
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,699
How did she die?

25
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,819
Xiao Mudan wanted to sell her
to Liu Kui.

26
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,419
She refused to be humiliated,
so she jumped into the river and ended her life.

27
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,340
You really don't want to live, do you?

28
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,619
At this point,

29
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,579
would there be any point
in lying to you?

30
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,939
There's a letter in my room.

31
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,459
She wrote it to you before she died.

32
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,100
If you don't believe me,
go read it yourself.

33
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,939
(Lin Yun.)

34
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,419
(When you read this letter,)

35
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,259
(I should already be gone.)

36
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,019
(When I was ten,)

37
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,179
(you were badly injured saving me.)

38
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,459
(I started liking you back then.)

39
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,779
(The engagement my father
arranged before he died)

40
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,939
(made me truly happy.)

41
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,980
(But I knew you weren't willing.)

42
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,139
(I was kidnapped
and sold to Huaying Brothel,)

43
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,219
(Now,)

44
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,579
(I have even less courage
to see you again.)

45
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,859
(This necklace is the one
you gave me back then.)

46
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,699
(I'm returning it to you now.)

47
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,660
(Let our engagement end here.)

48
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,859
(Ling Yun,)

49
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,820
(farewell forever.)

50
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,139
I'm nothing but an orphan
abandoned by fate.

51
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,899
Xiao Mudan needed to explain things
to Liu Kui,

52
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,619
so she made me become Xu Yin.

53
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,339
At Huaying Brothel,
I didn't tell you the truth

54
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,380
because you were the only one
who could save me then.

55
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,539
Using my guilt toward Xu Yin
to deceive me.

56
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,220
You really planned well.

57
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,620
Where is she?

58
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,819
Xiao Mudan dumped her at a mass grave.

59
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,099
I couldn't bear it,

60
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,259
so I asked someone
to secretly bury her here.

61
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:18,300
(The Tomb of Xu Yin)

62
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,260
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,539
I looked for you.

64
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,100
I failed to protect you.

65
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,660
Kneel.

66
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,220
Kneel!

67
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,980
Bow your head.

68
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,899
Now you should believe me, right?

69
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,699
You schemed to impersonate
Xu Yin and marry me.

70
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,139
Then you tampered with the wedding.

71
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,579
And you still say the explosion
had nothing to do with you?

72
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,100
Do you take me for a fool?

73
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,139
I have no grudge against Song Zhichu.

74
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,259
What good would it do me to do that?

75
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,899
I only wanted to use Xu Yin's identity

76
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,660
to find someone powerful to rely on.

77
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,499
And you think I'd believe you now?

78
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,259
At this point,
nothing you say matters anymore.

79
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,419
Three days.

80
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,500
Just three days.

81
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,700
I'll find the person
behind the explosion.

82
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,100
Fine.

83
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,500
I'll give you three days.

84
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,619
If you find the culprit,

85
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,780
everything between us
will be wiped clean.

86
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,740
And you'll leave Chengyun Society.

87
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,460
If you can't find them,

88
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,540
then the explosion
can only be your doing.

89
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,140
I'll make you die with Xu Yin.

90
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,580
Deal.

91
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,459
Has she returned?

92
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,739
Not yet. She's been acting
mysterious these days.

93
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,059
Leaving early and coming back late.

94
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,900
She's been wandering
around the Liang Residence.

95
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,660
The Liang Residence?

96
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,739
I want to see

97
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,580
what exactly she can find
in these three days.

98
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,339
I've found the culprit.

99
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,779
It was Madam Song's dowry maid,

100
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,980
Ruyi.

101
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,980
What a coincidence.

102
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,579
How do you prove it?

103
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,580
The relationship between Song Zhichu
and Ruyi is not simple.

104
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,620
(Tonight midnight at Xianhe Residence)
(From Chu)

105
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,620
You're betting your life
on this piece of paper.

106
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,100
(Tonight midnight at Xianhe Residence)
(From Chu)

107
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,979
Miss, why are you

108
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,099
reading the young master's
letters every day?

109
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,939
(Every love letter Song Zhichu
has written over the years,)

110
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,739
(I remember them vividly.)

111
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,020
(I couldn't be more familiar
with his handwriting.)

112
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,340
(I never thought it would come
in handy today.)

113
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,099
Go meet this Ruyi.

114
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,980
Yes.

115
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,219
Ruyi.

116
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,139
As long as you answer
my questions honestly,

117
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,540
I'll let you go.

118
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,300
I'm not finished yet.

119
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,779
If you lie,

120
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,100
even a bullet won't spare you.

121
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,580
Shh.

122
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,340
You weren't at the banquet,

123
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,940
where did you go?

124
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,779
I…

125
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,979
What?

126
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,260
Having trouble answering?

127
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,299
My stomach wasn't feeling well,

128
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,179
so I

129
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,620
left for a while.

130
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,500
Is the toilet of the Chengyun Society
on the east or west side?

131
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,819
East...

132
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,700
East side.

133
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,940
Nonsense!

134
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,179
It's clearly on the north side.

135
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,979
You planted the bomb in the cake.

136
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,059
You wanted to kill Chief Song
and Madam Song, didn't you?

137
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,979
How could it be me?

138
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,100
How could I ever harm
my master and madam?

139
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,140
What's this?

140
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,259
Boss.

141
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,339
It fell off her.

142
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,020
What is this?

143
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,699
This isn't mine.

144
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,379
I don't even know what that is.

145
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,099
You ordered the cake.

146
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,880
And that masked woman was you.

147
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,299
Now the evidence is here.
Let's see how you deny it now?

148
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,980
It really wasn't me.

149
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,259
- Beat her until she admits it!
- Yes!

150
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,099
It wasn't me!

151
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,139
You've got the wrong person!

152
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,540
It really wasn't me!

153
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,779
Madam Lin,

154
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,939
please save me.

155
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,899
I didn't cause the explosion.

156
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,539
Please help me send a message
to Chief Song.

157
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,819
Ask him to save me.

158
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,780
Chief Song?

159
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,259
Aren't you the maid who came
with the Liang family's dowry?

160
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,259
Why don't you ask your own
young lady to save you?

161
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,659
Chief Song treats
my young lady extremely well,

162
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,299
and he treats us servants just the same.

163
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,979
In that moment,

164
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,300
I wasn't thinking straight.

165
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,340
Oh really?

166
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,939
Your young lady

167
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,580
treats you well.

168
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,979
I grew up together with my young lady,

169
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,180
naturally our bond is deep.

170
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,059
Then why did you try to harm her?

171
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,699
No.

172
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,100
I really didn't.

173
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,420
What are you doing?

174
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,060
You don't remember where this bracelet
came from?

175
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,299
Miss.

176
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,579
This jade bracelet is so beautiful.

177
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,339
Do you like it?

178
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,420
Mm-hmm.

179
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,060
I'll give it to you.

180
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,300
Really?

181
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,020
Thank you, Miss.

182
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,780
Ruyi.

183
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,860
It's only been three months.

184
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,020
You can't even recognize me?

185
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,539
Look carefully.

186
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,180
Who do you think I am?

187
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,059
Impossible.

188
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,980
Miss clearly died already.

189
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,499
I didn't die.

190
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,840
Heaven took pity on me.

191
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,819
It let me live and return
to take revenge on you all.

192
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,459
Impossible.

193
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,179
No way.

194
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,899
Impossible.

195
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,179
No way.

196
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,899
Ruyi.

197
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,299
All these years I treated you
like my own sister.

198
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,379
For a man like that,

199
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,700
was it worth it?

200
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,059
Zhichu said

201
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,939
he never really liked you.

202
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,499
He married you

203
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,419
only because his father forced him.

204
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,819
Lu Man

205
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,739
was just a puppet he brought back
to replace you.

206
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,900
The one he truly loves is me.

207
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,619
Once I am married,

208
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,979
I will be the real Madam Song.

209
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,259
You really are foolish.

210
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,659
Do you really think someone

211
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,859
who could kill his wife and father-in-law
on his wedding night would actually marry you?

212
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,259
Is this how you repay Liang family?

213
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,179
Tell me, where did Lu Man

214
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,539
who replaced me come from?

215
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,899
I don't know either.

216
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,779
She was brought back by Zhichu.

217
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,140
So I would help confirm
Liang Yi's identity.

218
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,820
All those who harmed our Liang family,

219
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,980
I will make you all accompany
my father in death, one by one.

220
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,420
You're the first.

221
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,819
Miss, I was wrong.

222
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,339
I didn't mean to.

223
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,539
I'm pregnant.

224
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,220
I'm carrying Zhichu's child.

225
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,179
Please.

226
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,539
Don't kill me.

227
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,659
It's all my fault.

228
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,539
I listened to Zhichu's lies,

229
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,499
and did something wrong to you.

230
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,099
But the child is innocent.

231
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,059
Please spare me.

232
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,380
Will you?

233
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,259
I beg you.

234
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,980
Don't kill my child.

235
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,579
You may stand up now.

236
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,940
I won't kill you.

237
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,979
Thank you, Miss, for sparing me.

238
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,699
Since you already know my identity,

239
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,640
you can no longer stay in Rong City.

240
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,840
I will arrange for someone
to send you away as soon as possible.

241
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,259
Do not return.

242
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,459
Otherwise, next time I see you,

243
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,979
I will definitely kill you.

244
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,539
Okay.

245
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,900
I will obey you.

246
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,939
Chief Song.

247
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,899
She is over here.

248
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,859
Zhichu.

249
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,380
So Miss...

250
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,320
What nonsense are you talking about?

251
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,920
How could the Liang family
young lady be fake?

252
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,939
I think you're just obsessed
with becoming Madam Song.

253
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,240
- You even wanted to blow up Liang Yi.
- No, Zhichu. It was Miss...

254
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,979
The culprit has been found.

255
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,299
Let's stop here.

256
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,620
You've worked hard.

257
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,259
After all, she's a Liang family maid.

258
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,139
As for Madam Song...

259
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,859
I'll go explain to her side.

260
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,220
You don't need to worry.

261
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,300
Zhichu.

262
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,340
Are you okay?

263
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,060
Just a servant.

264
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,180
I'm leaving first.

265
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,379
Boss.

266
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,179
Tonight, while Song Zhichu
wasn't around,

267
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,779
we opened a few more Liang family
cargo boxes at the dock,

268
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,419
but still found nothing.

269
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,059
Do you think it's possible that opium

270
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,539
has nothing to do with Song Zhichu?

271
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,680
The black market opium

272
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,360
started appearing the second year after
the anti-opium ban in Rong City.

273
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,020
Coincidentally, that year,

274
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,219
Song Zhichu became police chief
thanks to his father's connections.

275
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,579
Moreover, all these years,

276
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,299
no rumors ever leaked.

277
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,019
Even I couldn't find out a thing.

278
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,819
Who else in Rong City besides
the Song family

279
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,099
could have close merchant ties
with them?

280
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,219
It's only the Liang family.

281
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,539
But Liang family cargo
never showed any issues.

282
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,739
Song Zhichu is like a man
with three heads and six arms,

283
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,699
there must be channels for opium
to enter Rong City.

284
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,179
The goods are fine,

285
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,139
it doesn't mean the Liang family
is without faults.

286
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,619
Moreover,

287
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,460
Liang Wenbin died so mysteriously.

288
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,859
Could it be that Song Zhichu killed him?

289
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,939
Liang Wenbin had an accident
on his wedding day.

290
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,379
Song Zhichu had an affair with
his wife's personal maid.

291
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,179
The Liang family, proud of their status,
really couldn't catch a break.

292
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,179
Moreover, the Liang family
young lady is very unusual.

293
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,859
Even we felt Liang Wenbin's
death was suspicious.

294
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,059
But she not only didn't suspect,

295
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,739
she let Song Zhichu manipulate her.

296
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,059
Liang Yi graduated
from Southern Women's University.

297
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,819
It's said Liang Wenbin valued
this only daughter greatly,

298
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,859
raised her as his successor
since childhood.

299
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,620
So she must have been blinded
by Song Zhichu's sweet words.

300
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,459
Unless...

301
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,659
Unless what?

302
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,459
Unless the current Madam Song

303
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,780
is not Liang Yi at all.
