=Episode 15=

12
00:01:13,752 --> 00:01:16,751
The sky over Rong City is about
to fully brighten.

13
00:01:16,752 --> 00:01:18,271
It requires the guns
of the police station

14
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:20,232
and the influence
of the Chengyun Society,

15
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:22,072
neither can be missing.

16
00:01:22,512 --> 00:01:26,032
Unfortunately, the sky over Rong City
is shrouded in smoke and chaos.

17
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,632
I really cannot stand by idly.

18
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,431
Since when did the underworld
maintain justice?

19
00:01:34,432 --> 00:01:36,151
What a joke.

20
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:37,861
White has turned to black.

21
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:39,831
The world is upside down.

22
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:41,431
Chief Song.

23
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:42,832
Who is truly the laughable one?

24
00:01:46,352 --> 00:01:48,151
Brothers quarrel at home.

25
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:49,871
It only allows outsiders
to take advantage.

26
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:50,991
That must never happen.

27
00:01:50,992 --> 00:01:52,711
Lin Yun.

28
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,551
I already scolded Zhichu.

29
00:01:54,552 --> 00:01:57,831
This matter was handled improperly
by him.

30
00:01:57,832 --> 00:01:59,011
Regarding those petty criminals

31
00:01:59,012 --> 00:02:01,351
doing despicable things right
under his nose,

32
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:03,632
and he was completely unaware.

33
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:04,991
You went straight to the core

34
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,751
which is truly a great achievement.

35
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,424
It was Zhichu
who misunderstood at first

36
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:11,425
and causing a misunderstanding.

37
00:02:11,512 --> 00:02:12,857
A misunderstanding?

38
00:02:13,152 --> 00:02:15,112
It seems you have made your judgment,
Mayor Song.

39
00:02:17,992 --> 00:02:20,911
You two are both eager to do good,

40
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:22,871
both for the sake of Rong City.

41
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:24,191
Today I will host.

42
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:27,831
First, to apologize on behalf
of Zhichu to you.

43
00:02:27,832 --> 00:02:29,511
Second, as mayor,

44
00:02:29,512 --> 00:02:34,312
to thank you both for joining forces
to cleanse Rong City of smoke and filth.

45
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:35,672
Come.

46
00:02:38,512 --> 00:02:39,672
Mayor Song.

47
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:41,911
Let me speak fairly.

48
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,632
How can a father apologize
on behalf of his son?

49
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:49,752
This guilt must be repaid personally
to show sincerity.

50
00:02:58,752 --> 00:02:59,871
Lin Yun.

51
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:03,432
Your wife really has a sharp tongue.

52
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:07,472
Zhichu.

53
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:10,152
The words have been spoken
to this extent.

54
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:12,712
Let's see how you respond.

55
00:03:19,352 --> 00:03:20,472
Is that enough?

56
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:23,912
Chief Song.

57
00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:26,632
I have been tortured and bled.

58
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,352
Can a cup of wine really
smooth over all grudges?

59
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:48,712
Is this enough now?

60
00:03:59,992 --> 00:04:03,071
Fine, let's consider this a blood oath.

61
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:04,191
From now on,

62
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:06,431
your brotherly bond is solidified.

63
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:09,071
No longer speaking
as two separate families.

64
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:10,311
Work together

65
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:11,832
to build Rong City.

66
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:15,312
Master. Your secretary is looking for you.

67
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:17,631
Official duties call.

68
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,112
I'll take my leave first.

69
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,312
You two brothers can catch up properly.

70
00:04:34,272 --> 00:04:37,592
Madam Lin seems to really
enjoy eating fish eyes.

71
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:39,471
What a coincidence.

72
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:41,952
Liang Yi also likes eating fish eyes.

73
00:04:44,872 --> 00:04:46,071
Wrong guess.

74
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:47,952
It's my husband who likes eating them.

75
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:56,551
She

76
00:04:56,552 --> 00:04:59,072
has figured out my tastes completely.

77
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:03,352
There's just one left.

78
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,391
What?

79
00:05:19,392 --> 00:05:21,672
Has Madam Song changed her taste?

80
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,431
I heard that once a woman is pregnant,

81
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:30,272
her tastes will change.

82
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:32,031
It can't be

83
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,391
Madam Song

84
00:05:33,392 --> 00:05:35,672
has become a mother?

85
00:05:38,152 --> 00:05:39,792
My wife and I are of one mind.

86
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:41,351
Even if she is to become a mother,

87
00:05:41,352 --> 00:05:42,671
I will take good care of her.

88
00:05:42,672 --> 00:05:44,712
No need for you to worry, Madam Lin.

89
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,551
I heard that last time Madam Lin
went to the pharmacy warehouse

90
00:05:49,552 --> 00:05:52,232
was just to take a look
at the Five-lobed Coptis.

91
00:05:53,232 --> 00:05:54,831
Five-lobed Coptis is extremely rare.

92
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:55,991
I was just curious.

93
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:58,274
But that the Liang family warehouse
has Five-lobed Coptis,

94
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,752
besides the Liang family manager,
only my father-in-law and my wife know.

95
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:03,985
Where did you hear that?

96
00:06:05,552 --> 00:06:07,991
As the top pharmacy in Rong City,
the Liang family

97
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,991
must have some rare herbs.

98
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:11,551
It was just a coincidence.

99
00:06:11,552 --> 00:06:13,231
There are so many rare herbs.

100
00:06:13,232 --> 00:06:14,591
You asked casually,

101
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:17,071
and happened to ask about one
that was in the warehouse.

102
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:18,912
What a coincidence.

103
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:24,552
We were invited to dinner,

104
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:26,672
not for interrogation.

105
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:28,472
Farewell.

106
00:06:42,872 --> 00:06:43,992
What's going on?

107
00:06:44,232 --> 00:06:46,386
Perhaps Yunzhou also got the news,

108
00:06:46,387 --> 00:06:48,667
afraid we'd cut off the opium trade.

109
00:06:48,762 --> 00:06:50,111
Go tell them.

110
00:06:50,112 --> 00:06:52,111
The opium trade is only paused.

111
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:55,032
But every cent owed will still be paid.

112
00:06:55,512 --> 00:06:56,552
This...

113
00:06:56,912 --> 00:06:58,392
Can be considered tribute.

114
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,872
We must maintain the Yunzhou route.

115
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:05,512
I'm pointing at their guns.

116
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:10,632
Song Zhichu was clearly suspicious
just now.

117
00:07:11,392 --> 00:07:13,832
So we must act quickly.

118
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:16,549
Have Lu Man's son
and husband been found?

119
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,072
They've been rescued.

120
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,753
Song Zhichu locked them

121
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:21,544
in his private residence
in the east of the city.

122
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:25,025
This father and son are his weakness.

123
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,290
In our hands, they are trump cards.

124
00:07:27,352 --> 00:07:29,586
We must expose Lu Man's
identity quickly.

125
00:07:29,587 --> 00:07:32,431
Song Zhichu won't give us much time.

126
00:07:32,432 --> 00:07:33,791
In a few days, Song Ming

127
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:36,924
will host this year's charity banquet
with the Chamber of Commerce.

128
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:38,911
All the prominent merchants in the city

129
00:07:38,912 --> 00:07:40,312
will attend in person.

130
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:43,311
Song Ming wants to run
for provincial chairman.

131
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:45,232
He can't do it without their support.

132
00:07:46,112 --> 00:07:47,286
What's your plan?

133
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:50,007
Just be Madam Lin, calmly.

134
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,299
I said

135
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,940
the Song family matter
is for me to handle.

136
00:08:01,612 --> 00:08:04,429
I once had the same dress.

137
00:08:07,575 --> 00:08:09,135
It was made following your style.

00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:13,631
The Liang family is nothing.

186
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:14,912
So generous.

187
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:16,791
What exactly

188
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:19,312
caught your attention, Chief Song?

189
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,550
Because you understand me.

190
00:11:28,952 --> 00:11:30,271
Chief Song.

191
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,911
I ate a bit too much today.

192
00:11:31,912 --> 00:11:33,672
Don't make me feel sick.

193
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,792
Don't shamelessly push your luck.

194
00:12:05,162 --> 00:12:06,882
Who exactly are you?

195
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:13,272
Why are you in my room?

196
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:17,602
What happened to your neck wound?

197
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:19,112
Where have you been?

198
00:12:22,062 --> 00:12:23,699
(Invitation: Lin Yun,
Song Ming cordially invite)

199
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,792
- Song Ming's invitation has arrived.
- What exactly happened?

200
00:12:28,712 --> 00:12:30,751
Song Zhichu knows I'm not Xu Yin.

201
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:32,592
You encountered Song Zhichu?

202
00:12:34,112 --> 00:12:35,512
He caused the injury?

203
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:39,071
The main point now is we must ensure

204
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:41,351
tomorrow's plan goes perfectly.

205
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:43,071
You're already exposed.

206
00:12:43,072 --> 00:12:45,311
Do you think Song Zhichu
will let you go?

207
00:12:45,312 --> 00:12:47,311
You absolutely cannot go tomorrow.

208
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:49,240
I'll arrange for you to leave
as soon as possible.

209
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,432
Leave the Song family to me.

210
00:12:50,512 --> 00:12:51,752
Lin Yun.

211
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:54,831
I already said at Xianhe Restaurant,

212
00:12:54,832 --> 00:12:57,111
we're just partners.

213
00:12:57,112 --> 00:12:58,400
Now, in your current state,

214
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,720
do you still look like the boss
of the Chengyun Society?

215
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,859
Song Zhichu only knows I'm not Xu Yin,

216
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,724
he doesn't know I'm Liang Yi.

217
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:06,845
I must go tomorrow.

218
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,392
Take some medicine before we go.

219
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:17,182
Even if we're just partners,

220
00:13:17,392 --> 00:13:19,112
I have a duty to protect you.
