00:03:56,632 --> 00:03:58,512

75
00:03:59,952 --> 00:04:01,232
Let her go.

76
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:09,499
Are you sure?

77
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,740
Follow her.

78
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:13,712
What are you looking at?

79
00:04:13,832 --> 00:04:15,752

All right, all right.

84
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:23,192

90
00:04:40,862 --> 00:04:43,061

you gave me.

91
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:45,299
It'd be more accurate
if the child could come in for sizing.

92
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,951
Please wrap them up for me.

93
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:47,952

94
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:05,799
Madam,

95
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,440
your clothes.

96
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:13,031
Thank you.

97
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:14,032
Take care.

98
00:06:13,352 --> 00:06:15,271
Don't you have any other methods?

99
00:06:15,272 --> 00:06:16,672
I learned from you.

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,720
We agreed not to meddle
in each other's business.

101
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,220
Mr. Lin,
you'd do well to stay in your lane.

102
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:25,592
My kindness means nothing to you.

103
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:27,447
Fine, don't come begging me later.

104
00:06:36,032 --> 00:06:36,631

105
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:38,511

107
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:41,631
Can't you visit me more often?

108
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:42,907
Be good, Guang.

109
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:44,712
I miss you too.

110
00:06:49,032 --> 00:06:50,552
What are you doing?

111
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:55,192
You always bring useless things.

112
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:57,591
Didn't you say you came here

113
00:06:57,592 --> 00:06:59,311
to sing and earn money?

114
00:06:59,312 --> 00:07:00,432
I think

115
00:07:00,992 --> 00:07:03,312
you found yourself some man out there.

116
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:07,632
I suppose I've found a way
to get Lu Man to give me the goods.

117
00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:09,791
You wretch!

118
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:11,431
Mother...

119
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:12,391
Tell me

120
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:14,752
how Guang hurt his face.

121
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:19,436
If I hadn't bought
your freedom back then,

122
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:22,271
you'd still be pouring drinks for men.

123
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:23,791
And now you think

124
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:25,832
you can lecture me?

125
00:07:26,232 --> 00:07:27,311
Where's the money?

126
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:28,792
When will I get my money?

127
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:30,871
I'm warning you,

128
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:32,631
touch one hair on Guang,

129
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:34,071
and I'll fight you!

130
00:07:34,072 --> 00:07:36,511
I'm stuck in this dump every day.

131
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:37,991
I'm bored out of my mind.

132
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:39,952
If you don't bring me money,

133
00:07:41,232 --> 00:07:43,911
I'll take Guang to that lover of yours

134
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:46,791
and spill everything.

135
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:47,791
Lu Youcai,

136
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:49,511
get this straight.

137
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:50,471
All these years,

138
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:52,832
I've been the one feeding you.

139
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:54,951
So what?

140
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:56,951
You really believe you have the right

141
00:07:56,952 --> 00:07:59,112
to put me in my place?

142
00:07:59,432 --> 00:08:00,912
Stop!

143
00:08:02,752 --> 00:08:04,592
Oh, we've got company.

144
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:17,677
Xu Yin.

145
00:08:19,752 --> 00:08:22,232
I never thought you had
this many secrets tucked away.

146
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:25,111
I wonder
if it will be a surprise or a shock

147
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:26,711
for Chief Song

148
00:08:26,712 --> 00:08:28,712
when he hears about this.

149
00:08:31,537 --> 00:08:32,617
Xu Yin,

150
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:34,351
for old times' sake...

151
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:35,752
You want me to keep this quiet?

152
00:08:37,112 --> 00:08:39,072
What's in it for me?

153
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:43,312
These.

154
00:08:43,725 --> 00:08:45,711
Ask for whatever you want.

155
00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:46,991
From now on,

156
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:49,552
what's mine is yours.

157
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:53,351
You're generous.

158
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:54,824
Although,

159
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:59,145
what's mine has been yours already.

160
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,991
Don't worry.

161
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:03,712
I'll never have anything to do

162
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:05,697
with Lin Yun again.

163
00:09:06,632 --> 00:09:08,151
I don't care about that.

164
00:09:08,152 --> 00:09:09,672
Then what do you want?

165
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:12,872
Herbs.

166
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:14,431
Herbs?

167
00:09:14,432 --> 00:09:16,231
The Liang's Apothecary
has plenty of those.

168
00:09:16,232 --> 00:09:18,631
Tell me what you need.

169
00:09:18,632 --> 00:09:20,071
I'll fetch it.

170
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:21,512
I'm asking for plenty.

171
00:09:21,912 --> 00:09:23,231
I want

172
00:09:23,232 --> 00:09:25,431
all the wulingzhi I saw

173
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,232
in those dozen crates.

174
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:31,386
Why do you want that?

175
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:32,907
No reason.

176
00:09:32,992 --> 00:09:34,191
I just

177
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:35,752
like it.

178
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:36,631
What?

179
00:09:36,632 --> 00:09:37,311
Is that a problem?

180
00:09:37,312 --> 00:09:38,671
I may be

181
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:39,631
the daughter

182
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:41,624
of the Liang family,

183
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,911
but ever since I married Song Zhichu,

184
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:45,711
he's been

185
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:47,432
running everything.

186
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:49,511
It all belongs to him.

187
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:51,392
I can't make the call.

188
00:09:53,072 --> 00:09:55,032
Then, I'll go to Chief Song.

189
00:09:56,232 --> 00:09:57,112
Wait!

190
00:09:57,632 --> 00:09:59,152
Give me some time.

191
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:00,832
All right.

192
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:03,151
But I'm impatient,

193
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:04,031
and I have loose lips.

194
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:05,632
I'll be quick about it.

195
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:22,551
You don't come across

196
00:10:22,552 --> 00:10:24,512
icy imperial green jadeite every day.

197
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:26,991
You don't deserve it.

198
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:29,071
It'd be such a waste

199
00:10:29,072 --> 00:10:30,712
if your lover accidentally smashed it.

200
00:10:30,832 --> 00:10:32,632
I'll hold on to it for you.

201
00:11:09,432 --> 00:11:10,871
Yi,

202
00:11:10,872 --> 00:11:12,072
sit here.

203
00:11:13,992 --> 00:11:15,231
Is this necessary, Father?

204
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:16,351
It's just a gift.

205
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:18,232
There's no need for all this secrecy.

206
00:11:18,872 --> 00:11:22,191
It's for your 18th birthday.

207
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:24,472
A bit of ceremony never hurts.

208
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:25,872
Open it.

209
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:29,631
Father, I expected

210
00:11:29,632 --> 00:11:30,711
something exciting.

211
00:11:30,712 --> 00:11:33,631
This is what people
your age appreciate, not me.

212
00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:35,151
Oh, you.

213
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,391
I chose this icy imperial green jadeite
just for you.

214
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:39,871
It took me a long time

215
00:11:39,872 --> 00:11:41,151
to find it.

216
00:11:41,152 --> 00:11:44,111
I even had a master craftsman
in Suzhou customize it for you.

217
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:45,432
Give me your hand.

218
00:11:46,312 --> 00:11:48,831
This jade is firm but not brittle,

219
00:11:48,832 --> 00:11:50,991
just like my Yi.

220
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:54,191
I hope this bangle keeps you safe

221
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:56,032
all your life.

222
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,551
(I miss you,)

223
00:12:11,552 --> 00:12:13,712
(Father...)

224
00:12:47,992 --> 00:12:49,511
The head of the Chengyun Society.

225
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:50,752
Hello.

226
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:52,632
You're drunk.

227
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,232
No, I'm not.

228
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:57,992
I can walk in a straight line.

229
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:00,751
I can walk

230
00:13:00,752 --> 00:13:02,111
sideways

231
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:03,592
and backwards too.

232
00:13:12,232 --> 00:13:13,271
Stop it.

233
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:14,511
We're going home.

234
00:13:14,512 --> 00:13:15,632
Home?

235
00:13:17,552 --> 00:13:18,992
I don't have a home anymore.

236
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:22,072
Not anymore...

237
00:13:30,787 --> 00:13:32,932
(Puyuan Pastries)

238
00:13:33,632 --> 00:13:34,872
Smells good.

239
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:36,792
I want pastries.

240
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:41,792
I want pastries.

241
00:13:42,552 --> 00:13:43,871
Smells so good.

242
00:13:43,872 --> 00:13:46,071
They are my favourite.

243
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:49,392
My father always bought me
lots of those pastries.

244
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:50,871
I want pastries.

245
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,551
I want pastries.

246
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:53,599
It's late.

247
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,991
They're closed.

248
00:13:54,992 --> 00:13:57,436
No, I want pastries.

249
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,672
I want pastries right now.

250
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:01,351
I want pastries...

251
00:14:01,352 --> 00:14:03,231
I want pastries...

252
00:14:03,232 --> 00:14:04,872
I want pastries...

253
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:16,192
Coming!

254
00:14:18,472 --> 00:14:20,112
Mr. Lin?

255
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:21,551
I'd like to buy some pastries.

256
00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:23,392
