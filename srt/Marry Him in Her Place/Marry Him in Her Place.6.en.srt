=Marry Him in Her Place=

11

=Episode 6=

12
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,579
(Last night I was worried
that Ruyi would expose my identity.)

13
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,019
(I panicked for a moment
and blurted out that Liang Yi was fake.)

14
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,299
(Once Song Zhichu
pieces everything together,)

15
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,099
(he'll definitely notice
something wrong.)

16
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,779
(If my identity is exposed
because of this,)

17
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,659
(how will I take revenge on him?)

18
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,580
(I should leave this place
as soon as possible and plan again later.)

19
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,179
You said

20
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,180
once the killer is found,
you'll let me go.

21
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,619
You said

22
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,900
Ruyi was Liang Yi's personal maid,

23
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,140
she had plenty of chances to strike.

24
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,060
Why choose to act during our wedding?

25
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,140
Wasn't she afraid of hurting
Song Zhichu by accident?

26
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,380
She...

27
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,640
Loved but couldn't have him,
so she lashed out in shame and anger,

28
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,260
wanted to kill them both.

29
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,660
Kill him?

30
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,740
Just one note from Song Zhichu
was enough to lure her out,

31
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,980
she really is hopelessly devoted.

32
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,940
(He saw through it.)

33
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,100
(But why didn't he expose me
in front of Song Zhichu?)

34
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,820
(Aren't they)

35
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,020
(supposed to be good friends?)

36
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,299
To show his gratitude,

37
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,059
Song Zhichu invited us

38
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,940
to the Liang Residence for a banquet.

39
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,059
I'm not Xu Yin,

40
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,659
nor your wife.

41
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,300
Why should I go?

42
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,539
If I tell Song Zhichu the truth

43
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,499
that you're not Madam Lin,

44
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,700
and even framed Ruyi,

45
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,860
do you think he would spare you?

46
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,459
Besides,

47
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,700
aren't you interested in him too?

48
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,619
Change into something decent.

49
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,819
I'll wait for you outside.

50
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,420
Madam.

51
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,380
(Once I lose the identity
of Madam Lin Yun,)

52
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,500
(it will be much harder to get close
to Song Zhichu again.)

53
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,299
(Since he didn't expose me,)

54
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,460
(he must have his own plan.)

55
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,540
(Maybe)

56
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,660
(going to the Liang Residence)

57
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,700
(might be an opportunity.)

58
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,460
How does you know the way
to the dining hall?

59
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,740
Have you been here before?

60
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,880
Wealthy families arrange their homes
with feng shui in mind.

61
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,979
I know a little about it.

62
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,820
Huaying Brothel teaches that too?

63
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,579
Just a bit.

64
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,180
Nothing impressive.

65
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,460
Lin Yun.

66
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,540
You two really are a lovey-dovey
newlywed pair.

67
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,780
Jealous?

68
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,219
You'd better not let your underlings
see you like this.

69
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,900
Otherwise who would still respect you?

70
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,080
It's not mealtime yet.
Let's go play a few rounds of mahjong.

71
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,579
This way please.

72
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,580
Let's go.

73
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,979
I really need to thank the two of you
for cleaning up my household mess.

74
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,459
Thank my wife.

75
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,860
She discovered it.

76
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,099
Madam Lin does seem to meddle
a bit too much.

77
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,699
Well, women

78
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,300
have to keep an eye on their own men.

79
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,339
After all, Mr. Lin is so charming.

80
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,900
You wouldn't want him snatched away
by other ladies.

81
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,499
What happened at the Chengyun Society,

82
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,780
we naturally owe Madam Song
an explanation.

83
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,899
After all, the Liang family

84
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,420
can't withstand any more storms.

85
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,940
I misspoke.

86
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,700
It's alright.

87
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,419
You worry too much.

88
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,459
Between our two families,

89
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,660
there's no need to be so formal.

90
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,819
You're right.

91
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,619
Master Liang has only just passed away.

92
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,780
If something happens to you too,

93
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,420
I wouldn't be able to take it.

94
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,220
Rumor has it

95
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,900
that Mr. Lin married his wife
out of gratitude.

96
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,819
Her father entrusted her
to me before he died,

97
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,980
asked me to take care of her.

98
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,780
But I still failed to protect her.

99
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,980
Madam Lin really is exceptionally lucky
to be alive.

100
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,820
I heard

101
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,780
when Mr. Lin arrived,

102
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,420
you already had one foot in the coffin.

103
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,300
Madam Song is so interested
in my affairs.

104
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,859
Someone like you,
what could I possibly be interested in?

105
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,019
Then why you

106
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,580
pry into my matters so thoroughly?

107
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,699
If it isn't me you're curious about,

108
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,339
could it be

109
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,300
you're interested in Lin Yun?

110
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,699
I didn't expect you to be such
an extraordinary woman.

111
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,580
No wonder you could tame
that wild Lin Yun.

112
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,820
You can know a face but not the heart.

113
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,979
Mr. Lin,

114
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,340
it's better not to misjudge people.

115
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,700
Liang Yi.

116
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,900
All tiles the same.

117
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
I win.

118
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,179
Mahjong is a necessary social pastime
for wealthy ladies.

119
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,139
Madam Lin is so poor at the game,

120
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,060
how can she fit the role of hostess
of the Chengyun Society?

121
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,740
If you can't play cards,
you can't scheme.

122
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,300
Women

123
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,500
are better off being simple.

124
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,340
The couple are so devoted to each other.

125
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,099
Stop making a fuss here,

126
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,580
okay?

127
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,699
And you?

128
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,699
Good for you, Lin Yun.

129
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,960
To avoid exposing your tiles, you won't
care about your own win or loss, right?

130
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,019
See. Now that's strategic thinking.

131
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,100
Sometimes you shouldn't be too concerned
with short-term gains.

132
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,899
If the situation is unfavorable,

133
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,780
you can simply forfeit this hand.

134
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,940
As long as you don't lose,

135
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,179
you'll keep getting chances.

136
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,459
Understand?

137
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,620
Madam.

138
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,100
Where are you going?

139
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,540
I'll ask the kitchen to prepare
some fruit for you.

140
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,180
I'll go help her.

141
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:13,859
Yi.

142
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,059
Father, come chase me!

143
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,619
Run slower.

144
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,579
You naughty girl.

145
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,459
Got you now.

146
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,940
Here, I will hold you.

147
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,980
It's spinning.

148
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,140
Spinning around.

149
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,380
Are you happy?

150
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,899
This lousy censer

151
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,979
makes my hair smell like a dead person.

152
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,219
Miss Liang. Keeping the mourning hall set for
a hundred days is our family tradition.

153
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,339
I've been having nightmares
every day lately.

154
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,419
I am the Liang family's eldest miss,

155
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,580
do you want me to go and
bury myself with that old thing?

156
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,099
(Spirit tablet of Liang Wenbin)

157
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,859
Miss Liang.

158
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,139
This is very disrespectful.

159
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,380
Quickly throw these unlucky things out!

160
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,140
Oh right.

161
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,940
Remember to scatter the new roses
I bought all over the room.

162
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,739
Master.

163
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,020
I apologize.

164
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,140
(Spirit tablet of Liang Wenbin)

165
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,059
You are...

166
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,220
I am...

167
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,939
Lin Yun's wife.

168
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,540
Just passing by.

169
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,059
Madam Lin.

170
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,580
Have you been to the residence before?

171
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,499
How many times have I told you?

172
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,299
The tree is so tall,

173
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,339
don't climb it.

174
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,700
It's dangerous.

175
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,300
- Do you admit you were wrong?
- I don't.

176
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,440
Punish her by not letting
her eat tonight.

177
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,020
Do you truly care about my life, Father?

178
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,099
You are the apple of the Master's eye.

179
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,940
How could he not cherish you?

180
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,859
Then why won't you let me eat?

181
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,860
I'll starve if I don't eat.

182
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,300
I have never known

183
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,659
the Liang family,

184
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,660
I've never come here.

185
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,499
Maybe I'm getting old.

186
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,540
My eyesight isn't what it used to be.

187
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,579
What is this of yours?

188
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,620
I've long heard

189
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,939
that Master Liang was virtuous
and respected,

190
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,339
generous and charitable.

191
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,899
I admire him.

192
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,100
Please help give the old gentleman
a proper send-off.

193
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,739
Madam Lin, you're so kind.

194
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,099
The Master was a great man in life.

195
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,659
His greatest wish was for Miss Liang

196
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,819
to live happily and well.

197
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,820
But,

198
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,459
for some reason,

199
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,900
Miss Liang

200
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,820
has become like this now.

201
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,379
Are you treating Liang Residence

202
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,780
like the Rouge Alley of Huaying Brothel?

203
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,459
Don't forget.

204
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,459
You are now Madam Lin,

205
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,100
not the top courtesan
of Huaying Brothel anymore.

206
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,219
You hit me?

207
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,019
So this is the manners

208
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,660
of the noble Liang family?

209
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,459
The affairs of Liang family

210
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,660
are not for someone like you
to lecture on.

211
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,819
All of Rong City knows

212
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,619
I am Lin Yun's legally wedded wife.

213
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,059
On our wedding day,

214
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,260
Chief Song even officiated
the ceremony himself.

215
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,899
Yet today you keep bringing up
my Huaying Brothel background,

216
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,019
trying to belittle me,

217
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,059
are you trying to slap Chief Song
in the face?

218
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,059
Stop pretending in front of me.

219
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,979
I've seen plenty of women
who climb up using men.

220
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,699
Miss Liang, who's been sheltered
her whole life

221
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,300
actually knows about such things?

222
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,260
Men and women,
it's all the same petty stuff.

223
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,819
Stop embarrassing yourself here.

224
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,820
Get out!

225
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,979
Madam Song still a Liang family lady.

226
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,500
Why bother?

227
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,779
Madam Song.

228
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,300
Are you alright?

229
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,220
You're worried about me?

230
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,739
Well then, Madam Lin.

231
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,260
Does your hand hurt?

232
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,660
Madam Lin.

233
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,939
Your husband chased
after my wife just now.

234
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,140
Aren't you curious what they're doing?

235
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,260
I believe in Lin Yun.

236
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,179
Do you know

237
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,900
they slept together?

238
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,259
Zhichu was just panicking at the time.
Madam Song, surely...

239
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,619
Mr. Lin, you may still call me
Miss Liang.

240
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,820
After all,

241
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,814
the one who shared a night of passion

242
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:37,499
with me on the wedding day was you,

243
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,220
not Song Zhichu.

244
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,100
What exactly are you trying to say?

245
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,700
Perhaps

246
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,940
I am more trustworthy than Lin Yun.

247
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,819
As long as you choose me,

248
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,899
no one in Rong City
will dare bully you again.

249
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,339
You're not angry about that night?

250
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,899
You were the one I liked from the start.

251
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,499
I was happy, not angry.

252
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,380
How could I be upset?

253
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,060
Thank you for your kindness,
Chief Song.

254
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,379
But I'm a stubborn person.

255
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,139
Once I decide something, I won't change.

256
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,699
Madam Song, you misunderstand.

257
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,899
Even if Lin Yun does not love me,

258
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,459
I will never betray him.

259
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,460
My heart holds only my wife.
