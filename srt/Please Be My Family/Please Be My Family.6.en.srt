[What to do when your husband wants a third child?]

179
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,300
Can I keep you company?

180
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,280
The frog will miss its chance if it doesn't go back soon.

181
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,700
Daddy, don't bother us when we're trying to save him.

182
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,240
It's Xuan Xuan's first time sleeping on her own.

183
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,750
She definitely won't be able to fall asleep.

184
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,750
I'll go tell the kids a bedtime story.

185
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,150
The kids will fall asleep, then I'll fall asleep, too.

186
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,800
This is the plan.

187
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,560
Little Princess.

188
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,450
I'm here to tell you a bedtime story.

189
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,480
No!

190
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,250
Take it easy! Xuan Xuan, you...

191
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,520
Wait, baby...

192
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,190
These kids...

193
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,240
That was my only way out.

194
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,020
I guess I need to take a shower while he's not there,

195
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,370
then, I'll pretend to be asleep.

196
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,500
Our relationship

197
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,800
is evolving faster than I expected.

198
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,380
Now that we're married,

199
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,040
I don't have to study up on how to win over a girl.

200
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,950
What I need to do now is act the part of a husband.

201
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,010
At least I can't let Grandpa and Xuan Xuan see through our lies.

202
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,610
Don't do anything

203
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,210
that you yourself wouldn't even believe,

204
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:49,090
or something that even you, yourself, would think is fake.

205
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,150
I'll have to get along well with her,

206
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,570
and learn more about her

207
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,140
to make it seem more real.

208
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,100
She probably only married me because of what's going on in her life right now.

209
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,980
But would she be willing to pretend to be a loving couple

210
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,020
just for show?

211
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,790
Is it something we can achieve flawlessly?

212
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,810
Whatever. Either way, I have to get myself into character first.

213
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,390
Don't touch me! What are you...

214
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,120
S-Song Haoyu...

215
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,580
This doesn't seem appropriate, does it?

216
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,860
Would it be appropriate for me to stay here and watch you shower?

217
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,510
We can't go too fast.

218
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,780
It was real.

219
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,660
A real heart flutter.

[The Third Child Policy is Finally Here!]

221
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,430
This is beyond dropping hints, right?

222
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,280
It'll be too late if we don't talk about this now.

223
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,900
She'll understand if I ease into it

224
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,250
and beat around the bush, right?

225
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,210
I can be subtle and lay it on him gradually, right?

226
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,810
How to have an unforgettable wedding night with your husband.

227
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,970
Men are very fragile during intimacy.

228
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,380

229
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,810
- Sile, I think it's time that we...
- D-Don't get me wrong...

230
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,450
There's no rush!

231
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,660
- I want to talk to you.
- I want to talk to you.

232
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,330
Y-You first, then.

233
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,350
I know we just got married,

234
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,710
and there's a lot of adjusting we need to do.

235
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,620
I agree with that.

236
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,820
Since we're a legally married couple,

237
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,730
we have duties to fulfill.

238
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,890
I hope you can cooperate fully.

239
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,750
He means "that" when he says duty, right?

240
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,500
And he wants me to fully cooperate with him? What kind of request is that?

241
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,870
Well... I don't think that's appropriate right now...

242
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,480
Sile.

243
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,280
I'm sure you're aware that Grandpa is getting older and he isn't in great health.

244
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,930
The only way he won't worry about us

245
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,790
is if we have a good relationship with each other.

246
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,330
You should understand what I mean, right?

247
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,560
A good relationship? Of course, I understand.

248
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,100
Yes, I understand. I understand.

249
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,290
Our children are already so old. How could I not understand?

250
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:14,710
In that case, we should try to get to know each other better,

251
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,490
so that things go more smoothly for us down the line.

252
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,230
What?

253
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,970
Don't be nervous. The first step to being husband and wife is to get to know each other.

254
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,460
The first step to being husband and wife?

255
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,380
Do you like this?

256
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,290
Or interlocking all ten fingers?

257
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,470
Either is fine.

258
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,360
Then...

259
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,790
Is this okay?

260
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,770
Just now, on the phone it said that men's self-esteem is really fragile.

261
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,450
Will I hurt him if I tell him no?

262
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,650
In the future...

263
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,890
I'll be doing this often.

264
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,280
Are... you okay?

265
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,290
Your heart is beating so fast.

266
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:20,190
My heartbeat is racing?

267
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,280
Are you not used to it?

268
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:31,410
You were acting really natural in front of Grandpa during the day.

269
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,530
It's not that I'm not used to it.

270
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,170
I'm just...

271
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,280
Are... you okay?

272
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,920
I'm fine. You g-get up first.

273
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,400
Okay.

274
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,820
- What's wrong?
- You're yanking on my hair.

275
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,530
Oh...

276
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,900
It hurts!

277
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,890
Sorry.

278
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,480
Wait! Hold on!

279
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,550
Stop moving!

280
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,960
Are you okay?

281
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,460

00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,160
I don't approve.

356
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,630
We've already... gotten the marriage license.

357
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,410
- You've already gotten the marriage license?
- You've already gotten the marriage license?

358
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:44,640
You're always so impulsive. Don't you consider your own life?

359
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,610
Listen to me first. I trust him.

360
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,260
I'm willing to believe him.

361
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,960
You both just barely met, but he proposed. For Xuan Xuan, he's contributing effort and money.

362
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,740
And he asks for nothing from you, so it's for... love?

363
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,150
Isn't this too much like a fairy tale?

364
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,820
Are you telling me a fairy tale? It's not real.

365
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,190
How is getting married not real?

366
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:12,670
But, you've even brought her to the office to make it public, this is fantastical as it is!

367
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,690
I get it.

368
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,630
Hey...

369
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,050
But...

370
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,790
Since it's not because she's pregnant or for a business reasons,

371
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,610
I really can't think of any reason that could push you into love's graveyard.

372
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,010
What if he has an ulterior motive toward you? This won't do.

373
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,010
I'm still worried.

374
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:37,070
Arrange for him to eat with us today. Let me have a look.

375
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,090
Today?

376
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,340
Sile.

377
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,310
Best friend?

378
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,360
Miss Li at Xuan Xuan's kindergarten?

379
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,080
Sure. Text me the location. I'll be right over.

380
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,190
Having a date with your wife?

381
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,400
Yes, she said her best friend wants to meet me.

382
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,340
It's not good to have two against one. I'll help you.

383
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:30,620
President Song, let me get straight to the point.

384
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,360
Do you have a special reason for marrying our Sile?

385
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,840
Sile, I've cut it up for you.

386
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,100
Here. Eat more.

387
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,830
That's right. I married Sile for a special reason.

388
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,720
She's always facing a lot of problems on her own.

389
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,490
My heart aches for her.

390
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,990
Your heart aches are often the beginning of love.

391
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:09,230
Love? They're like this piece of steak, still rare.

392
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,180
Rare means it's fresh,

393
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,740
that there's more room for growth. It'll be even better when they warm up.

394
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,160
But if the fire gets too strong, then you won't be able to cut through it.

395
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:25,070
Miss Li, you knife is upside down.

396
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,120
Do you two really not know each other?

397
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,760
President Song, do you really understand our Sile?

398
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,270
Or, let's be more direct. What is it about her that you love?

399
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,740
[Please Be My Family]

400
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:14,950

♫ I want to embrace all the possibilities ♫

412
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,100
♫ An ode to time ♫

413
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:21,250

♫ The moment we fell in love ♫

417

♫ From this moment ♫

418
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:41,450
♫ I'm running toward you ♫

419
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,720
♫ Gone through the maze of time ♫

420
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,890
♫ You are still in my heart ♫

421
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:53,180
♫ We have too many encounters ♫

422
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,420
♫ And has always been in a hurry ♫

423
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:04,200
♫ I once forgotten the love we had ♫

424
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,520
♫ The moment you made my heart flutter ♫
