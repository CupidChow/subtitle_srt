As to why I'm helping her?

359
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,840
It's because she did a lot for me before,

360
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,020
as an old friend,

and I've become ill...

374
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,790
will you treat me the same way?

Don't worry, President Song. I took care of the things you asked me to do these past few days when you were gone.
