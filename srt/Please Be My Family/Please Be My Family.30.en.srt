00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,540
The most important thing is he has you in his heart.

179
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,580
Just pick another day and go again.

180
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,730
Right. Think about it.

181
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,310
Even if you and Hao Jun break up,

182
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,910
there are plenty of men everywhere.

183
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,250
You can find a better guy.

184
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,660
I don't want to. I just want Hao Jun.

185
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,950
You just want Hao Jun.

186
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:01,130
Look, Haoyu and I overcame lots of obstacles to get where we are today.

187
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,190
So, I've been thinking recently that

188
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:08,350
the right person is the best place for love.

189
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,600
You're right. So, if you want to get your marriage license,

190
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,610
you don't have to care which day you go. Just go when you want to.

191
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,920
- Exactly.
- You're right.

192
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,340
I don't care if it takes three tries.

193
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,650
Even if we get it 30 years later, I'm okay with that.

194
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,080
If Hao Jun dares run from me, I'll break his legs.

195
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,430
I'll help you.

196
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,410
Me too.

197
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,160
Hello, Haoyu.

198
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,950
It's fine. I'm with Luoqi. She'll send me home later.

199
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,120
What? Bird's nest?

200
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,020
Isn't it too early for me to be having that?

201
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,690
Okay, okay, I got it.

202
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,120
I'll drink it when I'm back. Bye bye.

203
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,070
Best friend, there's something you definitely still don't know yet.

204
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,530
What is it?

205
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:09,600
Qi Sile is pregnant.

206
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,630
You just found out?

207
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:17,070
We forgot to tell you the day we were at the hospital.

208
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,220
Qi Sile!

209
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,770
What's wrong? Are you okay?

210
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,910
I might have stirred up the energy in the womb.

211
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,130
Energy in the womb.

212
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,370
Does it hurt a lot? Do you want to go to the hospital?

213
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,450
- No, no, I'll be fine after some rest.
- Let's rub it.

214
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,250
Stirred up the energy in the womb, did you?

215
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,240
This won't do. You have to go to the hospital. Let's go.

216
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,810
It's fine. Sit down.

217
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,060
- I'll be fine after some rest.
- She just needs to rub it.

218
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,550
Is your baby in your stomach?

219
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,790
Why do the two of you love putting on an act so much?

220
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,980
Why do you love putting on an act?

221
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,550
What are you doing? Stop it!

222
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,080
- She really did stir up the energy in the womb.
- All right!

223
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,150
Qi Sile, you little liar!

224
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,190
Okay, okay.

225
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,950
Sile, here.

226
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,840
Have some bird's nest.

227
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,290
Is it good?

228
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,670
Your hair is still damp. I'll blow dry it for you.

229
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,790
I don't want you to catch a cold.

230
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,940
Sile.

231
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,190
I saw Grandpa... go back to his room earlier.

232
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:48,090
So, you want to sleep here tonight?

233
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,710
Can I?

234
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,340
Didn't Grandpa tell you not to sleep in here?

235
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,880
I'll sleep here just for tonight.

236
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,660
Haoyu, are you in there?

237
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,450
I'm coming in.

238
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,090
- Grandpa.
- Grandpa.

239
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,490
You brat. I knew you were in here.

240
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,340
Grandpa, I was helping Sile blow dry her hair. It was still wet and she might catch a cold.

241
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,840
No. You can't stay here. Come out.

242
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,490
Dry your hair yourself. Don't catch a cold.

243
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,420
Why did you go to her room again?

244
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,300
I want to sleep in my own room.

245
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,400
Didn't I tell you? You can't sleep in the same bed during the first trimester?

246
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,820
I wasn't planning on doing anything.

247
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,340
Also, we're a legally married couple, cuddled up and sleeping together is appropriate.

248
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,920
Appropriate? Cuddled up?

249
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,870
One thing leads to another. What will you do then?

250
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,750
Grandpa, your bed is too hard.

251
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,170
I can't sleep well there. I still have work tomorrow.

252
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,590
Sleeping on a hard mattress is good for young people like you.

253
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:23,100
Why would you sleep on a soft mattress? Go back to bed with me.

254
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,980
- Sile.
- Yes!
- Get to bed soon, okay?

255
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,810
All right, Grandpa.

256
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,190
Let's go.

257
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,350
Okay, that's good enough. You can stop now.

258
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,380
Give it to me once it dries.

259
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,860
Boss.

260
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,620
I'm on vacation right now.

261
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,430
I don't care. I want that drawing.

262
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,940
I'll send this to the workshop and start producing the jewelry.

263
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,550
I'm just drawing this for fun. Why are you in such a hurry?

264
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:06,960
This sort of design should see the light of day.

265
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,020
But I drew a cluster of paraiba tourmaline.

266
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,580
Wouldn't it be too risky to launch this as the first product of a new brand?

267
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,400
Am I short of capital that I need you to help me save some?

268
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,580
Either way, if I don't finalize and sign off on it,

269
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,850
you won't be able to take this risk.

270
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,690
You've grown bolder. Do you think I won't—

271
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,960
- What are you doing?
- My womb is kind of...

272
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,180
Are you okay?

273
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,890
It's fine, it's fine. I'll be fine after I drink some water.

274
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,650
Qi Sile.

275
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,080
You really have me under your thumb.

276
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,480
Remember to eat the nutritional products I bought you.

277
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,780
- I got it.
- I'm leaving.

278
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,940
Wifey, the desserts are ready. Come and have some.

279
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,240
What's wrong?

280
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,120
She definitely doesn't know.

281
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,720
We're not even sleeping in the same room right now.

282
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,340
Don't worry.

283
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,770
Sure.

284
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,190
Let me think of a time.

285
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,000
When can I move back into our room?

286
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,530
Just a little while more.

287
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,440
Who’s calling me now?

288
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,840
Sile.

289
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,870
It’s work, I’m going to go take this call.

290
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,370
Okay.

291
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,430
Hello.

292
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,790
Why did you call me at this time?

293
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,290
Okay. You can tell me. I'm away from her.

294
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,820
That’s fine. All right then.

295
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,240
Let's follow the original plan.

296
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,400
That exciting? You sure have a lot of ideas.

297
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,800
Then we'll meet when the time comes. Bye-bye.

298
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,070
I'll go first.

299
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,090
Okay.

300
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,120
I think this matter probably isn't that serious.

301
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,110
That's right.

302
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,740
This isn't serious?

303
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:23,200
No, wait, I mean, we've been through highs and lows already.

304
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,440
Now behind my back, he's secretly...

305
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,210
- What can you prove from this?
- Right.

306
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,240
- You know your man best.
- She's right.

307
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,210
- Would he cheat?
- Right.

308
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,250
No.

309
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,040
- Exactly.
- That's right.

310
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:50,060
Why do I think both of you are also acting suspiciously?

311
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,340
- No.
- Are we?

312
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,530
Am I suspicious? You're the suspicious one.

313
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,750
It's very strange.

314
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,550
I'm telling you, you have anxiety. You see everyone the same way.

315
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:04,190
- Why do I have anxiety? It's obviously—
- Beloved Consort,

316
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,970
married women need to learn to grow.

317
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,750
- Not like you, making a big fuss about everything.
- Exactly.

318
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,620
How am I making a big fuss? I'm very calm. I'm analyzing this with you two—

319
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,550
I suddenly feel sleepy. How about we end it here today? Go back and rest.

320
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,770
- I feel sleepy indeed now that you mention it.
- We're tired.

321
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,240
I can't even keep my eyes open.

322
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,520
Fine, I'm leaving then.

323
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,990
I'm leaving.

324
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,590
Good night.

325
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,560
Haoyu!

326
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,430
Haoyu!

327
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:03,020
♫ Why am I somehow obsessed with you? ♫

328
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:08,170
♫ It's like a seed in my heart waiting to bear fruit ♫

329
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,200
♫ I'm only aware afterwards ♫

330
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,530
♫ I realized I'm lost when you're not here with me ♫

331
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,820
♫ If it's possible ♫

332
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,390
♫ Let's not be strangers and become lovers ♫

333
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:27,480
♫ When you're in my life, only then can my life be fulfilled ♫

334
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,350
♫ Love has no preconceived notions ♫

335
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:36,670
Sile, the first time I proposed to you, it was too hasty. It has always been a regret of mine.

336
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:41,500
So I prepared a long time for this moment.

337
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,990
I know... there are many variables in life.

338
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:57,730
But in my life, the only thing that remains unchanged is wanting to be with you.

339
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,300
Are you willing to spend a lifetime together with me?

340
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,790
Yes, I am.

341
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,760
♫ When you're in my life, my dreams are complete ♫

342
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,390
♫ If it's possible ♫

343
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:19,900
♫ Let's not be strangers and become lovers ♫

344
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,980
♫ When you're in my life, only then can my life be fulfilled ♫

345
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,380
♫ Love has no preconceived notions ♫

346
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,500
♫ I'm the only one how knows you best ♫

347
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,070
What's wrong?

348
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:38,740
So those secret phone calls you kept making behind my back was for this?

349
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,300
I'll come clean. The person Haoyu has been fooling around with was me.

350
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,320
You...

351
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,680
All of you knew?

352
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,040
Okay. Now I've finally made up for my regret.

353
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,380
But I have a regret!

354
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,140
What regret?

355
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,970
Wait, I...

356
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,790
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

357
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,090
I came down wearing pajamas.

358
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,750
Why are you like this? You should at least let me comb my hair.

359
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,700
Why are you so annoying? Can we redo it?

360
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,030
Can we redo it?

361
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,990
♫ Love has no preconceived notions ♫

362
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:29,790
♫ I'm the only one how knows you best ♫

363
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:33,410
♫ I will spend this lifetime proving it ♫

364
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,460
Get ready!

365
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,130
One, two, three.

366
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:56,880
♫ I thought I missed the rainbow ♫

367
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,800
♫ It turns out, it's been transferred to your eyes ♫

368
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:10,130
♫ The commotion stirs my memory like tidal waves ♫

369
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:18,950
♫ Not surprising the light only meet in the dark ♫

370
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,850
♫ From this moment ♫

371
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:25,320
♫ I want to sing softly about us ♫

372
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,850
♫ Going to fill my world with wonderful dreams ♫

373
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:33,530
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

374
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:40,820
♫ The sun rises and sets in all four seasons ♫

375
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:47,190
♫ It can't be compared to a minute of our embrace ♫

376
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,020
♫ From this moment ♫

377
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,460
♫ I want to embrace all the possibilities ♫

378
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,010
♫ An ode to time ♫

379
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:00,130
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

380
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:04,150
Because you came late, I used to think life was nothing more than this.

381
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:09,930
Turning back to see every step of the past, it turns out it was all so I could meet you.

382
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:18,260
You became my weakness and made me understand what it mean to gain and lose something.

383
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,550
You became my armor and made me no longer afraid of relying on someone.

384
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:26,510
Sile, I still have a lot of things to tell you.

385
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,420
Where should I start?

386
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,180
Life is long. You can tell me slowly. I'll take my time to listen.
