You see, most of our products at Fanyi are one-of-a-kind pieces.

73

They might have collectible value,

74

but for the same reason, they aren't price friendly.

00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,370
When I recalled the proposal, I just...

176
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,520
I told you to give both of you time to calm down,

177
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,390
so that she can slowly start doing things for you.

178
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,880
Who told you immediately to—

179
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,160
Hao Jun.

180
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,340
I have to tell you something.

181
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,180
What is it, Sister-in-law?

182
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,760
Li Xin

183
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,680
has been underperforming at work due to her bad mood.

184
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,850
She might be at risk of being fired.

185
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,430
What do we do then?

186
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,520
I don't know.

187
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,850
She said she wants to return to her hometown.

188
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,990
With how her mom is, she's going to have a hard time.

189
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,690
What will her mom do? Scold her?

190
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,060
Not necessarily.

191
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,930
Her mom has always been forcing her to go on blind dates.

192
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,590
If she goes back this time, she's highly likely to get married.

193
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,690
Married?

194
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,630
Oh right, that's a total possibility.

195
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,350
Li Xin had asked Sile to help her go on a blind date once.

196
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,260
I even caught them red-handed.

197
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,870
Say something useful.

198
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:03,990
She asked Sile to go to those blind dates because the frequency level is just too high.

199
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,150
- There are too many candidates.
- Exactly.

200
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,000
It'll be worse when she goes back.

201
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,160
No, I must go find her now.

202
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
I must make her stay. If she loses her job, I'll take care of her!

203
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,540
Hold on.

204
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,000
What should I do then, Sister-in-law?

205
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,300
Don't panic.

206
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,190
We can analyze this thing deeply first.

207
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,100
I didn't expect you still lived here.

208
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,610
How have you been?

209
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,810
What are you doing here?

210
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,500
I know what happened back then

211
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,130
has always been something you've never gotten over.

212
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,240
But it's been bothering me for many years,

213
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,590
because I didn't apologize to you in person.

214
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,710
Can you spare me some time?

215
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,890
My feelings for you back then were true.

216
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,930
But I really didn't want to give up the opportunity to debut.

217
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,200
So, I chose to give up our relationship.

218
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,070
I'm sorry.

219
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,110
How interesting.

220
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,830
What did you say?

221
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,990
I've imagined countless times,

222
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,530
that if you show up in front of me,

223
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:32,550
what kind of manner should I face you?

224
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,980
I really didn't expect

225
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,660
it would feel like this.

226
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,020
How do you feel?

227
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,950
Nothing.

228
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,810
You should go. The past is in the past.

229
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,170
You're not the one I want to see.

230
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,600
Li Xin.

231
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,540
What on exactly is going on between you two?

232
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,490
Who?

233
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,490
Your boyfriend. He approached me.

234
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,910
What did he say?

235
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,040
He threatened me and told me to explain things to you in person.

236
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,740
You refused to see me then, right?

237
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,400
Yes.

238
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,390
I'll give you the answer you want to hear.

239
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,480
I was wrong for leaving without saying goodbye.

240
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,480
But when that contract deal was placed in front of me,

241
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,180
I needed to seize the opportunity.

242
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,690
These are all the songs I sang at that bar.

243
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,950
I'm returning it to you now.

244
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,340
So that's the solution he came up with.

245
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,270
He wanted me to get over it.

246
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,590
Although I don't know what happened between you two,

247
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,970
but I think he cares about you a lot.

248
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:56,550
♫ Reminds me of your gentleness, exquisiteness, and breathlessness ♫

249
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,840
Yes, you're right.

250
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,070
Hao Jun, you fool.

251
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,480
♫ You were too honest when we first met ♫

252
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,760
♫ You told me you're not handsome ♫

253
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,110
♫ But you give me time to understand you better ♫

254
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,290
Here.

255
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:46,350
♫ Whoever arranged this, my future is no longer empty ♫

256
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,850
♫ Although I'm not very surprised ♫

257
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,100
♫ Who anticipate for the worst? ♫

258
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,550
♫ I'm afraid of moving too fast and the uncertainty of the future ♫

259
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,620
♫ I wonder how to express this feeling ♫

260
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:04,210
♫ I should be open-minded cause of love shining bright ♫

261
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,680
♫ I think love is... ♫

262
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,690
Sile.

263
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,660
How are you doing?

264
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,220
I'm almost done.

265
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,640
Look. Pearls wrapped in a platinum inlay

266
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,310
signifies the love of a baby wrapped in a swaddle.

267
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,940
Although it's handled with much care,

268
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,120
but it's still very vulnerable and needs protection. What'd you think?

269
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,690
Oh. Well...

270
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,890
The symbolism is excellent.

271
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,900
And the design is very sophisticated.

272
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,510
Really?

273
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,990
Okay, that's enough. Time for bed.

274
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,550
Not yet.

275
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,800
I don't have time to waste. Chinese Valentine's Day is almost here.

276
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,920
I have to finish it up quickly.

277
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,510
I don't know why,

278
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,700
but I don't really have any inspiration today.

279
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,300
Come here.

280
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,590
I'll give you some inspiration.

281
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,850
- I got it!
- What did you think of?

282
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,760
Half will be platinum and the other will be black gold.

283
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,720
It'll have the Chinese elements of yin and yang

284
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,500
and symbolize the two sides of love.

285
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,340
Take you for example.

286
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,150
Me?

287
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,030
You're vicious and love to put on an act,

288
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,660
yet you're very responsible.

289
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,810
Although you only do things that benefit you and have lots of tricks up your sleeve,

290
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,860
but you treat me very sincerely.

291
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,870
Are you complimenting or insulting me?

292
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,820
Of course, I'm complimenting you.

293
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,950
I was trying to say that everything has two sides to it.

294
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,170
Just like a relationship or humans,

295
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,320
nothing is absolutely black and white, right or wrong.

296
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,900
This concept is amazing, right?

297
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,180
Loving someone means loving everything that they are.

298
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,560
Loving someone means loving everything that they are.

299
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,940
This is great. I'll change the color.

300
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:00,110
This will definitely be a popular design.

301
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,630
[Hao Jun]

302
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,810
What should I say to him?

303
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,340
Direcror is here.

304
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,370
- Have you pulled yourself together?
- Yes.

305
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,670
Thank you for your concern, Director.

306
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,250
That's good then.

307
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,500
Is everyone here?

308
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,510
Yes.

309
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,150
Before the kids go for their blood test,

310
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,850
they'll be entering the school in batches.

311
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,180
Don't let them gather at the school gate.

312
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,230
Who will be the one in the panda costume at the gate?

313
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,960
Director, that's me.

314
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,720
Other than encouraging the kids,

315
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,050
you have to cooperate with the security guards

316
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,550
to strengthen safety and security.

317
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,210
I understand.

318
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,850
Wow! You didn't cry at all today, Xixi.

319
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,390
Here's a flower for being so brave.

320
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,520
Thank you, Panda.

321
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,710
Sir, who's in that bear costume?

322
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,160
It's so hot.

323
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,530
Why isn't she out yet?

324
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,820
The surprise Sile arranged

325
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,660
is a little torturous.

326
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,340
I don't know. You should be the only one in a costume here.

327
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,590
That's definitely not one of us.

328
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,190
Human traffickers are getting smarter.

329
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:19,080
Once you sense something is wrong, take action right away.

330
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,020
Sir, let's go take a look.

331
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,160
Where did you come from? You— Hey!

332
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,000
Hey! That bear is assaulting people!

333
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,590
How dare you kick me? Sir, wait here for me. I'll chase after him!

334
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,150
Stop there, you evil bear!

335
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,140
Stop running!

336
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,980
Stop right there!

337
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,270
Are you crazy? Why are you still chasing me?

338
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,880
Damn you.

339
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,340
You can run pretty fast.

340
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,200
You're crazy. Stop chasing me!

341
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,080
S-Stop running.

342
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,820
Run, why don't you? Are you okay?

343
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,170
Are you okay?

344
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,880
How dare you shout at me?

345
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,770
You seem completely fine!

346
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,050
I'll beat you to death!

347
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,740
Don't! Don't!

348
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,060
Who said you could run?

349
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,150
- Who said you could target the kids at the kindergarten?
- Stop hitting me!

350
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,740
- Run, why don't you?
- Stop hitting me!

351
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,310
You're a Class 2 animal under state protection,

352
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,900

530
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,800
♫ Forever protected ♫

531
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:24,310
♫ The moment we fell in love ♫

532
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,940
♫ From this moment ♫

533
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:32,000
♫ I'm running toward you ♫

534
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,300
♫ Gone through the maze of time ♫

535
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,660
♫ You are still in my heart ♫

536
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,880
♫ We have too many encounters ♫

537
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,080
♫ And has always been in a hurry ♫

538
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:54,950
♫ I once forgotten the love we had ♫

539
00:34:54,950 --> 00:35:00,810
♫ The moment you made my heart flutter ♫
