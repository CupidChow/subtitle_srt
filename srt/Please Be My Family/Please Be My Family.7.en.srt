President Song, do you really know our Sile?

23
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,740
Or, let's be more direct.

24
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,340
What is it about her that you love?

25
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,680
Didn't I say it a moment ago?

26
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,580
She always forces herself to face everything alone,

27
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,410
and also loves to act calm.

28
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,310
Yet clearly her heart is very fragile and sensitive.

29
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,270
Because of that, she always has a mask on,

30
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,730
afraid to let others see through it.

31
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,280

I want to become the only one in your life who you can let your guard down with.

37
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,770
You're talking about yourself, right?

38
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,460
What do you mean?

Tapping finger.

40
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,780
It's a bad habit you have when strategizing.

41
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,950
You can't deceive me.

42
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,500
Li Xin asked you what you like about Qi Sile.

44
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,940
Your answer was evidently manipulating the plan.

45
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,780
You're acting.

46
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,340
- I'm planning a marriage.
- A marriage without love?

Haoyu.

48
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,360
- I've seen how you are when you truly love someone.
- Hao Jun!

49
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,260
You better not think that you know me that well.

50
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,220
Looks like what Li Xin said was correct.

51
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,210
You have a motive for

52
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,700
marrying her.

53
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,240
So what?

54
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,790
I honestly don't understand you anymore. What do you want to do exactly?

55
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,850
I know what I'm doing, so don't worry about it.

56
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,990
What do you think? Are you satisfied?

57
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,780
Before, what you said about finding a man who loves you,

58
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,330
I won't deny that now.

59
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,130
Don't worry. I'll definitely get along with him and live happily together.

60
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,230
I won't make you worry about me.

61
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,380
How can I not worry about you?

62
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,790
Even if Chen Chen's father is very well-known in Jiangyuan.

63
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,370
But I just think he's not good enough for you.

64
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,350
It turns out I'm the best in your heart.

Don't hold me down, I'm going to fly a little.

00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,600

- Got it.

68

Hey.

69
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,060
Then are you going to have your wedding in

70
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,780
Madagascar or New Zealand?

71
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,400
Wait. It's winter in New Zealand right now.

72
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,360
They haven't mentioned anything about the wedding yet.

73
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,060
That's not right.

74
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,680
A wedding is the most important event in a woman's life.

75
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,790
The main point is to put in the highest priority.

76

Why are you just like my mom?

77
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,010
No, no, no. I can't even compare to Ms. Liu.

78
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,330
Oh, wait. Do your parents know about this?

79
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,680
Did your father... cause you any trouble?

80
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,140
No. It went pretty smoothly.

81
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,510
That's rare.

82
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,680

83
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,320
he is good to me.

84
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,750
Should I also slowly approach him to return his affection?

85
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,930
Well...

86
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,710
Although I don't believe in love,

87
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,480
but I want you to have it and live happily.

88
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,590
- Leaving now!
- Bye Bye.

89
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,630
I want to become the only one in your life who you can let your guard down with.

90
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,870
You can be yourself when you're with me.

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,530
I think Song Haoyu is treating me sincerely.

92
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,840

102
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,890
Sile? Your dad is busy.

103
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,270
What did you want to say to me just now?

104
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,760
Oh.

105
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,130
Mom, actually I...

106
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,930
Huh?

107
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,260
What's wrong?

108
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,250
Sile, did something happen?

109
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,080
No, nothing, it's not important.

110
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,020

The little doggie.

114
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,130

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,530
Okay. Let me teach you then.

179
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,840
Here.

180
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,550
Put your primary hand

181
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,310
and support hand

182
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,920
and the ball in a straight line.

183
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,870
Harden your fingers.

184
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,580
Between the thumb and forefinger...

185
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,230
use your eyes to aim at the target.

186
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,440
Shoot!

187
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,160
What are you doing?

188
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,230
I heard you like to play pool, so

189
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,250
I wanted to come practice, and then play with you.

190
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,470
No need.

191
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,360
What's the matter with you?

192
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,440
Are you angry because I touched your stuff?

193
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,650
You shouldn't have come here.

194
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,100
I only wanted to know more about you.

195
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,880
Qi Sile.

196
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,570
This is my private space. You don't need to understand.

197
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,600
I know for our relationship

198
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,380
you put in a lot of effort.

199
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,260
That's why... I wanted to do something for you.

200
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,330
Was I wrong?

201
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,080
Aside from what you previously agreed to,

202
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,920
in front of the kids and Grandpa,

203
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,250
we don't need to do anything other than act well.

204
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,460
Act?

205
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,860
Haven't we been working well together lately?

206
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,540
I hope we can work together happily in the future.

207
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,200
All ready?

208
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,130
Let's go. Grandpa and the kids are waiting for us.

209
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,040
Morning.

210
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,320
Let's get a marriage license.

211
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,260
I think our complementary needs

212
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,620
are very suitable for living together.

213
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,200
Put on an act, right?

214
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,520
I'll definitely be more professional than you at it.

215
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,100
I hope you can promise me not to come here again. Okay?

216
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,010
Okay. No problem.

217
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,970
Since it's like this, then let's take this opportunity

218
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,720
to rationalize our marriage relationship.

219
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,920
Rationalize?

220
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,310
I want to have a preliminary agreement with you.

221
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,300
Go ahead.

222
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,290
Since you can, even in front of my best friend,

223
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,150
pretend and act so perfectly.

224
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,080
Then I hope in front of everyone else,

225
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,420
you can stay this professional. Can you do that?

226
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,080
Okay.

227
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,700
You wouldn't find it tiring, right?

228
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,690
Also, we won't interfere with each other's private lives.

229
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,490
No problem. What else?

230
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,630
Also, do you want me to make it more clear?

231
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,940
Regardless if it's relationships, work, or daily life,

232
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,440
we won't interfere with each other's futures.

233
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,980
That's fine. Since we won't interfere with each other's futures,

234
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,780
then don't ask about each other's pasts.

235
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,900
Okay.

236
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,280
All right. Put all those balls away.

237
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:42,760
♫ I thought I missed the rainbow ♫

238
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:49,700
♫ It turns out, it's been transferred to your eyes ♫

239
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:56,030
♫ The commotion stirs my memory like tidal waves ♫

240
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:04,850
♫ Not surprising the light only meet in the dark ♫

241
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,690
♫ From this moment ♫

242
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,210
♫ I want to sing softly about us ♫

243
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,680
♫ Going to fill my world with wonderful dreams ♫

244
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,050
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

245
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,650
♫ The sun rises and sets in all four seasons ♫

246
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:33,190
♫ It can't be compared to a minute of our embrace ♫

247
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,370
♫ From this moment ♫

248
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,480
- Daddy, let's go.
- Where are we going?

249
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,430
Daddy, you made mommy mad. Let's go.

250
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,280
That is an adult matter, you don't have to take care of it.

251
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,830
Go to your room.

252
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,500
You made mommy mad, I have to take care of it!

253
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,330
Song Xingchen. Don't make me say it again!

254
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,860
You bully me!

255
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,760
You make me so angry!

256
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,850
Daddy is a bad daddy!

257
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,660
♫ The moment you made my heart flutter ♫
♫ From this moment ♫

258
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,000
This was a fake marriage, to begin with.

259
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,990
A fake family.

260
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,970
She and I should both well aware of this.

261
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,050
She plays her role as a wife well.

262
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,250
I play my role as a husband well.

263
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,610
We won't be able to continue acting for long anyway.

264
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,190
♫ And has always been in a hurry ♫

265
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,540
♫ I once forgotten the love we had ♫

266
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,890
But why am I so confused right now?

267
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:37,520
♫ The moment of my heart flutter ♫

268
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:42,130
You can't. We can't continue this way.

269
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,190
Mommy, leave with me.

270
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,580
I will take you and leave my Daddy.

271
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,580
Chen Chen. Daddy didn't bully me.

272
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,200
Don't be angry. Okay?

273
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,020
Don't lie to me.

274
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,790
I saw your eyes were red.

275
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,460
Daddy definitely bullied you.

276
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,540
Chen Chen, then can you forgive your daddy, okay?

277
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,920
Poor mommy.

278
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,410
Huh?

279
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:17,280
You must really love my daddy.

280
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,880
But him?

281
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,330
I don't love him anymore.

282
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,270
I won't love him anymore.

283
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,070
Thank you, Chen Chen.

284
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:34,480
I know you want to protect me. I understand.

285
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,450
But I'm too young.

286
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,570
I can't reason with him.

287
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,010
When can I grow up?

288
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,970
I'm so angry.

289
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,920
All right, don't be angry. Don't be angry.

290
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,390
Suddenly, I am happy to have a son.

291
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,490
He knows how to protect me.

292
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,110
Thank you, Chen Chen.

293
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,600
Because I love you!

294
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,410
I love you, too.

295
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:10,160
But I don't love daddy anymore. I'm not happy.

296
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,700
Then how can you be happy again?

297
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,380
How about you let me see your treasure, okay?

298
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,550
What? This is all girly stuff.

299
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:32,630
Not as fun as my Transformer.

300
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,050
Oh.

301
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,900
Mommy made these herself.

302
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,090
This is a treasure, be gentle, don't throw it.

303
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,840
Chen Chen. Xuan Xuan is right.

304
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,040
I also want to tell you.

305
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,370
No matter how angry in the future, you can't throw stuff, okay?

306
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,280
Why can't I throw stuff?

307
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,380
Daddy also tells me not to throw things.

308
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,290
But every time I throw it, he'll buy me a new one.

309
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,800
What did he say to you?

310
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,140
"Song Xingchen, I told you not to throw stuff."

311
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,160
"Don't let me see you do this again."

312
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,160
That is your dad. Only talks about the result.

313
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,880
It's broken? Let me see.

314
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,600
How do I fix it?

315
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,170
You don't need to fix it.

316
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:35,670
I'll ask daddy and great-grandpa to buy me a new one!

317
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,370
Chen Chen. How about you buy the transformer yourself?

318
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:46,960
Buy it by myself? But I'm a kid. I don't have money.

319
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,970
Then go earn it.

320
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:54,550
Mommy, are we going to take brother to that place?

321
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,850
Chen Chen, we'll sell our stuff in a little bit.

322
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,740
After you make the money, I'll take you to buy a transformer. Okay?

323
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,970
I want to buy this store!

324
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,810
Wow, so cool!

325
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,260
Let's go.

326
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,840
Come take a look. My mommy made these accessories herself. They're pretty!

327
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,430
Such a pretty little girl.

328
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,420
Sister, take a look, they're really good.

329
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,790
Is this really for me?

330
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,960
Yes.

331
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,110
Thank you.

332
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,210
You're welcome.

333
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,900
Bye Bye.

334
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,240
Mommy, she didn’t give me the money. Mommy.

335
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,880
It’s okay, Xuan Xuan. Just take it that we gifted it to her, okay?

336
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,940
You'll know next time then, right?

337
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,450
Look, there are still so many here. It’s all right.

338
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,080
Mommy, I know what to do already.

339
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,680
Huh?

340
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,030
We're selling stuff! We're selling stuff!

341
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,290
- We're selling stuff!
- Mommy, look at brother.

342
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,820
- We're selling stuff!
- Little boy, you're so cute!

343
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,940
You can’t take this for free, you have to pay for it.

344
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,300
- But I don’t like this design.
- I want to drink water.

345
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,930
- Thank you.
- Are you thirsty? Wait a minute.

346
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,450
Are you tired? Do you feel unwell?

347
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,650
Chen Chen.

348
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,470
Brother was here just now.

349
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,460
Chen Chen!

350
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,660
Brother was here just now!

351
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,020
Come here.

352
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,140
- Chen Chen!
- Brother!

353
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,560
- Song Xingchen!
- Brother!

354
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,930
- Chen Chen! Chen Chen! Song Xingchen!
- Brother!

355
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,150
Hello, have you seen my child?

356
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,620
Excuse me, have you seen my son?

357
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,610
He was just over there.

358
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,350
- He's this tall.
- I haven't.

359
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,570
- Brother.
- Chen Chen.

360
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,640
Brother, Brother. Brother!

361
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,650
Brother, Brother...

362
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:22,030
- Hello? Haoyu, I can't find Chen Chen.
- Brother. Brother.

363
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,180
Mommy.

364
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,710
- Mommy!
- Chen Chen!

365
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,650
Chen Chen! Song Xingchen!

366
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,500
Where did you go?! You had me so worried. Do you know that?

367
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,180
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

368
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:42,910
Mommy, this uncle found me.

369
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,270
I'm really grateful to you, thank you very much!

370
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,720
Regarding the matter when Chen Chen almost got lost, I admit that it’s all my fault.

371
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,280
Let me apologize to you first. I'm sorry.

372
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,690
It won't happen next time.

373
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:06,990
Next time?

374
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,600
You're going to bring them to that kind of place again?

375
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,360
I've been selling things at that market for many years.

376
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,490
It isn't the kind of chaotic place you're thinking of.

377
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,240
What I mean is...

378
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,040
Whether or not it's chaotic,

379
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,560
it was unnecessary for you to teach them how to sell things.

380
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,980
But you can't use your experience to replace the children's experience.

381
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,110
If you educate the children like this,

382
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,700
how will they ever figure out the right thing to do?

383
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,010
Can you not push your own interests onto the children?

384
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,870
That's right, these are my own interests. What about it?

385
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:43,540
Who was the one who told me before the wedding that they would adapt to my interests?

386
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:49,380
Oh right, it's all an act. Look at this memory of mine.

387
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,350
I'm talking to you about Chen Chen getting lost. What are you talking about now?

388
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,790
Am I not talking with you about that matter right now?

389
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,360
You sure are funny.

390
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,880
What's the matter with you today?

391
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,580
What's wrong with me?

392
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:07,350
I'll act well in front of everyone, but when no one's around, we've nothing to do with each other.

393
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,280
Please get up.

394
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,260
What do you want?

395
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,620
From now on, I'll sleep here, so as not to bother you.

396
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,240
Whatever.

397
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,260
It's so late. Why aren't you sleeping yet?

398
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,170
Daddy, I...

399
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,370
I'm sorry.

400
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:51,010
Don't be mad with mommy, okay?

401
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:55,020
Didn't I already tell you? Adults and children have their own responsibilities.

402
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,030
I know that this is mommy and your business.

403
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,570
I don't need to worry about it.

404
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,550
Come here.

405
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:11,500
Next time, don't make me and your mommy worry again.

406
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,670
Daddy, great-granpda said that,

407
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,810
boys have to take better care of girls.

408
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,940
Coax mommy nicely, okay?

409
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,880
Why are you doing this again?

410
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,350
Okay, fine. I won't say anymore. I'm very good. I'm going to sleep now.

411
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:48,690
Put the first one here, and the second one there too.

412
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,010
Xuan Xuan, why are you still awake?

413
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:54,560
Uncle, I'm completing my mission.

414
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,100
A mission?

415
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,790
What mission?

416
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,540
Mommy said that

417
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,280
you should do things from beginning to end.

418
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,770
Chen Chen and I went to the market on a mission,

419
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,520
we have to clean up when we get back.

420
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,900
Then, Xuan Xuan, what mission did mommy take you out to do?

421
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,980
The mission of buying toys.

422
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,820
Because brother broke the Transformer.

423
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:23,370
Mommy wants to teach brother what it means to have money.

424
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:28,480
Money needs to be earned, so you need to cherish what you have.

425
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,520
So you're saying the reason mommy took you two to sell things...

426
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,090
to complete the mission was to

427
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,710
teach you two how to cherish your things?

428
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:43,760
Yes. You'll cherish it more if you earn it yourself.

429
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,570
Not only treasures should be cherished, but also you.

430
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,260
Because mommy said you're good to us,

431
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,450
so we have to be nice to you, too.

432
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,920
♫ Gently humming a song, it enters my heart  ♫

433
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,390
What if... just what if...

434
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,510
I didn't expect Mrs. Song's design to have such a good early response.

435
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,360
At present, there are more than a dozen first-line brands,

436
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,480
that all hope to co-operate with us.

437
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,770
♫ I thought I missed the rainbow ♫

438
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,410
What if she isn't thinking of this marriage

439
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,650
and this family as an act.

440
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,040
♫ It turns out, it's been transferred to your eyes ♫

441
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,140
President Song. President Song?

442
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,850
♫ The commotion stirs my memory like tidal waves ♫

443
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,500
The presentation will be held in a month.

444
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,570
Due to too many brands being added temporarily,

445
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,730
many details need to be handled by Mrs. Song herself.

446
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,390
Okay.

447
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,150
I'll personally tell her about this.

448
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:50,660
Then what does all I've done before mean?

449
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,160
[Please Be My Family]

450
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:14,320
♫ I thought I missed the rainbow ♫

451
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:21,270

♫ Going to fill my world with wonderful dreams ♫

♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

458
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:58,330
