[ Please Be My Family]

21
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,070
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Song.

22
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,790
The reservation time for the private room is almost up.

23
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,650
About what time will you arrive?

24
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,060
Just a moment. I need to make a phone call.

25
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,420
Hello, are you coming yet?

26
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,400
Coming? Where to?

27
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,510
At the mall, I've been waiting a long time for you since I got off work.

28
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,610
Why didn't you say anything? I'm already outside eating a midnight snack.

29
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,510
Where are you eating?

30
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,320
At that one I brought you to before, that has river snail vermicelli and stinky tofu.

31
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,400
Wait for me at home.

32
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,650
How can he be like that? I wasn't even done speaking.

33
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,190
I was with him the last time I came here.

34
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,850
Forget it.

35
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,990
Here you go.

36
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,420
Are you still thinking about what we talked about earlier?

37
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,030
You're already married. Why are you still thinking about if he loves you or not?

38
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,980
I'm not. Recently I've been thinking about all sorts of things.

39
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,780
I don't know if I'm thinking too much.

40
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,360
Maybe you two have some sort of misunderstanding.

41
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,550
A married couple should be honest with each other to make life easier.

42
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,350
This thing isn't as simple as being honest with each other.

43
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,270
Some things, when kept to yourself for too long,

44
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,980
in the end, even if you want to say it, you can't anymore.

45
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,410
Why are you suddenly getting emotional?

46
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,970
Is there something troubling you?

47
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,550
Qi Sile!

48
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,430
Why are you here? I thought I said to wait for me at home.

49
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,080
Do you know how long I waited for you outside Maolin?

50
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,190
How would I know? You never told me.

51
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,160
Didn't you say you would behave yourself?

52
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,650
President Song, I think you've misunderstood.

53
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,440
It had better be one.

[Episode 15]

55
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,740
Do you think it's appropriate of you to go out and eat late-night meals with another man?

56
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,420
I originally wanted to invite him to dinner.

57
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,650
But today just happened to be kind of late.

58
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,220
You're my wife. Why are you always so close to him?

59
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,990
Could you please stop saying things that would make me misunderstand?

60
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,250
Misunderstand what?

61
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,850
Are you jealous?

62
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,650
Jealous?

63
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,550
This word doesn't suit me.

64
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,790
What kind of word suits you then?

65
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,210
Uncertain of your feelings? Undefined emotions?

66
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,930
Qi Sile.

67
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,920
Don't you know that I especially came to pick you up after work

68
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,890
- today because...
- Especially pick me up from work?

69
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,960
A husband picking up his wife after work,

70
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,890
might be normal for other people.

71
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,410
But for me... I'm a bit surprised.

72
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,400
What's going on?

73
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,000
How about we make everything clear with each other?

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,470
Okay?

75
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,670
What?

76
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,800
Our relationship is really strange, isn't it?

77
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,170
In the beginning, when we got married,

78
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,500
I had a lot of feelings toward you.

79
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,020
I thought you liked me.

80
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,210
Even if you didn't like me, you must at least have good feelings toward me.

81
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,710
But later I realized...

82
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,570
that I misunderstood it.

83
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:29,690
♫ It turns out, it's been transferred to your eyes ♫

84
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,290
Then after that, you gave promises to my parents, and you're so good to my Xuan Xuan.

85
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,700
I worked really hard to get close to you.

86
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,730
But all you've given me was coldness.

87
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,750
Sile...

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,140
Don't be like this.

89
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,320
There you go again!

90
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,230
You always make some really intimate gesture

91
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,320
towards me, but I feel like your heart is

92
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,420
so far away from me. I really don't know why you're doing this.

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,590
Someone told me before that your heart

96

has been closed for a long time already.

97

But...

98
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,420
who's been there before?

99
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,030
What nonsense are you saying?

100
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,930
That person...

101
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,950

00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,660
I just want an answer.

106
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,130
Am I in your heart at all?

107
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,930

- With your alcohol tolerance, don't drink...
- Hurry up!

114
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,450
I've never seen you like this before. What's going on?

115
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,850
Let's talk first.

116
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,250
What's the situation? You're so abnormal.

117
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,140
I'm so confused right now.

118
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,900
Qi Sile.

119
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,210
I already knew something was wrong with your marriage from the beginning.

120
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:21,220
Maybe I did this wrong from the beginning.

121
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,240
If I had known you married her for Xuan Xuan, I...

122
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,430
Forget it. It's no use saying anything now.

123
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,010
Actually, I've always known from the beginning that I was wrong.

124
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,810
But recently...

125
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,040
I care about this marriage... more and more.

126
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,320
Congratulations Haoyu.

127
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,980
Congratulations to me?

128
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,170
You're in love with her.

129
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,120
You used to say we were acting.

130
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,600
But now when it comes to the feelings you have for me,

131
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,670
you're mute about it.

132
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:16,090
Actually I... only want an answer from you. That's all.

133
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,910
Am I overthinking it again this time?

134
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,990
You're afraid. Afraid if she found out the truth, she would leave you.

135
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,720
So you were silent.

136
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,630
Now you can only regret...

137
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:42,710
think about what can you do to change things around starting from this moment.

138
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,980
Use the rest of your life to love her, and make up the wrong you did.

139
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,690
Was all your reading in vain?

140
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,970
Think about how much she means to you.

141
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,960
What you need to do right now is to show Qi Sile how much you care about her.

142
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Only by saying it out loud, can the other person really hear you in their heart.

143
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,670
Auntie Du!

144
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,670
Can you take this suit and dry clean it for me?

145
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,310
Okay.

146
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,890
- Auntie Du!
- Yes, President Song?

147
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:27,960
Where are Sile's clothes?

148
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,410
She left early this morning.

149
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,240
She took some clothes with her.

150
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,510
- She left?
- She said she was going to Li Mountain to pay respects to her relatives.

151
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,710
When she left, I saw that her eyes were a bit swollen.

152
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,070
Did something happen to you two?

153
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,660
Nothing much. You can go back to your work.

154
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:54,310
Hello, the person you're calling isn't available right now.

155
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,750
Auntie Du, let Grandpa know I went to Li mountain with Sile.

156
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,280
[Construction ahead. Please detour.]

157
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,900
Why is the signal so bad?

158
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,350
What's going on? Why is this road closed again?

159
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,380
This road is closed whenever it rains.

160
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,810
Hello.

161
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,290
Do you know any other way to get up the mountain?

162
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,620
I do know a path, but it's hard to walk.

163
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,580
Can I trouble you to take me there?

164
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,030
Sure. Come with me then.

165
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,300
- Okay. Great.
- Let's go.

166
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,520
Thank you so much.

167
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,880
Thank goodness you know the road,

168
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,870
otherwise, I would've really been going around getting lost.

169
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,940
Here, take this. No need to be polite.

170
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,480
Thank you.

171
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,120
Come this way.

172
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,800
You also like hiking?

173
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,360
I can't really say that I like it, but my hometown is nearby.

174
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,480
So I come here once every year.

175
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,150
And you?

176
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,680
I come here often with my buddy. He's busy this week, so I came here on my own.

177
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,400
Oh, I see.

178
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,460
- Is your bag heavy? I'll help you carry it.
- It's not necessary.

179
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,380
- I can do it myself, thanks.
- No problem.

180
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,360
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Go ahead.

181
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,770
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- What?

182
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,360
No, I just think you're really pretty.

183
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,770
Thank you, I'm already married. I have a husband.

184
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,050
- Slow down, slowly.
- Thank you.

185
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,950
- I'm fine now.
- Come on.

186
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,270
Hey, let go. What are you doing? I'm okay now, thank you.

187
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,560
We are both young people. Don't be so stuck up when we're out having fun.

188

Let go!

- I'm fine.

- Her husband.

Qi Sile, how far away is that so-called Sound Transmission Bridge?

195
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,670
About an hour.

196

You can't walk anymore?

197
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,540
Later, when we pass by the shuttle bus, you should take the bus.

No way.

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,810
I already said. We'll go together

to the top of the mountain to view the scenery.

201
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,000
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine. Just slipped.

202
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,870
You should still take the bus.

203
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,970
It's okay.

204
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,360
It's hard to hike in those shoes anyways.

205
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,610
What if you twist something?

206
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,710
Why are you so agitated?

207
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,420
Am I agitated?

208
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,720
Qi Sile! Don't walk so fast.

209
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,990
- Here, use this as a cushion.
- No need.

210
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:12,930
When I left, Auntie Du gave me some beverages and bread.

211
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,130
Thanks.

212
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,380
The Sound Transmission Bridge that you talked about, what is it exactly?

213
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,440
It's really pretty there.

214
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,130
It's really pretty there.

215
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,450
That place is full of memories of my older sister and I.

216
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,040
I remember when I was young, my sister would take me there.

217
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,700
You also had to walk for an entire day.

218
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,640
She would also pack some snacks in my bag that my parents typically wouldn't let me eat.

219
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,530
The Sound Transmission Bridge is a folk custom in our hometown.

220
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,090
As long as you speak standing in the middle of the bridge,

221
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:56,930
the valley will transmit the message to the heart of the person you miss.

222
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,390
But what you say can't be a lie.

223
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,710
Otherwise, it won't be able to transmit the message.

224
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,140
I would always come here when it's the Qingming Festival,
(TN: Grave Sweeping Day)

225
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:15,690
because the valley will carry my message to my sister's heart.

226
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,950
Only by saying it out loud, can the other person really hear you in their heart.

227
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:29,180
The harder it is for me to say out loud, the further away you are to me.

228
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,250
It's almost like you keep moving forward,

My goodness. How did you two get into such a mess?

350
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,860
Old Qi, Old Qi!

351
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,120
- Dad.
- Dad.

352
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,920
You... What happened to you two?

353
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,560
It's nothing.

354
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,540
It rained on our way back, so...

355
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,380
Hurry, give me your bag. Go wash up and change out of your clothes.

356
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,690
Okay. Mom, cook some yummy food for us.

357
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:22,040
S-She only thinks about eating. They're as dirty as mudskippers.

358
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,800
These two kids...

359
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,540
Look how dirty you are.

360
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,000
You think you're clean?

361
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,270
I'm definitely cleaner than you.

362
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,480
- Later...
- Later...

363
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,350
- You wash up first.
- You wash up first.

364
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,590
You first.

365
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,740
How about...

366
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,100
What are you thinking?

367
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,480
I think it's a good idea.

368
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,570
What's so good about that?

369
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,130
Hello?

370
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,820
Where are you?

371
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,470
Me?

372
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,250
I'm at my friend's place.

373
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,430
Li Xin, come out and let's talk.

374
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,500
Let's grab a meal together.

375
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,060
I'm quite busy lately.

376
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:30,120
But since you're my brother-in-law's buddy,

377
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,260
I'll meet with you.

378
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,250
I'll send you the address.

379
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,230
Okay. I'm hanging up.

380
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:46,200
Since Sile and Haoyu are here, they should stay a few more days.

381
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,180
Yes. Cook some nice food for them.

382
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,060
Of course, we should.

383
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,370
Older Brother, Sister-in-law!

384
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,290
Brother-in-law, Older Sister.

385
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,750
- You're here.
- We're here.

386
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,430
Sile and Haoyu are back. I'm getting ready to cook for them.

387
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,690
It's not... good timing for you to be here.

388
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,080
Your son-in-law is here? That's great timing!

389
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,980
We actually need him.

390
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,420
Why are you laughing?

391
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,120
It's nothing.

392
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,510
What exactly are you laughing at?

393
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:28,150
I'm laughing because I didn't expect you to look so good wearing my dad's clothes.

394
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:35,470
I asked you to wait for me last night. Why did you fall asleep first?

395
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,370
It's broad daylight.

396
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,210
There's another one over there.

397
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,870
I'll be right back.

398
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,220
Haoyu, come here.

399
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,790
Huh?

400
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:05,880
High-end ingredients often only need to be cooked in the simplest way.

401
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,750
The traditional made Xizhuang chilli sauce looks simple and plain.

402
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,100
It doesn't even need to be boiled or cooked.

403
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,680
If we think of the encounters of food ingredients in the sophisticated world,

404
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,810
the Xizhuang chili sauce is an impressive match made in heaven,

405
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:29,040
a touching encounter by chance.

406
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,900
Even more so, it symbolizes the happiness and harmony in the family.

407
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,880
Chop the garlic. You can do it!

408
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,480
I can...

409
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,130
Second Auntie!

410
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,130
It's enough.

411
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,960
Oh my.

412
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,380
I'm shedding tears.

413
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,130
Wait, don't rub your eyes.

414
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,990
Don't rub. Here's another bowl.

415
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,620
Eldest Auntie, it's good enough.

416
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,920
There's still another bowl that hasn't been cut yet.

417
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,790
Why don't you ask Eldest Uncle-in-law or Cousin-in-law? Don't take advantage of my hubby.

418
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,390
Look at this kid.

419
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,510
You only just got married and you're already taking his side?

420
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,050
Aren't you our little endearing cotton vest?
(TN: meaning one who cares a lot)

421
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:33,490
This is such a hot day. Aren't you afraid that this cotton vest will make you get a heat rash?

422
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,420
You really are upset.

423
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:38,300
Shouldn't I watch out for my own hubby? Go, go, go.

424
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,580
Okay, okay. Go take care of him.

425
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,090
Are you... all right?

426
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:49,100
My shoulders ache.

427
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,140
I'll massage them for you.

428
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,360
We men from Xizhuang, are strong-willed our whole lives.

429
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,460
All the important steps

430
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,430
- are done by the men on our own.
- Sure.

431
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,310
- You can't be careless.
- No way.

432
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,290
Here. Haoyu, have a taste.

433
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,780
- See if anything's missing.
- Okay.

434
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,020
- Dad, this chili is too spicy!
- Dad!

435
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,440
- Are you okay?
- Water.

436
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,840
- Water.
- Come. I'll take you to rinse out your mouth.

437
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,100
You're really something. Dad asked you to try the taste, and you actually take a bite.

438
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,850
Why are you all taking advantage of my son-in-law?

439
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,390
That rascal got spicy.

440
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,200
What's the matter?

441
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,110
We have to share the pain.

442
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,240
It's so spicy!

443
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,760
- How can you still laugh?
- Sile!

444
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,280
Hurry and help Haoyu get rinsed at the faucet.

445
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,030
If it gets on him later, it won't just be his mouth that's spicy.

446
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,860
Yes, that's right.

447
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,470
How can you still laugh? Look at you.

448
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,420
The water's over there.

449
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,510
You can use that.

450
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,560
I didn't do it on purpose.

451
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,900
You didn't do it on purpose?

452
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,690
Qi Sile, what are you doing? What are you doing?

453
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,970
Qi Sile, I said I didn't do it on purpose! What are you doing?

454
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,560
I didn't do it on purpose!

455
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:41,130
♫ Why am I somehow obsessed with you? ♫

456
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:46,220

465
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,490
In the recently concluded snooker tournament,

466
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,020
our country's player Jin Xichen won

467
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,650
with a ten-to-five victory over the previous champion.

468
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:37,420
The era of Jin Xichen has arrived in the world of women's snooker in China.

469
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,650
Director Qin, I already saw this news this morning.

470
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,540
What do you think, Director Qin?

471
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,750
When we were in a meeting, President Song never came.

472
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,610
When we called, he never answered.

473
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:54,360
But we can't keep delaying the matter of our endorsement spokesperson.

474
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,820
The spokesperson that I collaborated with

475
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,620
is at most a celebrity star or social influencer.

476
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,190
On this...

477
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,790
I already met with the person in charge of KL yesterday.

478
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,530
He would like to see more international elements at the mall.

479
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:10,250
This way it'll facilitate better resource allocations when they come in.

480
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,590
Director Xie, you're also a major shareholder at Molin.

481
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:16,930
On matters that only take a few shareholders to decide together,

482
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:20,160
there's no need to be obedient to someone else.

483
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,240
On this point, I can help you, Director Xie.

484
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,210
Getting the world champion isn't going to be easy.

485
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,600
What if Miss Jin herself is willing?

486
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,140
You mean, Jin Xichen and you are friends?

487
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,810
No.

488
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,840
But there's a reason that will make her come.

489
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,610
Jin Xichen! Jin Xichen! Jin Xichen!

490
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,460
Can you tell us how you feel coming back to the homeland after three years, Miss Jin?

491
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,190
Miss Jin, is it true that you'll become Maolin's spokesperson?

492
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:56,130
- Miss Jin, what plans do you have next?
- Miss Jin!

493
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,030
Jin Xichen! Jin Xichen!

494
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:05,930
Jin Xichen! Jin Xichen!

495
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:08,520
The fans in the country are so unexpectedly enthusiastic.

496
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,450
A'Lai, where are the children's toys that I asked you to prepare?

497
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:15,090
They're ready, for a five-year-old boy. Don't worry.

498
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,560
Chen Chen must have grown up a lot.

499
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,750
Jin Xichen! Jin Xichen!

00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:20,770
♫ You are still in my heart ♫

522
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,950
♫ We have too many encounters ♫

523
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,100
♫ And has always been in a hurry ♫

524
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:36,990
♫ I once forgotten the love we had ♫

525
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:42,370
♫ The moment you made my heart flutter ♫
