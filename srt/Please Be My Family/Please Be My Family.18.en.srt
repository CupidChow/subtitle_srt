00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,940
Next is the question and answer segment with the reporters.

29
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,580
Miss Jin, the foreign media praises you for being the best female snooker player in the world.

30
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,540
What do you think?

31
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,090
Of course, I think I'm the best.

32
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,540
It's not very humble of me, is it?

33
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,440
Actually, I know I'm not truly the best,

34
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,660
but I think every athlete should be this confident

35
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,740
so they can be victorious on the field.

36
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,400
I heard your journey up until winning the championship was a difficult one.

37
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,140
Would you mind sharing it with us?

38
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,460
It was indeed very difficult. I would even say it was brutal.

39
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,040
At the most crucial point in my life, I gave up a lot.

40
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,980
Included love,

41
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,030
and the promises I had made.

42
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,290
But from the moment I gave up those things,

43
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,420
I've never once regretted it.

44
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,690
But there was no turning back for me. Working hard and pushing forward

45
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,000
was the only way to have an opportunity to reclaim

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,130
what I had lost after the decision.

47
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,130
Now, I'm back.

48
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,560
Thank you.

49
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,630
I heard she gave up her first love for her profession.

50
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,590
Really?

51
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,540

[Episode 18]

54
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,390
- Miss Jin, regarding the romance you mentioned in the interview,
- Excuse Me.

55
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,600
- can you elaborate, please?
- Did you get squished? It's crowded here, be careful.

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,100
- Miss Jin.
- I'm fine. Let's go in.

57
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,220
Miss Jin, can I take a photo with you?

58
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,240
- Of course.
- Thank you.

59
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,530
Take it for me. Make sure it looks good.

60
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,700
Take a few.

61
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,890
- Thank you.
- Haoyu.

62
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,370
Now that the signing is over, let's talk.

63
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,080
Talk... about what?

64
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,210
I saw Chen Chen today.

65
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,950
He's grown up a lot since we last saw each other three years ago.

66
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,360
It must've been hard for you these past few years.

67
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,910
Also,

68
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,630
I miss you a lot.

69
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,010
Haoyu.

70
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,930
Sorry, Miss Jin.

71
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,380
I didn't properly introduce myself just now.

72
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,060
- You are...
- I'm Haoyu's wife.

73
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,530
You're married?

74
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,490
Yes, we're married.

75
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,070
Miss Jin, we both really admire you.

76
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,990
And are very appreciative that you're willing to be Maolin's ambassador.

77
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,490
When did you get married?

78
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,920
It's busy today. I'll have He Qing give you a ride.

79
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,390
We'll get going now. Let's go.

80
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,400
Are you hungry? What do you want to eat?

81
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,390
- I'm fine.
- Here.

82
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,570
Sile. Actually, that was...

83
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,600
I just remembered that Li Xin called and said

84
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,380
she wants to see me. I'm going to go see her for a bit.

85
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,460
I'll give you a ride then.

86
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,110
No, it's okay. It's just at the coffee shop upstairs. I can go by myself.

87
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,000
Then be careful when you come home later.

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,770
Got it!

89
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,230
Hello? Li Xin. Where are you?

90
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,120
What a coincidence.

91
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,690
I was just about to ask you to meet up.

92
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,720
Okay. I'll pick a place and send you my location.

93
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,470
Hao Jun. The situation is urgent.

94
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,600
- I...
- I...

95
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,630
You first.

96
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,890
I don't think...

97
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,940
Hao Jun and I have a future together.

98
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,710
So you don't have to worry about our relationship anymore.

99
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,550
I've thought through this.

100
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,890
Are you okay?

101
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,260
Yes, I'm great.

102
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,370
I'm drinking with you right now, aren't I?

103
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,760
What about you? What is it? Song Haoyu?

104
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,490
I think Chen Chen's biological mom is back.

105
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,140
What?

106
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,590
What do you mean "you think"?

107
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,010
She didn't explicitly admit it, but I think it's probably her.

108
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,030
I understand how you're feeling.

109
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,040
Exes, when they're not around,

110
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,510
are like tombstones.

111
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:16,740
But once they do come around, they're like a thorn in your side.

112
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,160
In this, the most important piece is still Song Haoyu.

113
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,870
What's his stance on this?

114
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,500
I used to get the feeling...

115
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,610
that there's someone he still hadn't gotten over yet.

116
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,790
He kept his distance when he saw her today.

117
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:38,030
But doesn't doing that mean that he still cares?

118
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,290
Who is she?

119
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,330
What gives her the right to disturb your lives?

120
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,410
Jin Xichen.

121
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,480
The snooker player?

122
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,250
Why is your life

123
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,830
just like a fiction novel.

124
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,220
Hello? Who is this?

125
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,360
Qi Sile. Don't you have your boss' number saved on your phone?

126
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,550
President Tong?

127
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,450
Why are you calling me this late?

128
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,640
I want to talk to you about Jin Xichen and Song Haoyu.

129
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,010
You know about her and Haoyu, too?

130
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,020
Oh please! I've known Song Haoyu longer than you have.

131
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,300
- Why is it so noisy over there? Are you out?
- Yes.

132
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,390
Send me your location.

133
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,400
You're here.

134
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,470
Are you feeling better?

135
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,370
I'm not coughing anymore so I should be better soon.

136
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,960
Enough about me. What's up with you?

137
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,580
Sile... met Jin Xichen.

138
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,820
So? Just say hello and let that be that.

139
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,190
I think... she knows about me and Jin Xichen.

140
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,550
Doesn't matter what she suspects,

141
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,760
just tell her everything and then show her your determination.

142
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,310
How do I tell her the truth?

143
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,720
She thinks Jin Xichen is Chen Chen's biological mom!

144
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,360
You know how Qi Sile is.

145
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,640
If I tell her Jin Xichen isn't,

146
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,810
she'll want to know who Chen Chen's biological mom actually is.

147
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,460
You're the one who told me to take this to my grave.

148
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,910
Let me do some formal introductions.

149
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,890
This is the owner of Fanyi Jewelry, Miss Tong Luoqi.

150
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,250
This is my best friend,

151
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,950
- L-Li—
- Let's get down to business.

152
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,760
Qi Sile, you know what that conniving little b*tch, Jin Xichen,

153
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,310
and Song Haoyu's relationship is, right?

154
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:03,610
How could you agree to let her become the ambassador for Maolin Mall? Are you a fool?

155
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,110
Hold on.

156
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,230
How can you talk to her like that?

157
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,030
Best friend. I don't have time for civilities.

158
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,490
Don't get mad. That's just how she is.

159
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,080
Keep going. What was their relationship before?

160
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,970
You really don't know?

161
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,100
First loves.

162
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,770
They knew each other in high school,

163
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,220
and they dated in college. Senior Song was against it.

164
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,590
She didn't have a great family background, similar to yours.

165
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,130
Can you watch your mouth?

166
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,840
- I'm just speaking the truth.
- Which part?

167
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,490
Forget it.

168
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,670
But we must admit Senior Song had a great eye.

169
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,980
Not like now, where he easily compromises.

170
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,210
Jin Xichen is very devious.

171
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,630
She's super ambitious.

172
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,600
On the surface, she acts like an innocent little rabbit.

173
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,620
Naive and harmless.

174
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,540
When it comes to this, you can't compete with her.

175
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,070
Get to the point.

176
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,760
Later, Haoyu proposed to her and she said yes.

177
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,640
Haoyu did everything he could

178
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,120
to finally get his grandpa to agree to their marriage.

179
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,520
But then just as their marital home was ready for move-in.

180
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,900
Jin Xichen went abroad for training.

181
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,580
She dumped Haoyu just like that.

182
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,530
Song Haoyu must've been devastated back then.

183
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,030
That's his own fault.

184
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,920
I told him time and time again,

185
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,090
that woman was going to be a handful. He deserved it.

186
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,730
How are you still alive with a mouth like yours?

187
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,070
Your family must be rich, right?

188
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,920
Best friend, you're right.

189
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,260
My name is Li Xin.

190
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,680
So is she Chen Chen's biological mom or not?

191
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,410
Are you crazy? Of course not!

192
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,200
What are you going to do then? She's going to ask at some point.

193
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,620
I don't know what to do either.

194
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:09,380
If she absolutely needs an answer about this,

195
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,320
I don't know what I would say to her.

196
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,200
Aren't I such a good friend for telling you so much?

197
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,530
You two beauties,

198
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,440
I just have a quick question.

199
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,680
You said your enemy's enemy...

200
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,340
What's the relationship between you two then?

201
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,480
- Love rivals.
- Love rivals.

202
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,490
Then... what's the current situation like?

203
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,480
Do I even have to say?

204
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,680
Qi Sile, you've gone too far! Don't make me yell at you!

205
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,660
Yell at me later.

206
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,200
If Jin Xichen isn't Chen Chen's mom...

207
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,000
Does that mean... there's still another one?

208
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,400
This...

209
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,090
I made a huge mistake back then, didn't I?

210
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,120
But if you didn't do what you did,

211
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,020
you wouldn't have found your happiness today.

212
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,700
On the other hand, you set a ticking time bomb for yourself

213
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,790
by doing what you did.

214
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,130
How do I put it?

215
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,900
Nothing is as simple as black or white.

216
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,920
Maybe it's what's meant to be.

217
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,910
She's calling.

218
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,730
Answer!

219
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,950
Hey, Sile.

220
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,860
Who is this?

221
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,340
Are they a party of two?

222
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,980
A party of three?

223
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,180
A party of three ladies?

224
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,830
Okay, I'll be there soon.

225
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,320
Come with me. Li Xin is there, too.

226
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,510
Tell He Qing to come, too.

227
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,800
Three ladies? Who?

228
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,910
Is Auntie Du there, too?

229
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:24,210
♪ Later on, I finally learned how to love ♪

230
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,410
♪  But you're already long gone ♪

231
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,020
Why are those three...

232
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,350
♪  You disappeared in the crowd of people ♪

233
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,410
Sile, stop singing.

234
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,470
- Go away!
- Stop embarrassing yourself.

235
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,420
Stop messing around. It's time to go home.

236
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,690
- Stop messing around.
- Go away!

237
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,250
I might not have a happy marriage,

238
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,420
but I can't cheat on him and go home with you!

239
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,930
No!

240
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,630
Li Xin.

241
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,810
- Li Xin. Wake up.
- Qi Sile.

242
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,210
No... No...!

243
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,360
She's so strong even when she's drunk.

244
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,580
I have someone in my life.

245
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,020
You have me.

246
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,980
These two crazy women are drunk.

247
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,620
They can't remember anything.

248
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,420
Tong Luoqi. Why are you with them?

249
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,620
Did you say something that made them drink this much?

250
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,050
Who are you? Why are you calling me by my full name?

251
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,840
Do you think you're qualified?!

252
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,410
Call me President Tong!

253
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,670
Why are you so mean?

254
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,130
Am I mean?

255
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,380
Best friend. Am I mean?

256
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:38,760
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Let's drink!

257
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,560
Why can't he just be honest with me?

258
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Didn't you say you liked me?

259
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,360
If you like me so much,

260
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,970
why can't you try putting yourself in my shoes?

261
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,100
Love means nothing!

262
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,980
It means nothing! Just leave if you want to.

263
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,710
Love doesn't exist anymore.

264
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,640
You want me to leave, right?

265
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,540
Right? Fine, I'll go right now!

266
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,150
I'll be alone from now on.

267
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,540
Look. We're a family from now on.

268
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,820
Come here. I'll put it on for you.

269
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,660
Hi, Miss Jin.

270
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,290
I'm Maolin's marketing director, Qin Tian.

271
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,290
I'm wondering if you're free to come to Molin Group tomorrow.

272
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,550
Hello? What is it?

273
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,400
President Song, Director Qin says he has something important to talk to you about.

274
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,060
[The Trio]

275
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,050
What is this group chat?

276
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,820
Who brought me home yesterday?

277
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,320
- Not me.
- Not me.

278
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,440
President Tong.

279
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,970
What are you doing here?

280
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,270
Secretary He said he couldn't handle you last night, so he called me.

281
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,590
- Why did you drink so much?
 - He Qing?

282
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,600
[Who brought me home last night?]

283
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,100
Who brought me home last night?

284
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,640
- Not me.
- Not me.

285
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,440
What's going on?

286
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,220
Do you two remember what happened last night?

287
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,050
I remember I came home on my own.

288
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,040
Me too.

289
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,970
Why do I think we drank too much last night?

290
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,240
No, I don't blackout.

291
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,100
Me neither.

292
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:33,180
Then... did I come back on my own, too?

293
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,820
Designer Qi.

294
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,890
It's the first day in your new position.

295
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,350
I'm firing you if you're late!

296
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,520
You're so scary.

297
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,480
I don't need you to remind me!

298
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,980
What do you think?

299
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,340
Very unique.

300
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,760
- What is it?
- Here's the situation, President Song.

301
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,230
Miss Jin tells me that many interviewers are asking her about Maolin Mall,

302
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,040
but there's a lot about Maolin that she doesn't know much about,

303
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,920
and she doesn't want to answer presumptively.

304
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:22,070
She asked me if she could chat with you in person.

305
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,980
There's no need.

306
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,670
- He Qing, send them our information.
- Okay.

307
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,760
But she's already in the meeting room.

308
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,610
Don't you think it's inappropriate if I ask her to leave?

309
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,140
Have a seat.

310
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,640
Haoyu, do we have to be so formal with each other?

311
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,060
I'm just being respectful to the champion.

312
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,910
Didn't you want to talk about Maolin Mall? Go ahead.

313
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,380
You know I'm not here for that.

314
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,510
Then there's nothing for us to talk about. You know about my current situation. I have to go now.

315
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,970
Wait.

316
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,550
Give me two minutes.

317
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:18,210
I want to tell you that it was a really tough decision for me to leave.

318
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,580
Just two minutes.

319
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,580
You know my parents work odd jobs.

320
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,290
If I hadn't realized my talent in billiards,

321
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:50,610
I wouldn't have been able to provide them with a stable life.

322
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,180
Yes, you did say that you

323
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,880
would assume responsibility and support me unconditionally.

324
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,880
But I still didn't have peace of mind.

325
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,710
From high school to college, and up until our engagement,

326
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:08,670
everyone said I schemed to be with you.

327
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:13,120
But what they don't know is that it was me who was there for you

328
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,660
when your parents passed away.

329
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,290
That's why I gave up the opportunity to train and compete abroad.

330
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,340
Would I do that if it wasn't for love?

331
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,320
I know you're not like what they say about you.

332
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,320
But I couldn't stand it.

333
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,750
Whenever I think of them

334
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:39,230
saying stuff about me every time I'm next to you,

335
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,120
and saying I don't deserve it,

336
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,950
I would get scared just thinking about it.

337
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,920
I'm scared of a life like that.

338
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,440
I want a career of my own, too!

339
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,660
I also want to be by your side with dignity and have you feel proud of me!

340
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,860
That's why I wanted you to wait for me!

341
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:06,250
I thought we had such a great relationship that you would understand me.

342
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,140
I'm married now.

343
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,040
Do you dare say

344
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,980
that you can let go of our past?

345
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,070
Your two minutes are up.

346
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,220
- Hello.
- You are...

347
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,550
Who's here, Auntie Du?

348
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,610
It's Miss Jin.

349
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:06,290
- Grandpa.
- Oh my, Xiao Chen is here.

350
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,400
You've been doing well abroad the past few years.

351
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,110
I often see you on the TV. Congratulations.

352
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,680
Thank you, Grandpa. I brought you these. They're all beneficial to your health.

353
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,360
Great, thank you for caring so much.

354

Have a seat. Sit.

Grandpa.

356
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,890
Actually, I came to ask about Haoyu.

357
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,880
How did he suddenly get married?

358
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,510
You get married when the time is right.

359
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,970
They have a great relationship, too.

360
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:40,480
But I heard they haven't known each other for long.

361
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,890
Wasn't it a bit hasty of them to get married so quickly?

362
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,540
Actually, with marriage,

363
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,430
it's not about how long you've known each other.

364
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,220
Some people might not even get to that stage

365
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,990
even after seeing each other a few hundred times.

366
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,910
But some people meet the first time and believe that person is the right one.

367
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:59,010
Love isn't something you can really explain.

368
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,850
The right one?

369
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,240
Grandpa, I've known Haoyu for ten years.

370
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,950
I know his personality, so I don't believe that he would fall in love with someone so easily.

371
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,620
You don't believe it?

372
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,620
What's the most difficult to change in a person?

373
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,000
It's that everyone is changing constantly.

374
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,850
Just a kind reminder. There's no point in making meaningless speculations.

375
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,550
What is marriage? Marriage is a one-way street.

376
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:33,220
Making a U-turn would violate the law.

377
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,080
I'm getting tired.

378
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,370

It looks just like her.
