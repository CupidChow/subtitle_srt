- Okay.

Your daughter's condition is a bit special. Let's look at the report first.

Conservative treatment methods are already ineffective.

209

The only method is surgery.

210
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,580
Okay, okay, surgery. Definitely do it.

211
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:24,220
But the child is too young. The surgery's success rate is low as it is.

212
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,780
If you want to raise the success rate, I recommend that you talk with Department Chief Xu.

- I can't accept this. Don't say anymore.
- Sile, listen to me.

But there are no bargaining chips left in this physical condition.

Grandpa giving his spot to Xuan Xuan... is inappropriate.

342
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,790
Sile.

I know this is troubling for you right now.

344
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:41,820
But, once Grandpa makes a decision, it's hard to change his mind.

345
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,200
Don't worry.

346
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,280
After Xuan Xuan has her surgery, I'll have Grandpa lined up for another spot.

347
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:56,320
So are you going to help me fight the little monsters too?

348

Uncle, I like having you by my side.

351
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,460
Xuan Xuan, I also like staying by your side.

352
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,310
You like it, Xuan Xuan?

353
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,090
Yes.

354
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,920
Would you like it if I cooked it for you every day?

355
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,210
Okay.

356
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,080
Baby.

357
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,990
Mommy.

358
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,640
You're back.

359
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,530
How is it? Do you still feel bad?

360
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:45,170
Mommy, Uncle said I was too tired from fighting with the little monsters earlier,

361
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:50,750
that's why I fell asleep. Also, Uncle and I've already agreed,

362
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,350
we'll fight the little monsters together.

363
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,590
Did you thank Uncle then?

364
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,100
Thank you, Uncle.

365
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,280
Good girl.

366
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,450
Also, I heard Uncle say

367
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,720
that Grandpa will also help me fight the little monsters.

368
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,520
So I'll definitely win!

369
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,670
That's right. Xuan Xuan will definitely win.

370
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,270
Song Haoyu, thank you.

371
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,310
No worries.

372
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:29,880
I need to take care of a few things. Can I bother you to coax Xuan Xuan to sleep?

373
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,430
Okay.

374
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:35,900
Don't worry. I often coax Chen Chen to sleep. You go ahead.

375
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,970
Thanks.

376
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,610
Baby, be good, okay?

377
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:44,160
I'll listen to Uncle.

378
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,710
Mommy, you can go ahead.

379
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,240
Good girl.

380
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,960
Come on, Xuan Xuan. Let's lie down.

381
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,330
I'll tell you a story, okay? What do you want to hear?

382
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,270
You feel so bad. Just give it to me.

383
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,230
Let's get a marriage license.

384
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,540
Also, Uncle and I've already agreed,

385
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,180
we'll fight the little monsters together.

386
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,750
There's a saying that, before we came into this world,

387
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,210
we've already looked at the script for this life.

388
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:38,210
Despite knowing the hardship and obstacles that await us,

389
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,390
we opted to enter this world without hesitation.

390
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:48,700
So it's enough to prove that there's still something worthwhile to living this life.

391
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:54,010
If all the hardship and obstacles are for me to understand why it's worthwhile,

392
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:58,970
then perhaps it's our fate to come together as a family.

393
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:06,850
♫ I want to give you all of my warm embraces ♫

394
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:14,570
Haoyu, I'm waiting for you in the corridor downstairs.

395

This is my own thing.

401
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,100
Why should I waste time staying with you?

402
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,330
- Give me your contact info.
- Nothing good comes from meeting you.

403
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:51,250
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

404
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:55,140

♫ The sun rises and sets ♫

406

Sile, do you want to choose a companion

407
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:07,240
to be with you and support each other? And also, to get over that mountain inside your heart together?

408
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,170
Companion?

409
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,680
Such as, me?

00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,560
♫ An ode to time ♫

411
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,380
Now you know

412
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:22,380
that Xuan Xuan wasn't a healthy child when she was born.

413
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,760
But you're still willing to accept her?

414
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,480
Of course.

415
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,590
♫ Forever protected ♫

416
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,180

♫ ... my heart flutter ♫

418
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,210
I'm willing to become Grandpa's granddaughter-in-law.

419

I'm willing to be Chen Chen's mother.

420
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,370
I'm willing...

421
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,580
to be your wife.

422
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,590
Are you… proposing to me?

423
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,270
Yes. Are you… willing to marry me?
