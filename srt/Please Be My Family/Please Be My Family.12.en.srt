Why didn't you tell me that you were here?

Miss Yu, this is the situation.

42
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,890
The brooch you're interested in isn't Fanyi's product.

43
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,340
Also, she's been wearing it for a while and the wear and tear is quite severe. Why don't—

44
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,380
Newbie, she said your brooch has wear and tear.

45
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,410
Take it off and let me take a look.

46
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,710
Miss Yu, please be gentle.

I'm just looking at it. Don't get so nervous.

48
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,020
Judging from its craftsmanship, it must be one of a kind.

49
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,670
That's right.

50
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,310
It seems I underestimated you.

51
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,170
You're actually an expert.

52
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,170
No, I'm not. A really important person let me this brooch.

53
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,230
So, I've always kept it with me...

54
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,090
Enough with the explanations.

55
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,420
I can already tell you know a lot about jewelry

56
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,480
from the necklace you showed me earlier.

57
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,380
You... You flatter me.

58
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,120
I just feel that the style of this necklace

59
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,660
is very similar to Master Helong's earlier designs.

60
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,620
So, I thought it was worth recommending to you.

61
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,110
You even know about Master Long?

62
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,300
After that, Miss Yu talked about jewelry with Sile.

63
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,010
Under Sile's recommendation,

64
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,820
she placed an order for the raw diamond ring.

65
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,030
Manman, is that true?

66
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,140
I saw you storming out of the store earlier.

67
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,560
It's because I had to place an order for it.

68
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,180
You also know I hate to wait.

69
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,380
I didn't expect that she'd actually understand jewelry.

70
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,430
But recommending the least popular raw diamond ring

71
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,060
proves her inexperience.

72
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,000
Consider it a lesson for her then.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,910
Qi Sile, since you're the one who initiated this order,

74
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,810

- the consequences if anything goes wrong.
- I understand.

106
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,560
I don't want any onions, ginger, or garlic.

- President Qin.

I heard that your job seems to be going smoothly.

124
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,840
That's right. I saw Tong Luoqi earlier.

125
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,450
So I understood what you meant when you said it was for my own sake.

126
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,910
I can arrange for you to work at other jewelry companies.

127
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,580
Just don't go to Fanyi.

128
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,830
But you should've just told me about it back then.

129
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,380
If I did, you wouldn't have gone to Fanyi?

130
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,500
If you went to another mall, I wouldn't be able to see you.

131
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,270
And if that's the case...

132
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,150
I can't tell the kids when you'll be off work.

133
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,240
They'll be worried.

134
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,680
I got it. The misunderstanding has been cleared up.

135
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,640
Anyway, if Tong Luoqi makes things difficult for you again, just let me know.

136
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,160
- Excuse me. I'd like to ask if Fanyi is around here.
- It's right up front.

139

If I tell you to, you should do it.

140
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,650
Hey, I wasn't done talking.

141
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,770
Why are you upset again? Why are you acting so weird?

142
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,400
Are the two of them a couple?

143
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,810
- It should be green.

144
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,940
Who's Master Long?

145
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,660

00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,200
What's wrong with me?

151
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,520
Mommy said the person she likes the most isn't you.

152
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,750
They're talking about Master Long.

153
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,250

154
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:17,450
Right. I chose to study jewelry design because I fell in love with his designs.

155
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,320
I don't have to worry, then.

Yeah. Even if the man himself isn't coming,

but it'd be great if I could see his designs in person.

163
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,340
Is he that great?

164
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,880

It's on Sunday. That's perfect, I don't have to work that day. Thank you.

174
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,740
Hey.

175
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,450
Call me after the exhibition. I'll pick you up.

176
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,900
Y-You're not going with me?

177
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,400
I have meetings all day that day. I don't have time.

178
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,670
Okay...

179
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,170
I'll leave this for you.

180
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,500
- Thank you.
- Hey.

181
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,490
That's... it?

182
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,210
What else?

183
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,330
Qi Sile!

184
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,720
So heartless.

185
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,050
What a coincidence,

186
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,780
that the one Qi Sile was with turned out to be you.

187
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,990
That smile.

188
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,820
That fake smile!

189
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,740
Song Haoyu! I'll make you pay!

190
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,000
President Qin, I heard President Song called you.
[Assistant Wu]

191
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,450
You have such big aspirations.

192
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,440
You actually want to replace my superior as marketing director.

193
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,500
Aren't you trying to join KL through my connections as well?
[Qin Tian]

194
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,810
Once this is done, KL will send you the offer.

195
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,370
[Sile: I'm coming for you, Master Long's exhibition!]

196
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,900
Qi Sile.

197
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,490
Fate really is bringing us together.

198
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:18,200
[Master Long Jewelry Exhibition]

199
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,710
How refined. Typical of Master Long.

200
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,280
How great would it be to own

201
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,620
one of Master Long's piece.

202
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,660
Qin Tian? What are you doing here?

203
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,290
How is it that I can run into you here, too?

204
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,060
You're a fan of Master Long's work?

205
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,280
Yes! He's my idol.

206
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,500
I've been a fan of his since high school.

207
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,890
Master Long's designs are the best in the country.

208
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,900
I'm so happy I get to be here today.

209
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,260
Are you a fan of his, too?

210
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,310
Yes.

211
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,970
Wait.

212
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,350
Master Long is an old friend of mine.

213
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,480
And he's also here today.

214
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,350
- Really?
- Yes.

215
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,510
I'll take you to meet him right now.

216
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,100
Let's go.

217
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,510
Master, this is the designer I mentioned to you earlier, Qi Sile.

218
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,180
Nice to meet you, Miss Qi.

219
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,650
Nice to meet you, Master Long. Nice to meet you.

220
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,030
Sile, don't be so formal.

221
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:33,380
That's right. We're old friends. Xiao Tian helped me a lot

222
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,620
when I held an exhibition abroad years ago.

223
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,120
We're all friends. Let's sit down to chat.

224
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,240
Have a seat.

225
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,640
Master Long, Sile is a very talented designer.

226
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,390
An opportunity to meet you isn't easy to come by.

227
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,000
Sile, is there anything you'd like to ask about?

228
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,850
What? Can I?

229
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,530
Go ahead.

230
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:13,090
Three, two, one.

231
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,650
Thank you so much for introducing me.

232
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,080
How about this? Why don't I treat you to a meal right now?

233
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,470
Okay.

234
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,420
I'm sorry.

235
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,400
- I forgot my husband was picking me up. I'll treat you next time.
- Why does he look so familiar?

236
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,110
- Bye-bye!
 - She didn't have to ask another guy to go with her even if I wasn't free.

237
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,080
Who was that just now?

238
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,570
A friend.

239
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,500
What does he do?

240
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,290
I'm not sure. But I think he has a pretty impressive background.

241
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,670
Okay...

242
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:54,180
- Did you gain anything from the exhibition today?
- Of course!

243
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,250
You know what? Master Long was there himself.

244
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,880
My God.

245
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,090
Speaking of which, I need to properly thank someone.

246
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,080
- Thank who?
- My friend just now.

247
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,420
He's great friends with Master Long,

248
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,030
so he arranged for me to meet with Master Long privately.

249
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,250
Your friend really is quite amazing then.

250
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,950
Isn't he?

251
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,710
Because of this, I was able to ask Master Long for advice.

252
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,210
It helped me out so much.

253
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,920
And look,

254
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,210
he even took a picture of me with Master Long.

255
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,260
- Come on, look.
- I'm driving!

256
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,760
Fine.

257
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:40,090
My God. I've got to print this photo and frame it for the wall.

258
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,420
Is that necessary? He takes bad photos.

259
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,380
I think it looks fine.

260
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,160
You didn't even look at it.

261
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,310
Then you're not photogenic.

262
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,770
Look.

263
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,940
You're amazing, aren't you?

264
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,930
You're amazing, you're amazing, aren't you?

265
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,210
What... are you doing?

266
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,800
I'm...

267
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,010
It's too hot so I'm sitting in the air-conditioning.

268
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,720
Then I...

269
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,160
I know you don't like all the formalities, but I still want to thank you.

270
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,790
A very solemn thank you.

271
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,680
If you're sleeping on the couch, then I'll sleep on the bed tonight.

272
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,680
Whatever!

273
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,540
Fine. As long as we don't have to be next to each other.

274
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,670
I think we should keep the door open.

275
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,210
Tell me. What are you scheming by coming home?

276
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,360
What do you mean? This is my home.

277
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,260
This... is your home?

278
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,830
I don't really like

279
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,550
staying with my family,

280
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,410
so I'm renting a hotel room long term.

281
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,290
How wild of you.

282
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,050
I don't think it's because you don't like living at home.

283
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,190
It's because you want the freedom of going out at night, isn't it?

284
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,440
Can you not think of me as such a...

285
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,910
I'll tell you about my family when we have more time.

286
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,880
Let's not talk about stuff that'll ruin the mood right now.

287
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,620
I have something important to give you.

288
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,720
What is it?

289
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,410
Didn't you say that I left something with you?

290
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,590
I'm realizing you never tell the truth.

291
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,990
Close your eyes first.

292
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,120
No!

293
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,090
Fine then.

294
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,010
The confession ceremony officially starts now.

295
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,050
W-What?

296
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,020
I thought carefully about this for a long time

297
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,030
after Haoyu's wedding reception,

298
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,920
and finally came to a conclusion.

299
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,170
I've fallen for you.

300
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,160
- You're crazy.
- Hey!

301
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,200
Let me finish.

302
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,030
I didn't know myself before.

303
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,290
Deep down in my heart, I've always wished for someone to tie me down.

304
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,560
I think we should stop

305
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,370
beating around the bush.

306
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,890
I know you must have feelings for me, too.

307
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:26,130
So why don't we try being together?

308
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,410
Did I leave something with you or not?

309
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,190
If not, I'm leaving.

310
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,870
Hey!

311
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,860
You really did.

312
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,310
Come here.

313
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,410
There's a total of 28 gifts.

314
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,610
It represents the 28 years we missed out on together.

315
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,280
These 22 gifts are to make up for the 22 birthdays I missed.

316
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,560
All the things you left with me, I'll make up for all at once today.

317
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,370
I'll be with you for every birthday from now on.

318
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,160
I know, you think I'm unreliable,

319
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,020
and that I can't give you the sense of security you want.

320
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,900
But you must believe that I'll do everything for you.

321
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,140
I just hate myself for not having met you sooner,

322
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,720
so I'm doing this to make up for my regrets.

323
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,160
I hope you can accept my feelings.

324
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,520
Li Xin.

325
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,910
I like you.

326
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,820
That day...

327
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,710
I told you everything. Right?

328
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,050
You told me everything.

329
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,120
And I also told you about the gifts

330
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,520
according to my age? Right?

331
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,680
So you thought of this idea to hurt me.

332
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,500
To satisfy your cheap amusement as a scumbag?

333
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,180
Right?

334
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,180
What cheap amusement? Is there some sort of misunderstanding?

335
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,240
Do you think I would believe this was a coincidence?

336
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,260
You clearly knew about everything.

337
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,740
Why did you still do this?

338
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,810
Does it make you happy to hurt me?

339
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,140
- Does reopening my wounds give you a sense of fulfillment?
- No.

340
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,730
I'm not understanding a single word you're saying.

341
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,110
Who's hurting who right now?

342
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,160
Does mistaking my kindness for something else every single time give you a sense of fulfillment?

343
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,280
Do you even have a heart?

344
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,650
A heart?

345
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,880
You men

346
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,230
are all heartless.

347
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,940
What... are you doing?

348
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,420
I'm so tired. I'm sleeping.

349
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,550
Then you sleep on the bed.

350
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,130
I'll go sleep on the couch.

352
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:27,860
Next time you want to go to an exhibition, tell me in advance.

353
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,350
I'll get us tickets in advance and go with you.

358
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,910
Hello? Hao Jun.

359
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,550
What? You want to meet up?

360
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,310
After she saw the gifts I got her,

361
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,950
she yelled at me and left!

362
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:31,130
Are you still going to keep it up after Li Xin did that to you?

363
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,680
Yes.

364
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,580
I'm serious about Li Xin.

365
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,290
You should just take the shoes and leave. Why are you here playing the piano?

366
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,850
Every time she rejects and denies me,

367
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,640
she always looks so sad.

368
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,530
If it's because of her past, I'm sure you know what it is.

369
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:00,700
Sister-in-law, even if you want me to give up on her today,

370
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,910
I need to know why I'm giving up.

371
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:18,460
There's still someone Li Xin hasn't gotten over.

372
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,910
When she was in college,

373
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:25,910
she met a singer at a bar who played the piano really well.

374
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,650
You finally came.

375
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,960
Later, on Li Xin's 22nd birthday,

376
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,600
he confessed his feelings for her with 22 gifts.

377
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,050
Do you think I would believe this was a coincidence?

378
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:45,730
Does reopening my wounds give you a sense of fulfillment?

379
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,340
Back then, Li Xin fell deep into that relationship.

380
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,860
To help him achieve his music dreams,

381
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,510
she traveled with him to all his performances

382
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,860
and neglected her own music major.

383
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,330
Then... why did they end up breaking up?

384
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,310
They were going to get married.

385
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:08,080
But Li Xin's parents were extremely against it and they got into a really bad argument.

386
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,970
But Li Xin was insistent on being with him.

387
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,450
Right before they got married,

388
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,790
he was discovered by his current music agency.

389
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,960
He broke off all contact with Li Xin the day they were supposed to get their marriage license.

390
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,190
He didn't give her an explanation or anything,

391
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:28,780
and completely disappeared from Li Xin's life.

392
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,690
She cut off her family for him!

393
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,680
Gave up on her own future to help him achieve his dreams!

394
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,410
Yet he...

395
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,180
Take it easy. Drink it slowly.

396
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,490
Are you okay?

397
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,420
She's been doing really well these years after breaking up with him.

398
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,370
But ever since you showed up,

399
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:58,040
she started to worry a lot more and gives herself a hard time.

400
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,610
Do you know what this means?

401
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,020
What?

402
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,080
She's trying to protect herself by losing her temper.

403
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,810
It means she's very fragile.

404
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:12,340
The more uncomfortable she is, the more it means she cares about you.

405
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:19,820
Thank you, Sister-in-law. I know what to do.

406
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,990
It would be great if Li Xin and I can be as happy as you two.

407
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:29,860

408
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,080

00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,270
I heard your entire conversation.

You've known that Haoyu doesn't have any real feelings for me, right?

What did you hear?

00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,780
