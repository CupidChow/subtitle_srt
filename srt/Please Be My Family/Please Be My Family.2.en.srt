Hello, President Tong.

She must be Tong Luoqi, the daughter of the owner of Fanyi Jewelry.

I heard that the brands from her family business only open their stores in Maolin Shopping Malls.

27
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,370
The relationship between President Tong and Song Haoyu's relationship is not simple.

Our Chen Chen has gotten cuter.

Do you still remember me?

39
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,730
This should be the place mentioned in the phone call earlier.

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,150
- Are you Miss Qi?
- Yes.

Hello, I'm He Qing, President Song's secretary.

43
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,840
- Hello.
- Is this your daughter?

44
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,980
Yes. I didn't feel safe leaving her alone at home, so I brought her along.

45
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,360
I'm sorry. I didn't realize it was such a big event.

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,690
It's fine. You can take her to the kids' recreation area to wait for you.

47
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,840
After all, the ballroom isn't suitable for a kid.

48
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,720
- Well…
- Rest assured.

49
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,080
The kids' recreation area has many surveillance cameras. The security here is very tight.

50
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,780
This way please.

51
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,370
Let's go.

Mommy, where are you going?

53
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,980
Honey, in order to help you fight the little monsters,

54
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,530
I have to go replenish some energy later.

55
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,530
Later, be good and wait for me at the recreation area. Okay?

56
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,880
Okay.

57
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,420
Chen Chen,

58
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,300
when your dad is done with business later, can you take me to look for him?

59
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,860
Okay! I will.

60
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,630
I advise you not to go with him.

61
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,670
President Tong.

62
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,820
The previous person who went with him to look for his dad was locked up in a room by him.

63
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,400
If you don't want to be pranked, you better stay away from him.

64
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,820
This rascal has a lot of tricks up his sleeve.

65
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,640
We have something to tend to over there.

66
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,850
We'll head over.

67
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,760
Why did you sabotage me?

68
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,340
You said earlier that you would form an alliance with me. You lied to a kid.

69
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,500
You think your dad will fall for their tricks so easily? Those two?

70
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,950
You should worry about him less.

71
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,730
Do you think I can't tell?

72
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,480
You're just like them and want to be my stepmother.

73
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,640
I don’t have the final say to be your stepmother.

74
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,640
But you don't get to decide either.

75
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,170
It's impossible for me to have a stepmother.

76
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,150
Because my mommy will be back really soon.

77
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,310
Our alliance is over!

78
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,020
Everything is all arranged with the hotel?

79
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,120
- Yes.
- That's good.

80
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,880
- So there you are.
- President Tong.

81
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,410

83

- Long time no see.
- Hello, President Liu.

00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,380
Hello, President Tong.

85
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,140
I heard from Chen Chen that you found him a mom?

86
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,430
If you speak nonsense, Chen Chen will misunderstand.

87
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,340
Today is Molin Group's anniversary celebrations, have a drink with me.

88
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,100
Sure. Here, let me toast everyone.

89
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,360
Thank you for your continued support to Molin Group.

90
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,400
Thank you.

91
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,390
Oh, by the way, Molin will have

92
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,830
a promotional event coming up. Please come and join us then.

93
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,010

94
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,800
President Song.

95
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,440
The person who was referred by the Chairman is here.

96
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,850
Can you see her now?

97
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,990
- I’m busy right now, ask her to wait.
- Okay.

98
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,120
I need to learn more from you going forward.

99
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,740
I've always wanted to invite you and the Chairman to pay us a visit.

100
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,970
Is that true? My father has been talking about inviting you to dinner.

101
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,800
I'm afraid you and the Chairman are too busy and don't have time for me.

102
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,630
President Fang, excuse me, I need to pick up a phone call.

103
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,460
Sure, sure.

104
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,130
Wait a moment, I'll find a quiet place to talk to you.

105
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,100
Someone referred by Grandpa?

106
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,400
It can't be the mother Chen Chen was referring to is it?

107
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,610
Waitress, aren't you the one serving President Song’s guests?

108
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,220
What?

109
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,080
I guess this guest isn’t that important.

110
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,420
- I think you made a mistake—
- President Tong.

111
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,290
Take the glass. Miss Wu,

112
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,060
- I haven’t seen you for a while.
- Your business is doing so well.

113
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,270
Miss Qi, are you okay?

114
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,950
Let me take you to the break room to take care of it.

115
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,570
- Okay, thank you.
- Follow me.

116
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,300
I really didn't think about it before I met her.

117
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,650
Then is there a way to...

118
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,720
Why don’t you state your intention and explain your situation face to face.

119
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,980
Isn’t it too direct? I’m afraid she won’t accept it.

120
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,990
Thank you.

121
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,280
Thank you.

122
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,030
President Song, how about this?

123
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,320
How about you feel her out and see her willingness?

124
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,370
Then see if there's a chance to move forward.

125
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,110
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?!

126
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,590
Hurry, get up!

127
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,600
What’s going on Miss Qi? Miss Qi—

128
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,690
President Song?

129
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,870
Sorry to interrupt.

130
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,070
President Song?

131
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,820
How about we change our position to talk?

132
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,410
Hi, President Song.

133
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,380
I came here today specifically to meet with you.

134
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,120
Let me formally introduce myself.

135
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,890
I’m Qi Sile, I’m from Landi—

136
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,650
- You’re Qi Sile.
- Yes.

137
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,840
Are you married or single?

138
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,940
Have you been raising your kid alone this whole time?

139
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,680
President Song, can we talk about private matters later?

140
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,930
I’m here today to talk business.

141
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,290
I’m sorry. I was too hasty.

142
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,700
I’m the account executive from Landi Advertising Agency.

143
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,490
We’ve previously signed the contract for your promotional event.

144
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,730
But I haven't heard anything from anyone on your end,

145
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,110
that’s why I’m here today to talk to you about this.

146
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,600
Account executive from Landi Advertising Agency.

147
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,330
Actually, our professionalism is excellent.

148
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,680
I myself value professionalism, but I value someone’s ethical standards more.

149
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,100
That why I don’t appreciate people who try to play tricks. I’m sorry.

150
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,670
President Song, can we discuss a bit longer? President Song!

151
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,030
Swoosh, swoosh!

152
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,660
Xuan Xuan, why are you here?

153
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,590
Chen Chen? You’re here too!

154
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,760
Of course, this is my territory,

155
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,280
I have to be here.

156
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,210
It’s yours? You’re amazing!

157
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,250
That’s right, where's your mommy? Why isn’t she here?

158
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,430
Mommy went to save the world.

159
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,310
She wants me to be good and stay here.

160
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,100
Save the world?

161
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,190
Xuan Xuan, let me take you to eat something good.

162
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,010
Okay!

163
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:54,270
But I don't have magic pills so I can't eat good food.

164
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,380
Then what should we do?

165
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,660
Mommy has the magic pills.

166
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,980
Let's go, that's good!

167
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,580
President Song, President Song, President Song, wait for me a second.

168
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,760
President Song, can we talk about it a little more?

169
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,940
President Song, I admit that previously

170
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,480
I tried to play smart, but that doesn't mean my character is problematic.

171
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,300
It's mainly because the comments Manager Wang proposed, really weren't...

172
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,170
Right now isn't a good time to talk. Another day.

173
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,560
Another day is which day?

174
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,850
Since I’m here today anyway, President Song.

175
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,270
- Why don’t we…
- President Song.

176
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,600
President Fang has some things he'd like to talk to you about. This way.

177
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,080
Okay.

178
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,720
You heard it. Go to the person who you met in the first place.

179
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,210
Wow!

180
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,800
See? I didn't lie to you, did I?

181
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,080
There are all sorts of delicious food!

182
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,820
There's cake!

183
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,160
Wait a bit, I'm going to find my daddy,

184
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,780
then we'll take you to find your mommy.

185
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,760
Okay!

186
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,360
Wow!

187
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,870
Careful!

188
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,990
Chen Chen!

189
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,390
- Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

190
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,970
Is the child okay?

191
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,800
Are you okay? You're not hurt are you?

192
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,250
- Where's President Song?
- He should be fine.

193
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,470
Will mommy celebrate my birthday with me

194
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,730
with a cake bigger than this?

195
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,800
Yes.

196
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,380
Child, are you okay?

197
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,410
Baby, are you hurt?

198
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,370
[Happy Birthday]

199
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,840
You saved me! You're my mommy, aren't you?

200
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,410
Are you looking for your mom?

201
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:13,170
Daddy didn't lie to me, I do have a mommy.

202
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,890
This is great!

203
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,080
- Mommy, you finally came back!
- President Song's here.

204
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,400
Chen Chen, what’s going on?

205
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,520
President Song, I'm sorry. Just now, the cart almost ran into Chen Chen.

206
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,350
How could you servers being so sloppy?!

207
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,420
Oh, you misunderstood, I'm not a waitress.

208
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,690
President Tong, if it hadn't been for this lady, Chen Chen would have been hit.

209
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,230
Song Xingchen, are you okay?

210
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,190
I'm fine.

211
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,250
You were trying so hard earlier,

212
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,260
is because you wanted to leave a good impression in front of Haoyu, weren’t you?

213
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,630
No, it's just when I saw the boy—

214
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,830
Chen Chen, are you okay?

215
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,940
I'm fine.

216
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,420
Oh, you're the boy's mom. You misunderstood.

217
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,410
You misunderstood.

218
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,680
She isn't.

219
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,830
Oh, I see.

220
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:12,380
Is that important? No matter who I am, you shouldn't be here.

221
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,360
President Tong.

222
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,590
She's my guest.

223
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,350
Your guest is a bit too much, isn’t she?

224
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,180
Well, wasn't there something you wanted to talk about?

225
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,260
There is.

226
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,750
Okay, you two go ahead.

227
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,160
This is the situation. I really never thought that Manager Wang

228
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,490
would take the comment about benefiting his career and salary seriously.

229
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,920
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,570
- It’s pretty good.
- What?

231
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,830
- Nothing, go on.
- Haoyu.

232
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,560
- Grandpa.
- Grandpa?

233
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,930
Sile, you’re here too. Have you two met already?

234
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,760
Oh, yes. Thanks to your help I got to meet with President Song.

235
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,270
- Oh, don't mention it.
- Help?

236
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,940
No, no, no.

237
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,500
Whose little lady is this? She's so cute.

238
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,090
Xuan Xuan, come and greet Great Grandpa.

239
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,260
- Hi, Great Grandpa.
- Hello.

240
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,700
- T-This is your daughter？
- That’s right.

241
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,770
Mommy, when are we going home?

242
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,850
She matches all your conditions, seize this opportunity.

243
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,240
You must be sleepy, aren't you? Soon.

244
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,650
Are you ready to go home?

245
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,840
Haoyu, give Sile and her child a ride home later.

246
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,520
No need, no need to trouble you.

247
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,890
It’s fine, it's no trouble at all.

248
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,830
Okay.

249
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,520
Well, regarding the proposal…

250
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,880
You still haven't answered the question I asked.

251
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,550
Are you raising Xuan Xuan on your own?

252
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,830
Yes.

253
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,900
Xuan Xuan's very cute.

254
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,940
Yes. Thank you.

255
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,530
Have you thought about if you...

256
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,980
If you weren't raising Xuan Xuan on your own,

257
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,910
you could have more freedom?

258
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,820
Why would I think that?!

259
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,580
I've never once thought like that.

260
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,820
Xuan Xuan is my gift from God,

261
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,620
so no matter what happens,

262
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,340
I would never leave her.

263
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,410
Do you know how to drive? Why aren't you paying attention to the road?!

264
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,270
Are you hurt?

265
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,850
Seriously.

266
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,550
♫ Like it's gone by ever so slightly ♫

267
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,810
♫ Reminds me of your gentleness, exquisiteness, and breathlessness ♫

268
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:21,850
♫ Reminds me of your gentleness, exquisiteness, and breathlessness ♫

269
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:26,900
♫ You unconsciously occupying my heart ♫

270
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,120
Baby, we're home.

271
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,450
Thank you, we'll head back now.

272
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:38,180
Wait, the weather is getting cooler. I’m afraid the child might catch a cold.

273
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,980
Her hairs gotten all messy.

274
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,130
Thank you.

275
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,800
Well…

276
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,260
- regarding the contract…
- All right.

277
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,790
Let's talk about the contract tomorrow. It's getting late already.

278
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,950
Okay.

279
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,910
Take this home to rub on your shoulder.

280
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,330
Thank you. I'll wash the clothing and bring them back to you tomorrow.

281
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,950
Okay.

282
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,030
- Haoyu.
- Yes?

283
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,930
That lady today... what do you think?

284
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,600
Well…

285
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,810
If you don’t deny it, it means you have some feelings.

286
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,360
Grandpa.

287
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,090
I want to find time to invite them over for dinner.

288
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,360
What?

289
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,400
I said, I want to invite them over for dinner.

290
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,460
Oh, my God! Happiness is coming too suddenly.

291
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:47,360
Auntie Du! Auntie Du! Where's my phone? Hurry, bring it to me.

292
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,800
[Grandpa Song]

293
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,500
Hello? Grandpa Song?

294
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,660
Sile, tomorrow, bring Xuan Xuan over for dinner.

295
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,780
Tomorrow? But tomorrow I'm supposed to meet President Song

296
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,030
at the office to talk about the business proposal.

297
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,600
Perfect, just come to the house to discuss it.

298
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,210
I sent you the address. See you tomorrow!

299
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,220
But I—

300
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,910
Why is this whole family so strange?

301
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:23,520
I want to defeat little monsters!

302
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,170
For Xuan Xuan, I will get the contract no matter what!

303
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,290
Auntie Du, I'll go get groceries tomorrow. We have a VIP guest coming.

304
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,550
- VIP?
- Who's coming tomorrow?

305
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,600
It could be Chen Chen's new mother!

306
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,790
Okay. Great!

307
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,210
High alert! High alert!

308
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,990
They're really getting me a stepmom this time.

309
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,650
Alliance, regroup.

310
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,150
Wow, Chen Chen's house is so big!

311
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:08,210
- Baby, in a minute, remember to say hello to everyone.
- Okay.

312
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,420
I know, you taught me good manners.

313
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,950
Good girl.

314
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,220
You must be Miss Qi.

315
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,170
Yes, hello.

316
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,950
Miss Qi, please come in.

317
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,420
All right.

318
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,350
Who's here?

319
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,870
- Chen Chen.
- Chen Chen, it's me.

320
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,550
Mommy, I knew you would miss me.

321
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,130
This is my mommy!

322
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,090
Auntie Du, are they our VIP?

323
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,330
That's right!

324
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,070
Chen Chen!

325
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,090
Oh no! Xuan Xuan, we need to go prepare for war!

326
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,230
Xuan Xuan, be careful.

327
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,120
- Auntie Du.
- Miss Tong, come in.

328
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,380
What a coincidence.

329
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,610
Not at all. I came here for a specific purpose.

330
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,340
Go ahead and chat away. I’ll get back to work.

331
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,230
Okay.

332
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,690
You came to a single man's house to have dinner with great fanfare.

333
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,980
Aren't you afraid of being misunderstood? Chen Chen doesn't want Haoyu to find him a stepmom.

334
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,570
Miss Tong, you've got the wrong idea.

335
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,810
I came here to talk about work with President Song.

336
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,630
Why do you have Haoyu's clothes with you?

337
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,310
- This—
- Sile is here for a blind date with me.

338
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,980
- Sile.
- President Song, what are you saying?

339
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,060
You've washed it? Thanks.

340
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,790
Auntie Du, please hang this up for me.

341
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,880
All right, drop the act. You think I don't know you?

342
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,300
You just want to use her to shut your grandpa up.

343
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:59,290
It's different this time. I told Grandpa to invite her over.

344
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,320
What? You like these types of girls?

345
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,870
Stop messing with me.

346
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,450
Haoyu, I already told you,

347
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,680
until the day you find someone you truly love,

348
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,390
I won't give up.

349
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:18,720
In this aspect, I'm braver than anyone else.

350
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,850
- Hey.
- Grandpa.

351
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,900
- Grandpa.
- You’re all here.
- I’ll check with the kitchen.

352
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,010
Sile, you're here. Oh, Luoqi, you're here too.

353
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,470
I've missed you, Grandpa. I brought you lots of gifts.

354
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,660
Okay, okay.

355
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,190
There's more.

356
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,760
These fruits...

357
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,670
- Did you buy them, Sile?
- Yes.

358
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,720
This is good for lowering my blood pressure.

359
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,770
You know my health is in poor condition. Thanks for being considerate.

360
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,730
I'm glad you like it, Grandpa.

361
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,180
- I'll go wash the fruit.
- Okay.

362
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,770
I think the trouble is over for now.

363
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,790
Chen Chen, what are you doing?

364
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,990
I, your older brother, am working hard for happiness.

365
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,140
Why must you be my older brother?

366
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,670
Because older brothers will give their toys to their younger sisters.

367
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,070
- Really?
- Of course!

368
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,560
Brother Chen Chen!

369
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:34,140
I never knew you could cook.

370
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:39,190
There's a special guest today. I have to cook the food personally.

371
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,560
Do you need my help?

372
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,300
No.

373
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,440
- Sile!
- Yes?

374
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,460
Come over here.

375
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,570
What is it, President Song?

376
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,410
Help me tie my apron.

377
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,850
Huh?

378
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,460
Thank you.

379
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,650
Everyone is here today.

380
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,090
I'm in a good mood, so cheers to you all.

381
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,130
Thank you, Grandpa.

382
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,780
Cheers.

383
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:48,290
When is this bad woman leaving?

384
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:52,020
Why does it seem real this time?

385
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,210
I'm one step closer to success.

386
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,410
Once dinner is over, I have to find a chance to nail down the project.

387
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,380
I'll find a chance to push them closer later.

388
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,220
There's so much good food today.

389
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,880
Here, Xuan Xuan. See if you like my cooking.

390
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,400
Wait…

391
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,450
President Song, Xuan Xuan can't eat this.

392
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,200
I-I'll eat it.

393
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,070
Oh, I'm sorry.

394
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,480
Here, baby. Try this.

395
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,170
Is it good?

396
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,460
Better than candy.

397
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,740
- You like it, Xuan Xuan?
- Yes.

398
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,890
Would you like it if I cooked for you every day?

399
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:45,930
I mean, Sile can bring her over often for dinner.

400
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,520
Yes, you can come often. Come often.

401
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,520
Okay.

402
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,830
Mommy, I want to eat that.

403
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:03,190
Chen Chen, I like you very much,

404
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:07,010
but I'm Xuan Xuan's mommy.

405
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,720
You want her to be your mom, but she doesn't feel the same way.

406
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,250
Don't flatter yourself.

407
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,230
She is my mommy!

408
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,280
She's my mommy!

409
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,450
They're a family.

410
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,520
You pinched me!

411
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,610
N-No, I didn't. I just

412
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,750
touched you. Don't cry, don't cry.

413
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,780
Song Xingchen, boys aren't allowed to cry. If you keep this up, I'll send you to your room.

414
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,230
Grandpa, Haoyu, I'm leaving.

415
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,350
Kids are too much trouble!

416
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,240
Luoqi, come visit us more often.

417
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,700
All right, stop crying. She's gone.

418
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,650
Come and play!

419
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,670
Chase me!

420
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,490
Thanks for sharing your opinions.

421
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,690
I've already given it a lot of thought.

422
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,970
Then, I can only wish for your success.

423
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,200
Thank you, Lawyer Wang.

424
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,900
Let's play on the slide!

425
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,980
I’ll go first.

426
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,640
The slide's here!

427
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,530
President Song!

428
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,830
Auntie Du sliced some fruit.

429
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:16,350
Shall we have some while talking?

430
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,260
Let's talk first.

431
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,090
Sure.

432
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,610
Come with me.

433
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,730
Okay.

434
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,000
- Xuan Xuan, be careful.
- Okay!

435
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,530
President Song, your garden is beautiful.

436
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,340
Grandpa likes it.

437
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,470
President Song, let me do it.

438
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,380
Sure. Thanks.

439
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,120
Not at all.

440
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,560
I heard that people who keep succulents

441
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,650
love the vibrancy of life.

442
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:04,350
President Song, do you think my proposal

443
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,430
has a very refreshing strength?

444
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,660
Yeah.

445
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,910
I'm glad you agree.

446
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:16,400
However, even the best ideas need to be watered just like plants.

447
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,910
President Song, I wonder if you're willing

448
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,960
to move forward with

449
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,380
- Let's get a marriage license.
- our partnership?

450
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:38,130
♫ From this moment ♫
♫ I want to sing softly about us ♫
