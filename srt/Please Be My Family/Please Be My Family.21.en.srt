Hao Jun, congratulations.

24
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,810
Speaking of this, we must thank our sister-in-law.

No, wait.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,190
For me and Li Xin to finally be together, it's all thanks to sister-in-law for pointing the way.

You see, the comments are leaning in one direction. They're all shipping Haoyu and sister-in-law.

41
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,250
Haoyu, don't you still have to film the last episode? Looks like you need to take sister-in-law.

42
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,570
You can't let down the audience.

I'll be the manager.

I think so, too. I think I'm in a very good state recently.

98
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,610
I'm guessing it's probably because...

This piece, if I use gold for it, what do you think?

109
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,380
Yes, it looks good. This rubus coronarius flower is really unique.

110
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,480
But platinum would look more fairytale-like than the gold.

111
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,040
You're an amateur. Don't randomly give your opinion.

112
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,860
It's obvious that the gold will show up more. Gold is good.

113

I'll give you three days then.

You're so good.

144
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,460
Daddy, how about you never do overtime again?

145
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,570
Let Uncle Ugly do it.

146
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,230
Then you can keep me and Xuan Xuan company every day.

147
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,770
Okay. You're so smart.

148
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,800

00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,120
It's lunchtime. Aren't you going to have lunch before you go?

176
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,590
She has anxiety. It's a very dangerous illness.

177
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,230
In serious cases, she might be unable to breathe.

178
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,470
How did she develop this?

179
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,300
Actually, three years ago,

180
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,520
when she had just left the country,

181
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,420
because of the problems between you and her, she isolated herself.

182
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,230
Not long after, she developed anxiety.

183
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,160
Luckily, she was treated in time

184
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,110
and it didn't affect training or competitions.

185
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:32,650
President Song, actually she came back to the country this time,

186
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,330
because of you. But she didn't expect to come back and find

187
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,190
that you were already married.

188
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,070
I'll go see her.

189
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,900
You're so annoying. I already told you to leave me alone!

190
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,960
Why isn't he back yet?

191
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,810
The reality show, Long Time No See, that Jin Xichen is participating in

192
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,510
will be delaying its broadcast.

193
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,950
This has caused a heated discussion to ensue online.

194
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,850
Many netizens are concerned about Jin Xichen's current state of health.

195
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,610
You're back.

196
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,370
You haven't slept yet?

197
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,540
Why did you come back so late today?

198
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,750
I went to settle some things.

199
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,880
It was a little troublesome.

200
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,600
Her manager has said that the information being spread online is untrue.

201
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,210
Okay, next, let us all take a look at

202
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,740
the replays of Jin Xichen's existing performance in competition.

203
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:01,080
Was it about Jin Xichen?

204
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,370
She's sick.

205
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,090
What's she sick with?

206
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,910
It's quite serious.

207
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:18,610
Sile, I went to help her find a suitable psychologist to treat her at home.

208
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,170
Please don't think too much of it.

209
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,860
Got it.

210
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,060
Thanks.

211
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,080
Don't be silly.

212
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,350
It's Jin Xichen's manager.

213
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,660
It's fine. Take the call.

214
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,120
What's wrong, A Lai?

215
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:59,900
Yes, I've contacted them. The NDA can be signed tomorrow.

216
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,920
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

217
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,530
You know what my illness

218
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,650
means to a snooker player?

219
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,080
It means I won't be able to control my breathing

220
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,100
and my hands will shake.

221
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:29,410
I won't be able to play and I'll no longer be able to compete.

222
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,370
I'll find the best doctor

223
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,020
to treat you at home.

224
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,170
I'll also get them to sign an NDA.

225
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,430
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

226
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,880
No.

227
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,930
I can't let anyone find out about this.

228
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,360
Hey!

229
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,380
You scared me.

230
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,160
What are you doing here?

231
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,170
Waiting to have dinner with you, of course.

232
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,510
The feeling of having someone at home waiting for me

233
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,580
really is great.

234
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,360
Then...

235
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,120
Let's go.

236
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,860
When did this light go out?

237
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,010
It's always like this.

238
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,450
That's ridiculous. You don't even have a light.

239
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,320
I'm used to it already.

240
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,170
Looks like I have to come over often.

241
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:20,950
The area around your community is too dangerous.

242
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,670
The last time was a thief breaking in.

243
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,160
And now it's entering the house in the dark.

244
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,460
What would I do if something

245
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,390
really happened to you?

246
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,850
It's not that serious.

247
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,090
I'm smart and can fight.

248
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,620
Who would be able to hurt me?

249
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,970
I'll find someone to fix it tomorrow or I'll do it myself.

250
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,030
You know how to fix lights?

251
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,550
It's just standing on a chair and pulling on the circuit breaker.

252
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,160
When did you learn to do so many things?

253
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,360
There are still many things you don't know about.

254
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,050
I just feel bad whenever I think about you having to walk home

255
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,300
alone in the dark every day.

256
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,090
Here. Try some of this. It's delicious.

257
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,490
You have to dance the same moves as her. That's right.

258
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,280
Why did it... hang?

259
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,530
I'm sharing the network cable with my neighbor.

260
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,760
The connection might be loose. I'll go take a look.

261
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,220
It's so dark outside. Don't go.

262
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,590
It's fine. The internet will be back after I unplug and replug the cable.

263
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,540
Oh, it's back. Come on.

264
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,490
Li Xin.

265
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,120
You're used to walking in the dark,

266
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,150
know how to fix lights,

267
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,160
and can even fix an internet cable in the middle of the night.

268
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,660
My heart breaks for you.

269
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,510
Why? Isn't this normal?

270
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:23,560
You have me now. You can leave all these things to me from now on.

271
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,510
All right.

272
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:31,270
Come on, let's play. Time's running out.

273
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,510
I was thinking,

274
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,740
how about I check out of the hotel

275
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,650
and buy a house. Then, we can live together in it.

276
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,970
I just started to feel positively about you and now you're back to your old ways.

277
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,710
How? I'm just trying to say,

278
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,160
if we're living together, it's easier for me to take care of you.

279
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,390
We're just dating. Why do we need to cohabit before marriage?

280
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,190
Before marriage?

281
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,660
Okay, I understand!

282
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,960
- What did you understand?
- I just understand.

283
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,020
What is going through that head of yours all day? I don't get it.

284
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,520
Ever since Jin Xichen became our ambassador,
[Molin Group]

285
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,240
Molin's sales have skyrocketed.

286
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,530
The delay in the reality show's broadcast

287
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,210
has resulted in her becoming an even hotter topic.

288
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,190
The shareholders on my side

289
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,830
are all very satisfied.

290
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,390
Moreover, President Song hasn't been coming to the company

291
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,750
and more shareholders are coming to our side now.

292
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,890
Is President Song not in the office again today?

293
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,610
Ever since you joined us,

294
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,980
you've done a lot for him.

295
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,490
All of his schemes have all been exposed.

296
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,920
What do you mean by that?

297
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,360
I found someone to look into things.

298
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,090
He went to see Jin Xichen.

299
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,780
Jin Xichen is Molin's image ambassador.

300
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:06,420
President Song might have met with her to speak about business.

301
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:11,270
Think about it. Why would he go to her house when they could meet in the office?

302
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:14,520
You're still too young and naive.

303
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:45,460
How long are you planning to stay in the same spot?

304
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,570
Should I lie to myself instead and tell myself that everything will get better?

305
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:56,890
Yes. Even if you lie to yourself, you have to keep telling yourself that everything will get better.

306
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,620
Only by doing that will you have hope.

307
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,050
Tell me the truth, then.

308
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,650
If you hadn't meet Qi Sile,

309
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,960
after I returned,

310
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,340
would we still have had a chance?

311
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,600
I don't want to answer your question.

312
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,100
Why? Are you afraid of wavering?

313
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,560
I'll help you get through these tough times as your friend, okay?

314
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,830
Stop holing yourself up here.

315
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,360
Cooperate with the doctor, okay?

316
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,730
If I have time, I'll visit you.

317
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,430
[Jin Xichen]

318
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,250
Hello.

319
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,970
Where are you? Can we meet?

320
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,400
Let's talk about Haoyu.

321
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,920
Didn't Haoyu already explain things clearly to you?

322
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,830
But I still can't accept it.

323
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,570
Then what do you want to do?

324
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,920
Can you...

325
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,440
Divorce him?

326
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,530
Are you kidding me?

327
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:38,110
I want to know if he can still say those cruel words

328
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:41,720
to me without the bondage of marriage.

329
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,910
If time could go back

330
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,450
would you choose Haoyu or being the world champion?

331
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,220
Of course, it's Hao Yu.

332
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:55,780
Can you say with certainty that you hesitated when you got on the plane three years ago?

333
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,950
Or did you regret leaving him when you stepped on the podium and raised your trophy high in the air?

334
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,660
- What do you know?
- I know you think it's unfair.

335
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,220
But since you've made your decision, you should be responsible for it.

336
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,130
You clearly know how much it would hurt him to leave right before you two

337
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,570
were about to get married, but you still did it.

338
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,860
In that case, you shouldn't have hoped he would wait for you.

339
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:26,140
Even if he didn't wait for me. That doesn't mean he doesn't have me in his heart.

340
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,070
Because he knows more than anyone else

341
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,980
that I wanted to become a champion so that we could have a better future.

342
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,570
Miss Jin, marriage isn't a competition.

343
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:38,030
There's no second chance after you miss out on it.

344
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,200
From the moment he decided to marry me,

345
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,670
you completely disappeared from his future.

346
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,520
This isn't up to you.

347
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,800
Because you don't know

348
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,540
how deeply in love we were.

349
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:07,450
We're very happy right now. I won't divorce him. Take care.

350
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:12,630
♫ An evening breeze dissolves the midsummer night's dream  ♫

351
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:19,840
♫ I see the starry night in your eyes ♫

352
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:26,810
♫ Gently humming a song, it enters my heart  ♫

353
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,740
♫  I want to give you all of my warm embraces ♫

354
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,380
Come in.

355
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,790
Why are you here? Wait for me. I'm almost finished.

356
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:49,390
♫ It turns out, it's been transferred to your eyes ♫

357
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,420
Haoyu.

358
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,180
Hug me.

♫ From this moment ♫

361
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,680
♫ Please be my family ♫

362
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,070
♫ Going to fill my world with wonderful dreams ♫

363
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:19,920
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

364
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,070
What's wrong? Are you sad?

365
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,710
No.

366
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:29,880
I'm just a little tired, so I came to recharge some energy through you.

367
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,840
Okay, I'll give you all the energy you need.

368
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:37,340
♫ From this moment ♫

369

♫ Please be with me for the rest of my life ♫

370
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:43,280
♫ An ode to time ♫

371
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:49,350
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

372
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,480
Sile. Come here.

373
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,920
There's something bothering you.

374
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,860
No.

375
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,780
You're a bit weird today.

376
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,610
You're the strange one.

377
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,610
How am I strange?

378
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,510
You're strangely cute.

379
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,490
Sile.

380
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:40,470
We'll always be happy.

381
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,250
Are you tired from being with me while I was working overtime?

382
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,370
I'm not tired. Are you?

383
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,820
I'm definitely not tired.

384
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:13,800
But it was hard to concentrate when you were next to me.

385
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,520
Wait. Who's calling me?

386
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,900
Who is it? So late.

387
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,770
Hao Jun?

388
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,860
- What's wrong?
 - You two aren't asleep yet, right?

389
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,680
- Yes, she's here.
 - Put me on speaker.

390
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,690
Speaker?

391
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,390
Speak.

392
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,610
Hao Jun, you're looking for me?

393
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:47,180
The kindergarten is closed tomorrow and Li Xin will be working on duty. I'll be proposing to her tomorrow.

394
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,490
- Huh?
- Really?

395
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:54,830
Oh, right. Haoyu, can I ask you when you proposed—

396
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,220
Oh, I almost forgot. I can't use you as an example.

397
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,150
Hao Jun, if you can't speak properly, just keep quiet.

398
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:07,800
Hao Jun, you're proposing tomorrow? Don't you think you're rushing it?

399
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,100
All the arrangements have been made. I just need to borrow Chen Chen for tomorrow.
