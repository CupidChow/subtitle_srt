[Is this a real plot?]
[My heart is fluttering.]

26

Did everything go well at work today?

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,900
It went pretty smoothly.

00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,470
[The more I look at the female lead, the more beautiful she is.]

31
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,720
Raise the head at a 45-degree angle.

32
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,880
Gaze at him... admiringly.

33
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,220
Look at this.

34
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,660

I-I just want to confirm how he feels about me.

40
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,480
This method...

41
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,160
Wait.

42
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,200
Does it have to be such a big fuss?

00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:03,340
[Do you love me?]
[Episode 14]

44
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,820
It'll work with the liquor.

Qi Sile.

46
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,840
Prepare to raise the gaze with the head at a 45-degree angle.

47
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,540
- Why are you dressed like this?
- Was everything taken care of at work?

48
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,960
- What's that smell?
 - Should I gaze at him admiringly?

49
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,390
I knew that it wouldn't be difficult for you.

50
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,900
What?

51
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,720
What did you say?

52
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,530
You're a little different today.

53
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,550
How am I different?

54
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,170
You drank?

55
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,690
Just a little bit.

56
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,130
You can't drink. Why did you drink?

57
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:50,130
One, two, three, four, five...

58
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,860
- After the gazing rule,
- What?

59
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:59,320
I have to use words to hint at the intimate moment between two people.

60
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,510
What gazing rule?

61
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,390
That's what I'm thinking in my head. How did you know about it?

62
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,450
Is this what they mean by spiritual consonance?

63
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,820
Spiritual consonance...

64
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,140
If you can't drink, don't drink.

65
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,750

71
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,410
I do.

If I don't do this,

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,340
how would I know if you like me or not?

74

00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,820
Mommy is still sleeping.

Do you... like me?

85
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,300
I really said it.

86
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,830
Alcohol really is evil.

What do I do now?

88
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,530
She's trying to protect herself by losing her temper.

89
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,900
It means she's very fragile. The more it means she cares about you.

90
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,300
But, how do I confess to her...

91
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,040
again?

92
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,730

00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,930
Good morning.

95
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,280
Come quickly.

96
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,050
We're about to start our class. Get organized, come on my loves.

97
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,520
Didn't you say you wanted to chat at the office? Why meet here?

98
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:40,040
President Song, you want me to join Molin. Don't you want to get to know me better?

99
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,960
Your taste for food is very similar to someone I know.

100
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,420
Is that so?

101
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,690
Do you mean Sile?

102
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,580
Qin Tian.

103
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,900
President Song, we're honest people, so let's talk openly.

104
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,070
You should trust your wife and trust yourself.

105
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,330
Besides, when it comes to the relationship, I've never been your enemy.

106
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,360
Shopkeeper, give me a bowl just like his.

107
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,530
- Sure.
- Thanks.

108
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,650
The legal department sent you an employment contract this morning. Have you reviewed it?

109
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,540
I did.

110
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,970
It also includes the clause to bring in the KL brand.

111
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,830
With your qualifications, it shouldn't be hard to get KL.

112
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,890
But, how do you let the KL brand and other brands win at the same time

113
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:33,460
and also attract other big brands? That'll require more effort from you.

114
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:40,920
President Song, are you trying to scour clean all the resources I have?

115
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,760
You really are a true businessman. Here.

116
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,370
Try it.

117
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,260
The line that you just said,

118
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,450
I'll believe you this time.

119
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,550
Which line?

120
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:10,050
President Song, rest assured. I always follow the rules when doing things.

121
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,750
I have a younger cousin who's 30 years old.

122
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,800
Should I introduce you two?

123
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,630
Sorry, but I prefer a younger brother.
 (T/N: Younger man )

124
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,930
Younger brother?

125
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,700
Miss, I don't want to eat vegetables. I want to eat meat.

126
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,120
Vegetables taste great. They're so green.

127
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,860
I love eating vegetables, too.

128
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,620
Don't keep attacking my soldiers.
 (T/N: League of Legends online game)

129
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,930
I want to buy weapons. I need money. Get it? I need money.

130
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,760
She loves green?

131
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,830
She also loves a younger brother, and she needs money.

132
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,160
Chen Chen, good job.

133
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,170
Who are you looking for?

134
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,200
Excuse me, is Li Xin here?

135
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,370
Miss Li Xin! Someone's here for you!

136
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,050
Okay!

137
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,210
Who's looking for me?

138
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,820
Older Sister.

139
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,120
What are you doing? Who's your older sister?

140
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,880
Flowers, cake, eyeshadow, and lipstick. All green.

141
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,910
They were really hard to get. Do you like them?

142
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,720
Can you talk like a normal person?

143
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,490
Also, you can quit your current job if you don't like it.

144
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,790
- What?!
- I can keep you company while you look for a job.

145
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,380
Song Xingchen?

146
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,980
You don't like green?

147
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,970
Do you trust everything kids say?

148
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,680
You really...

149
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,820
After what happened last time,

150
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,220
I had made the decision to not see you again.

151
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,860
But I can't do it.

152
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:37,340
I think about you when I'm asleep and awake. I can't help but think about you all the time.

153
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,550
I know you think I'm unreliable.

154
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,550
But I've never encountered anyone who has made me feel this way.

155
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm serious about you.

156
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,310
Li Xin.

157
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,380
Li Xin.

158
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,850
I can't figure you out, but I'm willing to learn.

159
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,850
Will you give me a chance?

160
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,840
Please?

161
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,490
How do you feel exactly?

162
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,610
I'm allergic to love, okay?

163
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,030
Get home safe.

164
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,990
I can tell that Hao Jun cares about you a lot.

165
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:51,210
He bought you gifts and even asked Chen Chen to figure out what you like.

166
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,350
I can't get over that person.

167
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,790
When Hao Jun walked into the office,

168
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,780
he looked at me the same way that person looked at me years ago.

169
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,750
Li Xin!

170
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,490
Forget that person!

171
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,110
I think Hao Jun is pretty nice. Why don't you give him a chance?

172
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,280
What if he comes back after I accept Hao Jun's feelings?

173
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,650
I just don't understand.

174
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,360
Why can't you forget that scumbag?

175
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,400
He's in the past now. Why can't you get over it?

176
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,890
You're just giving yourself a hard time. Why does it matter to you if he comes back or not?

177
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,880
If Chen Chen's biological mom came back,

178
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,210
the woman Song Haoyu used to love, would he be completely indifferent about it?

179
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,000
Would he?!

180
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,330
Sile.

181
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,990
I just said... the first example I thought of

182
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,800
- that would help you understand.
- It's okay.

183
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,380
- I didn't mean it.
- It's okay.

184
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,710
It was just the first thought that came to mind.

185
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,030
It's okay. It's okay.

186
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,920
I just want you to understand

187
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,070
that what we currently have is what's real.

188
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,790
I believe in Haoyu, and I believe in you.

189
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,700
It's going to be okay.

190
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,680
Chen Chen's biological mom.

191
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:51,250
Enough of that. I should think about how to resolve what happened last night.

192
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,690
Haoyu... I...

193
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,760
I confess my feelings to everyone when I got drunk.

194
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,290
Don't take it to heart.

195
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,130
Am I trying to ruin my reputation?

196
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,200
- Sile.
- Yeah?

197
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,240
- Last night...
- I got too drunk last night and don't remember anything.

198
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,160
Okay then.

199
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,850
Then... let's go to sleep.

200
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,850
Wait!

201
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,960
Let's... talk.

202
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,650
Okay.

203
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,620
Even though I might not remember,

204
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,600
but you do, right?

205
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,910
Which sentence are you referring to?

206
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:16,430
Did I ask you a question last night?

207
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,960
Which question?

208
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,510
Haoyu...

209
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,410
I've always been curious.

210
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,480
Why did you decide to marry me back then?

211
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,450
Can you tell me?

212
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,530
If you become husband and wife,

213
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,090
the child will become a part of the Song family

214
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:56,990
and then you can get a divorce and fight for custody.

215
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,640
Sile.

216
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,480
I married you back then...

217
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,600
I married you back then because...

218
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,740
I'm going outside to get some air.

219
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,750
You go to sleep first.

220
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,640
Did I...

221
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,960
get rejected?

222
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:49,260
Am I really just a good mom in his heart?

223
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,270
- Store Manager.
- What's wrong?

224
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,520
You've been spacing off lately. Where did the energetic Sile go?

225
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,220
Cheer up! Let me tell you,

226
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,390
Miss Yu will be here in ten minutes.

227
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,890
She said the raw diamond ring arrived,

228
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,860
but she doesn't seem too happy with it.

229
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,950
Welcome, Miss Yu.

230
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,650
- Just in time. Help me take a look at this.
- Sure. Just a moment.

231
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:31,580
The natural stone is fine, but it's a round cut.

232
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,380
The crown mounted around it doesn't have any contrast.

233
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,560
It doesn't show much value.

234
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,280
A good natural stone should indeed be paired with a simple crown.

235
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,780
It seems like you also agree that the current crown doesn't look that nice.

236
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,960
Come, have a seat.

237
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,920
Tell me how the jewels should be set.

238
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,580
If we change the round diamond to red agate,

239
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,390
and change the style of the clasp to

240
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:05,670
a nouveau Chinese auspicious cloud style, it might look more elegant and integrated.

241
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,450
You're right. Those changes would make it more unique.

242
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,660
- Okay then, make the changes according to what you said.
- What?

243
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,720
What do you mean what? I won't buy this ring

244
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,800
with it looking like that.

245
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,470
Just a second. Let me ask.

246
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,310
Store Manager, can we ask to make changes?

247
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,150
We can't.

248
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:35,210
All of Fanyi's designers have their own unique style. How could you make changes to someone else's work?

249
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,300
Manman, you're here.

250
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,240
What if we have the original designer make the changes?

251
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,500
Have them scrap their own design?

252
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,930
How could you even think that?

253
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:50,850
If Miss Yu really has a need, she can make a request for a custom design. Understand?

254
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:55,680
But then this wouldn't be considered your sale if that ends up happening.

255
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,210
Excuse me!

256
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,850
Mr. Qin, what are you doing here?

257
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:05,160
I'm Maolin Mall's current marketing director, Qin Tian.

258
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,850
I'm doing a routine check on each store's business operations.

259
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,690
Director Qin, here, have a seat.

260
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,540
That's okay.

261
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,130
Nice to meet you, President Tong.

262
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,140
Marketing director?

263
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,990
Song Haoyu asked you to come, didn't he?

264
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,900
He has a lot free time, it seems.

265
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,450
You seem quite angry, President Tong. Is there anything I can help with?

266
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,820
Qi Sile wants a designer to revise their original design.

267
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,950
We don't do that at Fanyi.

268
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,810
I think you should let Qi Sile have a try.

269
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,990
I've seen your designs, and you also make your own jewelry.

270
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:48,640
I'm sure you've cultivated your craft, so I believe in you.

271
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,970
Qi Sile.

272
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,240
This is a ¥3.6 million accessory.

273
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,320
Do you dare touch it?

274
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:02,150
I want to find a job. What do you think?

275
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,760
- You're amazing, Mommy!
- Chen Chen supports you, Mommy!

276
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,140
I just want them to understand

277
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,070
that mommy can be like daddy, and take charge of her career.

278
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,550
I can give it a try.

279
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,700
Please get over yourself.

00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,210
Today is the last day of your probation.

281
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,480
I'll finish it before closing time.

282
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,820
If I can complete this order,

283
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,440
I'll officially become Fanyi's employee.

284
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,300
Since there's no way to retreat, let's give it a try.

285
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,750
I say, Luoqi,

286
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,840
if it can really be modified,

287
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,680
you'll really end up taking a lot of money from me.

288
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,060
Do your best.

289
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,600
Okay, you can make the modifications.

290
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,990
But I don't have a setup for jewelry work here.

291
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,940
Figure it out yourself.

292
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,930
Manman, I need to leave first.

293
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,800
Manager Wu, close the store promptly at 10 pm.

294
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:09,430
- President Tong.
- Take care, President Tong.

295
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,680
President Song, Store Manager Wu just called.

296
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,360
She said your wife accepted a mission from President Tong to modify a piece of jewelry for Miss Yu.

297
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,310
If she succeeds, then she'll be able to become an official employee.

298
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,840
That sounds good.

299
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,440
It's just that President Tong won't lend any equipment for working on the jewelry.

300
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,010
I remember there was a jewelry workshop room in the B-area.

301
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:41,640
Yes, there is. But no one's used it for a long time, so it's locked up.

302
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,160
Then hurry and ask the back office to find the key.

303
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,720
- Okay.
- Wait.

304
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,170
Once the key is found, give it directly to Store Manager Wu.

305
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,620
Manager Wu?

306
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,660
Don't give it directly to your wife?

307
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,190
That's right.

308
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,910
Give it to Manager Wu.

According to the company's rules,

any expensive items worth ¥3 million or more being taken out of the store,

313

00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,420
I thought that red agate would better bring...

352
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,140
Bring out the color!

353
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,720
Red agate better brings out the color!

354
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,930
It looks so good!

355
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,430
What?

356
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,920
It's great.

357
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,800
Why are you still standing there? Help me check out!

358
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,680
- Okay, thank you.
- You're closing soon.

359
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,920
Why are you just standing there?

360
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,570
The commission on my sale is yours.

361
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,910
Aren't you going to thank me?

362
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:34,410
Thank you! Thank you, Miss Yu.

363
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,830
I... I really was so worried you wouldn't be happy with it.

364
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,600
Store Manager Wu.

365
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,790
Qi Sile can become an official employee now, right?

366
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,970
Yes.

367
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,680
What are you all waiting for?

368
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,180
Are you waiting to celebrate after I leave?

369
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,170
Qi Sile, congratulations on becoming an official Fanyi employee!

370
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,720
Thank you, Store Manager! Thank you!

371
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,210
It's all your doing.

372
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,150
Thank you, Miss Yu.

373
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,190
Hello? President Tong.

374
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,210
I saw the payment come in. Be honest. Did Song Haoyu pay for it?

375
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:16,630
No. Miss Yu made the purchase because she was happy with it.

376
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,500
Have her take the call.

377
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:26,440
- President Tong.
- Qi Sile, why are you working so hard? Doesn't Song Haoyu support you?

378
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,060
I'm just doing what I love.

379
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,870
Besides, our relationship as man and wife is nothing you need to worry about.

380
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:36,090
As man and wife? You're provoking me on purpose, aren't you?

381
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,110
You're the one who wanted to challenge me, President Tong.

382
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,590
Update! Update! The lioness got knocked down!

383
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,590
Fine, Qi Sile. Don't think you're all that.

384
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,370
He'll never have feelings for anybody else.

385
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,600
You're asking for trouble by marrying him! Bye!

386
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,930
Ignore her. Don't take it to heart.

387
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,730
That's it?

388
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:01,210
- That's all the drama I get to see after spending so much money?
- What?

389
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,540
Whatever. I'll teach you the ways of arguing with people later on.

390
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,790
I'm off!

391
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,520
Take care, Miss Yu!

392
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,720
Please come again!

393
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,310
That was great!

394
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:18,510
You're finally one of us! That was amazing!

395
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,810
Thank you, Everyone!

396
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,980
Hello? What's the update?

397
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,670
President Song. Store Manager Wu just called and said Mrs. Song succeeded.

398
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,980
Good. That's great.

399
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,360
Are you going to get dinner with her later to celebrate?

400
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,690
That's not for you to worry about.

401
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,950
Hello? I'd like to reserve a private room.

402
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,690
For two, my wife and I.

403
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,180
Thank you.

404
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,950
It's such an important day for me.

405
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,980
And he didn't even ask me once about how it's going.

406
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,150
Qi Sile!

407
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,580
You scared me!

408
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,150
Why the long face on your big day?

409
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,940
I'm not.

410
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,040
What's wrong?

411
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,620
My official employment contract!

412
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,050
Look! I got such a large commission, too!

413
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,200
I have to give you a proper thank you for today.

414
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,610
If it weren't for your encouragement,

415
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:28,940
I really wouldn't have dared to take on such an important task.

416
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,940
Tell me. How should I thank you?

417
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,720
[Please Be My Family]

418
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:02,270
♫ I thought I missed the rainbow ♫

419
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:09,130
♫ It turns out, it's been transfered to your eyes ♫

00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:52,570
♫ It can't be compared to a minute of our embrace ♫

428

430
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,310
♫ An ode to time ♫

♫ The moment we fell in love ♫

435
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:23,610
♫ From this moment ♫

436
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:28,640
♫ I'm running toward you ♫

437
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,950
♫ Gone through the maze of time ♫

♫ You are still in my heart ♫

439
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,570
♫ We have too many encounters ♫

440
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,660
♫ And has always been in a hurry ♫

441
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:51,570
♫ I once forgotten the love we had ♫

442
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:57,000
♫ The moment you made my heart flutter ♫
