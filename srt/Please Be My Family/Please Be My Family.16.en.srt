Li Xin, I heard you've had a craving for hotpot lately.

22
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,850
I've booked a private room. I'll wait for you.

23
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,960
He wants to get together for a meal as soon as he's back from traveling.

24
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,240
What's this Hao Jun up to now?

25
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,550
If it didn't happen to be my day off,

26
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,330
I wouldn't even come.

27
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,700
You're here!

28
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,120
Take a seat.

29
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,130
I initially wanted to meet you alone, but it just happened

30
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,390
these young ladies wanted to have lunch with me.

31
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,430
A reunion with old friends, and a get-together with new friends.

32
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,750
You... don't mind, right?

33
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,830
You have to be jealous now.

34
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,280
Come clean, you've been thinking about me.

35
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,350
Why would I mind?

36
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,500
My favorite thing to do is to have a meal with pretty ladies.

37
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,200
I can't wait.

38
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,990
Fine. Still talking tough?

39
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,640
I'll irritate you a little more then.

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,040

Kindergarten teacher, 27 and a half years old.

43
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,830
27 and a half?

44
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,840
28 years old?

45
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,310
Brother Jun, how do you get such an old younger sister?

What do you think? I'm awesome, right?

52
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,840
How come I didn't know you were so childish before?

53
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,090
I also didn't know that I would be this childish someday.

54
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,040
You're still laughing.

55
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,970
What's wrong?

56
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,930
Nothing.

57
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,690
I just think that the happiness right now doesn't feel real.

58
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,470
Does it feel real now?

59
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,400
- Sile.
- Yes?

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,180
I really am very happy right now.

61
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,490
Why don't you go to my dad's study to sleep?

62
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,390
We're both pretty tired after today.

63
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,770
When we sleep in the same bed,

64
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,570
we definitely won't sleep well.

65
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,180
Won't sleep well?

66
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,790
Then I'll...

67
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll go?

68
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,190
All right then.

69
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,130
Are you mad?

70
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,680
Didn't you just say

71
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,790
we won't sleep well in the same bed?

72
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,770
Not really.

73
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,740
I just...

74
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,920
because I'm in my own home.

75
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,810

76
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,260

00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,380
Sister, I didn't know you could look so gentle, but also ride a motorcycle.

80
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,270
Yeah, you're really amazing!

81
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,600
Sister, can you send me info on that face-lifting tutorial you talked about?

82
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,060
You're so young, it's probably too early for you to learn that.

83
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,990
Sister, you look like you're in your early 20s.

84
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,020
I want, when I get to 28,

85
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,960
to look just like you.

86
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,260

87
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,460
Of course. Let's do it later.

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,880
Check please!

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,620
Wow, Sister, you're so cool!

91
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,260
So cool!

92
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,660
Sister, can I visit your motorcycle club?

93
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,020
Sure. If those brothers at the club see you, they'll all go crazy.

94
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,390
You should be careful.

95
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,980
Sister!

96
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,550
As for dinner tonight,

97
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,140
thanks!

98
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,500
Sure.

99
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,630
Sisters, didn't we agree to provoke her to make her admit that she likes me?

100
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,260
Why didn't you follow the script? What's the point of our rehearsal then?!

101
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,790
Sister Li Xin is a really good person.

102
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,320
You still wanted to play this act, so childish.

103
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,930
If you like her, just take the initiative to bow your head.

104
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,480
Doing this will make the girl think you aren't reliable.

105
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,710
That's right. Why do you insist on going against her?

106
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,000
You can't defeat her anyway. Why bother?

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,750
- We're off now.
- All right.

108
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,470
- Bye-bye.
- We're leaving too. Bye-bye!

109
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,280
Hello, book me a ticket for a night skiing session at the ski resort.

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,080
What do you care?!

111
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,100
I just want to cool off.

112
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,970
It's you. It's you.

113
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,260
Let you play. Let you play.

114
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,370
So you go out to fool around!

115
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,210
I'm so annoyed!

116
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,880
Dad, Mom,

117
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,590
you haven't shown me

118
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,550
how to survive without you!

119
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,240
How am I supposed to support this family?

120
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,520
Take me with you!

121
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,680
Otherwise, I'll be really scared.

122
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,270
Don't go.

123
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,530
Of course, they can't bear to take you with them.

124
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,660
They love you, believe me.

125
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,140
Someday in the future,

126
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:33,340
you'll definitely find the meaning of happiness again.

127
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,600
Haoyu, I started simmering this carp fish soup early this morning.

128
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,690
- Drink more of it, and boost your energy.
- Thanks, Dad.

129
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,800
Isn't that so? You must have been exhausted yesterday. We have steamed buns as well.

130
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,470
Mom, why are you saying something like that?

131
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,890
Haoyu chopped so many chili peppers for your eldest aunt yesterday.

132
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,840
Is it wrong for me to care about him?

133
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Chopping chili peppers...

134
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,950
That's right. Your eldest aunt came this morning, saying she had something to give you,

135
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,400
as a thank-you gift for yesterday.

136
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,750
Don't move, as long as you stay calm.

137
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,830
I'll be calm. Okay?

138
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,170
We'll both be fine.

139
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,700
You're a man. Why are you this afraid of a duck?

140
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,100
Who's afraid of it?

141
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,180
But this "big" gift from your eldest aunt

142
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,830
is a bit hard to accept.

143
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:21,040
How about we cook it and have duck stewed with pickled mustard greens?

144
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,950
Y-You mean it?

145
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,140
Let me ask.

146
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,310
What are you doing?

147
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,890
I'm having a talk with it.

148
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,330
I asked it if I could make it into a stew, and it said no.

149
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:51,250
And then I asked if we can give it a name. It said, okay.

150
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,800
Wow!

151
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,610
- Haoyu!
- Yes, Mom, Dad.
- Don't keep this

152
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,810
chili sauce for too long. It tastes the best when it's fresh.

153
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,480
Got it, Mom.

154
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,300
These are wild mushrooms from the mountain.

155
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,280
Take them back to let your grandpa have a taste.

156
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,580
Also, this is all-natural produce from the mountain. They're good for the health.

157
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,770
Remember... to eat more of it.

158
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,280
Thank you, Dad.

159
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,150
Dad! Mom!

160
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,600
I think we're all set.

161
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,520
If you're all set, better go now before it gets dark.

162
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,950
Don't drive at night.

163
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,390
- Okay.
- Sile, you can get in the car first.

164
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,350
I want to chat with Mom and Dad.

165
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,400
Oh, okay.

Chong Ya.
 (T/N: Means Let's Go! )

167
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,970
Our house has two children, they'll definitely like you a lot.

168
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,270
Are you willing to come home with us?

169
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,440
Dad, I didn't get a chance to tell you during the past two days.

170
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,270
Sile has already started to work on what she likes to do.

171
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,680
- Good son.
- What?

172
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,690
Can't I be cheesy once? Look at you two.

173
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,740
Your dad has always said that "a son-in-law is half a biological son".

174
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,790
He was nervous for a few days, and he finally said it out loud.

175
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,430
Why did you mention that? Really.

176
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,870
All right, Haoyu. Sile's waiting.

177
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,790
Drive slowly on the way. Be safe.

178
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,130
Okay.

179
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,890
Dad, Mom, we'll get going now.

180
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,010
Drive slowly. Okay?

181
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,040
- Go back inside.
- Okay.

182
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,900
Someday in the future,

183
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,120
you'll definitely find the meaning of happiness again.

184
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,950
What's the matter?

185
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,280
I used to imagine many times,

186
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,920
if I still had my parents, what would I feel whenever I had to depart from them?

187
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,180
Perhaps it would be like how I feel now.

188
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,400
Haoyu, I have something to give you.

189
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,230
What is it?

190
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,250
- This is...
- It's from mom.

191
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,260
They used it when they got married.

192
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,800
Originally I wanted to personally design one for you.

193
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,420
But I think...

194
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,290
this one is more meaningful.

195
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,580
Oh no, I think it's too big.

196
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,630
Doesn't matter, we'll just adjust it.

197
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,040
Okay.

198
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,140
Where's your ring?

199
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,690
The diamond on mine is too large.

200
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,590
- It's not convenient to wear at work.
- I don't care.

201
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,520
Even if you don't wear it, you should always carry it with you.

202
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,340
Let others know you have a husband.

203
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,290
All right.

204
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,910
How about... I wear this one first?

205
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,130
Song Haoyu, watch the road.

206
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,540
What did you call me?

207
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,740
Song—

208
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,580
- Hurry up.
- Hubby.

209
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,410
- Mommy.
- Daddy! Mommy!

210
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,860
Xuan Xuan, Chen Chen!

211
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,640
Come.

212
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,780
Oh my.

213
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,720
Daddy, Mommy, how come you went away for so long?

214
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,560
And didn't take us with you?

215
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,110
We're back now, did you miss daddy?

216
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,350
I missed you a lot.

217
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,190
- What about you?
- I missed you, too!

218
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:31,310
Every day, I had to coax my sister to sleep. I worked so hard.

219
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:36,050
I've been taking care of the family for you two!

220
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,610
Thank you, Chen Chen.

221
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,950
You really are my good child. Right?

222
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,400
Yes.

223
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,970
- Haoyu, you're back.
- Grandpa.
- Grandpa.

224
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,190
Sile, how are the your parents?

225
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,370
They're well. They asked me to send their regards to you.

226
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,820
They also had us bring back some local produce to let you try them.

227
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,830
Why are they so courteous?

228
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,100
What's that sound outside?

229
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,030
One of the local produce is alive.

230
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,990
I'll take them to have a look.

231
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,990
That sounds like a duck, right?

232
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,620
- Yeah.
- I'm doomed.

233
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,240
My backyard will be ruined.

234
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,680
Fine, fine. It's getting late. Tidy up, take a shower, and go to sleep. Okay?

235
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,440
Okay.

236
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,390
Hey, Haoyu.

237
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,270
That... that someone has returned.

238
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,060
Who?

239
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,300
It's nothing much. I saw that you were unhappy with each other the other day.

240
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,420
Now that I see you're doing well, I can be at ease.

241
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,170
- Hurry, clean up and rest.
- Okay.

242
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,420
One order of stinky tofu.

243
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,840
And the river snail vermicelli.

244
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,790
- Sure thing.
- Thanks.

245
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,350
They're ready.

246
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,110
What made you think of bringing me here?

247
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,120
This was the place for our first date. Don't you remember?

248
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,280
How could that time be considered a date?

249
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,380
You're right. It isn't.

250
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,570
This is the sad place where I came, late at night to pick you up,

251
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,720
but instead ran into you and that you-know-who eating together.

252
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,340
I just realized that you really can hold a grudge.

253
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,090
I already told you that day, it was...

254
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,360
I'm teasing you. Anyway, next time if you want to eat it,

255
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,000
just call me. I'll come with you.

256
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,490
Okay.

257
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,310
Don't you have a meeting this afternoon?

258
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,740
Are you okay eating so much garlic?

259
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,880
I've got breath-freshening mints.

260
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,910
You can eat some, too.

261
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,690
I can't be the only one with bad breath.

262
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,230
No, go away.

263
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,880
Behave!

264
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,170
They aren't looking at us.

[Domineering CEO Addicted to Spoiling His Wife]

266
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,180
It's time for my shift.

267
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,050
We still have a little time.

268
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,800
I want to sit with you for awhile before the meeting.

269
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,040
Then, five minutes?

270
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,890
Five minutes?

271
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,760
That's not enough.

272
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,560
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

273
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,090
Let me declare. It's purely an accident.

274
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,370
I'm not interested in watching a live stream from a legally married couple.

275
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,670
What nonsense are you saying?

276
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,920
What's the matter with your voice?

277
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,720
It's magnetic.

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,000
He went skiing right after coming back from Sanya. Crossing 47 degrees Celsius (116.6°F) and he can still talk,

279
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,050
that means he's asking for it.

280
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,750
You should pay attention to your health.

281
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,490
You two must have business to discuss.

282
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:19,570
It's about time for my shift. I'll go first.

283
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,130
I don't have any business to discuss with him.

284
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,470
I'll find a way to make him leave.

285
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,670
It's time for my shift.

286
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,750
I'm leaving.

287
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,070
- Sister-in-law, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

288
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,260
So it went well?

289
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,840
Yeah, it went pretty well.

290
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,570
Even your taste has changed.

291
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,530
I get it. It's He Qin's again.

292
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,600
Here you go. Here.

293
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,370
Your voice is in this state already, but you still haven't gone to the hospital.

294
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,790
I'm fine. A little illness

295
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,390
can relieve the fire in my heart and the agitation.

296
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,430
Originally I was trying to trick Li Xin to make her care about me more.

297
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,790
Everyone else told me doing this makes me unreliable.

298
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,270
No wonder Li Xin finds me annoying.

299
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,550
I haven't had the courage to go see her for several days already.

300
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:14,180
Of course, she doesn't find you reliable. You have nothing to do every day.

301
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,710
What should I do to be reliable?

302
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,950
Come back to manage the company with me. Your parents also want you to return.

303
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,950
It's not like you don't know how it is between me and my parents.

304
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,780
How much longer do you plan to be upset with your parents?

305
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,670
No, wait. What do you want me to do?

306
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:33,770
How long has it been since I touched company affairs? Aren't you afraid that I'll make a mistake?

307
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,830
Then, don't leave my sight.

308
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,370
There's a meeting tonight. Come with me.

309
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:46,010
Start from the beginning and learn slowly. I'm sure you can do it.

310
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,860
- You've seduced me.
- Get out.

311
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,530
One, two, step.

312
00:21:55,530 --> 00:22:00,060
Do it again. Left, right, smile. Flower.

313
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,130
That Hao Jun.

314
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,970
He inexplicably asked me and a bunch of young ladies to eat dinner.

315
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,710
And then he suddenly disappeared.

316
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,140
Forget it. Forget it. It's better if he doesn't come bother me.

317
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,930
Okay! Everyone danced really well today. Let's give yourselves a big Like!

318
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,820
Like!

319
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,060
- Want to eat some fruit?
- Yes!

320
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,390
Let's go!

321
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,480
What's the matter, Brother Chen Chen?

322
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,690
She made so many wrong motions.

323
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:34,760
It's a dance that we dance every day, but Godmother confused the left and right.

324
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,320
That's right.

325
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,830
Chen Chen, what's the matter?

326
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,110
Uncle Ugly, my godmother is acting weird.

327
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:58,530
She even made wrong moves in the dance that she's most familiar with.

328
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,950
Are you two being naughty again?

329
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,180
Why are you so weird, too?

330
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,050
You sound like a duck.

331
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,080
Never mind.

332
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,970
Behave and be good at kindergarten.

333
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,470
Uncle has to work today. So I'm hanging up.

334
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,980
Bye.

[Snooker Champion Jin Xichen's bio]

336
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,560
Who's decision was this?

337
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,360
President Song, I recommended Jin Xichen to the company.

338
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,840
Why?

339
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,700
Moalin Mall's operation model is more stylish.

340
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,890
The world champion doesn't suit our positioning.

341
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,620
But, Jin Xichen has enough intrinsic value.

Maolin is the first brand ambassador role she got after winning.

343

For our company image,

00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,410
it's really advantageous.

Director Qin does things resolutely.

346
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,350
You don't need my approval when you make decisions now?

347
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,110
It's like this,

I couldn't reach you on the phone in three whole days.

00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,830
Director Xie initiated special handling.

351
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,870
He held a board meeting to vote, we're all doing this for the good of Maolin Mall.

352
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,740
I believe President Song can understand that.

353
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,000
I understand, of course, I understand.

354
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,100
Director Qin, thanks for your hard work.

355
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,100
However, in order to make this happen,

356
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,060
we still need someone from the company to coordinate it.

357
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,180
President Song, do you have a candidate?

358
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,160
How about you go there personally?

359
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,610
If we let the reporters take a photo of the both of you together and then announce the endorsement,

360
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,930
this will increase publicity even more.

361
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,350
That's right.

362
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,730
Let me go then.

363
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,670
President Song is a low-key person.

364
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:52,050
Miss Jin and I happen to know each other from before, it's appropriate for me to go.

365
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,850
Then that's great! Let's do that.

366
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,760
Haoyu, you're back. Are you tired?

367
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,340
- I'm good.
- Here.

368
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,680
Let me have that.

369
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,530
I made delicious food for you, let me get you some.

370
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,140
All right.

371
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,070
Grandpa.

372
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,660
You're back, hurry, sit down.

373
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,430
Sile has been busy in the kitchen for the last two hours.

374
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,220
She made soup and has been waiting for you.

375
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,710
News from our station, Chinese player Jin Xichen,

376
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,620

377
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,380
Chinese women's snooker is welcoming the Jin Xichen era.

378
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:56,620
She's beautiful and a world champion, what a life!

379
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,210
Haoyu, have some soup.

380
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,820
Please see the detailed report next.

381
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,270
It's time for me to watch "Meeting Mr. Right."

382
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,790
That show is good, I watch every episode.

383
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,160
I'm going upstairs to get changed.

384
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,040
No, wait. I made the soup...

385
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,440
it doesn't taste bad this time!

386
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:39,200
Wins the championship by defeating the legendary champion, 10-5.

387
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,160
Chinese women's snooker is welcoming the Jin Xichen era.

388
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,500
Player Xichen Jin arrived in China recently, and is expected to...

389
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:58,570
Even now, why have you suddenly appeared in my life again.

390
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:05,230
I already don't want anything else to affect my current life.

391
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,160
Don't drink it then, whatever.

392
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,580
It's actually good.

393
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,830
Forget it, he isn't lucky enough to enjoy it.

394
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,090
Who says that?

395
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,400
Let me try it.

396
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,820
- You've improved a lot.
- Really?

397
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,080
Then drink it all.

398
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,930
All right

399
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,370
I was just kidding.

400
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:13,710
It's such a big pot. How can you finish it all?

401
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,880
I really can't finish this pot.

402
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,330
But I can have one more bowl.

403
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,330
Grandpa and the kids are asleep, right?

404
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,990
Yeah, they're all asleep.

405
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,740
It's quite quiet. Right now it's just you and me.

406
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,280
- What are you doing?
- There's a mosquito.

407
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,830
- Mosquito? Where?
- Oh my!

408
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,240
Here, too.

409
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,000
There's one here too!

410
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,160
And here. And here, too.

411
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,080
Who pinches the face to kill mosquitos? Did you do that on purpose?

412
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,530
No, no, no. There really was a mosquito. Look!

413
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,880
There's one over there. That way.

414
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,390
Song Haoyu! How can you be so childish?

415
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:10,920
♫ It's like a seed waiting for it to grow ♫

416
