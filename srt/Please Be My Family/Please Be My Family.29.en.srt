[Please Be My Family]

21
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,410
Grandpa.

22
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:54,120
If you know something, can you tell me?

23
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,180
This day still came.

24
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,880
Grandpa, you heard this audio recording before?

25
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,190
Yes.

26
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,650
That audio recording is indeed only the first part.

27
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,620
W-What exactly is the truth?

28
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,950
I beg you. Tell me.

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,320
But if the reality is more cruel than this,

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,370
can you accept it?

31
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,900
Haoyu, go.

32
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,740
Go to my bedroom and bring the box with a lock from the bottom of the wardrobe.

33
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,790
A record of the chats.

34
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,480
- What delicious food are you eating?
- Prune.

35
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,210
Feed me one. Is it very sour?

36
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,290
- It's very sweet.
- Is it as sweet as Tian Tian?

37
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,570
Of course not.

38
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,650
- Then I want the sweetest one.
- I think I'm pregnant.

39
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,270
I'm going to be a father? Let's get married.

40
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,520
I'll be responsible for you and the baby.

41
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,710
- When should we discuss the marriage?
- Let's wait.

42
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,980
Turns out...

43
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,480
I'll go and find you right now.

44
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,700
Song Haochen

45
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,870
really wanted to get married.

46
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,340
I'll definitely be responsible for you and the baby.

47
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,560
We'll definitely be very happy.

48
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,410
Can you give me more money?

49
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,150
This way, there's more security for me and the baby.

50
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,630
She wanted money?

51
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,720
Yes. You see it too.

52
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,280
Grandpa, what does this mean?

53
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,550
When that woman called me the first time

54
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,140
and told me that she was pregnant with Haochen's child,

55
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,130
she asked me to give her a sum of money.

56
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,880
But I didn't agree. When she called again,

57
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,950
I was careful and recorded it.

58
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,020
If you still don't give me the money, I'll make sure the Song family never sees the child.

59
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,390
This is extortion.

60
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,490
So what if it is? Either way, I really need the money.

61
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:13,000
If you're not willing to give it me, you'll definitely regret it.

62
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,900
Why did Sister do this kind of thing?

63
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,990
A short while after that,

64
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,260
I received a call from the police overseas.

65
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,610
They said something bad happened to Haochen.

66
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,250
There's still one more audio recording.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,310
It's the part you heard that was restored.

68
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,690
If you want to hear it,

69
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,620
go somewhere else. I don't want to hear it again.

70
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,200
Grandpa, why didn't you tell me about this?

71
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,910
When Haochen died,

72
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,430
if you knew about it,

73
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,080
would you have gone to the Qi family to seek justice?

74
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,950
Would you have?

75
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,030
- I would have.
- Haochen died.

76
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,100
But the Qi family also lost a daughter.

77
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,710
We were all heartbroken.

78
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,120
If you went, what could you do to redeem the situation?

79
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,100
I'll destroy you.

80
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,980
Qi Sitian, I'm going to destroy you! I hate you!

81
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,270
Do I care?

82
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,200

83
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,390
All along, you only had him in your heart!

84
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,050
Were you only with me because of money?

85
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,410
Since you know, why can't you agree to it?

86
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,930
Sitian, how did you become like this?

87
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,870
Song Haochen, watch ahead! Watch ahead!

- Mommy.

Mommy, are you hungry?

97
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,370
Mommy, I can give all my delicious food to you.

100
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,430
- I'm fine.
- That's good.

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,560
Let's not stay here. Let the two of them chat.

102
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,020

- Then, Mommy, we're going to kindergarten first.
- Let's go.

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,030
I'll help you.

106
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,880
It's such a big thing and you didn't know?

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,170
Take care of yourself. Call me if you need anything.

00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,130
- Go back first.
- Bye-bye, Grandpa.

112
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,360
- We're leaving.
- We're leaving.

113
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,270
They're two steps ahead of us already.

114
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,620
Should we speed up the pace too?

115
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,010
Look, the new house is already settled. It just needs the stamp of approval.

116
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,810

117
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,710
But I'm not in a hurry at all.

No. Did I?

00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,720
Don't say nonsense in front of the kids, okay?

123
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,650
You don't care about me even more now.

124
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,280
Why must I care about you?

125
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,540
I put you in my heart, okay?

00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,240
Later after we send them to the kindergarten,

127
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,020
you go and take leave. There's no need to choose another day. We'll go get our marriage certificate.

128
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,700
Let me consider it.

129
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,760
You're not allowed to consider.

130
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,430
You know the sequence of events in this matter, right?

131
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,140
Grandpa.

132
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,230
I'm sorry.

133
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,060
My sister, she...

134
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,250
Haoyu, sit.

135
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,960
Let me tell you,

136
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,580
no matter if Haochen and your sister were right or wrong,

137
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,620
you and Haoyu shouldn't bear the responsibility for everything.

138
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:05,410
It's all because I was anxious to learn about the truth before.

139
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,230
I made it difficult for you, Grandpa.

140
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,750
I really...

141
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,220
It's okay.

142
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,310
The most important thing for you right now is to take care of your health.

143
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,830
Don't be unhappy. Otherwise, the baby will also be stubborn when it's born.

144
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,120
I know.

145
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,920
Family is like a skeleton.

146
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,990
When you lose an important family member,

147
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,170
it's like losing a bone. It's really painful.

148
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,210
But other bones still need to grow normally.

149
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,350
It won't stop because of the loss.

150
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,470
The ones who are alive now and those who will come

151

I'll love the baby no matter if it's a boy or a girl.

He'll love it either way. Both boys and girls are good.

Now that you know the truth, you probably can't stay with the Song family anymore.

176
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,730
Why not take the kids with you and leave the Song family?

00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,230
I'll take on full responsibility.

178
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,360
I won't leave.

179
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,820
What are you saying?

180
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,140
Don't disturb my life anymore.

181
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,070
Qi Sile, you...

182
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,720
Qi Sile, you're forcing me to do this.

183
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,290
Director, what's the matter?

184
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,400
There were so many people when classes ended. He grabbed the two children and got into the car.

185
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,030
The security guard chased after him. We also called the police right away. I'm sorry.

186
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,620
- I'm sorry.
- Did he pick up?
- No.

187
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,350
The watch, the watch.

188
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,670
Why are the kids' watches turned off?

189
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,540
We don't allow wearing watches in kindergarten.

190
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,950
So we ask the kids to turn them off during class.

191
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,450
Sile!

192
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,430
Where are the kids? Have they been found yet?

193
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:49,120
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have gone to get the marriage certificate today.

194
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,280
What do we do?

195
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,760
I'll contact some people to search for them.

196
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,710
Don't panic. Stay calm.

197
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,890
Hello, Sile.

198
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,290
Qin Tian, where have you taken my kids?

199
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,990
Speak!

200
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,310
Don't be so agitated. I just want to be with them.

201
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:34,880
At the same time, also take them to see their real mother.

202
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,210
What do you want to do?

203
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,690
I won't allow it!

204
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,450
Qin Tian!

205
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700
- Sile.
- He hung up.

206
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,440
- What did he say?
- He said...

207
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,860
He said he's taking our kids

208
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,310
to see their real mother.

209
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,280
What does that mean? What does that mean?

210
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,510
Don't panic yet. We'll find a way.

211
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,140
We can go to those places that Qin Tian often frequented to take a look.

212
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,400
Wow, this leap frog toy

213
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,770
is just as fun to play as the Transformer.

214
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:16,090
And this one, a small windmill. La La La.

215
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,470
Xuan Xuan, are you happy?

216
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,810
Where is Mommy?

217
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,950
Mommy...

218
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,490
Mommy is right here.

219
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,680
No, she isn't.

220
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,490
Xuan Xuan, come here.

221
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,230
Let me hug you.

222
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,150
Come on.

223
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,900
This place didn't look like this a long time ago.

224
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,380
This was your mom's and my home.

225
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,980
Look here. There used to be

226
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,120
a table here. Your mom and I used to draw here.

227
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,380
And there. There used to be a small wood plank there.

228
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,790
Your mom and I used it as a sofa.

229
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,790
They're not at the rooftop at the office.

230
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,700
Where could they have gone?

231
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,290
The orphanage! The orphanage! It's possible that he took the kids to the orphanage.

232
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,580
- Let's go to the orphanage to take a look.
- Okay.

233
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,290
Uncle, what are you saying?

234
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,150
I don't understand, either.

235
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,850
Every night,

236
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,960
I was always here.

237
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,860
Your mom would always come.

238
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,130
Look. These drawings I did when I was little are so ugly.

239
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,430
You were really talented at drawing when you were little.

240
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,640
Don't throw it away. I want to take it overseas.

241
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,440
All right.

242
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,030
I'm sure our new home will be very pretty.

243
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,890
Right?

244
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,340
Yes, because I'll always be there.

245
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,470
Xuan Xuan, you look a lot like your mom.

246
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,260
Chen Chen turned on his watch. Right here.

247
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,180
Good, this kid is smart.

248
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,960
Give it to me.

249
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,440
I want to call Daddy.

250
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,390
I've played enough, so I want to go home. Give it back to me!

251
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,480
Chen Chen isn't obedient.

252
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,620
Xuan Xuan, are you looking for something, too?

253
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,540
I'll help you.

254
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,700
Uncle, you can't do this. That's mine.

255
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,290
Uncle is bad!

256
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,370
Brother, what do we do? What do we do?

257
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:21,230
We've run into a bad guy.

258
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,070
Xuan Xuan, it's fine.

259
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:30,060
Uncle is only borrowing our watches to play for a while.

260
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,420
We can keep playing with the toys.

261
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,380
Don't panic. They'll be fine.

262
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,050
Chen Chen, take your bag. We're leaving.

263
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:08,170
We aren't leaving. We still want to play with the toys.

264
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,660
We must stay here to wait for Mommy and Daddy.

265
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,800
Brother, we should go home.

266
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,430
Uncle also wants to go home to find Mommy.

267
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,620
Mommy?

268
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,850
That's right. Uncle, your mommy can't find you.

269
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,950
She'll also be worried.

270
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,920
There is no mommy!

271
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,270
Everyone has a mommy.

272
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,870
I-I...

273
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,870
was abandoned by his mommy. She didn't want me.

274
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,390
No, maybe she only accidentally lost you.

275
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,450
And is very worried right now.

276
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,460
- Chen Chen!
- Xuan Xuan!

277
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,660
Chen Chen! Chen Chen!

278
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,550
It's here, the watch.

279
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,680
What do we do? What do we do?

280
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,930
Where could they have gone?

281

Qin Tian... Qin Tian!

283
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,750
Haoyu, don't panic.

284
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,420
Look at the map. This place isn't far from the orphanage.

285
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,430
Maybe they went to the orphanage?

286
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,900
Let's go, let's go see.

287
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,570
Okay.

[Angel's House Orphanage]

289
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,020
- Let's go.
- Brother, I'm scared.

290
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,990
I'm not going.

291
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,930
This is where she used to live.

292
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,320
I brought you here to take a look. Okay?

293
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,410
Mommy is here?

294
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:23,350
You're lying. You want to sell us, don't you?

295
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,590
Brother, I'm scared.

296
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,260
I only brought you here to take a look. Let's go.

297
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,300
Uncle, I want Mommy!

298
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,200
Uncle, I want Mommy!

299
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,910
I want Mommy!

300
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,690
- Hello.
- We've checked the roadways' surveillance videos

301
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,670
and can generally confirm that they were heading to Pingsheng Road

302
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,500
where the Angel's House Orphanage's old location is. We'll be there soon.

303
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,290
Okay, good. Thank you.

304
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:53,010
We understand how you feel. But if you arrive at the site earlier than we do,

305
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,390
I recommend that you don't act rashly.

306
00:21:55,390 --> 00:22:01,050
There's one more thing. If you want to capture Qin Tian,

307
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:05,090
can you not do it in front of the children? I'm afraid they will...

308
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,460
We understand your concern, but we probably need your cooperation.

309
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,580
Okay.

310
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,410
Thank you.

311
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,460
This is where I met your mom.

She was 10 years old at the time.

313
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:28,830
She was wearing a pretty dress, and she looked really beautiful when she smiled.

316
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,500

317
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,640

00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,860
I'm back.

321
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,040
And Chen Chen and Xuan Xuan are here as well.

322
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,500
Who's Sitian?

323
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,990
Sitian is your mom.

Come on, come over here.

325
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,950
Come here.

326
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,360
Uncle, I'm hungry, I'm cold,

327
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,770
I want to go home, and I don't want to play anymore.

328
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,040
This place is too scary.

329
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,170
I want to go home, too.

330
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,580
No, you can't leave.

331
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,970
It hurts! Uncle, it hurts!

332
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,690
I want to find Daddy! I want to find Mommy!

333
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,050
Don't you dare mention them to me!

334
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:33,610
I'm telling you, Qi Sile and Song Haoyu aren't even your parents!

335
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,090
You're lying. Uncle, you're lying!

336
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,690
I'm telling you, Qi Sitian is your real mom! Understand?

337
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:54,230
Sorry, Xuan Xuan. I didn't do it on purpose. Okay?

338
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,460
Don't cry. Don't cry.

339
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,850
You don't love me. You don't love. Uncle is bad!

340
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,180
That's not love.

341
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,620

00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,050
- Daddy, Mommy, save us!
- Daddy, Mommy, save us!

353
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,030
Xuan Xuan, Chen Chen, don't be afraid.

354
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,850
Uncle Qin Tian is playing a game with you right now.

355
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,160
That's right, that's right. Uncle Qin Tian is playing a game.

356
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,540
Qin Tian, it's enough. The kids should go home to eat dinner now.

357
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,670
Chen Chen, Xuan Xuan, to test you, Daddy, Mommy

358
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:14,420
and Uncle Qin Tian set up this special game.

359
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:18,870
I'm sorry. I know the game was a bit long.

360
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:22,100
But you're so amazing. You managed to make it through.

361
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,880
We're so proud of you. You really are amazing.

362
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,930
I just knew Uncle wasn't a bad guy.

363
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:33,370
Brother, we're awesome.

364
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:37,750
Uncle, you really scared us just now.

365
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,680
Thank you for playing the game with me.

366
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,820
Why are you bullying him?

367
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,500
Hurry, come here.

368
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,990
Xuan Xuan!

369
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,420
Let's go.

370
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,420
Wait a moment. I want to talk to him for a bit.

371
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,480
What else is there to talk about?

372
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,220
Don't let the kids hear. Wait for me for a moment.

373
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,890
- I'm fine.
- Be careful, then.

374
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,350
Okay.

375
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,460
Qin Tian, you wouldn't even spare the children.

376
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,050
Do you have any humanity left in you?

377
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:36,400
Chen Chen, wasn't it a great day? It's fine now.

378
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:41,090
I wanted to let them know their own mother.

379
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,800
Is that wrong?

380
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,310
A miserable childhood may need a whole lifetime to heal.

381
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,850
You should understand this better than anyone else. Why would you still do it?

382
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,870
If you let the children know that their biological parents are already dead,

383
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,400
do you want to ruin their childhood?

384
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,550
The cruelty in knowing the truth early

385
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,600
is still better than being kept in the dark for the rest of your life.

386
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,530
People will wake up sooner or later.

387
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:07,420
Is it bad to let them know about their true background sooner?

388
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:13,120
I'm warning you. Do not touch my family again.

389
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,490
Family? Qi Sile,

390
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:19,300
Sitian was so good to you. She only came home because of you!

391
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,250
How dare you say such words! Do you still have a conscience?

392
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,720
Sister was good to me.

393
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,430
I have...

394
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,840
I've never denied it.

395
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,510
But...

396
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,290
Song Haochen didn't do anything wrong.

397
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,320
How dare you say that.

398
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,390
He was innocent.

399
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:45,310
All along, you only had him in your heart! Were you only with me because of money?

400
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:49,490
Since you know, why can't you agree to it?

401
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,100
How did you become like this?

402
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,240
Song Haochen, watch ahead! Watch ahead!

403
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,150
Sitian, Sitian!

404
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:02,950
Don't ever bother me or my family again. We don't owe you anything.

405
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,130
Impossible.

406
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:09,690
Xuan Xuan, Chen Chen, let's go home.

407
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,000
Isn't Uncle going home?

408
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,100
He'll also be going home.

409
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,620
Impossible.

410
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,050
Impossible. How could this be?

411
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,870
How could this be?

412
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,290
Sitian wouldn't have been like this.

413
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,630
Sitian, I'm back.

414
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,450
How did this happen?

415
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,820
Sitian, where are you?

416
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:52,400
I brought Xuan Xuan and Chen Chen here.

417
00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:00,740
Why aren't you here?

418
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:08,830
Look. We'll be one family from now on. Here, let me put it on.

419
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,780
I am your wife.

420
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,530
I'm Qin Tian's wife.

421
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,850
Sitian... Sitian...

422
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,320
Why aren't you here?

423
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,440
[Please Be My Family]

424
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:32,750
♫ I thought I missed the rainbow ♫

425
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:39,640
♫ It turns out, it's been transferred to your eyes ♫

426
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:46,010
♫ The commotion stirs my memory like tidal waves ♫

427
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:54,850
♫ Not surprising the light only meet in the dark ♫

428
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,700
♫ From this moment ♫

429
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,160
♫ I want to sing softly about us ♫

430
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,720
♫ Going to fill my world with wonderful dreams ♫

431
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,500
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

432
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,750
♫ The sun rises and sets in all four seasons ♫

433
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:23,120
♫ It can't be compared to a minute of our embrace ♫

434
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,950
♫ From this moment ♫

435
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,240
♫ I want to embrace all the possibilities ♫

436
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,900
♫ An ode to time ♫

437
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:38,600
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

438
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,840
♫ Forever safeguarded ♫

439
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,910
♫ Forever protected ♫

440
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:51,320
♫ The moment we fell in love ♫

441
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,110
♫ From this moment ♫

442
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:59,290
♫ I'm running toward you ♫

443
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,510
♫ Gone through the maze of time ♫

444
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:06,620
♫ You are still in my heart ♫

445
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,050
♫ We have too many encounters ♫

446
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,200
♫ And has always been in a hurry ♫

447
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:22,020
♫ I once forgotten the love we had ♫

448
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:27,750
♫ The moment you made my heart flutter ♫
