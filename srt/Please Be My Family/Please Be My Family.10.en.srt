We never made Sile go to any matchmaking dates.

89
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,860
I'm also really happy that Sile got married!

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,470
I'm so envious of her...

00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,630

the happiest moment in her life!

93
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:28,270

00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,160
You're brave. Can you... get down first?

You really are drunk.

00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,930
Last time, when you put your shoes in front of my door,

103
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:09,650
I knew right away that was the real you.

104
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,250
You look frivolous,

105
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,500
but, deep inside, you're always discreetly thinking of others.

106
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,410
You really hope to be loved.

- Stand up straight!
- Standing straight.

113
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,780
Go back to your room and rest.

114
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,930
Why did you come to my room in the middle of the night?

115
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,510
Why are you sleeping by yourself?

116
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,710
Watching the wedding today made me eyes teary.

117
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,960
Haoyu, I haven't seen you treat a relationship so seriously in a long time.

118
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,810
I already told you before.

119
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,390
You should forget about the past and take a good look at the person in front of you.

120
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,190
It's already too late.

121
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,530
Do you still remember what you told me at the restaurant?

122
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,290
Not too long ago I confessed to her.

123
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,900
We agreed that we wouldn't interfere in each other's lives.

124
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,190
We won't ask about each other's past or talk about the future.

125
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,720
So today she was only cooperating with an act.

126
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:16,920
What? You two are already husband and wife. Why can't you two just live a good life together?

127
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,710
It's no use.

128
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,810
There's no love between us. Everything's fake.

129
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,670
Do you know why I didn't read that oath today?

130
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,590
Because I couldn't make myself read it.

131
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,290
That's why I told her father

132
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,450
that I would treat Sile well.

133
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,590
Because... that's all I can promise.

134
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,200
I can't give her anything else.

135
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,060
But I know that I'll definitely treat her well.

136
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:05,710
Maybe I took the wrong step from the very beginning.

137
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,890
Say goodbye to Grandma and Grandpa.

00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,090

- Then we'll head back first.

165
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,630
When we got home earlier, Grandpa was still there,

166
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,850
but you took Xuan Xuan to her room right away.

167
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,600
Didn't you say that we have to act well in front of others?

168
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,490
I'm not feeling well, so I don't want to act.

169
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,590
- Where are you feeling unwell?
- Does it have anything to do with you?

170
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,400
I'm fulfilling my duty as a husband and caring about my wife.

171
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,450
Caring about me?

172
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,600
Why? Because you promised my parents?

173
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,740
So you feel pressure to treat me well against your own will?

174
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,590
I hope that you're doing this because you are Song Haoyu

175
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,680
and you genuinely want to treat me well. Are you able to do that?

176

00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,690
Can you tell me why you don't want to go?

348
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:22,190
Because... Because...

349
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,910
It's fine. Xuan Xuan's mom, let her get prepared.

350
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,700
We'll go outside first to sign the surgery agreement.

351
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,220
Sile, you go first. I'll stay with Xuan Xuan.

352
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,590
Okay.

353
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,490
Come, Xuan Xuan.

354
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,440
Here you go.

355
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,710
There's only one next of kin?

356
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:48,680
Well... The child's father is busy at work.

357
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,570
It's fine to have only one person sign, right?

358
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,980
We recommend that both parents be present to sign before the surgery.

359
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,240
But, it's fine. It's understandable when there are special circumstances.

360
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,020
Then, it's fine, I'll sign on my own.

361
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,490
According to the hospital's regulations, I want to explain to you

362
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,800
the risks of brain tumor surgery and the details involved.

363
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,630
Oh, okay.

364
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,370
Compared to other surgeries, brain tumor surgery carries a higher level of risk.

365
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,160
First is the risk of anesthesia.

366
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,890
Qi Zixuan's surgery will be performed under general anesthesia.

367
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:22,000
There may be conditions when breathing and heartbeat will stop.

368
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,240
Y-You mean,

369
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,730
breathing and h-heartbeat will stop?

370
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,160
I must tell you ahead of time, but the probability isn't high.

371
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,130
Okay...

372
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,130
Okay. The following are the risks during the surgery.

373
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,050
During the surgery, there could be hemorrhaging in the brain,

374
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,690
it can damage important nerves and causes hemiplegia,

375
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,690
visual impairment, hearing impairment,

376
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,010
or risk of intracranial infection.

377
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,490
According to the preoperative positioning, the approach will be selected

378
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,880
to cut the scalp and open the skull.

379
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,420
Once the tumor is found, we will isolate the peripheral nerve.

380
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,170
How are things? What's happening at headquarters?

381
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,510
Those who are here to discuss business are mostly the top executives of the malls.

382
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:05,050
... piecemeal resection. After the surgery, there'll be postoperative hemostasis...

[Surgical Consent Form]

384
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,500
It looks like they know how to show respect.

385
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,220
Oh right, President Qin. Do you still remember mentioning Maolin?

386
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,950
I sent them an invitation according to your request.

387
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,530
Unfortunately, Maolin didn't send a representative over.

388
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,370
Qi Sile.

389
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,520
Qi Sile!

390
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,650
- Song Haoyu.
- What's wrong?

391
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,360
Song Haoyu. I...

392
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,580
Let me do it.

393
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:46,000
Doctor, I'm Qi Zixuan's father. I'll sign it.

394
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,970
Sure.
