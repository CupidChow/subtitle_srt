[Please Be My Family]

21
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,710
At first, I thought I had prepared enough.

22
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,660
I didn't expect... your father's reaction to as strong.

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,500
Xiao Song, you were divorced before.

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,030
Since you were divorced,

25
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,740
what qualification do you have to marry my daughter?

26
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,860
- My daughter, she simply—
- I don't mind.

27
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,240
Do you need to hold on to someone else's past and not let go?

28
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,750
Even If you don't mind, I do. I'm doing this for your own good.

29
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,180
If I don't ask clearly about his past relationship,

30
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,350
what will you do, if the mother comes back?

31
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,600
Did you think about that?

32
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,880
But good thing he still agreed in the end.

33
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,130
He agreed because of our Chen Chen, isn't that right?

34
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,200
Not possible! My mommy is already back.

35
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,160
This is my mommy.

36
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,760
I only have one mommy.

37
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,090
Father, I don't want to keep talking about this in front of the child.

38
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,940
You're my mommy's mother?

39
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,910
So you're my mommy's father?

40
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,330
Hello Grandpa! Hello Grandma!

41
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,190
I'm Song Xingchen who is both smart and eager to learn.

42
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,970
Why are you so good?

43
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,190
Why are you so polite?

44
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,380
That's because my daddy taught me well.

45
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,640
I'm very good. You don't have to worry, and

46
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,370
leave mommy to my daddy.

47
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,280
Okay. Auntie Du!

48
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,980
- Come take Chen Chen upstairs for his afternoon nap.
- Yes.

49
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,620
I can't believe how strong your immediate reaction was.

50
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,830
All you've been thinking about is how to ask me to stay.

51
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,070
I almost believed it.

52
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,980
Uncle. Auntie.

53
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,060
Actually, in Chen Chen's heart

54
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,500
he has always thought of Sile as his biological mother.

55
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,290
That's because he's still young. Wait until he grows up...

56
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,940
Mom.

57
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,170
No matter what happens in the future,

58
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,960
I only want to be Chen Chen's mother right now.

59
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,780
Auntie, I understand your concerns.

60
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,370
But I guarantee, I won't let something like that happen.

61
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,250
I'll take responsibility as her husband

62
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,800
and take good care of Sile. Please trust me.

63
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,980
I have one more thing.

64
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,680
Even mom isn't saying anything. Why do you have so many things to say?

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,230
Do the wedding by yourself then.

66
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,750
You see.

67
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,330
In-laws, since everyone is here today.

68
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,150
Let's set the date then.

69
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,070
If the two of you have opinions, you can bring them up and we'll talk about it.

70
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,310
Okay?

71
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,110
Grandfather-in-law.

72
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,180
According to customs in our hometown,

73
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,160
let's do an engagement party first.

74
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,240
An engagement party?

75
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,570
Sounds good! No problem!

76
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,350
Here! Let's toast!

77
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,860
Cheers.

78
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,130
I still feel like your father isn't sure about me.

79
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,020
My father's already agreed. Don't think too much.

80
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,060
Even pretending I have to act perfectly.

81
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,600
My father's personality is very stubborn. You figure it out yourself then.

82
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,910
[I've already given her to you.]
[Episode 9]

83
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,530
I didn't want to ask you earlier because other people were around.

84
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,140
Now no one else is here.

85
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,730
Tell me the truth? Are you pregnant?

86
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,600
Huh?

87
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,660
Li Lei said, you went on a blind date for Li Xin, and you met him there.

88
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,110
You're in such a hurry to get married now, of course, I know the reason.

89
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,210
Mom, I'm not. At the time Haoyu...

90
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,160
maybe got jealous and said that on purpose about me.

91
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,370
- I really am not.
- Don't lie to me.

92
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,400
I'm really not lying to you.

93
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,370
I won't replace someone else on a blind date anymore.

94
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,570
Oh, my God. What is that?

95
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,920
You see, the children did that.

96
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,210
Okay. I believe you.

97
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,160
I know now. You sincerely want to marry him, and not for other reasons.

98
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,890
Then I can rest assured.

99
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,990
Besides, you two already get your marriage certificates.

100
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,410
Is it still useful for me to hit you or yell at you?

101
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,230
Really!

102
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,660
Keep going.

103
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,770
Three cups for a son-in-law and one cup for a father-in-law.

104
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,570
That's our Qi family custom.

105
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,430
- Okay... okay... okay.
- Drink.

106
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,160
What?

107
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,810
Are you waiting for me to pure the wine?

108
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,330
Sorry, Uncle.

109
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,410
Xiao Song.

110
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,490
How's my daughter's personality?

111
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,260
Sile...

112
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,650
Sile is very gentle.

113
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,240
Gentle?

114
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,040
This child's personality is like mine... very stubborn.

115
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,170
Here, drink! Let's drink more!

116
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,660
I'm sorry, Mom.

117
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,170
I didn't do this right.

118
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,980
I should have discussed this with you in advance.

119
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,060
There's one more thing you don't know about.

120
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,950
Xuan Xuan will have her surgery next month.

121
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,940
- Really?
- Yes.

122
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,450
Grandpa gave up his position on the waitlist for this surgery.

123
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,150
They're truly sincere toward Xuan Xuan.

124
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,040
Then, we have to thank grandpa well.

125
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,080
You met a worthy family.

126
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,850
That's right.

127
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,520
Actually, you taking it upon yourself with this marriage,

128
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,890
I was so angry at the beginning.

129
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,180
But after I thought about it, it's not necessarily a bad thing.

130
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,180
You suffered a lot for Xuan Xuan all these years.

131
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,720
Your father and I didn't help you much either.

132
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,210
At times,

133
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,050
I truly wish you could be more like your sister.

134
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,500
Allow yourself to be more selfish.

135
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,420
Just be able to decide on your own for once.

136
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,430
Mom, don't be like this.

137
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,870
Let's stop talking. Let's not talk about it anymore. Okay?

138
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,790
So what do you think my daughter's greatest weakness is?

139
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,320
Weakness?

140
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,270
Uncle, this... I don't dare say.

141
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,030
What is there you can't say? Go ahead.

142
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,060
Sile... has a lot of weaknesses.

143
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,880
She isn't tall, has a bad temper, and is opinionated.

144
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,900
For Xuan Xuan, she always feels invincible.

145
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,580
Actually, it's all from forcing herself. Every day she's always

146
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,810
busy... has no time for herself.

147
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,230
Here. Let's drink this way.

148
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,230
Two for me and two for you.

149
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,480
I'll drink with you. Okay. Here.

150
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,850
Thank you, Uncle.

151
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,080
Cheers!

152
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,510
Sile... maybe it's because Xiao Song's parents died early,

153
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,400
I can tell, he's a deep thinker.

154
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,970
This kind of person likes to hide things within himself.

155
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,370
Let me tell you.

156
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,480
Before marriage, keep your eyes open.

157
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,820
After marriage, you have to learn to close an eye.

158
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,680
You need to take care of each other when you're together.

159
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,180
How can you even ask me to close an eye?

160
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,250
You're starting to push me away now?

161
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,980
I'm not.

162
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,110
I just want to tell you marriage isn't easy.

163
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,410
Don't learn to be like your father, so stubborn.

164
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,700
He obviously cares about you,

165
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,820
but once he opens his mouth, everything he says is the opposite.

166
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,960
All these years, I tried hard to look at his best qualities.

167
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,660
That's why we made it this far together.

168
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,750
Aren't we talking about Haoyu? Why are you talking about him?

169
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,670
He really is something, talking about those things in front of the child.

170
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,700
It's called, "caring makes chaos."

171
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,510
After your father found out about your marriage, he was so upset.

172
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,450
He said, all these years, no matter what you did, it was all for Xuan Xuan.

173
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:25,070
You suddenly made this decision. His heart kept feeling uneasy.

174
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,870
Sile.

175
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,240
You and your father are equally firm, right?

176
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,960
[Franzi Weissbier]

177
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,690
You finally came.

178
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,450
Why is it you?

179
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,830
Why can't it be me?

180
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,300
What are y-you doing here?

181
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,520
Let me help you remember.

182
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,110
You asked me to return the shoes and we were supposed to meet here, right?

183
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:45,270
Right. You should just take the shoes and leave. Why are you here playing the piano?

184
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,920
I saw you shared this song on your friend circle.

185
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,600
I thought that you must like it.

186
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,230
So I found a teacher to practice every day.

187
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,790
I'm a little bit talented.

188
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,570
You don't need to figure out my preferences.

189
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,820
Not to mention trying to please me.

190
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,960
Are you always going to not like me no matter what I do?

191
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,500
Yes! That's who I am!

192
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,610
If you don't have any feelings for me, why did you ask me to meet you here, then?!

193
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,390
Buddy, I have a friend who works here. It has nothing to do with you.

194
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,820
Take your shoes and leave right away.

195
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,430
And delete that video and those photos from your phone. I don't want to see you again.

196
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,410
Because if I see you, I'll feel super awkward.

197
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,840
Did you eat something wrong?

198
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,930
I only thought you had a bad temper and were somewhat stubborn, and that's why I was easy on you.

199
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,790
But you must have some issues!

200
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,650
You're the one who has issues!

201
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,420
Okay, delete the video, right?

202
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,200
I deleted it.

203
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,030
From now on, let's never meet again.

204
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,720
Fine then! Let's never meet again!

205
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,010
I'm a dog if I see you again!

206
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,970
Your alcohol tolerance isn't good.

207
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,820
You can't even move after drinking a bottle and a half.

208
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,670
Uncle, I...

209
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,230
What are you doing?

210
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,700
He doesn't know how to drink. Why are you making him drink so much?

211
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,770
A person's drinking tolerance defines their character.

212
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,440
I was testing him for you.

213
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,350
Xiao Song!

214
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,870
Back then, when I was leaving with Xuan Xuan didn't you say,

215
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,540
you wouldn't interfere in my matters anymore? Why are you interfering today?

216
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,770
Haoyu, how are you feeling?

217
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,600
Are you able to walk?

218
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,720
Don't let me catch you drinking again.

219
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,000
Haoyu. Let me help you back.

220
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,190
Come on.

221
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,750
Here...

222
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,910
Are you all right?

223
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,250
Should I get you some water?

224
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,300
I'm sorry.

225
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,200
I finally said it.

226
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,980
Why are you apologizing?

227
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,060
Because of a lot of things.

228
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,040
♫ As the breeze descends into the city ♫

229
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,410
There were a lot of times

230
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,230
that I wanted to apologize to you.

231
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:03,020
Grandpa, Chen Chen, and every single person at the company

232
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,310
I need to take good care of them all.

233
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,650
I'm so tired.

234
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,860
There are a lot of words in my heart that I can't tell you.

235
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,700
Thank you.

236
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,710
♫ You unconsciously occupying my heart ♫

237
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,680
You finally appeared.

♫ My heart constantly seeks ♫

239
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,220
Qi Sile.

240
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,910
Ever since you moved in,

241
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:38,030
my life seems to have changed.

242
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,820
Now it feels full in here.

243
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,650
♫  It turns out, you're already the four seasons I can't avoid ♫

244
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,150
Can we continue like this?

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:54,480
♫ Love you, I can't stop loving you ♫

♫ Let me tell you about all the sweet things in my dreams ♫

♫ Loving you, remembering all the good and bad days ♫

248

♫ How I hope I can become the air you breath one day ♫

249
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,470
Song Haoyu.

250
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,290
Even if it's only this moment,

251
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:24,880
I hope that what you said today is true.

252
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,580
- Who is it?
- It's Sile's eldest aunt.

253
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,360
My niece's husband, open the door.

254
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,700
What aunt?

255
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,910
He seems nice.

256
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,880
Eldest Aunt is...

257
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,090
I'm the eldest aunt!

258
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,820
Hello!

259
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,760
You all are... early this morning. This is...

260
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,230
Wake up early and live a good day!

261
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,330
Look at that, look.

262
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,980
This slim body carrying the sacks, shaking like a calf.

263
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,470
Old Qi's son-in-law

264
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,950
- really isn't that great.
- That's right, he isn't.

265
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,600
Not great?

266
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,070
He needs to pump more iron.

267
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,580
Didn't you say we would grow old and die without having had any dealings with each other?

268
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,480
Do you think I want this?

269
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,780
Who said that they were a dog if they saw me again?

270
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,420
Why does Song Haoyu only have one friend?

271
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,240
Don't push me and make him have no friends.

272
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,640
Doesn't Sister-in-law only have one best friend too?

273
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,570
There's no novelty at all.

274
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,180
Don't talk to me!

275
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,340
[Double Happiness]

276
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,450
Xiao Song!

277
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,120
- Mom.
- Where were you?

278
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,060
Sile's eldest aunt...

279
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,400
Don't worry about them.

280
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,350
- We're running out of time. Hurry and get changed.
- Oh, okay.

281
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,890
Uncle!

282
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,090
Xuan Xuan.

283
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,470
Uncle, do you think I look pretty?

284
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,110
Xuan Xuan, you look very pretty today.

285
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,900
Uncle, are you happy?

286
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,550
I'm happy.

287
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:07,440
As long as Xuan Xuan is here, I will always be happy.

288
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,660
Shouldn't you be happy because you're marrying mommy?

289
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,620
Right. Xuan Xuan is right.

290
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:19,140
Uncle, mommy is really good.

291
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,490
I really love mommy.

292
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:26,310
But I agreed to give mommy to you.

293
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:34,640
So I really need you to treat mommy really, really well.

294
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,540
Of course. I promise you

295
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,060
that I will definitely, definitely treat Mommy well.

296
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,180
Uncle, you're so handsome!

297
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,630
Good girl.

298
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,960
Haoyu.

299
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,460
Dad, what's the matter?

300
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,630
Can you come here for a bit? I need your help with something.

301
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,870
Okay. Xuan Xuan, go play.

302
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,140
- Have some tea, Haoyu.
- Thanks, Dad.

303
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,180
It’s nothing much. I just wanted to chat with you.

304
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,490
Actually…

305
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,520
I know, your family is wealthy.

306
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,730
But Sile was also painstakingly raised by me and her mother.

307
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,690
That’s why…

308
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,520
Dad, Sile is amazing.

309
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,700
You and mom have raised her very well.

310
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,460
So you can rest assured.

311
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,530
Haoyu,

312
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,260
you two are about to be married.

313
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,670
As Sile’s father, I have a lot to say to her.

314
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,540
However,

315
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,580
I’m not good at speaking, so I put it into a letter.

316
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,050
Once you finished the banquet,

317
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,500
please give it to Sile.

318
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,130
It’s almost time. You should finish up.

319
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,600
Okay, I'll head out first then.

320
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,600
[We are getting married!]

321
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,420
Come in!

322
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,750
Sile.

323
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,840
Grandpa has a good eye, this gown looks very good on you.

324
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,050
- The makeup is done. I’ll head out first.
- Thanks.

325
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,660
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

326
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,910
What took you so long?

327
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,500
The Banquet MC wanted to go through the rundown with you earlier.

328
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,960
Dad was looking for me.

329
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,160
What did he say to you?

330
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,510
Nothing.

331
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:04,330
He just wanted to chat with me, don’t overthink it.

332
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,580
Fine, I got it. You don’t need to comfort me.

333
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,640
How could it be just a regular chat?

334
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,270
I'm sure he was just telling you why he's not happy with me.

335
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:15,260
Sile, this is from your dad…

336
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,360
A letter?

337
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,160
He was always like this since I was young.

338
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,980
Wrote me letters to criticize me and then would ask me to write him back with self-reflections.

339
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,710
Qi Sile.

340
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,610
It's only because you care about each other, that’s why you fight. Do you understand?

341
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,710
What went on between me and him isn't easy to explain.

342
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,510
My dear daughter.

343
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,280
When you were born,

344
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,260
I would look at you,

345
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,670
thinking, how long would it take,

346
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:56,910
for such a small body to be fully grown?

347
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,320
I believe a lot of fathers are just like me,

348
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,280
shamelessly imagining

349
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,410
whether you’ll become a scientist when you grow up

350
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,840
or an astronaut.

351
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,820
But later on, I didn’t want to you to grow up.

352
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,680
I would think about how one day

353
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,710
you'd become a lady and get married,

354
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,780
you would no longer grab my thumb and ask me

355
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,550
this or that or ride on my shoulders out and about.

356
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:28,330
Just thinking of that,

357
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,260
makes my heart feel empty.

358
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,140
When you were five years old,

359
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:39,550
I got injured in the forest at work and was bedridden for several years.

360
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:44,200
Your mother became the only source of income for the family.

361
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,070
Sile, that’s why

362
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,950
you became a sensible child at a young age.

363
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:54,490
I know, as a father, I owe you a lot.

364
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,040
That’s why when you said you wanted to fulfill your dream, I was fully supportive.

365
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,420
I know my daughter is very talented,

366
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,860
and works hard,

367
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,190
you can definitely establish a wonderful life.

368
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,730
Unfortunately, due to a family incident,

369
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,970
you decided to give up your dream.

370
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,990
No matter what I did to stop you,

371
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:25,240
even threatening to disown you,

372
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,630
- it couldn't change your mind about the child,
- If you leave this house,

373
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,240
- and your determination to give up your dream.
 - never come back then!

374
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,590
Fine! I’ll never come home then!

375
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,150
You decided to protect your own daughter,

376
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:40,870
but forgot... you’re also my daughter.

377
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:43,510
My heart also breaks.

378
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,680
That’s why, Sile,

379
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,700
you need to fulfill your own dreams.

380
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,850
Don’t abandon your talent and hard work.

381
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,450
You don't owe anyone anything,

382
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,020
but only yourself.

383
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,220
Daughter from the Qi Family, show your gratitude to your parents.

384
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,910
Lastly, I want to say a few words to you.

385
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,340
Mom.

386
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,000
I can only be here as you grow up,

387
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,860
but I can’t walk you to the end of your life.

388
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,740
- Dad.
 - We will have to be separated one day.

389
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,810
Your health isn't great, have high blood pressure,

390
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,540
we should change this to tea.

391
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:32,110
I hope the person who's next to you at that moment

392
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,950
will love you like I do.

393
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,420
Dad.

394
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,690
I’m really, very sorry.
