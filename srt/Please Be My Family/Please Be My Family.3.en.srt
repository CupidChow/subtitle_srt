00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,290
Not appropriate.

00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,100
The contract is good enough, it can be signed.

354
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,090
Trying to avoid the topic.

355
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,710
What you said has nothing to do with work.

356
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,340
Fine, you want to talk about work-related things,

357
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,770
you can pay in advance.

358
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,540
Okay.

359
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,130
You...

360
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,980
Haoyu. My father said he hasn't seen you for a long time.

361
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,880
How about we have dinner together?

362
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,500
Wait a moment.

363
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,950
Please say sorry to uncle for me on my behalf.

364
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,470
I have something important to do tonight. I'm sorry.

365
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,680
Hello. Yes.

366
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,520
It's been ordered already? No need, I'll pick it up myself.

367
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,000
Hello, check someone for me.

368
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:51,480
Thank you, Secretary He. Please rest assured, I'll fix it as soon as possible.

369
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,310
It's a must. If you have any questions in the future, you can contact me anytime.

370
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,680
Thank you for the trouble.

371
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,050
Sorry, I just wanted to ask.

372
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,210
Is President Song busy every day?

373
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,880
Yes. President Song has a lot of matters to take care of every day.

374
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,700
Oh, got it.

375
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,950
The project is too small, no need to show up personally, is that right?

376
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,260
Qi Sile!

377
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,150
It's almost time for school to let out. Let's pick up the kids together.

378
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,520
With you?

379
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,370
It's not me that wants to see you, it's Chen Chen. Come on, get in.

380
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,030
Qi Sile.

381
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:40,130
Why don't we have dinner together?

382
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,310
- I'm sorry.
- Chen Chen wants you to stay a bit longer. Right, Chen Chen?

383
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:47,010
Xuan Xuan, let's go play in the car. I have yummy food in the car.

384
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,320

391
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,010

means you carelessly shuttle through my dreams.

393
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,940

I need to read more.

396
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,810
What's wrong? You don't like them?

397
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,220
I do like them, but I...

398
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,600
- Did you catch a cold?
- I'm not.

399
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,590
I'm... allergic...

401
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,380
Allergic?

402
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,290
I'm sorry, I didn't consider it carefully.

403
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,750
I'm sorry you wasted your money.

404
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,510
Wow, you have a rash too.

405
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:10,360
I'm fine. I'm fine. I just need to take allergy medicine.

406
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,330

- Does it hurt a lot?
- I'm fine.

410
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,200
You didn't even know your girlfriend was allergic to flowers?

411
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,050
- He's not my—
- I was careless.

412
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,340
Are you still itchy?

413
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,350
Let me take a look.

414
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,260
Don't scratch.

415
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,060
You need to take care of this.

416
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,980
Get on the bed. I'll apply some medication for you. Hurry.

417
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,560
Okay.

418
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,430
Patient's family,

419
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,480
this medicine needs to be applied twice a day.

420
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,530
She can't take a hot shower and also can't eat oily food.

421

I'll keep it in mind. Thank you, Doctor.

422

Xiao Wu, Director Sun asked you to go over for an urgent matter.

423
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,890
Coming.

424
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,870
Patient's family, help her apply the medicine.

425
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,900
Excuse me. Can you pass me the medicine, please?

426

Uncle He. It's been too long.

430
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,210
What are mommy and daddy doing inside?

431
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,010
Mommy?

432
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,370
That was quick.

433
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,210
The doctor is examining your mommy.

434
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,550

I can't reach my back.

437
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,990
How about... I-I help you apply?

438
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,330
No... no need.

439
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,540
I'll be fine after I endure it.

440
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,810
That's okay. I can put it on for you behind the curtain.

441
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,770
Since you feel uncomfortable, give it to me.

442
