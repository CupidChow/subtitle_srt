[Please Be My Family]

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,700
President Song, Xichen said the reality show must be continued today.

22
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,940
Okay. I'll handle matters at the office first and go to the filming site a little late.

23
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,210
President Song, you're back. You're so busy.

24
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,810
This is the report from the last season.

25
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,200
Shouldn't you give me an explanation?

26
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,040
The sales look good. President Song, does something not look right?

27
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,280
KL's growth is pretty good, but I don't think what you did

28
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,730
brings Maolin Mall anything positive.

29
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,610
I recall when you hired me, your attitude was very trusting.

30
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,100
So all you need to know are the results.

31
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,710
You don't need to worry about which methods or means I use,

32
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,480
because this is my working style.

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,430
This doesn't mean you can go out of line.

34
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,160
When you come to Molin, you should follow Molin's rules.

35
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,020
Got it, Director Qin?

36
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,110
President Song, you're taking this too seriously.

37
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,930
I only wanted KL to quickly gain returns and gains at Maolin.

38
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,570
This will also help other big brands want to emulate them and come here.

39
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,960
If this situation continues for long,

40
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,910
if KL ever withdraws, it'll take away 70 percent of the core clientele.

41
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,560
Do you really not see that?

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,580
On this, it was indeed an oversight.

43
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,460
President Song, you have foresight. I've noted this down and will continue to made adjustments.

44
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,040
I'll be going then.

[Wishing You a Bright Future]
[Episode 23]

46
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,370
- Bring in the clothes.
- Help me bring that lens.
- Okay.

47
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,410
I asked the director to clear the scene.

48
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,570
So there's no one else here.

49
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,470
Haoyu,

50
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,640
when I agreed to marry you back then,

51
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,550
I really did think about giving up playing billiards.

52
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:03,290
For the rest of my life, it would've been enough to take care of you, Chen Chen, and Grandpa.

53
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,350
Let the past stay in the past, okay?

54
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,480
I'm telling you the truth.

55
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,490
I know Qi Sile is in your heart.

56
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,720
But I don't believe she's the only one in your heart.

57
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,090
- Hello, Director.
- Hello.

58
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,950
Has the filming not started yet?

59
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,180
Miss Jin wanted to clear the scene for a while.

60
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,640
She wanted to talk to President Song alone.

61
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,390
I'll go up by myself. You two can wait for me here.

62
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,540
- Okay.
- Go on.

63
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,180
Back then, this is where you proposed to me.

64
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,820
Now that we're sitting here again, don't you feel anything?

65
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,070
Jin Xichen, this crosses the line.

66
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,770
Qi Sile isn't here.

67
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,350
I just want you to tell me from your heart.

68
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,200
You really don't care anymore?

69
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,280
It's not that I don't care.

70
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,440
On the eve of the wedding, you suddenly decided to go overseas for training.

71
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,820
Do you know how much you hurt me?

72
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,630
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,750
In the beginning, I indeed missed you, while I also hated you.

74
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,300
But gradually I felt numb.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,310
From then on, I never had any expectations for love.

76
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,370
Until Sile appeared.

77
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,700
I finally felt that my heart could still beat.

78
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,330
I'm grateful that you were with me while I was at a low point in my life.

79
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,790
I will also remember the past.

80
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,440
But it's only remembering.

81
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,440
We can't go back.

82
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,320
Make peace with yourself.

83
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,970
I don't want this championship anymore.

84
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,780
Isn't it okay if I give up the championship?

85
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,640
Haven't you always tolerated my willfulness?

86
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,230
Why can't you do that now?

87
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,590
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,980
I know...

89
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,380
it's going to be tough for you.

90
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,540
But you can only rely on yourself.

91
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,060
I truly and sincerely hope that you'll get over it soon.

92
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,320
Sile.

93
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,920
Have you memorized all the good wishes that's actually cotton with needles hidden inside?

94
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,440
The rose-leaf bramble's symbolism is really something.
(TN: spring's last bloom)

95
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,290
I might have to disappoint you.

96
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,860
- Huh?
- Huh?

97
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,200
I modified this brooch's design before I submitted the design.

98
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,950
I had some reservations.

99
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,320
But after hearing Haoyu and Miss Jin's conversation just now,

100
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,410
I'm sure that my modification was the right thing to do.

101
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,730
Right now, inside the box is the weigela flower.

102
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:40,110
I am grateful for the production team to have invited me onto this reality show.

103
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,430
It helped me remember many good memories from the past. The show is concluding today.

104
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,640
Thank you everyone for being here.

105
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,880
Just a moment. My wife is here. Come, Sile.

106
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,390
Allow me to introduce to everyone. This is my wife, Qi Sile.

107
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,880
She brought a surprise for everyone today.

108
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:02,390
Miss Jin, this is the mystery gift you ordered at Fanyi Jewelry.

109
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,970
It's so beautiful.

110
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,430
- What flower is it?
- A weigela flower,

111
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,140
because the blooms look bright like ribbons,

112
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,090
it symbolizes a bright future.

113
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,160
It's also Fanyi Jewelry's sincere blessing for Miss Jin.

114
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,030
On behalf of Fanyi Jewelry, I wish Miss Jin will succeed again.

115
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,110
- Thank you.
- I hope you'll like it.

116
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,560
I like it very much.

117
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,250
Okay, got it.

118
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,960
Sile. I have some good news.

119
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,470
What is it?

120
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:13,780
Our reality show has really increased traffic to the mall.

121
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,220
That's wonderful!

122
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,310
Also,

123
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,240
Jin Xichen just called to say

124
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,630
that she's decided to get treatment overseas to prepare for the next snooker tournament.

125
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,350
I'm really happy for her. She'll finally face her illness.

126
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,130
Why don't we invite her to a farewell dinner at home?

127
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,060
We'll do as you say.

128
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,200
Chong Ya, drink water and eat veggies.

129
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,430
Chong Ya, drink water and eat veggies!

130
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,540
- Brother!
- Grow tall and big!

131
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,500
Grow big and you can swim. Hurry.

132
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,880
Hurry and eat, Ya Ya.

133
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,900
- Chen Chen.
- Hurry and eat.

134
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,060
- Hello.
- Hello, Auntie.

135
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,660
Mommy said there'll be a guest to our house today. Is that you?

136
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,600
Yes, that's me. Who are you?

137
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,400
- I'm Qi Zixuan.
- She's my younger sister.

138
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,730
Younger sister?

139
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,170
Auntie, I think I've seen you on TV before.

140
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,700
You're a big star, aren't you?

141
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,350
What big star? I'm just an old friend of your daddy and mommy's.

142
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,750
Your younger sister is really cute.

143
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,670
Of course.

144
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,150
Auntie, let's go, I'll show you in.

145
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,540
Chen Chen, come on.

146
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,070
Mommy, look, who's here.

147
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,830
You're here.

148
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,610
Chen Chen, take your sister upstairs to call your father downstairs.

149
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,120
Go on.

150
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,360
Please have a seat.

151
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,860
I brought some gifts.

152
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,570
Thank you.

153
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,750
Haoyu has changed his style.

154
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,290
I thought the house looked a little bit too cold,

155
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:20,850
so I bought some brightly colored cushions.

156
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,280
It's indeed more lively than before.

157
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,370
Here, have some water.

158
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,970
Thank you.

159
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,840
Sile...

160
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,960
I want to apologize to you.

161
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,980
In the past, I wasn't thinking clearly.

162
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,040
I was too stubborn.

163
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,450
You're here.

164
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,940
Sile.

165
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,990
Are you frying fish?

166
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,790
My fish is still in the pot!

167
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,300
I'll go.

168
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,150
Miss Jin, please sit down. Take care of her.

169
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,840
- Can you handle it?
- I can handle it!

170
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,070
She said she had to fry some fish for you.

171
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,760
Haoyu! Haoyu!

172
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,930
I heard Auntie Du says Sile would be cooking by herself. Can she do it? Is there any risk?

173
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,430
She said she could, how could I stop her?

174
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,730
Don't be silly and go watch over her. If she can't do it, you can at least cover for her.

175
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,250
All right.

176
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,730
- Grandpa.
- Go quickly. Xiao Chen, you're here. Hurry and have a seat.

177
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,940
How is it?

178
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,780
Haoyu, come quickly and look at it! Why is the fish black?

179
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,030
You should turn off the stove.

180
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,260
It's scorched. You have to turn the fish over when frying it.

181
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,290
Oh no. Why is it popping up?

182
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,550
Did you get burned? Step back, let me do it.

183
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,270
- What's wrong?
- Haoyu, I overcooked the fish.

184
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,060
Can you teach me?

185
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,710
It's too complicated. Let's go out for dinner.

186
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,050
Does Haoyu cook often?

187
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,660
Not really, he's just assisting Sile.

188
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,870
Don't worry, if Haoyu is there, there won't be any problem.

189
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,320
It might mean dinner will start a little bit late.

190
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,130
- Have some water, Xiao Chen.
- Okay.

191
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,620
Let's wait a little bit longer, all right?

192
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,170
Come, come, let's all have a toast!

193
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,000
Wish Xiao Chen a smooth future!

194

Let's eat, come on.

Amazing, there are so many dishes.

198
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,230
Eat more.

199
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,620
Xuan Xuan, have some vegetables.

200
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,380
Xuan Xuan, you're so cute!

201
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,430
Auntie, are you also fighting a monster?

202
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,650
- What?
- Grandpa said you weren't feeling good.

203
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,710
You mean if I'm sick?

204
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,480
Xuan Xuan also fought them! Daddy, Mommy,

205
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,910
my brother and great-grandpa also fought them with me!

206
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:12,340
Then I won the fight! We can all fight them together with you!

207
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,360
Auntie, you can also win.

208
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,890
Right. I can also win.

210
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,290
I caught you!

211
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,160
Come on, let's go play with the swing. Let's go.

212
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,610
This family has become a lot more boisterous.

213
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,230
I can see that Haoyu really pampers Xuan Xuan.

214
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,990
This must be loving all people related to the one he loves.

215
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,650
Sile.

216
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,200
When I first met you by ourselves,

217
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,100
I indeed had selfish thoughts.

218
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,910
But there was one thing that I meant sincerely.

219
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,800
Which was?

220
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,730
I really envy you.

221
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:14,570
It wasn't until today that I understood why Haoyu loves you.

222
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,770
It's because all the repressed darkness on him has disappeared.

223
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,760
I've never seen that kind of light in his eyes before.

224
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,650
I only accompanied him to walk out of that darkness,

225
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:31,960

Yes. Xichen's flight is tomorrow morning.

247

She plans to recuperate overseas.

248

Qi Sile, you're already calling her Xichen?

250
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,500
You've reached this result so quickly.

Something is missing from the middle of the story. Tell us more.

252

Let's talk another day. I'm feeling sleepy after being busy all day.

253
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,260
When you two are together, don't drink so much. I'm going to bed.

254
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,440
Fine. Fine. Go to sleep. We'll talk about it next time.

255

Good night.

256
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,660
Sile's style, too grand.

257
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,290
But, believe me.

258
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,850
That style is useless for you.

259

What do I do now? I really didn't expect this.

261
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,620
I think, you should call him first, get him to come see you.

262
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,010
And then, once you've met, we'll see what you should do next.

263
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,170
Okay.

264

But what if he doesn't agree to see me?

265
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:33,060
My self-esteem is very fragile right now.

266
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,030
Why did I bring such a woman like you into my home to guide you for many days?

How can you still not have any guts!

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,870
Hao Jun...

348
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,280
You're here?

349
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,040
You want to trick me? I'm can't give up and fail.

350
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Hao Jun...

351
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,820
do you really not want me anymore?

352
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,820
You really don't want me anymore?

353
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,140
Why did you drink so much?

354
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,460
Because I miss you.

355
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,340
Since she's okay, I'm leaving. Just let her sleep here.

356
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,530
Uh... no way.

357
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,910
No way.

358
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,280
Take me home, Tong Luoqi!

359
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,850
- You'd better take her home.
- Take me home.

360
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,760
I sleep particularly soundly at night.

361
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,140
I won't wake up. If something happens

362
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,220
to her at that time. I'm not taking responsibility.

363
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,910
Best friend, time to get up from bed.

364
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,130
What's more, I have a meeting first thing tomorrow morning.

365
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,080
Otherwise, I'd let her sleep here. But I'm sorry about tonight.

366
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,080
- You watch over her. And you two can go home and rest early.
- No, wait, President Tong...

367
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,260
Good night. Good night. Good night.

368
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,140
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

369
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,760
Bye-bye.

370
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,850
I, Tong Luoqi,

371
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,460
am really full of hidden talents.

372
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,120
I don't feel good... my tummy.

373
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,960
I want to go home.

374
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,560
This acting is too fake. She knows I'm softhearted.

375
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,600
Go home...

376
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,050
Where's Hao Jun?

377
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,990
-I can't go inside.
- Hao Jun...

378
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,400
Don't fail at the last moment.

379
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,000
That's enough. Even your rouge is about to rub off.

380
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,520
Stop acting.

381
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,620
When did you realize it?

382
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,970
You're so smart.

383
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,030
This isn't important.

384
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,030
Go home early and rest.

385
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,960
Don't do this again.

386
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,030
Hao Jun, well done. I'm leaving.

387
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,100
Look.

388
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,130
A thief has marked my home.

389
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,730
Maybe it's some... pervert.

390
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,820
Or a robber.

391
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:39,300
I'm a weak little girl who can't even catch a chicken.

392
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,040
What do I do?

393
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,030
Can't you stay with me for a while?

394
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,590
Even the marking is drawn upside down.

395
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,920
Can't you stay with me for a little while?

396
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,590
You're so strong, but you say you're too weak to catch a chicken?!

397
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,810
[Please Be My Family]

398
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:19,130
♫ I thought I missed the rainbow ♫

399
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:26,050
♫ It turns out, it's been transferred to your eyes ♫

400
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:32,390
♫ The commotion stirs my memory like tidal waves ♫

401
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:41,210
♫ Not surprising the light only meet in the dark ♫

402
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:44,010
♫ From this moment ♫

403
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,580
♫ I want to sing softly about us ♫

404
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,990
♫ Going to fill my world with wonderful dreams ♫

405
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:55,730
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

406
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:03,080
♫ The sun rises and sets in all four seasons ♫

407
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:09,480
♫ It can't be compared to a minute of our embrace ♫

408
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,290
♫ From this moment ♫

409
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,520
♫ I want to embrace all the possibilities ♫

410
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,200
♫ An ode to time ♫

411
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,910
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

412
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,180
♫ Forever safeguarded ♫

413
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,370
♫ Forever protected ♫

414
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:37,690
♫ The moment we fell in love ♫

415
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,550
♫ From this moment ♫

416
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:45,640
♫ I'm running toward you ♫

417
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,910
♫ Gone through the maze of time ♫

418
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:52,350
♫ You are still in my heart ♫

419
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,460
♫ We have too many encounters ♫

420
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,500
♫ And has always been in a hurry ♫

421
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:08,520
♫ I once forgotten the love we had ♫

422
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:13,720
♫ The moment you made my heart flutter ♫
