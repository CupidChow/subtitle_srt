00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,620
next to the 3rd Secondary School, there was a really large man-made lake?

118
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,630
Back then, as soon as school ended...

119
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,850
I'm meeting a friend later on, so please excuse me.

- What a coincidence.

123
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,550

129
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,950
Senior Brother, we'll have to stay in touch frequently then.

130
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,980

131

132
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,480
My family is really urging me now.

133
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,640
It's not that bad. But I won't change my perspective toward my love life because of my parents.

134
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,590
I think I should find someone who is responsible and patient

135
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,120
and a man who will face problems together.

136
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,230
Besides, when it comes to love, it still depends on fate.

137
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,370
Then I need to work towards this.

138
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,170

142
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,920
It's one thing to have an argument. But you should still go pick up the children, right?

143
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,510

174
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,500
It tastes… quite unique.

175
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,740
Try this one.

176
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,820
What is this?

177
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,810
This is my favorite dish.

178
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,630
I often make it at home.

179
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,080
Qi Sile,

180
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,410
you said you want to find a man who is responsible, patience,

181
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,300
and can face problems with you.

182
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,540
I can do all of that.

183
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,270
You managed to eavesdrop and hear so many details.

184
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,680
Qi Sile,

185
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,310
I can promise you.

186
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,930
Once we get married, I can raise Xuan Xuan like she's my own,

187
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,750
but you have to let me get to know you two better.

188
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,230
For example, where was Xuan Xuan born?

189
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,520
We're not spouses. Why should I tell you all this?

190
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,410
Besides, I've never asked you why Chen Chen doesn't have a mother.

191
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,360
Chen Chen has always been with me, so you don't have to worry—

192
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,720
President Song, it’s rare for you to come to this kind of place.

193
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,980

I like to eat stinky snails.

197
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,330
It’s like how sea creatures and river creatures cannot be kept in the same tank.

198
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,860
It’s like we don’t belong to the same world.

199
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,550
There's no need to force ourselves to be together.

00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,740
The advertising company that President Tong referred has been waiting for almost 2 hours already.

Oh, okay. I'll be back soon.

Come back to the office with me. We can talk about the proposal.

Okay! Wait...

222
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,500

Got it, President Tong.

227
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,500
President Song, the guest has been waiting for a while in the meeting room already.

228
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,650
How about you go there first? I'll take care of this.

229
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,180

That's right. This is President Song’s decision.

Okay, bring it up. We'll iron out the details in person.

You don't look too good.

Naïve.

246
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,440
President Tong, what do you mean? I don't understand.

247
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,380
Haoyu didn't tell you?

Molin Group will never work with just one company.

249

It's very common for big companies to compare different proposals.

00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,660
I can accept the loss due to a lack in my ability.

251
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,220
But he's already agreed to work with the advertising company I recommended from the very beginning.

252
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,720
You couldn't tell that he never intended to work with you?

253
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,350
Right now isn't a good time to talk. Another day.

254
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,490
President Song isn't here today. He told me to verify with you if a revision is needed for the proposal.

255
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,070
How about... you look over that proposal again?

256
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,610
All right, I'll take a look at it again.

257
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,960
This is definitely a misunderstanding. I'll go get an explanation from him.

isn't as cute as that little braid that day.

348
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,140
It's really a pity...

349
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,800
that I can't murder you to shut you up.

350
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,210
What?

351
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,530
Hey, I'm not done talking.

352
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,860
Who are you? I don't know you. Go away!

I just happen to have something to tell you.

361
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,590
I recently met a girl. She's really interesting.

362
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,380
- Guess who she is?
- I'm not interested.

you couldn't control that girl from last time.

00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,690
I said you were too frivolous!

Hello, President Ho. Hello, President Ma.

379
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,390
Take a seat. Sit.

380
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,700
President Xu, the proposal that I just mentioned

00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,220

382
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,050
There's no rush. No rush.

383
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,900
Have a drink first.

384
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,300
President Xu, I... I don't drink much.

385
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,200
How can you discuss business

386
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,410
without having a couple of drinks? Isn't that right?

387
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,540
Xiao Qi.

388
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,740
When you show so little sincerity, what can I do for you?

389
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,610
I'm really sorry, President Xu. I-I...

390
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,500
I have a low tolerance for alcohol.

391
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,580
That's for later. You show your sincerity first.

392
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,830
Xiao Qi, you're not a rookie

393
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,670
in the advertising field anymore.

394
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,850
You should understand...

395
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,680
this simple rule, right?

396
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,430
Okay, I'll drink up.

397
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,570
Good tolerance. Here, another cup.

398
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,520
Miss, are you okay?

399
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,190
There's call for you.

400
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,540
Hello.

401
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,320
The cell phone's owner drank too much. She's throwing up a lot.

402
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,730
She can't talk on the phone right now.

403
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:03,850
- Here?
- Kunshan Grand Hotel? Thanks.

404
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,640
Hey. I'll go with you!

405
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,290
No need.

406
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,610
Here, I'll pour it full for you again.

407
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,690
President Xu, I-I really can't drink anymore.

408
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,660
Drink some water. Here.

409
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,670
Thank you.

410
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,890
What are you doing?

411
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,960
Don't be so tense, Xiao Qi.

412
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,710
- Xiao Qi!
- Let go of me.

413
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,370
Is this your attitude for discussing things? Do you still want this project?!

414
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,770
President Xu, calm down.

415
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,640
What kind of talk do you want to have?

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,610

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,050
