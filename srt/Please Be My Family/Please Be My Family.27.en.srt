[Please Be My Family]

21
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,390
I knew there was something wrong when you came back this time.

22
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,110
You...

23
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,590
A young couple having conflicts

24
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,030
need to calm down first and talk it out.

25
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,660
Look at you.

26
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,300
Came back to your family's home to hide. Where's your ability to handle this?

27
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,250
Even the kids are stronger than you.

28
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:02,840
The kids even know that when there are problems, they need to be resolved and faced. What about you?

29
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,310
Our Sile's temper...

30
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,660
I know well.

31
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,700
You should comfort her more.

32
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,920
Dad.

33
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,120
But this matter...

34
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,360
is a bit complicated.

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,260
How complicated can it be?

36
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,310
What exactly is going on between you and Haoyu?

37
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,340
Actually this time...

38
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,360
it's my fault.

39
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,900
Overall, it's quite serious.

40
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,750
Don't tell me you made the mistake that every man easily makes?

41
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,280
Dad, what are you thinking?

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,270
Your father and the people of the neighborhood committee

43
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,270
went out to search all day. He's so tired that his blood pressure rose again.

44
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,970
Then it's not a big matter.

45
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,690
It's nothing more than a couple quarreling and one saying more and the other saying less.

46
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,910
Take it slowly.

47
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,800
Talk it out with Sile later.

48
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,850
Talk it out with Haoyu later.

[Families Will Hug Like This?]
[Episode 27]

50
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,410
Sile.

51
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,770
Let's talk.

52
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,300
Actually, in the past,

53
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,610
I didn't understand myself.

54
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,850
Before I married you,

55
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,710
Chen Chen and Grandpa were my entire world.

56
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,780
When I knew that my brother had another child,

57
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,660
I only wanted to bring Xuan Xuan home.

58
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,450
I knew my way of thinking was selfish.

59
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,110
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,940
Sile, are you listening?

61
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,020
You...

62
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,220
Do you understand your brother's matter?

63
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,120
My brother and I have different personalities.

64
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,220
My family thought he was very rebellious.

65
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,330
But actually, he treated me really well.

66
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,080
My brother didn't have a good relationship with the family ever since he went abroad.

67
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,430
We weren't in contact with him up until the time he died.

68
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,640
You weren't in contact?

69
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,380
Then Grandpa didn't know about him and my sister?

70
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,390
He likely didn't know.

71
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,580
- That's not right.
- What's wrong?

72
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,380
Didn't Grandpa strongly oppose him being with my sister?

73
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,980
What are you talking about?

74
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,900
Song Enmao,

75
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,880
Song Haoyu's grandfather.

76
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,270
That family threatened her that she'd never see her children again.

77
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,150
They warned Sitian that she had to leave that man.

78
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,190
Who exactly is lying?

79
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,960
Lying?

80
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,110
Who's the other person?

81
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,850
- Qin Tian.
- Qin Tian?

82
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,800
Previously, he was also the one who showed me the lawyer's agreement.

83
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,500
What else did he say to you?

84
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,080
He said grandpa opposed the two of them getting married

85
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,240
and forced my sister to leave him by using the kids to threaten her.

86
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,570
It caused my sister to send Xuan Xuan back to the country.

87
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,250
What nonsense is he saying?

88
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,950
Grandpa would never do this kind of thing.

89
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,920
Who else knows about your sister's matter?

90
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,210
I'm not giving it to you.

91
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,470
Everything was fine. Why did you suddenly mention Sitian again?

92
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,470
Besides, Haoyu is still here.

93
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,590
Why talk about something so sad?

94
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,970
Mom, this matter is very important.

95
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,770
It concerns... the relationship between me and Sile.

96
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,880
What has this got to do with you two?

97
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,140
Our family is unwilling to bring up the things of the past.

98
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,680
Dad, Mom, actually...

99
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,130
Sister gave birth to twins back then.

100
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,450
What?

101
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,970
- That's not possible. Back then—
- Mom.

102
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,350
It's true.

103
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,990
Then what about the other one?

104
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,040
The other one...

105
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,370
The other one is Chen Chen.

106
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,470
Chen Chen?

107
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,040
Xuan Xuan and Chen Chen's biological father

108
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,170
is my brother.

109
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,760
You adopted Chen Chen.

110
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,510
You adopted Xuan Xuan...

111
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,890
It's a mess. A complete mess. Wait.

112
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:14,820
Don't tell me you two suddenly got married due to the kids?

113
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,480
- Dad.
- Dad.

114
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,900
- Dad.
- Old Qi, what's wrong?
- Don't, don't.

115
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,210
Don't call me, "Dad."

116
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,190
Your dad's blood pressure went up again.

117
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,390
Dad, slowly.

118
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,610
Don't panic.

119
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,370
Sorry, Dad.

120
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,620
We did get married then because

121
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,840
we wanted joint custody of the children.

122
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,200
Qi Sile, Qi Sile, you're really something.

123
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,650
Dad, this matter—

124
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,090
I initiated the marriage to Haoyu.

125
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,820
Dad, Mom, you don't worry too much.

126
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,650
Haoyu and I have always had feelings for each other.

127
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,120
Then what do you want to know?

128
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,010
I want to know what exactly happened back then.

129
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,440
Why did Sister suddenly go overseas?

130
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,990
Why didn't she contact the family again after she went overseas?

131
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,600
She wanted to leave the family. She didn't decide it on a whim.

132
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,840
Sitian isn't your biological sister.

133
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,730
Your father and I adopted her.

134
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,980
After your father and I got married,

135
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,010
we didn't have children for a long time.

136
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,820
The doctor in town said it was hard for me to get pregnant.

137
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,640
So we decided to go to the orphanage to adopt one.

138
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,580
We brought back Sitian.

139
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,700
We cherished her and loved her like our biological daughter.

140
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,530
Back then, even though life was tough for us,

141
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,330
we were quite happy.

142
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,440
But the happy thing was

143
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,850
I got pregnant.

144
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:22,010
But after that, I was injured in the forest.

145
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,000
Because of this, the family was in heavy debt.

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,610
We couldn't raise two kids. Your mother and I had no choice,

147
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,490
but to make a decision that we regret the most in our life.

148
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,670
After we sent Sitian back to the orphanage,

149
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,010
Your mother and I regretted it.

150
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,520
When we brought her back, she had completely changed. She was like a complete stranger.

151
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,530
She believed that because we had a biological daughter, we didn't want her.

152
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,330
I'm to blame. I'm to blame.

153
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,450
Turns out that Sister's life was so pitiful.

154
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,240
Then... what happened after?

155
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,440
What's done was done.

156
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,200
Your father and I tried our best to make up for it.

157
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,020
But Sitian became more and more rebellious.

158
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,410
She frequently ran away secretly at night.

159
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,350
I asked her where she was going.

160
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,830
She said she was meeting a friend.

161
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,420
Friend?

162
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,840
Then have you seen this friend before?

163
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,650
No.

164
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,020
But I know it was a guy.

165
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,030
One rainy day, she came back wearing his jacket.

166
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,150
Guy friend?

167
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,880
I used to admire her, but just looked from afar.

168
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,790
Later, after more interactions, we gradually became friends.

169
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,240
Then...

170
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,090
do you know the person who helped my sister bring Xuan Xuan back?

171
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,430
I never met the person before.

172
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,560
He only said he was Sitian's friend.

173
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,780
He was young, in his twenties.

174
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,360
Let me tell you. Everything that I've done

175
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,720
is for Sitian and her two kids.

176
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,980
Mom, take a look.

177
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,090
Is this him?

178
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,850
Look.

179
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,840
- It's him.
- It's him.

180
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,920
It's him. How do you know him?

181
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,090
In the matter of dismissing Song Haoyu,

182
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:30,360
we still need Director Xie to help more as a long-time shareholder.

183
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,560
Don't worry about this. We already have over half of the shareholders.

184
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,940
After that, you'll just need to replace him

185
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,100
and become our sole decision-maker at Molin.

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,360
I'm not interested in this position.

187
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,850
Then what do you want exactly?

188
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,160
Director Xie, you probably shouldn't ask too much.

189
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,420
One gets up early for profit.

190
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,620
No matter how smart you are, you shouldn't treat people like fools.

191
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,260
Go ahead and speak up.

192
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,010
I want to ruin the Song family.

193
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,600
Don't worry. I went to the hospital today.

194
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,320
Senior Song condition is stable. Don't worry.

195
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,420
I've been following the shareholder voting as well.

196
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,200
Hao Jun,

197
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,620
it's been hard on you during this period of time.

198
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,800
No need to be so formal with me.

199
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,440
Haoyu, I'm sure we'll get through this.

200
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,670
Thanks.

201
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,140
Grandpa...

202
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,140
How is he?

203
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,020
He said the situation...

204
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,120
is stabilized for now, so there's no life-threatening risk.

205
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,700
Sile.

206
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,060
All the recent incidents have something to do with Qin Tian.

207
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,980
I don't know why he's targeting us.

208
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,300
Qin Tian?

209
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,950
I still need to send gifts to my friends at the orphanage.

210
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,640
Can I choose a few more?

211
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,110
I just remembered something.

212
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,340
When I first met Qin Tian,

213
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,330
he mentioned the orphanage.

214
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,500
Looking back on it now,

215
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,310
it's possible that he knew my sister from a long time ago.

216
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:28,370
You're saying, your sister already knew Qin Tian when she was at the orphanage.

217
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,010
I'm not certain.

218
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,460
So I must go there.

219
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,090
What's wrong?

220
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,670
Nothing.

221
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,350
Maybe it's because I've been tired recently. Let's go.

222
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,490
This is the place that Older Sister lived when she was little?
[Angel's House Orphanage]

223
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,280
It looks long abandoned.

224
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,030
What are you two doing?

225
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,020
Sir, we're here to find out more about something.

226
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,170
Find out about what?

227
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,960
We had a relative who grew up here...

228
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,480
You can't find anything. This place moved a long time ago.

229
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,780
Even the employees at the new location

230
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,720
have changed over several times already.

231
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,920
Do you know any of the old employees who used to work here?

232
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,260
- Old employee?
- Yes.

233
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,050
Let me think.

234
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,080
I'm sorry for disturbing you so late at night.

235
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,090
If's fine. You've been referred by the next-door neighbor.

236
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,420
If you need anything, just ask.

237
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,230
Thank you.

238
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,330
Ms. Fang, when you worked at the orphanage,

239
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,730
did you know a girl named Qi Sitian?

240
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,570
Qi Sitian?

241
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,070
She was adopted at the age of five.

242
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,670
She was returned at the age of ten.

243
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,330
But later, she was taken back again.

244
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,260
Qi Sitian.

245
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,460
I remember this little girl.

246
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,250
Great. Then, Ms. Fang, do you remember

247
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,600
when my older sister was at the orphanage, did she have a close friend?

248
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,150
A close friend?

249
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,610
Ms. Fang, take a look. Do you recognize him?

250
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,750
His name is Qin Tian.

251
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,350
The name doesn't ring a bell.

252
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,910
But he looks familiar.

253
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,560
How did you get that wound?

254
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,970
I was naughty when I was little. I got scalded.

255
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,310
Oh, right.

256
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,640
On his left arm, there is a burn scar from when he was little.

257
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,690
At this position. About this long.

258
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,240
- Burn wound?
- Yes.

259
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,090
Ms. Fang, it hurts!

260
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,170
Xiao Chi?

261
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,670
Xiao Chi, what are you thinking about?

262
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:07,270
Did you hear what I just said?

263
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,620
Don't hit me. It hurts.

264
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,700
Don't be afraid.

265
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,380
Your stepmother

266
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,480
has already been arrested by the police.

267
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,770
Starting from now on, no one will be able to hurt you.

268
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,270
Don't worry.

269
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,980
But she said she only did that because she loved me.

270
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,950
Isn't that right?

271
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,620
From now on, you'll live here

272
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,900
with the other little kids and me, okay?

273
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,810
Before Xiao Chi came to the orphanage,

274
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:49,560
he was diagnosed with mild paranoid disorder.

275
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,040
We tried often to communicate with him,

276
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,560
but it wasn't effective.

277
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,320
I heard his mother doesn't want him anymore.

278
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,320
He has so many wounds on him, so he must be a bad boy.

279
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,880
I'm not. I'm a good boy!

280
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,060
You're a bad boy.

281
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,190
What are you doing?

282
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,180
Are you all right? I'll dry you up later.

283
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,810
Why are you bullying him?

284
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,020
His mother brought him back, so he must be a bad boy!

285
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,340
And he won't let anyone scold him!

286
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,100
Who do you think you are to scold him?

287
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,600
Do you know how sad he must feel now?

288
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,380
When I think about it now,

289
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,300
after he met Sitian,

290
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,360
he started to focus on studying.

291
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,610
He refused to be adopted, and he never interacted with other kids.

292
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,110
Sitian!

293
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,050
1003.

294
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,350
1004.

295
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,820
1005.

296
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,160
The week when Qi Sitian was sent back to the orphanage,

297
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,720
she always snuck up to the rooftop by herself.

298
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,910
Xiao Chi would always follow her.

299
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,990
Later, your sister was taken back home again.

300
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,400
After Xiao Chi left the orphanage,

301
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,880
he went abroad.

302
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,000
How are the two kids now?

303
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,090
They're doing great.

304
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,440
All the kids at the orphanage had a hard life.

305
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,120
It's good if they can live happily now.

306
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,980
Sister, why do you count every day?

307
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,970
A week has about 600,000 seconds.

308
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,960
Subtract the time to sleep, to work,

309
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,230
and to take care of my younger sister,

310
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:07,010
they still have 500,000 seconds to regret.

311
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,490
Regret what?

312
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,220
Abandoning me.

313
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,910
You... How did that happen?

314
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,650
Mom did it.

315
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,470
Why?

316
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,950
Because Dad didn't come home.

317
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:30,720
Mom said that if I was hurt, dad would come back home to take care of me.

318
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,520
The family would be together again.

319
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,810
That's not love.

320
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,340
Families will hug each other like this.

321
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:50,380
Sister, can you be my family then?

322
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,930
[Angel's House Orphanage]

323
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,010
Just call me Sister Sitian from now on.

324
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,550
What's your name?

325
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,760
My name is...

326
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,160
Chi Laifu.

327
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,580
Your name doesn't sound good.

328
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,790
How about I choose a new name for you?

329
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,590
So, everything that Qin Tian is doing is for revenge.

330
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:31,580
But, even if grandpa really broke up your brother and my sister,

331
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,400
why would Qin Tian do so much to harm your family?

332
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,350
Why not? If something happened to you, I would do the same.

333
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,520
I'll go back tomorrow and ask him directly in person.

334
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,530
Sile.

335
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,850
Do you think Qin Tian got close to you because you're Qi Sitian's younger sister?

336
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,890
Why?

337
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,890
Because...

338
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,560
it's possible that Qin Tian has transferred his linger thoughts for Qi Sitian to you.

339
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,090
What are you thinking? How could that be possible?

340
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,590
Even if he had this kind of idea, it's absolutely not possible for me to think that.

341
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,360
We're still husband and wife after all. I have my principles.

342
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,140
Still are?

343
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,840
Let's talk about our situation later.

344
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,860
Here.

345
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,630
This? Why so much?

346
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,120
You should keep some for yourself.

347
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,440
I'll keep one bill.

348
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,260
How is one bill enough? Take more.

349
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,720
I have enough. You have more expenses going to school.

350
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,460
I'm fine. I just need to eat enough.

351
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,060
But you've lost a lot of weight lately.

352
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,310
Did you pick up another job?

353
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,870
No.

354
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,700
I'm sorry.

355
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,850
It's all because I wanted to study overseas,

356
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,790
that you're working so hard for me.

357
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,040
It's fine.

358
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,760
I really like the new side job that I found.

359
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,450
I can learn a lot of things.

360
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,860
Just keep the money.

361
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,390
You've worked hard.

362
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,680
Thank you.

363
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,380
It's what I should do.

364
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,960
In your class,

365
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,570
are there any guys who like you?

366
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,040
If there is, would you be jealous?

367
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,370
No, as long as you're happy, that's what matters.

368
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:56,790
Silly. Don't worry, I'll always be with you.

369
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,830
I'll never let them off.

370
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,520
I'll always be here.

371
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,630
Sile.

372
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,140
Sile, did you fall asleep yet?

373
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,620
Actually, before I met you,

374
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,390
I thought I would never fall in love again.

375
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,040
But during the time after you left,

376
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,890
my heart... felt that it had been emptied.

377
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,510
It hurts, it really hurts.

378
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,720
Are you hurting too?

379
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,230
You probably feel even worse.

380
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,310
I know...

381
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,500
I'm a bastard for doing everything that I did.

382
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,170
I also know that, regardless of what I say now

383
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,930
or whatever I do,

384
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,660
I can't make up for the harm I inflicted on you.

385
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,360
I'm sorry.

386
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,930
I'm really very, very remorseful.

387
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,520
Before... all that I said about

388
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,970
Chen Chen being unable to live without you,

389
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:29,090
or Chen Chen can't not have a mom, it was all lies.

390
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,750
I'm the one who can't lose you.

391
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,700
I really...

392
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,450
I really can't imagine a world without you.

393
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,380
Let's not get divorced, okay?

394
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:53,540
♫ Let me tell you about all the sweet things in my dreams ♫

395
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:59,480
♫ Loving you, remember all the good and bad days ♫

396
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,670
♫ How I hope I can become the air you breath one day ♫

397
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,920
I'm sorry.

398
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,870
I'm sorry.

399
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,690
Sile. You're back.

400
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,920
Where's President Song?

401
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,450
He went to the hospital first.

402
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,330
- Here. Let me take it.
- I miss my room!

403
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:40,400
I'm also missing my Transformers.

404
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,300
Hello, Luoqi.

405
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,820
Qi Sile, you really are audacious!

406
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,970
Such big trouble, and you still haven't told me yet.

407
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,520
Don't be agitated.

408
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,080
Why wouldn't I be agitated?

409
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,890
Senior Song is sick, Molin is changing the President, and you're getting a divorce!

410
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:20,220
You never planned on telling me, right?

411
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,570
Fine, Qi Sile, you clearly don't treat me as a friend. Goodbye!

412
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,120
It's pointless, even if I told you.

413
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,540
It's been such a long time, and you still don't coax me a little.

414
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,780
What's this about friends and friendship?

415
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,940
It's all lies!

416
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,020
Cell phone number, blocked.

417
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,930
WeChat, blocked.

418
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,320
I'll cancel following your Weibo!

419
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:27,690
Hello, best friend. Did you know? Song Haoyu's family is in big trouble right now!

420
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,230
I know. I'm right here at the hospital.

421
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,600
Senior Song needed constant caretakers. Hao Jun and I are taking turns.

422
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,770
So you already know.

423
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,250
You two didn't tell me?

424
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,770
You two are isolating me?!

425
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,850
Best Friend? Phone number, blocked. WeChat, blocked.

426
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,680
Weibo, cancel following and then blocked!

427
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,210
Who is it?!

428
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,850
Who is it?

429
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,900
Luoqi.

430
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,180
We're no longer in contact. What are you doing here?

431
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,700
When a friend is in trouble, you still won't help?

432
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,800
Who's your friend?

433
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:22,020
Luoqi, I really didn't conceal it from you on purpose.

434
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,130
It was...

435
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,570
because this matter occurred too suddenly and too quickly.

436
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,910
My whole body is about to collapse. So...

437
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,220
I'm sorry.

438
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,330
What's going on exactly between you and Song Haoyu?

439
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,130
You are indeed surpassing the older generation.

440
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:17,440
On the voting, don't worry!

441
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,030
Thank you very much.

442
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,860
Luckily some shareholders are still standing united with Molin.

443
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,260
We now have 40 percent of the shares.

444
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,940
Let's follow up in a little while

445
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,290
so that they won't do tricks behind the scene before the shareholder's meeting tonight.

446
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,930
If I had known you had such strong negotiation skills,

447
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:37,860
even if I had to tie you up, I would have tied you up to work at Molin.

448
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,670
Your praise is making me feel guilty.

449
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:43,650
It's good that you know, Director Hao.

450
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,440
We can finally see a chance at winning this battle.

451
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,200
You should go to the hospital to see grandpa.

452
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,550
Leave the rest of the few shareholders to me. I'll go talk with them.

453
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,480
You worked hard.

454
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,120
What? Song Haoyu married you only for...

455
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,830
How could he do that?!

456
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,830
What do you plan to do now?

457
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:26,240
I told him I wanted to get a divorce.

458
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,460
But so many things are happening right now. It's hard for him, too.

459
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,300
So we'll talk about it later.

460
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:39,980
What's most important right now is grandpa's health and his company.

461
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,510
At this time, you're still thinking about his career.

462
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:47,460
After all, we're still one family. I can't stand by and do nothing.

463
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,460
You aren't a shareholder, so you can't help with the vote.

464
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,300
It's useless for you to just worry.

465
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:59,480
I can't do it. But you can.

466
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,820
So you were acting pitiful to me just now, and now you open up.

467
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,640
You just want me to help Haoyu, right?

468
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,100
It's not that I don't want to help you.

469
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:21,470
It's just that Fanyi's number of shares doesn't qualify us to be on the Board of Directors.

470
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,480
