[Please Be My Family]

21
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,300
President Tong, Miss Qi, this way, please.

22
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,590
Take a seat for a bit, please.

23
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,990
The interview isn't over yet. Please wait a moment.

24
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,790
- Okay.
- Alright.

25
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,050
You achieved such excellent results abroad.

26
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,360
Now that you've returned to the country, you must have received many offers from different programs?

27
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,690
Why did you choose "Long Time No See" then?

28
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,980
It's because this program has a different meaning to me.

29
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,590
She's quite imposing.

30
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:29,330
Isn't two against one a little... unfair?

31
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,350
Then, we can play bad cop, good cop.

32
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,400
You're the good cop, and I'll be the mean one.

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,970
That's not necessary. You can just be yourself and knock them down half a notch.

34
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,140
How can you talk to your boss like this?

35
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,810
Sorry, I'll take back my words.

36
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,980
So, by joining the "Long Time No See" reality show,

37
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,120
you said it's uniquely meaningful to you. What exactly is the special meaning?

38
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,690
Because this show will allow me to invite an old friend who I haven't seen for a long time.

39
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,460
We can chat about our good old times.

40
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,880
I imagine this old friend must be someone you really want to see.

41
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,830
Is it all right for you to reveal a bit more?

42
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,960
He's my senior schoolmate from high school, Song Haoyu.

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,140
So you became Maolin Mall's Image Ambassador,

44
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,420
because of an invitation from President Song?

45
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,690
That's right. Because we were schoolmates in high school and college.

46
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,230
What did I tell you? She really knows to strike first and act superior.

47
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,470
Then we should counter them as they come.

48
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,210
Fighting from a distance isn't interesting at all.

49
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,100
You're not going to let her off easy this time, are you?

50
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,360
I'm really looking forward to seeing it.

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,360
- Excuse me, everyone, the interview is over now.
- Thank you, everyone.

52
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,980
Thank you, Miss Jin.

53
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,730
This way, please.

54
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,460
Sit tight.

55
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,250
So we'll...

56
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,950
Go.

57
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,990
Please take a seat.

58
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,160
President Tong, how have you been?

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,210
It's been three years since I last saw you. You've aged a lot.

60
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:20,240
You must have lived a hard life over the past few years.

61
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,220
Training is indeed hard.

62
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,570
Also, I'm still adjusting to the jet lag.

63
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,850
Miss Jin, please take a look at the contract.

64
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,050
See if there's anything that needs to be adjusted.

65
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,060
She doesn't have time to look at the contract. All she thinks about

66
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,670
is using the media to give your husband a shout-out.

67
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,700
It's been so many years, I had thought your temper would've changed.

68
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,660
Looks like I shouldn't have expected any improvement.

69
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,880
Same here. Same here.

70
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,780
Do you see? What did I say? She's so good at chit-chatting.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,740
Miss Jin, I wouldn't interfere with Haoyu's decision-making.

72
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,700
If he wants to participate in the show, I'll support him.

73
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,240
Is that so?

74
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,090
Of course.

75
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,140
They're a couple. Of course, they'll discuss matters together.

76
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:28,380
Miss Jin, take a good look at the contract. The sooner you sign, the sooner we can start working.

77
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,540
Isn't that right, Mrs. Song?

78
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,070
[Back to the Past]
[Episode 20]

79
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,200
Both the craftsmanship and concept must be present in the brooch design this time.

80
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:50,000
We must let Jin Xichen and our colleagues in this field be completely convinced.

81
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,500
I understand. I have to really think about this.

82
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,350
If you need anything, tell me immediately. I won't shortchange my own people.

83
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,330
As long as you do a good job, I'll make sure everything is prepared well for you.

84
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,170
Thank you.

85
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,610
What's the matter? Don't be so cheesy.

86
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,970
You've done so much for me. I'm really touched.

87
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,620
Thank you.

88
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,030
I didn't do it for you.

89
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,980
I just want you to help me get even.

90
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,710
I'm your boss. You're not respecting me by acting this way.

91
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,260
I just want to give you a hug. Otherwise, you can fire me?

92
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,680
You think I don't dare? Believe it or not, I'll fire you right now.

93
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,690
- Let go of me.
- Nope.

94
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,600
Do you think I'm Song Haoyu and you can seduce me?

95
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,510
I just want to thank you properly.

96
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,620
Qi Sile, you're so annoying.

97
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,890
To tell you the truth, thank you.

98
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,650
I know.

99
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:04,070
What kind of design do you think can best represent Fanyi?

100
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,810
Think about that later.

101
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,190
I think the most important thing is to imply something to her in the concept.

102
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,240
Let her go away as far as she can, and take off with a plane.

103
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,750
I just suddenly thought of a flower.

104
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,690
It's a flower that only blooms at the end of Spring.

105
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,840
The rose-leaf raspberry.

106
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,830
It symbolizes the end of a relationship.

107
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,810
[Long lost best friend, can they be reunited? Can Handsome Entrepreneur and Snooker Queen get back together.]

108
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,370
Heavens, look at this. They're actually together now?

109
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,100
Look at it. They're together now.

110
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,390
- What is it?
- Jin Xichen.

111
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,120
Who's she with? Who's Song Haoyu?

112
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,510
Quick, look at this. Those two are together now.

113
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,250
On my, it's true.

114
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,160
[Has she been waiting for Song Haoyu all these years? I also waited years for someone. Deepest love is always a disappointment.]

115
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,350
[This Song Haoyu has a wife? Is he a scumbag?]
[Our Queen cannot be waiting for this Song Haoyu all these years, right?]

116
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,560
[Don't trust this gossip, our Sister Jin isn't drunk in love.]
[I've been waiting for this show, producer, please hurry up!]

117
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,770
He Qing, I'll tell you again.

118
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,620
Molin Group doesn't need to increase exposure through a show.

119
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,940
Fine then. Let Qin Tian and those shareholders who raised the ideas go themselves.

120
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,580
Prepare a follow-up statement. Let Public Relations release it tomorrow.

121
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,870
Why are you here?

122
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,530
Why not go? I'd like to see your other side.

123
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,010
A reality show isn't a bad choice.

124
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,180
Stop fooling around. I already turned it down.

125
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,920
But...

126
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,210
Didn't you say all the other shareholders want you to participate?

127
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,800
How will you counter them tomorrow?

128
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,170
There's no need to.

129
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:41,120
This matter was never in the company's development plan. They can't force it.

130
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,620
- Haoyu.
- Yes?
- Actually...

131
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,670
I've seen similar programs before.

132
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,580
A lot of company executives

133
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,700
will gain more recognition and likability through this format.

134
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,880
For our Song family's mountain of gold and silver,

135
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,820
it's not a bad idea to go once.

136
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,130
Besides, my hubby is so handsome,

137
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,250
wouldn't it be a shame not to go?

138
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,190
You mean it?

139
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,340
- You won't be jealous?
- I will be.

140
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,180
Then you're crazy.

141
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,110
I'm not crazy.

142
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,710
I just know that there are many things that we have to do, even if we don't like it.

143
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,680
Anyway, no matter what you decide, I'll always support you.

144
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,520
I also heard that this program

145
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,540
has a time-traveling segment.

146
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,780
I really want to see how you looked in high school.

147
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,330
How I looked in high school?

148
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,680
I'm sure you were really cute.

149
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,740
Too bad I missed it.

150
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,410
I was indeed cute.

151
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,220
The Molin Group's current CEO, Song Haoyu,

152
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,420
as supported by his wife,

153
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,880
has decided to join the battle by teaming up with

154
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,090
Women's Snooker Champion, Jin Xichen,

155
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,200
in the reality show, "Long Time No See".

156
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,170
This... was your idea?

157
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,990
I have my own little selfish thoughts.

158
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,550
You can't be so childish as to test your man, are you?

159
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,010
Is this... really childish?

160
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,930
It's not that.

161
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,980
A heart ailment can only be cured by heart medicine.

162
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,730
It's a fact that Haoyu suffered trauma in a relationship.

163
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,650
Not talking about it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

164
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,790
My selfish thought is to use this show

165
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,830
to let him totally get out of it.

166
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,760
Haven't you thought...

167
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,780
what if he doesn't get out of it,

168
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,500
and they relight their flame

169
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,790
on the program? What will you do?

170
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,630
It won't happen.

171
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,690
I wouldn't be so sure.

172
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,740
Hello, Luoqi.

173
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,250
Your husband is filming the show at the library of the Provincial Experimental High School.

174
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,580
I'm here already. You'd better hurry up.

175
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,010
Okay, got it.

176
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,070
Xiao Xue, let's go.

177
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,510
- Sorry.
- Hurry up, Xiao Xue. We're late.

178
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,990
Okay. Coming.

179
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,570
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,460
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,180
When I bumped into you at that time and the books scattered all over the floor,

182
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,130
you looked at me without making any sound.

183
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,360
It scared me into saying sorry repeatedly.

184
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,340
I... don't remember much about it anymore.

185
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,340
Cut. This part is done.

186
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,920
Makeup person, come fix the makeup.

187
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,870
Qi Sile, why aren't you here yet?

188
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,500
This scene, this atmosphere, how can you not be watching it?

189
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,810
Sister, take a seat here.

190
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,980
No need. I'll sit over there.

191
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,210
Brand sponsor. Be patient with her.

192
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,480
- Hello, Director.
- Hello, hello.

193
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,010
You probably have to go around it to go behind him.

194
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,910
Is there anything that you aren't satisfied with?

195
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,660
They're only in high school. How can the girl and boy get so close to each other?

196
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,240
Isn't this misguiding the youths?

197
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,840
Also, Song Haoyu is already married.

198
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,310
If any gossip arises because of this, your filming team will have to bear the responsibility.

199
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,450
Keep some distance between President Song and Miss Jin.

200
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,710
Okay. Sister, please step back a little.

201
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,380
You can place your hand on the back of his chair. Yes.

202
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,140
Hey, that won't work.

203
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,160
They're still too close.

204
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,140
Let the the girl sit across from him.

205
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,650
Okay.

206
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,330
Okay.

207
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,730
You two will gaze at each other.

208
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,400
Cut! Just film Song Haoyu alone.

209
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,090
There's no need for Jin Xichen to stay in the scene, is there?

210
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,610
Cut! Remove this segment.

211
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,410
Cut! Cut! What are you doing over there?

212
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,560
Does the frame look good? Is this a good scene? Do it again!

213
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,900
Come. You direct then.

214
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,260
Director, you go ahead.

215
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,940
Qi Sile, can you hurry up? I've been carrying the load for you. Why aren't you here yet?

216
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,420
I can't carry the load anymore. Hurry up, you!

217
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,210
I'm here, I'm here!

218
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,550
It took me great effort to insert you as the secret guest star.

219
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,610
You don't rush or hurry, and even made me carry the load. Do I owe you?

220
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,770
Thank you, Lady Boss.

221
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,590
As long as you know.

222
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,620
Sorry, Director. My wife is here.

223
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,810
- Sile.
- Haoyu.

224
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,610
The secret guest star arranged by the sponsor has arrived. Get the camera positioned.

225
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,010
Don't be nervous. Just act normal.

226
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,840
Hello, Miss Jin.

227
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,580
Why did you just get here? Senior Brother has been waiting for you.

228
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,720
I've waited you for a long time.

229
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,050
You're wearing a different style today.

230
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,750
Does it look nice?

231
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,330
It does.

232
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,230
Looks like it was the right decision to participate in this show.

233
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,970
How so?

234
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,320
Because I'm very curious about your high-school life.

235
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,190
It's not too late to find out now.

236
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,400
Is the filming going well?

237
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,430
Miss Jin, do you think our filming is going well?

238
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,800
That's a great shot. Keep it up.

239
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,300
Every camera on the husband and wife.

240
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,690
Great. Give us some more.

241
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:49,370
♫  It turns out, you're already the four seasons I can't avoid ♫

242
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:55,640
♫ Love you, I can't stop loving you ♫

243
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,350
♫ Let me tell you about all the sweet things in my dreams ♫

244
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,050
Well done, see you tomorrow.

245
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,560
- Thank you, President Tong, bye-bye.
- Luoqi.

246
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,950
President Tong.

247
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,140
What is it?

248
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,770
I may have to stay with Haoyu till very late today.

249
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,630
So, can I ask you for a favor?

250
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,090
What's the favor?

251
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:20,390
A little favor that will give you a pleasant surprise.

252
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,500
Sit here and wait for a little while.

253
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,530
This bench is dirty.

254
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,470
So fussy.

255
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,510
It's all right now. Sit.

256
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,530
Bad woman, you used me to wipe the bench.

257
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,190
Stinky rascal.

258
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:09,050
If it weren't because no one wanted you, do you think I would have cared to pick you up?

259
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,300
The two of you should thank me.

260
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,920
Who doesn't want me? Where are my mommy and daddy?

261
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,960
They are busy being lovey-dovey, don't have time for you.

262
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,920
What about my godmother Li Xin?

263
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,390
She's dating, too busy for you.

264
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,060
I still have Great-Grandpa and Auntie Du.

265
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,700
One is in the hospital for a checkup.

266
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,550
The other has gone back to her hometown for a wedding.

267
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,230
So don't keep fighting this anymore.

268
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:43,680
Brother, this auntie is scary.

269
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,390
You aren't allowed to cry.

270
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,530
Hold it back.

271
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,640
President Tong, Madam said that it may not be convenient for you to take care of the kids.

272
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,720
So she asked me to give you all a ride back.

273
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,410
Thank you!

274
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,640
Let's go.

275
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,880
I don't want to go in. I don't want to go in.

276
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,960
What are you doing? Let go!

277
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,690
If you don't behave, I'll call your godmother.

278
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,090
Let her give you so much homework that you won't ever finish. Let go!

279
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:21,870
Don't scare me. Once I go in, I won't able to go out. You're very scary.

280
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,000
Chen Chen, don't be nervous. Auntie just looks scary.

281
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,300
She's actually very kind.

282
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,790
What?! I look scary?!

283
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,960
Let go! Let go!

284
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,650
No! I won't!

285
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,770
How much do you think you weigh? If you're sold by the number of pounds,

286
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,540
your sister will be more expensive than your flesh is worth.

287
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,440
- Let go!
- Brother, what do we do?

288
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,500
You want to sell my sister?

289
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,970
Let go!

290
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,600
Okay then.

291
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,070
Let's agree to only sell me. Don't touch my sister.

292
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,250
Good boy. Let's go.

293
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,230
No one will sell you. No one will sell you.

294
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,740
Okay, President Tong, I'll be going now.

295
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,260
Okay.

296
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,130
Uncle He, you can't leave.

297
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:16,820
If you leave, no one will protect us. We brother and sister will be doomed.

298
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,270
Song Xingchen, that's enough!

299
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,470
Would I eat the two of you?

300
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:24,110
- Don't say that.
- Look, she wants to eat us!

301
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,900
She wants to eat us!

302
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,410
[I want to strike!]

303
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,760
[I want to do my best!]

304
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,250
Miss Jin.

305
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,820
This place is full of mine and Haoyu's memories.

306
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,570
Are you sure you want to join?

307
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,060
Memories belong to the past.

308
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,670
But there are a lot of things in the past we can't go back to.

309
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:55,350
I know this is all for the program, so I want to join.

310
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,950
But those memories

311
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,260
will always rest at an important moment.

312
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,350
You weren't there back then,

313
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,870
but you want to relive the moment with us.

314
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,120
Don't you think you'll be the third-wheel?

315
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,390
You shouldn't have come here. This is my private space. You don't need to understand.

316
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,740
I want to know more about Haoyu's past.

317
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,680
And I know that time is a powerful remedy.

318
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,560
If I can help him move on from the past,

319
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,730
I don't see anything wrong with it.

320
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:33,790
Qi Sile, you're that confident? Do you want to bet?

321
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,900
Miss Jin, I'm his wife. I don't need to make a bet.

322
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,880
Goodbye.

323
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,560
Senior Brother, go ahead.

324
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,000
So lame. You might as well go somewhere romantic with our junior sister.

325
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,910
Xiao Chen, it's your turn.

326
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,590
Handsome guy.

327
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,810
Do you still remember that today is my birthday?

328
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,230
Sorry, Xiao Chen.

329
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,950
I forgot to prepare a gift for you.

330
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,260
It's okay.

331
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,880
Then, let's bet on something.

332
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,620
Okay.

333
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,600
Haoyu.

334
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,910
You can do it!

335
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,610
- It's Miss Jin's turn.
- Come on, let's watch.

336
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,970
I want to see her play.

337
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,590
Not bad!

338
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:30,650
My father worked at a pool hall, so I played pool since I was a kid.

339
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,320
Are you scared?

340
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,430
You have the style of a champion.

341
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,990
Really?

342
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,390
Good!

343
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,980
Drink some water.

344
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,730
I have to head over there now.

345
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,220
Senior Brother, although it's not my birthday today,

346
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,200
would you place another bet with me?

347
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,470
Junior Sister, you've only got the black eight ball left.

348
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:27,840
You still haven't told me what you wanted if you won.

349
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,400
Promise me something if I make it in.

350
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,110
What is it?

351
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,770
I want you to be my boyfriend.

352
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,790
I'll take your silence as a yes.

353
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:23,490
Something's wrong. Her hands are shaking.

354
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,830
Stop the bet.

355
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:41,450
Director, let's wrap it up here for today.

356
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:44,550
Okay, let's call it a day.

357
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,260
Thank you, Director!

358
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,310
Let's wrap it up.

359
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,130
Thank you, Director.

360
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,480
Thank you. Thank you.

361
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,560
Haoyu.

362
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,850
Everything's fine. Let's go.

363
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,410
- Hello?
- A Lai, come pick me up right away.

364
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,780
Work ended that early?

365
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,820
Yes, come now, quickly.

366
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:42,000
From my experience, there's no way this woman is helping our mommy take care of us.

367
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,680
Mommy is too naive.

368
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,290
But she doesn't look that scary anymore

369
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,690
if you look at her for longer.

370
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,170
You don't get it.

371
00:25:55,430 --> 00:26:00,990
How to get along with naughty five-year-olds?

372
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,190
Share food.

373
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,120
Get closer to them and play with them.

374
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,210
What? Are you scared of me, too?

375
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,420
No, no. I was just trying to make the kids happy just now.

376
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,820
You're helping your boss watch his kids after work hours.

377
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,320
How miserable.

378
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,990
You don't have time to date, do you?

379
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,450
I don't want to. Wait, no. I don't have time.

380
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,820
So lame.

381
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,660
Brother, I'm hungry. I want to eat.

382
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,290
No, you're not hungry.

383
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,530
But I am hungry.

384
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,880
Hang in there until mommy gets back.

385
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,200
Such a hassle.

386
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,730
Do you want it?

387
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,810
Don't eat it!

388
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,750
Is it good?

389
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,610
Thank you, Auntie.

390
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:16,250
Kids should learn to share.

391
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,500
So can you give me a bite?

392
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,280
Okay.

393
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,300
I won't ask you to share. I didn't...

394
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,280
Don't cry. Don't cry.

395
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,500
Wait here. Wait for me.

396
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,560
My puff pastry!

397
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,890
This is...

398
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,420
We only had purple cabbage.

399
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,990
Try it.

400
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:51,620
I'll wait to see if you're still alive before I eat.

401
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,190
Stinky rascal. I made you food and you still complain?

402
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,570
It's good!

403
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:08,630
Xuan Xuan, is it good?

404
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,020
It's better than mommy's cooking.

405
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,000
You've got great taste!

406
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,460
Eat up.

407
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,530
Shut up! I'll throw you guys out if you keep yelling!

408
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,730
Please, God!

409
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,020
Thank you so much, President Tong.

410
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,570
President Tong, aren't kids adorable?

411
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:04,070
Qi Sile.

412
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,480
I paid to be the title sponsor for you, and I took care of your two kids.

413
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,730
You wouldn't be able to pay me back even if you wait on me for the entirety of your next life!

414
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,300
Thank you, President Tong.

415
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,410
Get out of here! Don't let me see your family of four.

416
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,770
You, too! Go!

417
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,080
[Please Be My Family]

418
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:52,340
♫ I thought I missed the rainbow ♫

419
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:59,280
♫ It turns out, it's been transferred to your eyes ♫

420
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:05,640
♫ The commotion stirs my memory like tidal waves ♫

421
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:14,510
♫ Not surprising the light only meet in the dark ♫

422
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,300
♫ From this moment ♫

423
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,830
♫ I want to sing softly about us ♫

424
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:23,390
♫ Going to fill my world with wonderful dreams ♫

425
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:29,070
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

426
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,330
♫ The sun rises and sets in all four seasons ♫

427
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:42,690
♫ It can't be compare to a minute of our embrace ♫

428
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,520
♫ From this moment ♫

429
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,830
♫ I want to embrace all the possibilities ♫

430
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,480
♫ An ode to time ♫

431
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:57,260
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

432
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,480
♫ Forever safeguarded ♫

433
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,600
♫ Forever protected ♫

434
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:11,020
♫ The moment we fell in love ♫

435
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,790
♫ From this moment ♫

436
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:18,920
♫ I'm running toward you ♫

437
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,080
♫ Gone through the maze of time ♫

438
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,520
♫ You are still in my heart ♫

439
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,680
♫ We have too many encounters ♫

440
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,800
♫ And has always been in a hurry ♫

441
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:41,700
♫ I once forgotten the love we had ♫

442
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:46,770
♫ The moment you made my heart flutter ♫
