that your marriage with Song Haoyu is a scam?!

23
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,260
He married you just to take Sitian's daughter from you.

24
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,360
How is it? You're married,

25
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,800
so it should be romantic. It needs a good atmosphere.

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,160
really disappointed in me?

35
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,170
I was too arrogant.

36
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,780
I trusted others too easily.

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,190
Running away?

56
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,750

Mommy hasn't had the chance to tell you.

Chen Chen also wants to go.

61
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,300
Chen Chen can't go, because Daddy isn't going.

62
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,920
Daddy is busy with work. So Chen Chen has to stay to keep daddy company, okay?

Grandpa hasn't woken up yet.

76
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,840
I'm afraid he won't be able to accept it.

77

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,970
I definitely won't sign the divorce agreement.

93
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,700
Chen Chen, what's wrong?

94
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,520
Did you have a nightmare?

95
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,740
Yeah, I had a nightmare.

It's okay, Baby. Don't cry.

Dreams are fake. It's always the opposite. After you wake up, everything will be fine.

98
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,670
Yes, it has to be fake. It'll be fine when I wake up.

Why isn't daddy and brother going to visit grandpa and grandma too?

106
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,950
Baby, Daddy has some important business to take care of.

107
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,230
That's why Brother Chen Chen is staying with daddy.

108
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,350
I see.

109
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,130

Chen Chen, what are you saying?

115
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,540
You and mommy can't breakup.

No!

- Mommy, hurry, stop the car.

127
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:20,470
Mommy, let's wait for brother. He's running.

128
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,160
He's running after us.

- I'm not tired.

Because I love you.

143
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,430
- Did you hurt yourself?
- I want Mommy!

144
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,850
Mommy didn't leave.

145
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,220
Mommy only took sister to go away for a while, and then they'll be back.

I deliberately skipped the chili sauce.

157
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:42,010
You've been coughing at night. The season is changing, so the weather is dry and you're inflamed. Eat less chili.

00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,260
She went inside. She's probably tired.

176
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,040

00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,770
I should've brought him here as well.

181
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,910
- Sile.
- Mom.

182
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,790
Xuan Xuan's probably tired, she's fallen asleep in my room.

183
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,900
Drink this while it's warm.

184
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,370
Chicken soup again?

185
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,600
It's suppose to nourish your body.

186
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,840
What's wrong?

187
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,430
I don't have much appetite, I can't drink it.

188
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,440
If you don't want to drink it then forget it.

189
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,630
I want to talk to you.

190
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,530
What do you want to talk about?

191
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,660
What happened to you and Haoyu.

192
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,850
There's nothing wrong with me and Haoyu.

193
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,870
- Nothing wrong?
- Nothing.

194
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,830
If there's a problem, don't hide it from me.

195
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,530
What can I hide from you, Mom?

196
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,510
I just want to spend a few days here. Can't I?

197
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,320
It's good if there aren't any issues.

198
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,880
My worrying heart can settle down then.

199
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,730
It's fine. Okay?

200
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,850
Mom, I'm really tired. I'm going to lie down for a bit.

201
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,130
Okay.

202
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,840
Go ahead and lie down. I'll go check on Xuan Xuan.

203
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,940
I'm keeping watch here.

204
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,570
You still have a kid at home, Haoyu. Go ahead and go home.

205
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,190
The other shareholders refused to meet with us in private.

206
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,980
President Song, we only have less than 10 days.

207
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:50,140
Song Haoyu, let's... get divorced.

208
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,550
Is Chen Chen inside? Chen Chen?

209
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,570
Auntie Du, what's the matter with the kid?

210
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,720
He hasn't eaten anything the entire day.

211
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,480
While I was cooking the noodles, he locked himself inside and won't come out.

212
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,740
Give it to me.

213
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,020
Chen Chen. It's daddy.

214
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,480
Why don't you open the door first okay?

215
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,280
- Auntie Du, where's the spare key?
- It's downstairs.

216
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,560
- Please get it.
- Okay, okay.

217
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,400
Chen Chen.

218
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,870
Our Chen Chen must be hungry now.

219
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,590
Here. Careful, it's hot.

220
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,840
Have some noodles, okay?

221
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,210
Daddy, I know crying won't solve any problem.

222
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:03,780
But can you just let me cry for a little while?

223
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,450
Come here. Chen Chen, you can cry if you want.

224
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,070
But don't cry by yourself, okay?

225
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,610
Let me stay with you, okay?

226
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,620
Okay.

227
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,790
Daddy, I miss them.

228
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:37,410
I want mommy and my sister.

229
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:50,360
Do you not want daddy and brother anymore?

230
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,550
Baby, I will always stay with you.

231
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,330
But I don't agree!

232
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,600
Godmother taught us in class.

233
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,370
A family must respect one another, but you didn't ask if I agreed.

234
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,040
You're selfish.

235
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,650
Then do you only want daddy and not me anymore?

236
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,540
But I have to have you, too.

237
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:29,440
Why can't the four of us stay as one family?

238
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,780
I'm sorry.

239
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,720
I'm sorry.

240
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,380
Mommy. Mommy.

241
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,620
Mommy.

242
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,340
[Brother Chen Chen]

243
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,670
[Brother Chen Chen]

244
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,920
Hello, Sister.

245
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,740
Brother, I miss you.

246
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,820
Where is mommy?

247
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,770
Does mommy miss me?

248
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:58,430
Of course. She cried today.

249
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,560
Brother,

250
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,700
I missed you so much that I woke up.

251
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,140
How about I come find you?

252
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,110
Really?

253
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,000
The pink is me.

254
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,290
The blue dot is you.

255
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:30,140
Xuan Xuan will come pick you up.

256
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,200
All right.

257
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,640
Daddy, I'm sorry.

258
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,730
I'm going to find my sister. Goodbye.

259
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,550
They're still not up for breakfast yet.

260
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,830
Dad, Mom, good morning.

261
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,460
- Good morning.
- You're up. Come eat breakfast.

262
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,540
Where is Xuan Xuan? Call her to come to eat.

263
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,100
What? She's not with you?

264
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,080
She's not.

265
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,640
I've been busy all morning and never saw Xuan Xuan.

266
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,920
Oh my.

267
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,950
Xuan Xuan! Old Liu.

268
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,430
Have you seen my granddaughter?

269
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,220
No. Did the kid run off?

270
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,440
Xuan Xuan!

271
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,440
- Xuan Xuan!
- Xuan Xuan!

272
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,150
- Xuan Xuan!
- Xuan Xuan!

273
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,130
Chen Chen! Chen Chen!

274
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,970
Chen Chen! Auntie Du!

275
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,650
Chen Chen!

276
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,440
Chen Chen! Chen Chen!

277
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,000
Auntie Du!

278
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,060
- President Song.
- Auntie Du.

279
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,670
- What's the matter?
- Have you seen Chen Chen?

280
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,970
- I didn't.
- Help me find him!

281
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:49,880
I saw your assistant come pick up Chen Chen.

282
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,400
So I let Chen Chen go outside.

283
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,040
Thank you. Thanks for checking.

284
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,890
Xuan Xuan!

285
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,580
Hello?

286
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,280
How come there's no battery left?

287
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,240
Grandma.

288
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,160
How many do you want?

289
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,210
One. All right.

290
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,270
Is this the place? Xuan Xuan?

291
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,550
Xuan Xuan! Xuan Xuan!

292
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,720
- Hold onto it, young girl.
- Thanks.

293
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,360
You haven't paid yet, kid.

294
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,210
I don't have money.

295
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,410
Where are your mom and dad?

296
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:43,750
I came here to find my brother by myself.

297
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,300
Oh right! Brother!

298
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,580
Brother! Brother!

299
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,440
Xuan Xuan!

300
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,060
- Xuan Xuan!
- Brother!

301
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,890
Xuan Xuan!

302
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,450
Brother, I've found you!

303
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:04,260
This is great, I've found you!

304
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,560
This is great, I've found you!

305
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,120
Here.

306
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,900
What is it? It can’t be cheap.

307
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,880
I'll just give you this salty tea egg as a gift.

308
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,600
Hurry and go home so that your mom and dad won't worry.

309
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,370
Great-Grandpa said, "Taking something without paying isn't polite."

310
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:25,360
It's actually "If someone is kind to you, but you don't reciprocate, that's impolite."

311
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,440
I'll give you a few more tea eggs.

312
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,790
Officer? They're on Snack Street?

313
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,240
Okay, I'll be right there!

314
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:41,850
Sile! Did the police contact you?

315
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,620
Get in the car first.

316
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,920
Let's go. I'll show you the way.

317
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,010
He Qing said he was going to take Chen Chen to find Xuan Xuan.

318
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:01,380
But unexpectedly, after he went to the restroom, Chen Chen had disappeared.

319
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,440
I must tell mommy to reconcile with daddy.

320
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,070
Yes, reconcile. So when will we be home?

321
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,250
Xuan Xuan, you said you would come pick me up.

322
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,310
But I don't know where home is.

323
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:24,680
Where's your watch? Call Mommy.

324
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:29,700
No battery. What do we do now?

325
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,240
I don't know.

326
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,780
Sister is unhappy. As the older brother, I must take good care of her.

327
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,630
- Thank you, Granny.
- That kid. How could he give the watch away?

328
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,190
Without the location positioning, what do we do?

329
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,860
Hello, have you seen these two kids?

330
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,500
Granny said the police has gone to the west side to search. We can go to the east side to search.

331
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,110
Hello, have you seen these two kids?

332
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,340
It's all my fault.

333
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,260
We have to find the kids before it gets dark.

334
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,100
Song Xingchen!

335
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,950
Wow, what pretty flowers!

336
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:22,860
Xuan Xuan, let's not be sad, okay?

337
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:29,400
It's my fault. Brother, don't get upset.

338
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,080
Brother, I'm thirsty.

339
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:37,560
Wait here for me.

340
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,520
- Xuan Xuan!
- Song Xingchen!

341
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,770
Qi Zixuan!

342
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,010
Wow, watermelon!

343
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:59,000
Brother, where did this watermelon come from?

344
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,530
An uncle just gave it to me.

345
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,870
Xuan Xuan! Chen Chen!

346
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:25,070
What do we do? When it gets darker, it’ll be harder for us to find them.

347
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,150
Brother, I miss daddy.

348
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,670
I also miss mommy.

349
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,760
Let's find a policeman uncle to take us home.

350
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,540
- Then call daddy.
- Okay.

351
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,460
- Let's go.
- Xuan Xuan!
- Song Xingchen!

352
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,910
- Chen Chen!
- Qi Zixuan!

353
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,210
Daddy!

354
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:47,070
Daddy! Mommy!

355
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:50,330
- Chen Chen! Xuan Xuan!
- Daddy! Mommy!

356
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:54,610
Daddy, I missed you.

357
00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:00,390
Where did you go?

358
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:03,350
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

359
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:06,830
- I'm not hurt.
- Don't leave me again!

360
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,660
Mommy, I've found you.

361
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:14,840
Don't leave me!

362
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,110
I'm sorry.

363
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,400
I'm sorry.

364
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,060
Xuan Xuan, I'm sorry.

365
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,800
Mommy, don't cry anymore.

366
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,760
Xuan Xuan.

367
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:41,250
♫ Not surprising the light only meet in the dark ♫

368
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,260
[Please Be My Family]

369
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:08,360
♫ I thought I missed the rainbow ♫

370
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:15,320
♫ It turns out, it's been transferred to your eyes ♫

371
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:21,590
♫ The commotion stirs my memory like tidal waves ♫

372
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:30,470
♫ Not surprising the light only meet in the dark ♫

373
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,330
♫ From this moment ♫

374
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,860
♫ I want to sing softly about us ♫

375
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,280
♫ Going to fill my world with wonderful dreams ♫

376
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:45,160
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

377
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:52,370
♫ The sun rises and sets in all four seasons ♫

378
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:58,790
♫ It can't be compared to a minute of our embrace ♫

379
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,620
♫ From this moment ♫

380
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,840
♫ I want to embrace all the possibilities ♫

381
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,540
♫ An ode to time ♫

382
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:14,080
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

383
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:18,470
♫ Forever safeguarded ♫

384
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,560
♫ Forever protected ♫

385
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:26,980
♫ The moment we fell in love ♫

386
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,680
♫ From this moment ♫

387
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,850
♫ I'm running toward you ♫

388
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:37,070
♫ Gone through the maze of time ♫

389
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:42,010
♫ You are still in my heart ♫

390
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,680
♫ We have too many encounters ♫

391
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,820
♫ And has always been in a hurry ♫

392
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:57,680
♫ I once forgotten the love we had ♫

393
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:04,090
♫ The moment you made my heart flutter ♫
