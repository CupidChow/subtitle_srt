00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,100
You can talk to me about it.

353
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,680
It's nothing. It's just that...

354
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:43,020
My family isn't supportive of me working in sales.

355
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,580
By family, do you mean your husband?

356
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,700
Yes.

357
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,690
Marriage really isn't easy.

358
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,060
Are you going through a rough patch?

359
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,300
It's not that...

360
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,250
I mean, why isn't he supportive?

361
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,520
Maybe he doesn't want his wife to be a salesperson.

362
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,800
What you want to do is your business.

363
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,120
Someone once told me that you can't lose a part of who you are, no matter what.

364
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,600
You can't lose a part of who you are, no matter what?

365
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,740
You shouldn't lose a part of who you are, no matter what.

366
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,680
Someone told me that same thing before, too.

367
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,110
So you know what to do then. Why the long face?

368
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,460
That's right. I know what I should do.

369
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,960
I need to find all my old books and go over everything again.

370
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,640
I won't let him keep looking down on me.

371
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,770
Thank you for the encouragement. I'll be off now.

372
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,220
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

373
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,400
Hey, Qi Sile, now that we've had a heart-to-heart,

374
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,030
we're friends the next time we see each other.

375
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,170
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

376
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,700
I've finally met you.

377
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,770
Qi Sile.

378
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,550
Hello?

379
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,120
Assistant Wu, where are you?

380
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,340
President Qin, I'm so sorry.

381
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,180
Something came up and I couldn't get away.

382
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,830
It's okay. Molin is a big corporation.

383
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,600
The marketing department must be busy.

384
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,790
I won't bother you then. But remember to disclose that I'm back in the country to Molin.

385
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,490
Don't worry.

386
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:51,200
President Tong, we summarized everyone's quarterly sales reports and sent them to your email already.

387
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,170
- Got it.
 - Also,

388
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:56,750
various jewelry brands are coming up with new designs for next season.

389
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,280
And there are rumors that KL Jewelers will enter the Chinese market.

390
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,750
If the news is true, they'll have an impact on Fanyi.

391
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,840
Entering the competition? This will be interesting.

392
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,550
We'll talk about our strategies when I return to the office.

393
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,120
Okay, President Tong.

394
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,870
Tong Luoqi, let's talk on the phone when you're free.

395
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,110
♫ Why am I somehow obsessed with you? ♫

396
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:54,250
♫ It's like a seed in my heart waiting to bear fruit ♫

397
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,660
♫ I'm only aware afterwards ♫

398
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,440
♫ I realized I'm lost when you're not here with me ♫

399
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,810
♫ If it's possible ♫

400
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:08,460
♫ Let's not be strangers and become lovers ♫

401
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,480
♫ When you're in my life, only then can my life be fulfilled  ♫

402
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,880
♫ Love has no preconceived notions ♫

403
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,690
♫ I'm the only one how knows you best ♫

404
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,720
♫ I will spend the rest of my life proving it ♫

405
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:35,860
Song Haoyu! What did you mean in your call last night?

406
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,240
How can you ask me to agree to Qi Sile working at my store?

407
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,550
Didn't I tell you on the phone that it was just a coincidence?

408
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,900
A coincidence? It seems like she's just trying to play smart.

409
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,610
She shouldn't be at Fanyi in the first place!

410
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,810
Who doesn't know that I used to like you?

411
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,650
Is she trying to make a fool out of me by making sure I see her every day?

412
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,240
She's trying to provoke me!

413
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,390
Didn't you use to try to make a fool out of Sile as well?

414
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,690
Did I storm into your office screaming at you like this?

415
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,990
I just don't want what's happening now to happen to Sile,

416
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,470
so I gave you a warning ahead of time.

417
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,020
Song Haoyu. Putting my feelings aside,

418
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,820
does Qi Sile even know anything about jewelry?

419
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,710
Why should I let her work at my store?

420
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,320
Do you know what it means to me to work at Fanyi?

421
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,990
I hope you'll support me.

422
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,600
Since your store manager hired her,

423
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,570
I'm sure she doesn't lack the qualifications.

424
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,760
Everything I told you is from me personally.

425
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,250
I hope you can help me, so my wife can work at your store with peace of mind.

426
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,300
You're different now.

427
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,190
You're personally asking me for help.

428
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,080
You used to never say this kind of stuff to me.

429
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,020
So, I'll take it as you'll help me then.

430
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,710
A big client is coming in today.

431
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,510
If she manages to win an order from Ms. Yu,

432
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:07,290
I'll agree to let her stay on probation.

433
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,660
One last thing, President Song.

434
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,690
You have terrible taste in women.

435
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,100
I don't think so.

436
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,170
Qi Sile, this is all I can help you with.

437
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,780
You're on your own from here.

438
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,280
Hello, Ms. Yu.

439
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,240
Ms. Yu, please, this way.

440
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:59,980
Welcome to Fanyi Jewelry, Ms. Yu.

441
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,660
What's her background?

442
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,650
Why is she so excessive?

443
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,920
Ms. Yu, your coffee.

444
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,740
She's an extremely tough client, but her family is very well-off.

445
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,000
Your skill in making coffee...

446
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,030
is pretty good.

447
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,130
Thank you. I'm glad you like it, Ms. Yu.

448
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,360
I'm here today because I'm getting married soon.

449
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,220
So, I came to pick out some jewelry

450
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,970
to match my wedding dress.

451
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,600
Okay, understood. Please wait a moment.

452
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,540
Ms. Yu, this icy purple jade is the rarest on the market.

453
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,100
I specially picked out a pink diamond necklace set for you. It suits you very well.

454
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,870
This set is the Star of Sierra Leone.

455
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,460
These are all great options.

456
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,080
But I don't like any of them.

457
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,070
Ms. Yu, I hope you'll like this cornflower necklace set.

458
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:04,600
They all picked out the most expensive items in the store for me to buy.

459
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,110
Why did you pick this set? Are you new here?

460
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,160
I saw that you have a warm white skin tone,

461
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,060
so cool tones suit you.

462
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,070
That looks pretty good. I like it.

463
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,160
Can I help you try it on?

464
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,410
I'm talking about your brooch.

465
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,660
Thank you.

466
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,150
How much is it? I want to buy it.

467
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:28,330
Sorry, it's my personal belonging. I'm not selling it.

468
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,810
What if that's just the one I like?

469
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,460
