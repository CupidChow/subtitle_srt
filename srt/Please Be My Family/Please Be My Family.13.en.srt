21
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,610
Sister-in-law, what you heard were things he said in anger.

22
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,800
And you only heard half of it.

23
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,320
Do you dare say this in front of her?

24
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,850
Of course.

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,250
I want to be good to her too.

26
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,320
But it's already too late.

27
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,180
He has always regretted saying those dumb things to you.

28
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,870
Aside from what you previously agreed to,

Song Haoyu has a useless mouth.

32
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,600
But he's already trying to make up for the hurt you felt.

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,100
Can't you feel that?

34
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,130
If you go to another mall, then I won't be able to see you anymore.

35
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,720
Should I believe what I'm feeling?

36
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,460
Maybe the love and care he shows me isn't just all in my head.

37
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,090
Song Haoyu,

38
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,770

Men's satisfaction comes from giving.

41
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,590
Not being needed is about the same as slowly dying.

Sile is working at Fanyi now.

43
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,200
What other needs would she have?

44
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,710
President Song,

45
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,610
the engineering cost for the launch has been audited.

46
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,830
But there's still a payment that still hasn't been granted.

47
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,690
The marketing and finance departments are both shifting the responsibility onto each other.

48
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,780
Can you take a look?

49
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,930
Why haven't the funds for the labor services been granted yet?

50
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,470
The cost was originally included in the marketing department's budget,

51
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,590
but the equipment leasing company didn't return the deposit to the finance department in a timely manner,

52
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,230
so they're unable to continue.

53
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,490
Have the marketing department send a reminder to the equipment leasing company immediately.

54
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,270
Okay.

55
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,870
He Qin, the last couple of days that Qi Sile has been at Fanyi,

56
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,270
has her work been smooth?

57
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,400
It seems pretty smooth so far.

58
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,890
But...

59
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,570
Manager Wu said it seems like she's been a bit scatterbrained lately.

60
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,160
Seems like... unrequited love.

61
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,870
Unrequited love?

62
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,760
When she has nothing to do, she'll constantly clean things,

63
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,320
or constantly is in a daze or sighing.

64
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,570
If it's really unrequited love,

65
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,660
then she's definitely thinking about you.

66
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,380
Thinking about me?

67
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,570
If there's nothing else, I'll get back to work.

68
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,490
Okay.

69
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,990
Remember to rush Xiao Han.

70
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,720
Okay.

71
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,810
Looks like I'm not slowly dying yet.

72
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,140
This won't do. If she misses me too much, she won't do well at work.

73
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,790
I should go see her.

74
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,280
So what if I know?

75
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,240
If Haoyu doesn't say it out loud,

76
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,320
it won't be possible for our relationship to change.

77
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,080
Do you have something on your mind? Tell me.

78
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,010
If you don't tell the store manager, you can tell me.

79
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,970
I'm fine, really.

80
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,020
Sile, someone's looking for you.

81
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,210
This is an 18-karat rose gold diamond necklace.

82
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,150
The main focus is the rare diamond in the middle.

83
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,530
I think this one's pretty good.

84
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,130
This one is so expensive.

85
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,640
I recommend you buy another one.

86
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,890
Shouldn't you be glad I'm buying something expensive?

87
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,380
- Sile!
- Yes?

88
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,990
Store Manager, just a minute. I'm almost done here.

89
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,500
But you're my friend.

90
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,620
- Welcome, President Song.
- I'm already embarrassed that you're helping improve my sales.

91
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,250
- It's okay. I want this one.
- No, look at something else.

92
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,350
It's him. What's he doing here?

93
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,360
Really, look—

94
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,510
Why are you here?

95
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,650
I'm still working. Let's chat during lunch.

96
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,800
I'm here to find my wife for lunch.

97
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,930
Hello, I'm Song Haoyu.

98
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,560
I didn't think I'd meet

99
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,780
the KL Asia Pacific Brand Executive, President Qin, like this.

100
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,700
Nice to meet you.

101
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,450
You've made quite a few trips to Maolin recently.

102
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,570
Looks like you've had your eye on us.

103
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,100
Looks like you're also watching me, President Song.

104
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,590
I'm only concerned about my wife.

105
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,030
You do need to be concerned about Sile.

106
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,790
After all, marrying such a wonderful wife

107
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,290
means you're rather lucky.

108
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,630
Yes, I am rather lucky.

109
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,810
Otherwise, our marriage wouldn't be so happy.

110
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,880
And we wouldn't be so in love.

111
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,370
By the way, President Song. I'm sorry I hung up on your phone call so hastily last time.

112
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,330
I'm not here to discuss work today.

113
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,590
Wifey, let's go eat.

114
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,270
I'm not off yet. I'm still working.

115
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,750
Of course, eating with your husband is more important.

116
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,520
- But I haven't finished...
- Store Manager, we'll be going now.

117
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,820
- Okay!
- We're going, Qin Tian.

118
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,140
Store Manager, please take care of my friend!

119
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,250
- Okay.
- Qin Tian, I'll message you later!

120
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,620
President Song, take care!

121
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,300
Mr. Qin.

122
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,840
Assistant Wu.

123
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,890
A reminder letter?

124
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,630
Just pretend...

125
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,090
like you forgot.

126
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,250
I already got you your next job.

127
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,150
I won't let you down.

128
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,980
Your order is complete. Please enjoy.

129
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,500
Thank you.

130
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,680
Eat up.

131
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,330
Oh right, how do you know Qin Tian?

132
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,210
I met him the first time I took Chen Chen to the street stalls at the market.

133
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,750
At the time, he was the one who helped me find Chen Chen.

134
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,080
That said, we've known each other a while now.

135
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,210
Right.

136
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,540
She loves eating stinky snails vermicelli.

137
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,440
What's wrong?

138
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,620
Oh. Nothing.

139
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,120
Did he misunderstand? Maybe he's jealous?

140
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,380
I have to buy something at Fanyi tomorrow.

141
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,520
Buy what?

142
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,340
My...

143
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,910
business partner is having a birthday, so I want to buy a birthday present.

144
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,140
Aren't you working? Can you take care of me?

145
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,150
No.

146
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,660
Fanyi is so expensive. Helping me earn commission

147
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,130
by spending our own money is wasteful.

148
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,790
What I mean is, buying a present

149
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,800
doesn't need to be so expensive. Just the intention counts.

150
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:02,170
It's all right. Anyway, the money from Fanyi will end up in Molin.

151
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,740
Thinking about it that way doesn't make it wasteful.

152
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,490
That's still not okay. Helping me get a commission is cheating.

153
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,610
Why can that other guy do it, but I can't?

154
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,360
Are you two the same?

155
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,370
I'm full.

156
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,440
You hardly ate anything, how can you be full?

157
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,250
I'm not hungry.

158
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,660
I have a meeting. I'm leaving. Don't forget to pay.

159
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,060
If you wanted me to pay, why did you bring me to such an expensive place?

160
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,180
What a waste.

161
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,130
Waitress, pack it up!

162
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,310
What does she mean?

163
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,680
Not the same?

164
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,770
How am I different from him?

165
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,560
You're right. Why is her attitude toward me

166
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,530
different all the time?

167
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,140
What brings you here today?

168
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,970
I've been having insomnia lately.

169
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,570
I devoted my heart and soul to her but she's so cruel to me.

170
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,840
But I still can't

171
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,700
get her out of my mind.

172
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,540
I said lots of romantic stuff to her when I confessed my feelings.

173
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,580
Do you know how much effort I put in to celebrate her birthday?

174
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,280
I gave her my heart, but she completely crushed it.

175
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,500
Ungrateful.

176
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,830
Why is Sile the same way?

177
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:26,050
I originally came here for you, but I found this book instead.

178
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,970
It's quite interesting.
 [Help her solve all her current problems, so she won't have to suffer!]

179
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,730
I...

180
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,550
You read books like these?

181
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,300
It's He Qing's. He left it here.

182
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,620
Did you find something useful in the book?

183
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,100
Look at this sentence.

184
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,560
"A woman's emotions are like rising and falling waves."

185
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,170
"Right now, what she needs is company and active listening, not suggestions."

186
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,260
That means I have to take more initiative.

187
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,560
If there are no opportunities, I need to make one.

188
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,540
[Company Initiatives - Protect - No Opportunities] 
 [Create Opportunities - Active Listening]

189
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,930
Haoyu, I want to ask you something.

190
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,010
What is it?

191
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,820
Did you know Qin Tian from before?

192
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,290
Why are you bringing him up all of a sudden?

193
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,330
I just wanted—

194
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,860
Where did the couch go?

195
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,280
I-I kept tossing and turning in my sleep and it got damaged.

196
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,850
Then... how are we sleeping?

197
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,560
That's not appropriate, is it?

198
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,630
Then... What should we do?

199
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,310
Is what appropriate?

200
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,950
What she needs most is someone to be with her, listen to her complaints, and empathize with her,

201
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,090
while she overcomes this tough period.

202
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,090
Qi Sile.

203
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,380
- Let's chat.
- About what?

204
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,090
I'm not against you working, but I don't want you to stay at Fanyi.

205
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,680
Why?

206
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,690
Is it because of Tong Luoqi?

207
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,210
It's not just her. It's also...

208
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,880
What?

209
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,470
My stomach feels kind of upset.

210
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,250
Auntie Du needs to make lighter dishes for the next few days.

211
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,840
Why has she been cooking such spicy food lately?

212
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,550
He really is jealous. When did this start?

213
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,020
I have to hold it in. As long as he doesn't admit his feelings for me,

214
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,090
I won't take the initiative with him.

215
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,420
Moreover, the most important thing right now

216
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,290
is to quickly hit my sales target.

217
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:11,070
[Sales Volume]

218
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,540
Aren't you responsible for how smoothly it's been going?

219
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,950
He won't be able to keep up that fake smile soon enough.

220
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,110
In less than two days, it'll begin.

221
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,750
Qi Sile!

222
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,040
What are you doing here?

223
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,100
Work's done for the day. I'm here to take you home, of course.

224
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,470
I'm not off work yet.

225
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,910
No, wait. I'm about to hit the sales target to pass my probation.

226
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,980
I just got permission from Manager Wu

227
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,810
to work overtime up to around nine.

228
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,100
You really don't need any help?

229
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,890
- I do.
- Okay, then—

230
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:56,670
Can you go home sooner today and spend time with the kids?

231
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,150
Sure. Why are you so stubborn?

232
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,920
I'm not being stubborn.

233
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,800
When I said I wanted to work, Xuan Xuan and Chen Chen were very supportive of me.

234
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,590
I just want them to understand that Mommy can be like Daddy, and take charge of her career.

235
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,630
Then I'll head home now.

236
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,190
Bye-bye.

237
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,900
Give it to me!

238
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,040
I'm not coming back!

239
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,600
Brother, let me play with your dinosaur!

240
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,960
No! I won't!

241
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,250
Song Xingchen, Song Xingchen, calm down!

242
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,370
Daddy, where's Mommy?

243
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,060
Mommy... is working.

244
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,120
When is she coming back?

245
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,740
She'll be back before your bedtime.

246
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,130
When is our bedtime?

247
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,140
Yeah, you two should be in bed now. Let's go to sleep right now.

248
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,270
- I'm not sleepy!
- I'm not sleepy!

249
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,250
Daddy, I want a dinosaur just like brother's.

250
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,800
Can you buy one for me?

251
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,430
- Buy things? 
 - I'll take this one.

252
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,090
Qin Tian won't go place an order with her when I'm not around, will he?

253
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,740
Daddy, buy me one!

254
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,630
Sure, sure. I'll buy it for you tomorrow. Chen Chen, let your sister play with the dinosaur for a while.

255
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,370
Here, here.

256
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,530
Give it to me!

257
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,700
Qi Sile, when are you coming back?

258
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,920
It's only eight. I'll be done at nine.

259
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,100
All right, I'm hanging up. There's a customer.

260
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,500
Hello?

261
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,420
Continue playing. It's fine. I'm not angry.

262
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:55,270
Hello, Sile? The kids were drinking milk

263
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,620
and spilled it all over the bedsheets.

264
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,190
I don't know what to do! When are you coming back?

265
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,890
Ask Auntie Du for help. I'm having an end-of-day meeting. Bye.

266
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,790
But I— Hello?

267
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:12,050
The little boy walked on and on. He felt...

268
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,830
it gets colder and colder and the surroundings get darker and darker.

269
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,850
He turned around and realized the path behind him was gone.

270
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,600
Daddy, I'm kind of scared.

271
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,850
What are you scared of, Xuan Xuan?

272
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,130
What is it now?

273
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,000
Qi Sile. When are you coming back? Xuan Xuan is scared and can't go to sleep.

274
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,870
Xuan Xuan, talk to your mommy.

275
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,570
Mommy, I'm so scared.

276
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,960
Did you hear that? Don't you have any sense of responsibility?

277
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,230
All right, all right, I'm coming home right now.

278
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,220
Hurry up.

279
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,690
Why do you make me feel so secure?

280
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,770
That feels so good.

281
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,010
- You're back.
- Yeah.

282
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,220
Is that for me?

283
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,750
Yeah. It'll help you sleep.

284
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,160
Thanks.

Are you coming home this late again tomorrow?

297
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,230
I don't know.

298
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,810
Why are you working so hard?

299
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,870
I don't want to lose to her.

300
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,230
What?

301
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,740
President Song! Come out! Return our money! Give us our money!
 [Maolin Mall]

302
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,610
Give us our money! Give us our money! Block him!

303
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:59,050
Block him! Give us our money! Give us our money!

304
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,980
Give us our money! Give us our money!

305
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,780
Something still seems to be missing.

306
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,350
Reporter Wei, there are people at Maolin Mall demanding to be paid. You won't want to miss this.

307
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,150
Wasn't the reminder letter sent out a long time ago?

308
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,500
Why hasn't the money been sent over yet?

309
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,170
The marketing department reported that they did send it out.

310
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,980
But they don't know why the workers are here causing trouble.

311
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,000
Maolin Mall owes us our salaries! They have such a big mall,

312
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,940
yet they don't even want to pay several hundred thousand yuan!

313
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,690
We'll look into why this is happening later on.

314
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,130
Tell the finance department to activate the emergency channels and pay the workers quickly.

315
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,000
- Sir, what happened?
- The boss held

316
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,100
some stupid meeting here and hired us to set up the stage. I have the contract here. Right here!

317
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,800
And they went back on their word. It's been such a long time and they still haven't paid us!

318
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,300
Get out here! Get out here!

319
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,580
Give us our money! Give us our money!

320
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,840
Sile!

321
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,650
Something's happening with President Song. The media is here too.

322
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,700
Everyone, quiet down!

323
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,600
Everyone, quiet down. Listen to me!

324
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,110
Listen to me!

325
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,690
I am Song Haoyu of Molin Group.

326
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,000
The finance department is already in the process of approving the wages.

327
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,840
You're the big boss. Why would you need to get it approved?

328
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,030
You big companies are all heartless and don't care if we die!

329
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:02,730
Pay the money! Pay the money!

330
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,130
You all...

331
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,810
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

332
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,170
What are you doing?

333
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,130
- Everyone, calm down first.
- Who are you?

334
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,220
I'm his wife. I know him best.

335
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,860
He knows what it means to be responsible.

336
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,360
That's why there must be a misunderstanding here. Please calm down.

337
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,820
You woman don't know shit!

338
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,580
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. Are you okay?

339
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,000
You're hurt.

340
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,200
- Pay the money!
- President Song.

341
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,410
He Qing, call the police. Call the police to handle this matter.

342
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,730
Hello, Assistant Wu.

343
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,040
Why did you stir up such big trouble? You even called reporters.

344
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,150
How am I supposed to clean this up?

345
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,260
You don't need to clean it up.

346
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,500
The new company is ready to welcome you.

You really don't follow rules in what you do.

348
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,270
I've never followed rules in what I do.

349
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,230
Does it hurt?

350
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,600
Are you a fool?

351
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,870
It was really dangerous just now, but you rushed right in.

352
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,730
I'm not criticizing you.

353
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,040
I just...

354
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,980
don't want you to get hurt.

355
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,790
Look. I have a bigger physique.

356
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,240
I wouldn't necessarily lose even if there was a physical fight.

357
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,090
You're so small and thin,

358
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,500
but you still wanted to protect me.

359
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,500
I... I didn't want it to happen like that, either.

360
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,570
But I...

361
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:02,920
I knew... but I couldn't help it.

362
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,030

You two are busy. I'll go then.

374
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,310
How's the handling of things going?

375
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,610
The money has just been approved.

376
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,840
The problem with the wages has been solved.

377
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,580
That's good, then.

378
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,770
Contact the legal department and pursue the liability from the equipment rental company.

379
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:30,400
Actually, I've already contacted the equipment rental company just now.

380
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,320
They never received the reminder letter.

381
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,660
So they didn't violate the contract according to the agreed terms.

382
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,950
They won't accept any liability.

383
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,760
They didn't receive the reminder letter?

384
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,020
I've already confirmed with the Marketing Director.

385
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,410
Assistant Wu should have handled the collection letter,

386
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,190
but he neglected it.

387
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,040
So it indeed wasn't sent.

388
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,370
Follow the procedure to pursue responsibility then.

389
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,750
He has already voluntarily resigned.

390
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:00,470
The Marketing Director has also submitted his letter of resignation.

391
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,980
- His attitude was very firm.
- Voluntarily resigned?

392
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,450
There's something fishy here. Let's investigate thoroughly.

393
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,920
What's the public opinion about the incident right now?

394
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,110
The impact caused by this incident is bad.

395
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,590
It's getting widely spread online.

396
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,590
[Molin embroiled in incident with workers over rights and wages.]

397
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,430
What do we do now?

398
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,410
[How can such a big company not have the money?]
[They don't treat the workers like human beings.]

399
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,310
Tell the Public Relations Department to issue an immediate announcement.

400
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,750
Okay.

401
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,590
I understand him best. He really understands what it means to be responsible.

402
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:37,190
That's why there must be a misunderstanding here. Please calm down.

403
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,240
So that was how President Song got injured.

404
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,130
I got it.

405
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,910
Aren't you going to express your sympathies?

406
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,810
Isn't there someone taking care of him already? Why should I worry?

407
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,260
Rather, I'm quite impressed by Qi Sile.

408
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,650
President Tong, then...

409
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:00,660
From now on, don't tell me anything about Song Haoyu unless it's business related.

410

417
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,380
I'm fine. I'm fine.

418
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,560
Look, all my arms and legs are just fine.

419
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,230
You really scared me to death.

421
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,680
He's fine.

422
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,870
Why were you at Maolin at that time?

423
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,660
And your clothes...

424
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,240
Why are you wearing these clothes?

425
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,770
I told you! Did you forget?

426
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:42,220
Didn't I tell you that I applied for a sales job?

427
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,590
Oh, right, right.

428
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:46,550
So, take a look at me.

429
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:50,050
I'm working at a jewelry store in Maolin Mall.

430
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,790
Instead of taking it easy as the wife of a president,

431
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,430
why do you insist on suffering?

432
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,440
You know how much I love the jewelry field.

433
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,480
Now that I've finally got an opportunity, of course I have to grab hold of it.

434
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,660
Besides,

435
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,790
there's nothing wrong with working in sales.

436
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,610
My heart simply aches for you.

437
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:10,480
Fine. Do whatever you want to do.

438
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,890
But if you're ever bullied or taken advantage at the store,

439
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,790
immediately call me. Watch how I rip that person apart!

440
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,060
You're still the best!

441
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,410
Have you lost your heart to me?

442
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:24,500
Of course, I've lost my heart...

443
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,660
I thought carefully about this for a long time

444
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,980
and finally came to a conclusion.

445
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,130
I've fallen in love with you.

446
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,860
Why are you staring off into space? What are you thinking about?

447
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,480
Nothing much. I just...

448
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,150
There's something

449
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,910
that I haven't had the chance to tell you yet.

450
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,620
What is it?

451
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,470
Hao Jun confessed his feelings to me.

452
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,410
That? I already knew about it.

453
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,990
He even gave me 28 birthday presents!

454
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,390
Tell me, didn't he do that on purpose?

455
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,720
He must be crazy!

456
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,510
On purpose? I don't think so.

457
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:12,310
But my guess is that he doesn't even know he stepped on a landmine.

458
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,660
On the other hand,

459
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:18,750
I feel that he must like you a lot.

460
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,770
How did you reach this analytical result?

461
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,790
Is your brain love-sick?

462
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:31,430
I thought you two looked pretty affectionate when you were together.

463
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,070
No.

464
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,700
Looking affectionate doesn't mean it's love.

465
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,750
You're too naive. You simply don't understand men.

467
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,130
sees a woman who looks pretty nice,

468
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,700
and the mood is good,

469
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,410
he's capable of doing anything.

470
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:51,350
As to whether it's true love, unless you go through observation and testing,

471
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,580
you can't be certain at all.

472
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,640
Anyway, I don't want any entanglement with Hao Jun.

473
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,460
Whether he likes me or not, has nothing to do with me.

Observe? Test?
