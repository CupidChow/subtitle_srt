00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,510
Director Hao, what about your meeting with Xiao Jin? I've prepared everything.

22
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,000
Do you want me to come pick you up?

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,020
No need. I am already here.

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,180
Then I won't interrupt your discussion. In case any collaboration opportunity arises,

25
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,030
please keep in mind my artists.

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,100
Hello Director Hao, my agent told me you wanted to see me.

27
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,790
So it's you.

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,190
- I have some questions to ask.
- Go ahead!

29
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,580
Li Xin, do you still remember her?

30
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,950
Sorry, I'm in a rush right now.

31
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,050
If it's not about discussing our cooperation, excuse me, I'll be going then.

32
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,470
If the agency finds out,

33
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,040
that the now rising star had to dump his long-term girlfriend in order to debut,

34
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,230
would there be any risk?

35
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,760
Are you threatening me?

36
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,780
Answer my question, I won't make things difficult for you.

37
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,650
Ask me then.

38
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,610
If Li Xin stood in front of you right now, how would you explain it to her?

39
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,950
I'm too embarrassed to see her.

40
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,520
Look at me!

41
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,790
All these years she has been waiting for your answer.

42
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,360
And you say you don't dare see her, pretending nothing ever happened?!

43
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,520
- She still hasn't let it go?
- What do you think?!

44
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,370
It's true, I did her wrong.

45
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,190
But my brain went blank when I saw that artist contract.

46
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,230
I only realized what I did after I signed it. But then what?

47
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,220
Back then I could only think about hiding.

48
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,310
Hiding? Do you really count as a man?

49
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,640
If it were you, what would you have done?

50
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,800
Gotten married?

51
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,080
Getting married means I'd break the contract. And if I didn't get married?

52
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,590
How do I explain this to her if I didn't get married?

53
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,950
Do I tell her, "I dumped you for my career and my dreams"?

54
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't care how you explain it to her.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,600
You're coming with me to explain it right now.

56
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,190
I can't risk seeing her right now.

57
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,000
Are you going to hide forever? Can't you be a man for once?!

58
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,750
She burned this CD for me.

59
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,740
They're all songs that I sang at the bar.

60
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,830
I've kept it until now.

61
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,510
Can you return it to her for me?

62
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,100

It's not going to be one of those cliché requests like asking me to leave Haoyu, is it?

66
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,930
Hi, Ms. Qi. Thank you for waiting.

67
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,810
- A Lai, just an orange juice for me.
- Okay.

68
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,330
Should we introduce ourselves?

69

Ms. Qi Sile, nice to meet you. I'm Jin Xichen.

70
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,870
Ms. Jin, nice to meet you. I'm Qi Sile.

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,180
I'm Song Haoyu's wife.

72
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,720
You're probably wondering why I asked to see you, right?

73
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,920
I don't have the time to wonder. Please just get to the point.

74
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,490
- It's not because you dread thinking about it, right?
- What should I be dreading?

75
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,120
Don't you know?

Is there something I should know?

Excuse me.

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,610
I came to see you...

79
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,440
because I want you to help me with a small favor.

80
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:36,020
I heard you were the Fangyi salesperson who helped Ms. Yu modify her jewelry.

81
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,530
I didn't expect a world champion would pay so much attention to me. Thank you.

Then you should be talking to President Tong.

86
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,850
But I need a designer first.

87
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,820
You're not asking me to be your designer, are you?

88
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,930
Fanyi has so many contracted designers. I can't even compare to them in terms of qualifications.

89
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,730
Why are you asking me?

90
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,020
Can I not ask you to do it?

91
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,550
I understand why we're meeting today.

92
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,760
So I'm afraid I can't take this job. Sorry.

93
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,060
It's because I envy you.

94

How lucky you must be to marry Haoyu.

95
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,230
I want you to be my designer,

so I can borrow some of your good luck.

97
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,820
Even if now's not the time, I hope that I can find happiness somewhere down the line.

98
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,290
I'm sorry, Ms. Jin.

99
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,930
As Fanyi's employee, I can't decide this on my own.

100
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,050
I still have to discuss this with President Tong.

101
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,820
I'll wait to hear from you then.

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,860

What are you doing here?

107
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:00,680
I was waiting for you. There are some things I wanted to talk to you about in person.

108
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,670
Go ahead.

109
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,100
Do you care about me?

110
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,390

Do you still insist on waiting to hear it?

113
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,060
If this is what you wanted to talk to me about,

114
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,790
forget it.

115
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,490
Are you going to keep waiting for him even if he never comes back for you?

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,660
- Yes.
- Fine.

I'll give you the answer you want to hear.

118
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,240
I was wrong for leaving without saying goodbye.

119
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,510
But when that contract deal was placed in front of me,

120
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,320
I needed to seize the opportunity. It wasn't until I signed it that I realized,

121
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,190
I needed to give you up.

I burned them into a CD for you.

You recorded them even when they sound so bad?

131
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,380
It doesn't sound bad. I think your singing is the best.

132
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,940
Don't you want to know why I haven't given you an explanation even after so many years?

133
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,290
It's because I can't bring myself to see you again.

134
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,890
I thought that as time passed,

135
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,450

you just suddenly disappeared.

Or start another relationship?

144
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,820
I'm sorry. I wasn't able to marry you,

145
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,480
and I couldn't make any commitments to you.

174
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,810
- I don't want to. I'm tired.
- Just make it.

175
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,560
No.

176
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,800
I really am hungry. I waited for you all night.

177
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,850
Stop crying.

178
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,740
Has the neighbor left yet?

179
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,620
They're gone.

180
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,420
[Molin Group]

181
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,510
It was me who was there for you

182
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,350
when your parents passed away.

183
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,660
That's why I gave up the opportunity to train and compete abroad.

184
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,130
Would I do that if it wasn't for love?

185
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,320
Why can't you just be honest with me?

186
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,880
Didn't you say you like me?

187
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,110
I missed you a lot.

188
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,810
Doesn't matter what she suspects,

189
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,260
just tell her everything and then show her your determination.

190
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:40,200
There she goes again. She hasn't come up with any new ideas in three years.

191
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,380
What do you mean, President Tong?

192
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,770
Jin Xichen also said something similar to me back then.

193
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,250
Ms. Tong, it's because I envy you.

194
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,080
After all, I can't choose my family background.

195
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,990
But I have no hostility towards you!

196
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,460
I just simply like Haoyu.

197
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,050
What?

198
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,610
It's nothing. That's enough.

199
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,590
Qi Sile.

200
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,550
Don't tell me you're thinking of yourself as petty, just because

201
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,970
of those things she said to you for sympathy.

202
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,830
Of course not. I have some social experience, too.

203
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,760
Of course, I knew she had ulterior motives.

204
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,770
It was such a great opportunity and you didn't splash coffee on her.

205
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,220
Seems like that's all you have in you.

206
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,220
Anyway, here are my three no's.

207
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,500
I don't agree.

208
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,760
There's no way.

209
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,040
I won't allow it.

210
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,610
She wants Fanyi to make her a custom order? No way!

211
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,600
Do you think she might not know

212
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,690
about our current relationship

213
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,720
and wants to see us tear each other apart?

214
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,440
Of course, that's what she wants!

215
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,420
But knowing her, that's just one of the things she wants from this.

216
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,210
I think she's taking this opportunity to test you.

217
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,930
She wants to get to know the enemy.

218
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,910
Testing me?

219
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,700
Then I definitely can't hide from her.

220
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,450
Why shouldn't I let her get to know me?

221
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:15,510
Besides, don't you think that with her current reputation,

222
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:20,730
it's only beneficial for Fanyi to take the job?

223
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,410
What are you talking about?

224
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,510
Do I need her to help promote my brand?

225
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:29,070
Besides, she's obviously setting you up in a trap. Can't you tell?

226
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,250
Are you... worried about me?

227
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,230
Do I know you like that? Why would I be?

228
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:46,050
But if we don't take the job,

229
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:49,230
would it make us seem a bit...

230
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,100
Cowardly?

231
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,860
President Tong.

232
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,850
I'm requesting to take on Jin Xichen's design request.

233
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,310
I'll go confront her.

234
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:12,520
I'll play it by ear whether I want to splash coffee on her or not.

235
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,920
Okay then.

236
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,680
But I'm warning you.

237
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,550
Since you've agreed to do this, you must win this battle.

238
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,100
- Otherwise, I'll fire you!
- Otherwise, I'll fire you!

239
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,710
Hello?

240
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,740
You're downstairs? Okay.

241
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,690
President Tong. I...

242
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,330
I got it.

243
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,990
Disappear.

244
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,530
Aren't we going home? What are we doing here?

245
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,190
I want to talk to you.

246
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,140
About Jin Xichen?

247
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,820
That's right.

248
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,210
Just a reminder,

249
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,520
get your words straight before telling me.

250
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,010
I'm still very sensitive about your past with her.

251
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,510
Sile, you don't have to worry that my past

252
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,070
will cause any trouble in our relationship.

253
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,660
Because...

254
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,160
Jin Xichen isn't Chen Chen's biological mom. You're mistaken.

255
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,830
I know.

256
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,570
You know?

257
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,760
Luoqi told me.

258
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,820
And?

259
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,290
Chen Chen...

260
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,560
Is my older brother's child.

261
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,000
Your brother?

262
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,330
You have a brother?

263
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,440
When Chen Chen was really young,

264
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,690
my brother and sister-in-law...

265
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,210
both passed away.

266
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,110
I brought Chen Chen up myself.

267
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,080
So to me,

268
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,590
he's just like my own kid.

269
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,530
I'm sorry for not telling you about this earlier.

270
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,710
Actually...

271
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,890
There's something I haven't told you, either.

272
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,930
What is it?

273
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,760
Actually...

274
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,090
Xuan Xuan isn't my biological child, either.

275
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,510
Xuan Xuan is my older sister's child.

276
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,090
What? Your sister's child?

277
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,730
The DNA results confirm that Xuan Xuan is related to the Songs.

278
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,500
We found out about the brooch.

279
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,570
Indeed, two were made.

280
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,480
Ever since my sister's

281
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,660
accident, Xuan Xuan's always been with me.

282
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,550
So to me, Xuan Xuan is like my own.

283
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,130
Accident?

284
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:58,630
Haoyu... Your brother...

285
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,400
He got into a car accident.

286
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,860
I'm sorry for not telling you about this either.

287
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,130
Never would've thought that Chen Chen and Xuan Xuan,

288
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,410
are quite similar.

289
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,260
Haoyu, don't worry.

290
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,740
I'll be twice as kind to Chen Chen from now on.

291
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,140
Turns out...

292
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,050
it was because of my brother that her sister...

293
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,990
We'll all be fine.

294
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,370
We'll have a very happy family.

295
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,680
Definitely.

296
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,380
Sile.

297
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,290
From now on,

298
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,790
no matter what happens,

299
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:04,330
stay by my side, okay?

300
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,060
Okay.

301
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,840
I'll tell her about Chen Chen and Xuan Xuan next time.

302
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,520
♫ Gently humming a song, it enters my heart  ♫

303
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:24,980
♫  I want to give you all of my warm embraces ♫

304
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,870
Song Haoyu.

305
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:30,520
There's something else I want to tell you.

306
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,320
What is it?

307
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,690
I don't care what your past is with Jin Xichen.

308
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:44,070
From now on, you can only treat her as a memory.

309
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,100
Got it.

310
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,630
Cherish what's in front of you right now.

311
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,650
As you wish!

312
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,660
Qi Sile.

313
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,910
In the future, whether you experience something

314
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,740
that makes you happy, sad, or mad,

315
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,360
you can't drink like you did before,

316
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,740
to the point where you're uncomfortably ill.

317
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,520
Did it pain you?

318
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,300
Did it pain me?

319
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:18,620
Yes.

320
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:24,710
♫ It can't be compared to a minute of our embrace ♫

321
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,670
♫ From this moment ♫

322
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,960
♫ Please be with me for the rest of my life ♫

323
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,670
♫ An ode to time ♫

324
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:39,560
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

325
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,800
♫ Forever safeguarded ♫

326
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,810
Haoyu.

327
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,940
This might ruin the mood a bit,

328
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,480
but I want to tell you something.

329
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,230
Sure.

330
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,050
Go ahead.

331
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:02,440
Jin Xichen asked me to meet today.

332
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,880
Did she give you a hard time?

333
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,800
No.

334
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,280
She wants me to design a brooch for her.

335
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,630
Design a brooch?

336
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:21,110
I discussed this with Tong Luoqi.

337
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,710
And we both agreed.

338
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,170
What are you two up to?

339
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,340
Three women on a stage.

340
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:37,030
The stage has already been set up. Audience, please take your seat.

341
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,980
I really don't understand what goes on in women's minds.

342
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,430
I don't know what she wants either.

343
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:49,190
But whatever it is, I'm not scared.

344
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:53,260
Your wife isn't too bad herself.

345
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,430
That's right.

346
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,680
My wife is the best and most amazing in the world!

347
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,910
Why are you giving me so much validation today?

348
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,410
Sile.

349
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,460
From when I was in school,

350
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,260
all the way to taking over Molin,

351
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,400
I've always been very confident

352
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,360
and very hard-working.

353
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,460
When faced with obstacles,

354
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,940
I would bravely overcome them,

355
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,150
and do the best I could.

356
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,290
But today I suddenly thought about the time

357
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,440
when you looked at me with determination

358
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,110
at the Molin office,

359
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:40,830
and said you wanted to start over.

360
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,640
You had such a brave look

361
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,820
in your eyes.

362
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,850
It was nothing worth noting.

363
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,920
You're great, too. Why compare yourself to me?

364
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,170
One sows and another reaps.

365
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,670
I just naturally became

366
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,510
the person I was supposed to be.

367
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,840
It's nothing to be too proud of.

368
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,360
But you're different.

369
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,460
You're the one who sows.

370
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,720
You're the brave Qi Sile who broke all boundaries

371
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,780
and started over again.

372
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,160
What's that look?

373
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,870
What?

374
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,670
If you're going to look at me like that...

375
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,730
I can't hold back any longer....

376
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,870
Stop...

377
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,550
[Please be My Family]

378
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,790
♫ I thought I missed the rainbow ♫

379
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:15,760
♫ It turns out, it's been transferred to your eyes ♫

380
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,940
♫ The commotion stirs my memory like tidal waves ♫

381
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:30,880
♫ Not surprising the light only meet in the dark ♫

382
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,560
♫ From this moment ♫

383
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,080
♫ I want to sing softly about us ♫

384
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,640
♫ Going to fill my world with wonderful dreams ♫

385
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:45,090
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

386
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:52,820
♫ The sun rises and sets in all four seasons ♫

387
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:59,140
♫ It can't be compared to a minute of our embrace ♫

388
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,870
♫ From this moment ♫

389
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,200
♫ I want to embrace all the possibilities ♫

390
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,750
♫ An ode to time ♫

391
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:14,020
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

392
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,890
♫ Forever safeguarded ♫

393
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,950
♫ Forever protected ♫

394
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:27,370
♫ The moment we fell in love ♫

395
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:30,170
♫ From this moment ♫

396
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:35,220
♫ I'm running toward you ♫

397
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,450
♫ Gone through the maze of time ♫

398
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:41,940
♫ You are still in my heart ♫

399
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:47,120
♫ We have too many encounters ♫

400
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,280
♫ And has always been in a hurry ♫

401
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:58,160
♫ I once forgotten the love we had ♫

402
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,700
♫ The moment you made my heart flutter ♫
