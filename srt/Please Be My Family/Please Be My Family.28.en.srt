[Please Be My Family]

21
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,330
Thank you for the hard work lately, Doctor Zhu.

22
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,240
My grandpa hasn't woken up in such a long time.

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,060
- You...
- Your grandpa's condition is still pretty stable.

24
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,590
He is still under our observation. Come to my office.

25
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,080
I explain the details to you.

26
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,070
Grandpa, I came to visit you.

27
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,220
So much has happened at home recently.

28
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,540
Actually,

29
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:45,230
deep down in my heart, I never believed you would do such a thing.

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,070
As a family,

31
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,780
we spent so many happy moments together.

32
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,610
And you've always been so kind to me and Xuan Xuan.

33
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,660
Haoyu and my feelings for each other...

34
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,270
are also genuine.

35
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,120
But I really can't come to terms

36
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,410
with why he married me at first.

37
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,020
I really don't know what to do.

38
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,530
Grandpa.

39
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,880
Don't worry.

40
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,750
I trust...

41
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,900
that Haoyu will do his best to protect Molin Group.

42
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,760
I will too.

43
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,000
Please get better.

[Protecting the Family]
[Episode 28]

45
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,900
Are you looking for me?

46
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,460
Yes.

47
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,160
Xiao Chi.

48
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,040
So you did look into me and Sitian's past.

49
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,230
What do you think? Surprising?

50
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,330
Stop whatever you're trying to do.

51
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,510
Stop?

52
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,770
What gives you the right to ask me to stop?

53
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,180
As Qi Sitian's family or Song Haoyu's family?

54
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,690
- Does it make a difference?
- Of course, it does.

55
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,820
The difference is if you're the enemy or family.

56
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,950
Do you want to single-handedly destroy Chen Chen and Xuan Xuan's happiness?

57
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,380
You tell me that you're doing all of this

58
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,040
for my sister and the two kids. Then let me ask you this.

59
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,350
Will my sister want to see her kids separated again?

60
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,470
You can raise both kids.

61
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,090
- And then?
- I can help you! We can do it together!

62
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,940
And then? How do I explain this to the kids when they grow up and have matured?

63
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:57,000
Do I tell them that they have a broken family all thanks to their Uncle Qin Tian?

64
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,670
Is that the love you want to give them?

65
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,760
Qi Sile!

66
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,030
I will protect my family. That's where I stand.

67
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,670
I would suggest you stop.

68
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,950
Otherwise, my sister up there won't forgive you.

69
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,400
You...

70
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,220
Qi Sile.

71
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,680
You're not Qi Sitian's sister at all.

72
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,410
You're just Song Haoyu's wife.

73
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,720
No matter what happens, promise me one thing.

74
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,940
What is it?

75
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,620
Stay at Molin Group.

76
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,600
What's the point of me staying if you won't be here?

77
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,100
There's a point.

78
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,610
I hope you can stay at Molin Group.

79
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:36,050
Since it was established in 1973, Maolin Mall has had it's share

80
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,020
of over fifty years of ups and downs.

81
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,450
According to my grandpa, he opened a general store with his family's bank savings,

82
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,760
behind my great-grandpa's back.

83
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,540
And he named it Maolin Store after my great-grandfather.

84
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:56,260
I came to Molin Group when I was 24 and officially took over when I was 27.

85
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,120
Everyone here has witnessed my growth along the way.

86
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,870
So,

87
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,110
I really appreciate everyone.

88
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,430
Emotional appeal?

89
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:31,150
Many have poured their heart and soul into helping Molin Group grow from a general store to what it is today.

90
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:36,160
So no matter what happens today, and no matter what my future role may be,

91
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,070
I'll continue to guard Molin Group as one of its members.

92
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,350
All right, all right.

93
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,200
The voting to dismiss Song Haoyu as the group's sole decision-maker

94
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,080
can officially begin.

95
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,450
Everyone can put in their votes now. I agree.

96
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:04,880
- Agree.
- Agree.
- Agree.

97
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,710
I already calculated it for you.

98
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,870
The amount of shareholders with the voting right possesses 83% of the company.

99
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,440
Those who voted yes account for 50%.

100
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,230
As I said, as long as we get results,

101
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,430
the process isn't all that important. All right.

102
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:24,350
The results are obvious. Song Haoyu, you don't need me to escort you out, do you?

103
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,950
Sorry, Everyone.

104
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,750
We're late.

105
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,440
President Tong?

106
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,670
Qi Sile?

107
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,210
You're...

108
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,660
Participating in the vote.

109
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,780
Taking part in voting? With what qualifications?

110
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,420
President Tong is Molin Group's new shareholder.

111
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,690
Fanyi now has 8% of Molin Group's shares.

112
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,790
Tell me, does that make me qualified?

113
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,110
If this 8% is a vote for no...

114
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,230
Wait. Who's that next to you?

115
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,250
Let me introduce you.

116
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,290
This is Fanyi's lead designer,

117
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:39,600
Qi Sile. I'm here today, all thanks to her investment proposal.

118
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,780
It's not that I don't want to help you. It's just that the amount of Molin Group's shares that Fanyi possesses

119
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,420
doesn't meet the standard for being on the board of directors.

120
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,140
If we can acquire more shares

121
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,010
to become a board member,

122
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,730
will that meet the requirements?

123
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,670
In order to absorb the shares, we need to take a lot of factors into account.

124
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,040
It's not that easy.

125
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,150
Business is business.

126
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,280
Then what about from the perspective of a business deal?

127
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,100
Luoqi.

128
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,270
You've worked with Haoyu for so many years.

129
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,090
You know best how important Molin Group is to Fanyi.

130
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,150
If there's a change of ownership at Molin Group,

131
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,360
what effect will it have?

132
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,790
You're putting us in the same boat as him.

133
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,500
Fine. Keep going.

134
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,010
The reputation that Grandpa and Haoyu created for themselves

135
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,550
is what all the shareholders value most.

136
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,070
So for them,

137
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,070
a change of ownership is an uncontrollable risk.

138
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,800
Do you think we can use that to our advantage?

139
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,210
They must be restless at this point.

140
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,620
So we should take advantage of this opportunity

141
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,320
to buy their shares at a lower price.

142
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,630
That's right. At the very least,

143
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,250
even if Haoyu does get dismissed from the board,

144
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,390
you won't lose anything.

145
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,290
If I become one of Molin Group's board members,

146
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,770
I can allocate more resources towards Fanyi.

147
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,870
Forget about KL, AL, and whatever else.

148
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,090
It's a sure win business deal.

149
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,220
All right, Qi Sile.

150
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,700
I'm willing to do this for you.

151
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,750
I want to remind everyone.

152
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,640
Molin Group is what it is today because of Chairman Song and President Song's decades of hard work.

153
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,450
I'm sure everyone is aware of the profit loss that will come

154
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,590
with replacing the decision-maker without careful consideration.

155
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,660
So I hope everyone won't get taken advantage of by someone who's ill-intentioned.

156
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,570
Let's vote.

157
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,640
I'm in favor of President Song.

158
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,520
In favor.

159
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,820
In favor.

160
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,730
In favor.

161
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,830
In favor.

162
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,770
In favor.

163
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,510
In favor.

164
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,330
In favor.

165
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,750
In favor.

166
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,940
In favor.

167
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,950
In favor.

168
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,870
I'm also in favor.

169
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,640
Then I announce that Song Haoyu will temporarily stay at his current position

170
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,390
with a probation period of six months starting today.

171
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,950
Thank you, President Tong.

172
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,690
I'm not the one to thank.

173
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,030
Sile.

174
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,190
Thank you.

175
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,870
I'm only doing it for the kids.

176
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,580
You two are being so polite to each other.

177
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,070
Song Haoyu, can you man up?

178
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,470
It's important to keep up appearances as a man,

179
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,560
but it's equally as important to acknowledge your mistakes.

180
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,580
If she still won't forgive you, go home and kneel on the washboard.

181
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,420
Sile...

182
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,010
is that okay?

183
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,990
Aren't we talking business here?

184
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,160
Why are we talking about this?

185
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,940
Lately,

186
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,090
I really have been reflecting on myself.

187
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,290
I truly do realize my mistakes.

188
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,970
Can you not be mad at me anymore?

189
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,500
I just remembered I have a date later.

190
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,560
I'll get going. You two take your time.

191
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,730
Luoqi.

192
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,610
Take care.

193
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,390
Sile.

194
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,870
Are you free later?

195
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,130
- I want to...
- I don't have time.

196
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,400
Don't get the wrong impression. I didn't do this for you.

197
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,660
What happened between us is a different matter.

198
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,550
I know.

199
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:48,980
I wanted to ask you if you have time to visit grandpa with me.

200
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,210
Doctor Zhu, did something happen to grandpa?

201
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,710
Okay, okay, that's great!

202
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,490
Thank you. I'll be there soon.

203
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,040
Sile.

204
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,910
Grandpa's awake. Do you want to go with me to see him?

205
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,070
[To be entrusted with one's life weighs heavier than Mount Tai.]

206
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,830
Thankfully my old bones are quite strong.

207
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,770
Otherwise, once I closed my eyes,

208
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,710
- my entire body would smell like disinfectant.
- Knock on wood!

209
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,810
Stop saying such unlucky things, Grandpa.

210
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:32,420
Am I not allowed to express myself now that I'm able to see such beautiful scenery?

211
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,010
You won't let me go out and play chess with Old Li.

212
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,150
Didn't you hear what the doctor said?

213
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,800
You still need to stay in the hospital for a few more days for observation.

214
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,120
What's there to observe? He can say what he wants.

215
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,370
We still haven't talked about you yet.

216
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,380
If Sile wasn't at the board meeting...

217
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:49,970
Sile.

218
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,260
- Thank you.
- It's nothing, Grandpa.

219
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,540
- Have a seat. Sit.
- Okay.

220
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,730
What happened with the company was my fault.

221
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,460
I promise it won't happen again.

222
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,610
Take it as a lesson.

223
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:10,210
Remember that anything can happen in the face of interest.

224
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,480
Sile.

225
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,110
Thank you.

226
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,740
Haoyu, I didn't bring any water out with me. Go get me some tea.

227
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,410
Okay. I'll be right back.

228
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,150
Sile.

229
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,560
Grandpa.

230
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,030
Regarding that legal document...

231
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,240
So...

232
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,180
Xuan Xuan and Chen Chen are both Haochen's kids?

233
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,200
Yes. They're both your great-grandchildren.

234
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,070
Then what's your relationship to Xuan Xuan?

235
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,760
Xuan Xuan is my sister's child.

236
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,530
So you're her younger sister.

237
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,860
Yes, I'm Sitian's sister.

238
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,440
If it weren't for Song Enmao,

239
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,770
Xuan Xuan and Chen Chen wouldn't have been brought up separately.

240
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,870
And everything that happened afterward wouldn't have happened!

241
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,620
Do you know Qin Tian well?

242
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,810
I know a bit about him.

243
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:36,630
Qin Tian knew my sister growing up.

244
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,750
But I don't know much about what happened

245
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,530
after they went abroad.

246
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:45,640
I just know that... later my sister ended up with Song Haochen.

247
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,820
Then they had Chen Chen and Xuan Xuan.

248
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,460
Then after that...

249
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,440
After that...

250
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,030
Looks like Qin Tian

251
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,850
and your sister went way back.

252
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:09,560
Grandpa, can you tell me what kind of person Song Haochen was?

253
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,010
Haochen, since he was a child, was simple.

254
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,310
He wasn't the calculating type

255
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,340
and was often the target of bullying.

256
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,080
He's very different from Haoyu in that aspect.

257
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,990
At that time,

258
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,200
I was more strict with Haoyu.

259
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,870
I was thinking that someone needed to take over Molin Group at some point.

260
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,520
But Haochen took that as me favoring Haoyu.

261
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,470
He got angry with me and left to go abroad.

262
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,120
Did he contact the family again after he went abroad?

263
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,790
Haoyu went through a tough time.

264
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:53,730
He worked really hard to inherit the company,

265
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,940
just so that Haochen

266
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,750
could live a stress-free life abroad.

267
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,440
So he could do whatever he wanted to do.

268
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,020
But who would've thought that...

269
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,050
Sile.

270
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,650
So what are your plans now?

271
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,660
He married me because of Xuan Xuan.

272
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,200
I don't know what to do either.

273
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,310
I get it.

274
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,940
I apologize to you on behalf of Haoyu.

275
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,410
Grandpa, don't say that.

276
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,660
So how are things currently with you and Haoyu?

277
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,880
Don't worry. We haven't gotten divorced yet.

278
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,600
That's good.

279
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,340
Here, Grandpa.

280
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,850
Have a sip.

281
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,120
Are you feeling better?

282
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,680
You silly boy. The water isn't even hot.

283
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,360
I told you I don't need you to take care of me.

284
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,870
Just discharge me from the hospital. Why won't you sign the papers?

285
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,100
Grandpa, why are you still thinking about leaving the hospital?

286
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,140
The doctor said we had to wait for things to stabilize some more.

287
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,490
Stable, stable...

288
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,060
Oh, no. My heart... is spasming again.

289
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,190
Come on, Sile. Let's go back inside.

290
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,970
Let's get another check-up for that heart.

291
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,490
My liver is spasming, too.

292
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,930
My stomach is spasming, too.

293
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,730
[Song Haoyu]

294
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,520
I can't tell Haoyu.

295
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,020
I'm not sure if I still have a future with him.

296
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,820
What do I do?

297
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,310
You're her sister.

298
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,570
Her sister.

299
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,310
No.

300
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,300
Then they had Chen Chen and Xuan Xuan.

301
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,980
Then after that...

302
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,470
After that...

303
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,940
What is grandpa trying to cover up?

304
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,230
Do you know Qin Tian well?

305
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,960
Qin Tian did all this for revenge.

306
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,500
The Songs owe you and Sitian!

307
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,040
They must repay their debts!

308
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,670
What does Qin Tian want from this exactly?

309
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,400
[Meet me at our usual spot.]

310
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,250
You're home.

311
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,260
How are grandpa's test reports?

312
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,390
He's getting better by the day.

313
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,550
That's good.

314
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:51,980
Sile. Did you call me earlier?

315
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,320
I called by my mistake.

316
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,990
Are you going out?

317
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,310
Something came up at work.

318
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,300
What's wrong?

319
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,230
Nothing. My stomach is a bit upset.

320
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:14,250
Sile. Stay home if you feel sick.

321
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,680
It's fine. I'll feel better soon.

322
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,270
How about this? Why don't I give you a ride?

323
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,400
- No thanks.
- Then...

324
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,370
I'll wait for you to get back.

325
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,550
All right.

326
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,410

[Urban Farming]

328
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:01,540
Grandpa didn't know anything about Song Haochen and my sister.

329
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,400
So it's impossible for him to break up Xuan Xuan and Chen Chen.

330
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,660
He didn't know?!

331
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:14,110
Qi Sile, are you saying Sitian lied?

332
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,420
The person who's lying could also be you.

333
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,020
What's your motive exactly?

334
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,220
Of course, it's to make the Song family pay for their debt.

335
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,100
What debt?

336
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,400
Haoyu and my sister?

337
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,990
This is Song Haochen.

338
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,310
Sitian.

339
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,670
You must be hungry, right? Here.

340
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,500
What's the matter?

341
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,580
I... have a boyfriend now.

342
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,100
What are you doing? It's dirty, stop eating.

343
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,830
It's fine!

344
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,300
Stop eating!

345
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,070
When did this happen?

346
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,410
We've been dating for almost six months.

347
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,730
I never had a chance to tell you.

348
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,540
What do you like about him?

349
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,280
I...

350
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,690
He has good grades in school.

351
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,520
He can give me a lot of financial assistance.

352
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,540
After all, my graduate study tuition is really expensive.

353
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,020
I thought, if I'm with him, you wouldn't be so tired from working.

354
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,790
I'm not tired!

Before, I was lying.

357
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,630
I don't want you to be with someone else.

358
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,400
You... Didn't you always say that we were only family?

359
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,150
It's because

360
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,420
I feel like I'm not worthy of you.

361
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,850
You're studying in such a good school.

362
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,950
At school,

363
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,900
you can also make friends with these outstanding people. But I...

364
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,580
Qin Tian, don't say that.

365
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,050
No matter what, you're irreplaceable in my heart.

366
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,980
Don't be with anyone else then.

367
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,450
Okay? Don't be with anyone else.

368
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,090
But I...

369
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,500
I'm pregnant.

370
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,380
Sitian said she wanted to have the kids.

371
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:56,550
Give the kids a complete family and not let them go through the hardship we went through in childhood.

372
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:01,490
I supported her, so I chose to completely disappear.

373
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,480
And later? What happened later?

374
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,080
I thought they would get married

375
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,790
and live a comfortable life. But Sitian suddenly came looking for me.

376
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,320
She was sobbing and told me

377
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,410
she needed me.

378
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:24,430
Then... what about Song Haochen? He was the children's biological father.

379
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:27,650
Song Haochen, because of his family's disapproval,

380
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,960
refused to get married.

381
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,520
This kind of weak and irresponsible man,

382
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,100
doesn't deserve to be cherished.

383
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:40,310
So, Sitian wanted me to the father of her babies.

384
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,830
Wait. That's not right.

385
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:52,390
Grandpa didn't even know about Song Haochen and my sister.

386
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,120
How was it possible for him to disapprove of it?

387
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,720
But if he hadn't objected to it.

388
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,980
Why didn't Song Haochen want to get married?

389
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,030
Are you sure this is the truth?

390
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,580
Not only that,

391
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,070
he did even worse things to Sitian!

392
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,760
What did he do to my sister?

393
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,180
He killed Sitian!

394
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,870
What?

395
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,990
Where are you taking me?

396
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,300
Stop! Song Haochen, stop!

397
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,930
- Sister?
- Stop the car!

398
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,640
I'll destroy you.

399
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,450
Qi Sitian, I'm going to destroy you! I hate you!

400
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,640
Sitian went back to the Qi family because of you.

401
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,370
Song Haochen killed Sitian!

402
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,390
If this is real,

403
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,330
then this is the worst consequence.

404
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,560
Baby.

405
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,730
I also want to give you a complete family.

406
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,030
Sister,

407
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,350
what should I do?

408
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:36,920
What should I do?

409
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,320
Why isn't she picking up?

410
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,530
You're back. Since you haven't been feeling well,

411
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,860
I made some porridge for you.

412
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,160
Here.

413
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,490
Sile.

414
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:32,410
I know you've been in a bad mood lately. You can't

415
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:35,860
accept the fact that I originally married you because of the children.

416
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,710
But, please believe me.

417
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,170
I will make it up to you.

418
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,650
I...

419
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,110
He killed Sutian!

420
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,920
We should still break up.

421
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,200
♫ From this moment ♫

422
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,540
♫ I want to embrace all the possibilities ♫

423
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,110
♫ An ode to time ♫

424
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:08,520

♫ The moment we fell in love ♫

428
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,430
♫ From this moment ♫

429
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:29,570
♫ I'm running toward you ♫

430
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,810
♫ Gone through the maze of time ♫

431
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:36,070

♫ The moment you made my heart flutter ♫

436
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,240
Sile, I'm reluctant to accept this.

437
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,900
Can you give me an answer, please?

438
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,810
So you and Song Haochen...

439
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,840
are twins?

440
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,670
Who told you?

441
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,910
I met with Qin Tian today.

442
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,260
Why did you go see him again?

443
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,510
I couldn't let go of my sister's matters.

444
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,960
What did he tell you?

445
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,730
Where are you taking me?

446
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,570
Stop! Song Haochen, stop!

447
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,610
Don't drive me to craziness!

448
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,650
I'll destroy you.

449
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:54,590
Qi Sitian, I'm going to destroy you! I hate you!

450
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:01,000
My brother... My brother isn't that type of person.

451
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,490
Then how do you explain this?

452
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,440
I really don't know what to think.

453
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,060
I don't know how to face this.

454
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,070
Don't force me to get crazy!

455
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,100
I'll destroy you.

456
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,820
Qi Sitian, I'm going to destroy you! I hate you!

457
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,660
Sile.

458
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,100
There's an issue with the recording.

459
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,110
This ending appears to have been damaged. Listen.

460
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,200
I'm going to destroy you!

461
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,190
I hate you!

462
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,570
I hate you!

463
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,420
This isn't the complete version.

464
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,880
Then...

465
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,360
Sile, don't panic.

466
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,650
When my brother got into the accident back then,

467
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:56,040
grandpa received documents from overseas.

468
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,850
I remember that he told me clearly that it was an accident.

469
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,860
Because he was afraid that I'd be too sad reading it, he took care of it.

470
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,950
Perhaps, grandpa knows.

471
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,390
Haoyu.

472
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,810
It's so late, why are you still up?

473
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,160
