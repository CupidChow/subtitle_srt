[Let's Get Divorced]
[Episode 25]

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,240
Back then, you made the connection and bought KL's shares.

41
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,730
The bonus was a no-brainer. Song Haoyu suddenly took back the resources.

42
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,780
He gave it to Fanyi. Then what about us?

43
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,390
President Song's actions deserted KL indeed.

44
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,080
They have very strong opinions.

45
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,590
I already tried my best, but I can't suppress it.

46
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,630
Isn't it all because Song Haoyu's wife is at Fanyi?

47
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,120
You didn't notice this? If the company lets Song Haoyu carry on like this,

48
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,140

In a few years, won't his arrogance from being a CEO be as high as the sky?

52
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,610
Honestly, Maolin is also considered his Song family's business.

53
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,180
Of course, he naturally wants to support his own people.

54
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,370

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,060
You missed me already?

91
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,430
Yes. I haven't seen you for 4 hours already.

No. I still have unfinished work on my hands.

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,120
I know.

97
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,150
Wait. Someone is knocking on the door.

98
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,180
- Who's knocking on the door?
- I'll go and see.

99
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,240
I don't know who'd be knocking at this time.

100
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,520
What are you doing? Have you eaten?

101
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,610
Me? I'm coming to fetch you, so I definitely didn't eat yet.

102
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,690

Yes. My boyfriend came to see me.

Okay. Then I won't bother you.

106
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,780
Why are you here?

107
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,470
- I was afraid you would starve. So I brought you food.
- Come in.

108
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,250
Hurry, come eat or the food will get cold.

109
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,220
Why are you delivering food to me at noon?

110
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,360
Won't it affect your work?

111
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,620
I remember previously someone didn't just deliver for me,

112
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,620
but also cooked the food for me.

113
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,250
My boyfriend really knows how to reciprocate.

By the way,

115
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,170
I researched more about that wedding gown shop, I think

116
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,270
it's a little too expensive. Why don't we change to another one?

117
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,960
You only need to consider what you like. Don't worry about anything else.

Then, Chen Chen and Xuan Xuan will be flower kids again?

I haven't had the time to tell you something I've been wanting to tell you.

124
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,140
Go on. What is it?

125
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,580
If I told you,

126
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,520
I was afraid you'd be angry.

127
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,870
Tell me first. Afterward, I'll decide if I'll be angry.

128

132
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,840
Xuan Xuan and Chen Chen have the same birthday.

133
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,350
It's not...

134
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,300
Is not what?

135
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,290
Pick it up. What if it's something important.

136
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,080
What is it?

137
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,190
What?

138
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,320
KL breached the contract and withdrew its store to join a rival mall,

139
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,110
and it also took away the customer resources it had developed at Maolin Mall.

140
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,040
Director Qin,

141
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,410
you've played a good hand.

142
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:26,420
President Song, if someone really wants to leave, who can stop him?

143
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,070
Since KL has already breeched the contract and someone is footing the bill,

144
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,740
then Molin should receive a good amount of compensation.

145
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,120
Compensation?

146
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,610
Aren't you going to explain your negligence at work?

147
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,250
I already said just now. If someone really wants to leave,

148
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,650
no one can stop him.

Fantastic.

You can leave right now.

152
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,650
Here's the thing.

153
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,120
Recently, Director Qin

154
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,160
has discussed purchasing the stock shares with the shareholders.

155
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,790
Over half of us are glad to do it. Furthermore,

156
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,300
we particularly like the conditions offered by the buyer.

157
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,910
So you're saying...

158
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,810
He's currently already a shareholder at Molin?

159
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,440
I hope President Song will continue to give me guidance in the future.

160
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,120
What do you mean by this?

161
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,720
Mr. Hao, don't get agitated. President Qin's offer is quite impressive.

162
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,480
We don't have any reason to refuse, do we?

163
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,280
All these years, hasn't Molin been good to you?

164
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,330
The shares were transferred in secrecy. Who do you think Haoyu is?

165
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,640
My participation will not only bring more brand resources to Molin,

166
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,000
but I can also provide more ideas to the company.

167
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,620
This way, we can help relieve President Song's pressure.

168
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,590

Qin Tian, you're truly amazing.

171
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,840
You flatter me.

172
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,460
But, as a new shareholder,

173
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,590
I question the company's current one-person decision-making system.

174
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:23,510
Therefore, we'll hold a shareholder meeting as soon as possible to redefine the management.

175
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,640
To dismiss Haoyu?

176
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,540
- How dare you?
- Of course,

177
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:33,740
before the shareholder voting meeting, you're still the one and only President Song at Molin Group.

178
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,370
That's all. Meeting is dismissed.

179
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,680
Let's go.

180
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,940
Haoyu, what do we do now?

181
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,590
Investigate first,

182
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,890
find what conditions he's offered to the shareholders.

183
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,140
Oh right, don't let Grandpa know about this matter.

184
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,240
Okay.

185
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,050
Hello, Auntie Du.

186
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:25,310
President Song, Senior Song suddenly fainted!

187
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,400
What?

188
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,660

[Medical Service Access | Staff Only]

190
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,120
Haoyu.

191
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,400
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

192
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,530
- Doctor.
- How's the situation?

193
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:52,000
The patient's situation is such that we don't recommend surgery. The risk is too high.

194
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,540
So we can only do conservative treatment and observe first.

195
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,650
When will he wake up then?

196
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,260
It's hard to say.

197
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,940
There's a problem with Senior Song's heart rate, and we can't rule out that he was stimulated by something.

198
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,880
Let's observe more once he's transferred to the patient's room. Don't worry.

199
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,830
Haoyu.

200
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:14,000
Don't worry. Trust me.

201
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,240
What's the matter, Attorney Wang?

202
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:26,310
Oh, okay. I'm in the hospital. Let's meet here.

203
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,050
Okay.

204
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,690
What is it?

205
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:36,520
He said that he's devised some measures in response to Molin's current situation. He's going to come discuss it with me.

206
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,250
Do you want to know why Senior Song fainted?

207
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,440
Come to the rooftop to see me.

208
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:05,390
How about it? Isn't the reason for Song Haoyu's marriage interesting?

209
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,710
What are you trying to do?

210
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:19,840
I want the entire Song family to repay the debt owed by Song Haochen.

211
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,250
You...

212
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,790
What are you laughing at? What's so funny?

213
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,620
I've treated you as a friend. How could you do this to my family?

214
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,280
What exactly did you do to grandpa?

215
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,670
Let me tell you. Everything that I've done

216
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,970
is for Sitian and her two kids.

217
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,600
What are you talking about? What two kids?

218
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,120
Qi Zixuan and Song Xingchen.

219
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,630
They're twins who were forcibly separated!

220
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,700
That family threatened her

221
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,830
that she'd never see her children again.

222
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,070
They warned Sitian that she had to leave that man.

223
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,330
Sitian could only send Xuan Xuan back to the country.

224
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,880
Do you know which detestable elder did this?

225
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,890
Song Enmao, Song Haoyu's grandfather!

226
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,540
Senior Song didn't approve at the time, unlike how he's so agreeable now.

227
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,690
That's not possible. I understand grandpa.

228
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,660
He wouldn't do something like this.

229
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,520
You won't even believe Sitian's words?

230
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,590
Why is it that, even now, you still can't see

00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,220

He married you just to take Sitian's daughter from you.

234
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,700
You're lying. Haoyu didn't do this.

235

I can promise you.

238
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,870
Once we get married, I can raise Xuan Xuan like she's my own,

239
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,900
but you have to let me get to know you two better.

240
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,530
For example, where was Xuan Xuan born?

241
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,450
Aside from what you previously agreed to,

242
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:51,290
in front of the kids and grandpa, we don't need to do anything other than act well.

243
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:56,070
I told you there is no love in our marriage. Everything is fake.

244
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,180
If it weren't for Song Enmao,

245
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,640
Xuan Xuan and Chen Chen wouldn't have been raised separately.

246
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,170
And everything that happened afterwards wouldn't have happened!

This is what the Song family owes you and Sitian.

He has to pay it back! Song Haoyu has been lying to you!

but his love for me is real!

00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,320
Are you sure?

254
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,220
Don't you want to know what I did to Song Enmao?

On the surface, Song Haoyu appears to love you,

but he already made preparations to divorce you!

I was afraid it would turn out like this now.

284

00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,040
that when I married you at the start,

289
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,740
it was indeed for Xuan Xuan.

290
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,390
But I didn't expect that, once I spent time with you,

291
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,530
I fell in love with you.

292
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,120
You didn't expect to love me?

293
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,550
So if you hadn't fallen in love with me, does it mean that I would have lost Xuan Xuan already?

294
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,770
Would you have already taken her away from me?!

295
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,980
I wouldn't have done it this way.

296
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,480
Why didn't you take me to court

297
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,530
and let me fight against your lawsuit fairly and squarely?

♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

348
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,520
♫ Forever safeguarded ♫

349
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,640
♫ Forever protected ♫

350
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:12,040
♫ The moment we fell in love ♫

351
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,790
♫ From this moment ♫

352
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:19,940
♫ I'm running toward you ♫

353
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,160
♫ Gone through the maze of time ♫

354
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,600
♫ You are still in my heart ♫

355
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,700
♫ We have too many encounters ♫

356
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,770
♫ And has always been in a hurry ♫

357
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:42,720
♫ I once forgotten the love we had ♫

358
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,180
♫ The moment you made my heart flutter ♫
