00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,010
We're taking group photos next.

176
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,950
Haoyu, because of work,

177
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,970
can't avoid contact with Tong Luoqi.

178
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,110
As for Tong Luoqi,

179
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,690
I'm guessing that she thinks only Haoyu can match her.

180
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,080
That's why she's so persistent.

181
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,890
But don't worry, Haoyu doesn't have any feelings for her.

182
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:18,420
I’m not worried. I’m just asking.

183
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,920
Haoyu.

184
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,280
Thank you for the promotion conference today. This is a little token of appreciation from us.

185
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,780
Wait a minute!

186
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,830
Here.

187
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,460
For me?

188
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,660
My wife's allergic to pollen.

189
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,040
So it's for you now.

190
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,620
He Qing.

191
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,190
These are the eternal flowers specially prepared for you.

192
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:46,100
Thank you so much for your hard work for Molin Group and me recently.

193
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,740
You've worked hard.

194

195
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,400
Thank you.

♫ You unconsciously occupying my heart ♫

197
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,840
Mr. and Mrs. Song, let's take a photo.

198
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,380
Okay.

199
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,130
If only all of this was real,

200
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,060
that would be nice then.

201
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,920
Job Number 1626 is at your service.

202
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,510
Hello, is this Miss Li? It’s my pleasure to serve you.

203
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,500
You have a package with us but the address is difficult to read.

204
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,810
It isn't clear where to send it to. Would you please

205
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,040
tell us the approximate location?

206
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,030
Yes, yes.

207
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,010
Great.

208
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,350
Okay, goodbye.

209
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,340
Who is it?

210
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,180
Delivery!

211
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,160
Coming!

212
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,170
Miss Li Xin, your package.

213
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,530
You tricked me in to giving you my address?

214
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,460
You went too far.

215
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,010
At least sign and accept the delivery first. It's very sweet.

216
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,680
I won't eat it. Leave.

217
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,390
Wait! I just missed you too much.

218
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,730
I missed you so much that I can't sleep at night.

219
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,540
Get lost!

220
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,460
Then I'm leaving for real. Don't miss me too much!

221
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,300
Anyway, I watch our video whenever I miss you!

222
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,290
- Video?
- Hao Jun, don't leave me.

223
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,140
Wait a minute!

224
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,210
Don't leave yet.

225
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,590
I knew you wouldn't want me to leave.

226
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,240
How is it? Not too greasy right?

227
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,250
Yes. You're so thoughtful.

228
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,580
You don't have to be that polite with me.

229
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:10,430
Since we're already acquaintances, then I'll be direct.

230
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,660
Let's each take a step back. Okay?

231
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,080
Not okay.

232
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,530
If you want to take a step back,

233
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:21,680
then I'll take a step forward. I won't let go of you.

234
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,820
Delete that video, okay?

235
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
We can still be good friends.

236
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,620
Those videos are all precious memories of mine.

237
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,570
Also...

238
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,010
I hope that...

239
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,250
we aren't just good friends.

240
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,950
- Take out your phone.
- No.

241
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,890
- Three, Two—
- One.

242
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,170
What?

243
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,300
Give it to me! Where did you hide it?

244
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,110
- It's not here.
- I don't believe it.

245
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,140
What are you doing?

246
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,280
I'm thinking

247
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,510
how you can still be this cute when you're angry.

248
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,480
Why do I like teasing you so much?

249
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,880
You! Get out!

250
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,220
Get out! Don't stay in my house any longer.

251
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,870
I can leave, but I still have something to tell you.

252
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,650
- I really do need to tell you...
- Get out and we can talk.

253
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,470
Li Xin, I really have something that I must tell you.

254
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,010
If you have something to say, say it here.

255
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,190
Look at this.

256
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,150
I saw it when I got here.

257
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,000
What is that?

258
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,430
You drew it?

259
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,440
Do you not watch the news?

260
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,520
This is a secret code for thieves.

261
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,050
Like this one, it means it's a single woman's home.

262
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,380
What about it? I'll call the police if they come.

263
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,900
Do you know about preventive measures?

264
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,940
A girl shouldn't be so careless.

265
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,420
You need to learn how to protect yourself.

266
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,240
I'll send this to the nearby police station.

267
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,040
That way I'll feel more at ease.

268
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,850
What are you doing?

269
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,490
This will let people with bad intentions know

270
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,310
that there's a man in your home to protect you.

271
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,790
I'm going now.

272
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,320
Bye bye.

273
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,900
Bye bye.

Mommy! I want to take you somewhere!

00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,550
Mommy, look!

277
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:27,770
Xuan Xuan still wants to go with Mommy for the mission.

278
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,020
Baby,

279
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,800
you didn't set all this up, right?

280
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,390
Uncle helped too.

281
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,660
Haoyu?

282
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,610
Uncle!

00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,230
Sile.

284
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,410
What are you doing all this for?

285
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,800
I have to put my part in teaching the kids too.

286
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,080
Let's go.

287
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,880
Come on! Come on!

288
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,350
Xuan Xuan, you're so pretty.

289
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,500
Be careful.

290
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,390
Gifted me eternal flowers, and then set up the stall.

291
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:15,440
There's no reason for him to put in extra effort in the acting.

292
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,020
It's on the tip of my tongue, why can't I say it out loud?

293
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,380
I've already gotten to this point, why am I scared now?

294
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,450
Could it be because the promotion conference went well?

295
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,020
I already bought the clothes and gave her the flowers.

296
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,860
Wasn't it just to apologize to her?

297

Qi Sile.

298
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,050
Mommy. Mommy.

299
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,150
Are you thirsty? Drink some water.

300
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,810
- Are you tired?
- I'm not.

301
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,660
Uncle, I also want to drink water.

302
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,880
Mommy, I don't want to buy that Transformer anymore.

303
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,980
Why?

304
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,810
Because earning money is hard.

305
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:02,900
So, Daddy, you must work really hard, right?

306
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,640
Thank you, Uncle.

307
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:16,250
When I have money, I will buy gifts for mommy, daddy, and little sister.

308
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,650
I want something delicious.

309
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,550
Xuan Xuan, are you tired today?

310
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:25,150
I'm not tired, but I want a hug.

311
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,110
Okay.

312
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,550
I also want a hug.

313
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,110
Come here. Hugs.

314
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,430
Here you go.

315
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,120
- Are you tired?
- No.

316
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,200
Xuan Xuan, you're doing so well today and so brave.

317
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,760
Uncle, you're brave too.

318
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,060
If you really are just acting,

319
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,910
why are you so kind to my daughter?

320
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,740
Song Haoyu,

321
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,280
which side is the real you?

322
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,050
Are you ticklish? Uncle is a little princess too.

323
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,770
Let me answer this call.

324
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,440
- Hi Mom.
 - I heard that you got married!

325
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,610
How did you find out?

326
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,990
Let me explain. I—

327
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,370
I'm done for.

328
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,120
Qi Sile.

329
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,920
Didn't you say that your parents are coming tomorrow?

330
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,820
Why aren't you asleep yet?

331
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,160
If you're worried that we'll get exposed tomorrow, don't worry about it.

332
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,510
My mission tomorrow is to make them feel at ease.

333
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,840
I know what I need to do.

334
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:56,120
You can only be this calm because you don't know them.

335
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,410
We already registered our marriage. It's a fact.

336
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,820
They're more problematic than you think.

337
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,560
If we can't get their approval, I won't be surprised

338
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,050
if they force us to get a divorce.

339
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,630
What?

340
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:26,230
Because of the matter between these two,

341
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,260
you must be tired from your journey.

342
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,110
It's what we should do.

343
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,330
Uncle, I heard from Sile that you like to drink tea.

344
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,050
I prepared some tea leaves for you.

345
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,620
I hope you'll like it.

346
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,610
You've been teaching for many years, so I prepared a fountain pen for you.

347
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,320
I hope you'll like it.

348
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,450
Thank you.

349
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,620
How thoughtful of you.

350
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,290
Of course.

351
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:08,150
A few days ago, I suddenly heard that Sile was married.

352
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:12,100
My dad and I were so shocked that we rushed over.

353
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,810
After meeting you today, we feel more relieved.

354
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,340
In-Laws, you don't have to worry about this.

355
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,920
Our Haoyu makes Sile the priority every day.

356
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,470
And Sile is excellent in every aspect.

357
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,090
It's Haoyu's blessing to be with Sile.

358
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,320
That can't be true, Senior Song.

359
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,900
I know her best.

360
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,410
Sile isn't good at cooking and has a bad temper.

361
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,270
Senior Song, you have to be more understanding of her in the future.

362
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,590
Mom, why do you talk about my shortcomings?

363
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,490
What's wrong?

364
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,500
Are you afraid that Haoyu will look down on you?

365
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,770
Auntie, how could I look down on Sile?

366
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:55,120
Sile is very lovely as she is. And she doesn't need to know how to cook.

367
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,120
It's fine as long as I can cook.

368
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,170
You sure know how to talk.

369
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,820
Then let me ask you something.

370
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,370
You and Sile haven't known each other long.

371
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,280
Why were you in such a rush to get married?

372
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:13,130
Actually, it was Grandpa who was rushing my marriage.

373
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,820
So I used this as an opportunity to propose to Sile.

374
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,460
Why did he tell them the truth?

375
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,480
But after spending some time with her, I found that Sile is a woman worth cherishing.

376
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,260
So I'm always unknowingly wanting to treat her well.

377
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,740
I slowly fell for her.

378
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,230
Which of these words are the truth?

379
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:38,490
These youngsters. You just fell for her?

380
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:42,180
Then how did you fall for her?

381
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,060
Mom, this is our relationship.

382
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,760
Why are you...

383
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,440
Auntie, actually, I'm not that sure myself.

384
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,690
From the first time I saw her,

385
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,120
I wanted to make her stay by my side.

386
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,690
I wanted to do anything to make her my wife.

387
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,910
Okay, all the dishes are here.

388
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,680
Let's all make a toast

389
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,000
to celebrate our two families becoming in-laws.

390
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,910
Okay, here.

391
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,940
When are Xiao Song's parents coming back?

392
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,810
Oh, about that.

393
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:26,560
My son and daughter-in-law have already passed away.

394
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,030
I raised Haoyu myself since he was young.

395
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:32,090
Sile, why didn't you mention it to us earlier?

396
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:34,180
Senior Song, don't mind me asking.

397
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,500
No worries. It's all in the past. Let's not talk about it anymore.

398
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,270
Here, cheers!

399
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,400
Mommy!

400
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,120
Chen Chen.

401
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,570
Uncle and Auntie,

402
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,540
this is my son.

403
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,420
I don't approve of your marriage.

404
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,510
[Please Be My Family]

405
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:25,040
