Daddy, Auntie picked up my pin.

- Let's check the surveillance camera.
- What?

181
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,810
Let security resolve this, so we can all save time.

This is my own stuff. Why do I need to stay here and waste time?

Today is my child's birthday. I don't want to make any issues.

If you keep making issues, I'll call the police.

00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,800
It's you.

355
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,060
It’s hand made by my mommy.

356
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,630
I hope you like it.

357
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,700
But I'm a boy.

358
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,860
It looks good like this.

359
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,960
My name is Song Xingchen. You can call me Chen Chen from now on.

360
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,780
Then you can call me Xuan Xuan.

361
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,700
Xuan Xuan.

362
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,840
Thank you, Xuan Xuan.

363
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,260
Hi Uncle.

364
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,320
Children, please sit down. Our activity is about to start.

365
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,900
Today, we would like our parents based on the theme “family and warmth”

366
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,400
to paint a poster with your child.

367
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:11,540
Daddy, you can draw a golden sun over there.

368
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,110
It needs to be consistent.

369
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,210
Why don't we draw a heart?

370
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,260
- Do you like the color red?
- Yes.

371
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,340
Okay, let's start coloring.

372
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:33,150
Oh no. It's bad.

373
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,540
Oh my.

374
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,190
What's the dark drawing supposed to be?

375
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,800
This one looks really good.

376
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,690
What is that?

377
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,990
Isn't the topic love and warmth?

378
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,900
This one seems to have followed the wrong topic.

379
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,240
The traditional Chinese style is minimalistic and confident. It gives the theme more depth.

380
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,190
You recognize it.

381
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,710
Yours?

382
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,390
Yes.

383
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,660
I see.

384
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,960
It truly is deep.

385
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,880
Which one is yours?

386
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,800
Listen up everyone! The drawing from Qi Zixuan and her mother, Qi Sile,

387
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,980
gets the red flower for this event.

388
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,830
Let's give them a round of applause!

389
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,720
Come, I'll put it on for you.

390
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,590
Let me put this on for you.

391
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,930
Look at this child's painting.

392
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,720
Don't you know that five-year-olds should be cultivating

393
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
their ability to recognize different colors?

394
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,980
You should read more parenting books.

395
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,920
If you don't have any, I can lend you one.

396
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,300
That's okay. Since you have so much experience with parenting,

397
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,990
why don't we find some time to talk?

398
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:37,820
No, thanks. Get an estimate of the car damages and I'll pay you back.

399
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,680
It's okay. It must be fate

400
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,780
that our children have the same birthday and are in the same class.

401
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,390
Forget about what happened with the car.

402
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,670
Why does he change his mind at the drop of a dime?

403
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,080
Xuan Xuan.

404
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,490
Mommy, look at this red flower.

405
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,360
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

406
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,960
Is something wrong?

407
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,690
Let's draw an even better one next time

408
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,410
- and get another red flower, okay?
- Okay.

409
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:19,300
Daddy, Xuan Xuan's mommy is so great. I want one, too.

410
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,980
[Vintage | Toys | Drinks]

411
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,360
Take a look.

412
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,790
We got a red flower on our first day at kindergarten.

413
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,160
There's no doubt that our Xuan Xuan is the best.

414
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,280
But of course!

415
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,550
[Dear Parent, Siqiao International Kindergarten is reminding you to pay the advanced payment of ¥41,679 in tuition and misc fees to our financial office by the 8th of this month...]

416
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,130
What is it?

417
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,650
I told you this before.

418
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,950
Siqiao's tuition is expensive.

419
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:57,140
She's attending no matter how expensive it is. I looked it up.

420
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:01,690
Only Siqiao will make separate meals for sick kids.

421
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,420
I have some extra money. I'll transfer it to you.

422
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,920
No. I still haven't paid you back for what you lent me before.

423
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,650
- We don't have to—
- Don't worry.

424
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,310
I just got a big order from Molin.

425
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:18,220
As long as we revise the plan to their satisfaction, I'll get a commission deposit.

426
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,720
It's a lot of money. I won't have a problem paying the tuition.

427
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,560
Besides, there's still over a year before Xuan Xuan's surgery.

428
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,310
I'll work even harder. There shouldn't be a problem.

429
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,580
I know. You're the best.

430
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,210
But don't try to do everything yourself.

431
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,780
If you need anything, let me know.

432
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,620
I got it.

433
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,450
Hello? Is this Molin's planning department?

434
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,300
Yes, who are you looking for?

435
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,190
Hi, I'm Qi Sile from Landi Advertising Agency.

436
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,090
I proposed a plan for your company's launch event.

437
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,110
We already signed the contracts.

438
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,020
- Landi? 
- Yes.

439
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,790
No one is willing to take over the work after the manager was fired. Don't call us anymore.

440
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,390
Hello?

441
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,490
What the heck?

442
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,030
Don't tell me it's because of…

443
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,000
I shouldn't have messed with him. Now my project is in shambles, too.

444
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,520
Go! Go! Don't ruin our day!

445
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,160
- How am I ruining your day?
- You're not leaving?!
- Go, go, go.

446
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,700
Hurry! Go! Go!

447
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,400
Don't ruin our day!

448
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,670
Wait. Are you all right?

449
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,430
I'm okay. Thank you, Miss.

450
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:32,470
We have to be each other's witnesses! Don't let him bamboozle us!

451
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,690
How am I trying to bamboozle you?

452
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:38,360
Aunties, let's talk this out. Don't act on impulse.

453
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,340
We're promoting a nationwide anti-fraud campaign.

454
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,490
28-year-old male. Never married, with one son.

455
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,390
Graduated with a post-graduate degree from London Business School.

456
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,510
1.84 meters tall, has an annual salary of one million, owns a home and a car.

457
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,750
- He seems great.
- Of course.

458
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,840
Keep reading.

459
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,570
Requirements: Female,

460
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,750
No education or impressive family background.

461
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,720
Has been married.

462
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,950
And also has a child.

463
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,710
This...

464
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,130
He has such qualifications and those are his requirements?

465
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,330
There's no way there's nothing wrong with him!

466
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,920
What do you know? You know nothing.

467
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,270
He has such qualifications and those are his requirements?!

468
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,580
There's no way!

469
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:25,370
Auntie, information for these blind dates are like product advertisements.

470
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,450
They're allowed to make appropriate exaggerations. It doesn't mean it's a lie.

471
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,670
You're all my elders.

472
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:35,450
I'm sure you all share the same mindset of wanting your children to find happiness.

473
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,390
Grandpa didn't do anything wrong. He just has his own struggles.

474
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,700
So it isn't strange that the happiness his grandson is seeking

475
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,310
- is different from what you're looking for.
- That's true.

476
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,980
You're not as sharp as she is!

477
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,590
She's right.

478
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:54,110
He shares the same mindset as us. I'll stand by that.

479
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:58,170
I don't know if his mindset is the same, but I think you're great.

480
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:01,430
Are you married? My son is 29 years old.

481
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,020
A handsome gentleman!

482
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,310
My son is a CEO!

483
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,700
- He's very tall!
- My son is 1.9 meters!

484
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,610
My son is great, too!

485
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,230
I have a five-year-old child.

486
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:20,250
Sile, it's a nice name.

487
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,540
Thank you.

488
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,420
Grandpa, do you often come here to play chess?

489
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,320
I come here often.

490
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,660
Did you say your child is five years old?

491
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,490
Yes, she's a girl.

492
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,370
I see.

493
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:36,970
When did you get married?

494
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,290
I...

495
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,110
I'm raising my child alone.

496
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,290
Raising your child alone...

497
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,360
If you're single, why don't you—

498
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,580
I'm sorry. I need to take this call.

499
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,110
Qi Sile! Come back to the office immediately!

500
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,640
You might as well get us some new clients with your spare time!

501
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,260
I've been on this project for Molin for so long.

502
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,490
How can we give up just like that?

503
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,290
Give me some more time. I'll figure it out.

504
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,860
Fine, fine. Do it quickly!

505
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,960
What's wrong? Hit an obstacle at work?

506
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,860
That's right.

507
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,130
I remember I have a chess friend who works for Molin.

508
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,150
Do you want me to talk to them to see if they can help?

509
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:25,470
I don't want to trouble you, Grandpa. I can deal with my work stuff myself.

510
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,280
You don't believe me?

511
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,930
I can definitely help you. Just wait.

512
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,720
Here. Tomorrow come to this place.

513
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,090
Look for He Qing. This is his phone number.

514
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,210
- Haoyu.
- Grandpa?

515
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,900
Why are you here?

516
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,250
It's so hot.

517
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,800
Have He Qing pick you up next time you come. Stop taking the bus here.

518
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,700
No need.

519
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,990
You're so happy. What happened?

520
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,800
Haoyu.

521
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,070
How are the preparations for the anniversary celebration tomorrow?

522
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,840
It's going great.

523
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,960
Get there earlier tomorrow and have He Qing bring Chen Chen too.

524
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,660
Why bring Chen Chen?

525
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,430
Bring Chen Chen to meet...

526
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,420
To meet some new people. That's all.

527
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,500
Grandpa. You have something else planned, don't you?

528
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:32,640
You got me. I found a girl according to your requirements.

529
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,760
- She's really pretty, too.
- I don't need to get married.

530
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,570
If you want to keep going against me, you...

531
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,320
You can't blame me for getting mean!

532
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,610
It's settled, then. I'm off!

533
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,640
Senior Chairman.

534
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,520
- Pick up Chen Chen tomorrow.
- Okay.

535
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:55,300
President Song, we found out what happened with the brooch.

536
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,850
- What did you find?
- Indeed, two was made.

537
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,410
The inspiration for the design comes from the Gemini in Greek Mythology.

538
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,450
The message behind it is to give blessings to a newborn baby.

539
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,180
[Please be My Family]

540
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:31,110
♫ I thought I missed the rainbow ♫

541
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:37,990

♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

548
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:15,030
♫ The sun rises and sets in all four seasons ♫

549
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:21,460
♫ It can't be compared to a minute of our embrace ♫

550
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,190
♫ From this moment ♫

551
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,600
♫ I want to embrace all the possibilities ♫

552
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,190
♫ An ode to time ♫

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,690
♫ The moment we fell in love ♫

557
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,400
♫ From this moment ♫

558
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,540
♫ I'm running toward you ♫

559
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,880
♫ Gone through the maze of time ♫

560
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:05,070
♫ You are still in my heart ♫

561
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,270
♫ We have too many encounters ♫

562
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,510
♫ And has always been in a hurry ♫

563
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:20,390

00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:26,440
♫ The moment you made my heart flutter ♫
