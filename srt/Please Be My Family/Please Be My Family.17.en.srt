00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,620
President Song will come right over after handling some work.

174
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,870
Let's go, Xiao Chen.

175
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,500
Brother. Brother, why aren't you playing with me?

176
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,400
Great-Grandpa, Brother is acting strange.

177
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,230
What's the matter?

178
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,630
Chen Chen, what's the matter? Tell me.

179
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:52,300
Great-Grandpa, I made a mistake. I'm feeling regretful.

180
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,450
You made a mistake? Come, stand up.

181
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,090
Tell me, what you did wrong.

182
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,360
It's not convenient to talk about it here.

183
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,420
It's not convenient?

184
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,570
Let's go. We'll talk in the courtyard. Come on.

185
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,360
It's all right.

186
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,800
At that time, you were only two years old.

187
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,290
You were still young, it's all right if you called her that.

188
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,260
But I still feel

189
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,420
- that I betrayed mommy.
- Oh my.

190
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,700
Good boy, Chen Chen.

191
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,880
This isn't betrayal.

192
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,830
If you feel bad about it inside,

193
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,530
just be nicer to mommy to make it up.

194
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,610
Yeah! I'll be even nicer to mommy.

195
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,930
That's right. You're really good.

196
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,080
Another thing, Chen Chen.

197
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,010
That auntie who went to see you at the kindergarten today,

198
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,910
did she say anything else?

199
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,090
She only said her name is something Jin something Chen.

200
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,810
She also said I look a lot like daddy.

201
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,580
And then I shooed her away.

202
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,920
Let's do this, Chen Chen.

203
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,040
Turn this incident into a little secret between you and me.

204
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,760
Don't tell mommy, daddy, and your sister.

205
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,010
If she goes to see you at the kindergarten again,

206
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,440
just tell me. I will go find her.

207
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,480
Okay, good!

208
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,640
Chen Chen is so good.

209
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,690
Sit properly.

210
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,390
Hello, I'm Song Haoyu.

211
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,360
Hello, I'm Jin Xichen.

212
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,700
Hello, President Song. I'm Jin Xichen's manager, A'Lai.

213
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,400
- Hello.
- Let's all sit down.

214
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,620
Let's start then.

215
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,520
- Okay.
- He Qing?

216
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,120
First, in the fourth point of the third clause of the contract, regarding the responsibilities and obligations of both parties,

217
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,500
we don't think Miss Jin Xichen needs to appear in person

218
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,120
at the Maolin Mall during its anniversary celebration and major holiday events.

219
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,430
Excuse me, but may I ask a simple question?

220
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,780
Isn't Xiao Chen's appearance meant to increase exposure for Maolin

221
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,760
- and attract more consumer traffic?
- Yes.

222
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,940
But at the same time, there are more risks.

223
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,740
When Miss Jin comes to our mall for image ambassador activities,

224
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,370
we need to prepare a lot of security personnel

225
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,420
and also report it to the relevant authorities in advance.

226
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,600
Therefore, after weighing the pros and cons, I still think

227
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,560
it's more appropriate to follow safer measures.

228
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,920
All right. We'll do as you say.

229
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,320
Safety first.

230
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,010
There shouldn't be any problems with the rest, right?

231
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:49,190
There will be quite a lot of unnecessary steps at the contract signing ceremony, so they'll be removed.

232
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,940
Such as?

233
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,090
It's not necessary to cut the cake and open the champagne.

234
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,570
It's too much like entertainment, not serious.

235
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:02,020
Didn't you always say that ceremonial formalities at times is important?

236
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,940
The reason that Molin has invited Miss Jin Xichen to come

237
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,730
is because we've already abandoned a flashy exterior that has no substance.

238
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,890
We pay more attention to inner qualities now.

239
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,410
Thank you for your recognition.

240
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,890
Then... let's keep everything simple.

241
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,170
President Song?

242
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,150
I have no more questions.

243
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,030
Then, Miss Jin, please take another look.

244
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,940
Is there anything else to change or improve in the contract?

245
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,890
I have no more questions regarding the contract.

246
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,490
And then, it's the script for the Q and A with the reporters.

247
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,270
I think it needs some adjustment.

248
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,150
What do you think isn't suitable?

249
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,430
The fans care about my personal life

250
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,180
even more than things like

251
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,430
what I felt after winning the championship.

252
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,820
These kinds of official topics,

253
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,730
I think they should be combined.

254
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,640
How do you think they should be combined then?

255
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,210
For example,

256
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,980
what was the motivation

257
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,100
that helped me win the championship?

258
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,090
Don't worry about that. I'll communicate in advance with the media.

259
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,300
I have no more questions, then.

260
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,310
And then, can I talk alone with President Song for a bit?

261
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,630
Sorry. The signing ceremony is about to begin.

262
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,730
There are still many matters to prepare for.

263
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,510
So... excuse me.

264
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,740
Sile!

265
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,430
I just ran into Miss Yu when I came out of the restroom.

266
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,910
She's here? Why didn't the store manager mention it?

267
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,720
Qi Sile!

268
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,840
- Miss Yu.
- Miss Yu.

269
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,240
It doesn't concern you all. I'm here to see her.

270
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,620
Qi Sile, what's wrong with you?

271
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,770
Are you brainless?

272
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,640
That piece of jewelry you designed for me that time,

273
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,540
is really popular among my friends.

274
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,020
Isn't this a good thing? Why are you scolding me?

275
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,900
Tell me, you have a designer's brain,

276
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,160
why must you work in sales here?

277
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,970
It just so happens that I have a friend who has returned from abroad and is opening a studio.

278
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,540
- You should go there.
- What?

279
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,400
I'll be open with you then. I came here today

280
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,330
to dig up talent.

281
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,380
Whose talent? Mine?

282
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,550
That's right. Luoqi, wait a moment there.

283
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,880
If you go to my friend's place to be an assistant to the designer,

284
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,970
you won't lose out, right?

285
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,320
Thank you for your recognition.

286
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,840
I'll... have to give it serious consideration.

287
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,910
Consideration?

288
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,720
Consider what?

289
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,280
So sorry, Manman.

290
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,620
Qi Sile has already been hired by Fanyi Jewelry as an official designer.

291
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,900
When did this happen?

292
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,280
Did you know about it?

293
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,270
I... just found out...

294
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,890
Not to criticize you, President Tong,

295
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,470
but isn't your offer given out too randomly?

296
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:26,720
That's right. The random offer I give to be a designer is still better than being an assistant to a designer.

297
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,190
Isn't that right, Designer Qi?

298
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,560
Then... I....

299
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,340
So not fun.

300
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,510
- There's a customer here. I'd better go greet them.
- Wait.

301
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,820
I never go back on my promise.

302
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,360
I'll tell the design department to get ready and give you an office.

303
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,230
Wait to hear from me.

304
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,010
Sile!

305
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,290
This is awesome!

306
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,870
Congratulations on your promotion!

307
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,570
- Designer Qi!
- Thanks...

308
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,750
♫ You were too honest when we first met♫

309
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,030
♫  You told me you're not handsome ♫

310
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,390
♫ But you give me time to understand you better ♫

311
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,420
♫ You're like color suddenly appearing in the sky  ♫

312
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:57,590
♫ Whoever arranged this, my future is no longer empty ♫

313
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,850
Wow!

314
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,750
How are you now?

315
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,580
I've missed you.

316
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,620
Are you crazy?

317
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,680
I want to drink water.

318
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,620
Get over there.

319
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,150
Is it hot?

320
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,320
Don't pretend.

321
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,390
I know you still care about me.

322
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,830
Eat a little more... to block your mouth.

323
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,070
Yummy.

324
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,580
You personally cooked porridge for me

325
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,170
and you still pretend that you don't care.

326
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,290
I'm only concerned that you might die in the hotel

327
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,170
and affect their business.

328
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,050
If I really die of an illness here,

329
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:22,050
no one will discover me for a while anyway.

330
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,380
Why are you living here? Where are your parents?

331
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,180
Don't they care about you?

332
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,270
My parents got divorced when I was really young.

333
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,420
Afterward, they each formed another family

334
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,480
and had other children.

335
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,180
I became an extra.

336
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,280
It was awkward going with either side, so I decided to live on my own.

337
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,170
It's quite carefree.

338
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,090
Don't you stay in contact at all?

339
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,260
Or even eat a meal together occasionally?

340
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,980
Yes, we've eaten together.

341
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,000
But, every time we ate together,

342
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I would recall my childhood.

343
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,500
When I was little, they also fought.

344
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,980
But... when the family was together,

345
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,990
we were still quite happy.

346
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,690
Unlike now,

347
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,180
they're so formal and courteous when they see me.

348
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,690
But, for you, they're still able

349
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,620
to sit down together to eat a meal together.

350
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,600
It means they want to make it up to you.

351
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,120
They still care about you a lot.

352
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:47,250
Yes, that's why he transferred all his shares in Molin to me.

353
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,420
My life is quite easy and carefree right now.

354
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,280
I also have my own home.

355
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,210
You think of this place... as home?

356
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,640
Don't you feel lonely living here by yourself?

357
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,490
Then move in with me.

358
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,800
You want to die?

359
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,920
Actually, you don't need to pity me.

360
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,720
I'm used to being by myself.

361
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,190
To me,

362
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:14,930
home is where there's a bed to sleep on.

363
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,950
I'm not sentimental.

364
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,760
Then, we're quite different in our understanding of it.

365
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,880
I feel that a home is more than just a bed or a house.

366
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,980
It's a kitchen with something cooking on the stove.

367
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,410
When you're sick, there's someone there to be with you.

368
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,860
When you're tired, there's someone there to hold you.

369
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,030
A place where family is around you,

370
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,030
that's home.

371
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,020
Li Xin, I want a family, too.

372
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,510
- You...
- What can I do so that you'll become my family?

373
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,570
Let's get married.

374
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,710
Are you so feverish that you've lost your mind?

375
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,950
I-I scared you?

376
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,840
Why are you talking about marriage?

377
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,340
We don't have to get married. Let's just date.

378
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,850
Not get married?

379
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:11,190
Then this will be a romance that's fated to end badly. Sooner or later we'll break up.

380
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,440
That's not necessarily so. As long as two people are in love,

381
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,790
it's fine whether they get married or not.

382
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,510
Is this what you really think?

383
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,170
Yeah.

384
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,740
Indeed...

385
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,440
how a scumbag thinks.

386
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,280
But, I...

387
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,370
Why is it, with you, whatever I say is always wrong?

388
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,740
What do you want me to say then?

389
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,110
How about this?

390
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:45,150
From now on, you teach me, I'll learn.

391
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,270
You already know...

392
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,890
I just want to be with you.

393
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,700
This little move from you...

394
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,970
really hurts me.

395
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,330
Hao Jun...

396
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,610
I... am still waiting for an answer.

397
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,520
So...

398
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,850
I'm sorry.

399
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,450
Answer?

400
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,360
I can give you one too.

401
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,810
[Please Be My Family]

402
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,240
♫ I thought I missed the rainbow ♫

403
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,210
♫ It turns out, it's been transferred to your eyes ♫

404
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:17,490
♫ The commotion stirs my memory like tidal waves ♫

405
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:26,310
♫ Not surprising the light only meet in the dark ♫

406
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,200
♫ From this moment ♫

407
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,700
♫ I want to sing softly about us ♫

408
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,190
♫ Going to fill my world with wonderful dreams ♫

409
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:41,620
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

410
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:48,230
♫ The sun rises and sets in all four seasons ♫

411
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:54,640
♫ It can't be compare to a minute of our embrace ♫

412
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,410
♫ From this moment ♫

413
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,770
♫ I want to embrace all the possibilities ♫

414
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,420
♫ An ode to time ♫

415
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:10,570
♫ I bet it's all in your eyes ♫

416
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,300
♫ Forever safeguarded ♫

417
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,430
♫ Forever protected ♫

418
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:22,810
♫ The moment we fell in love ♫

419
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,630
♫ From this moment ♫

420
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:30,730
♫ I'm running toward you ♫

421
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,010
♫ Gone through the maze of time ♫

422
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:38,120
♫ You are still in my heart ♫

423
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,570
♫ We have too many encounters ♫

424
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,710
♫ And has always been in a hurry ♫

425
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:53,580
♫ I once forgotten the love we had ♫

426
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:59,540
♫ The moment you made my heart flutter ♫
