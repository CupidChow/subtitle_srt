13
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,570
Sir,

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,939
is your leg okay?

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,899
What did the doctor say?

16
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,290
Can you still stand on it?

17
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,930
It's this leg.

18
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,779
Sir,

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,019
is this leg okay?

20
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,330
What did the doctor say?

21
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,010
Don't worry.

22
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,099
If the day comes,

23
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,499
I'll light incense at your memorial.

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,890
Watch your mouth.

25
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,770
Count me in too.

26
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,090
Cut it out. Let's get down to business.

27
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,019
Sir,

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,400
I finished looking into what you asked.

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,470
Something's definitely fishy about
the guy in the wheelchair who attacked you.

30
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,499
He was on a medical team.

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,370
The person in charge of that team

32
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,450
Mu Jie's assistant.

33
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,530
Vice Director Jiang.

34
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,210
I noticed you've been working overtime.

35
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,650
What's going on?

36
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,389
New project keeping you busy?

37
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,440
Vice Director Jiang,
are you talking to me?

38
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,879
That last project

39
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,530
needed some wrap-up,

40
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,090
so I pulled some overtime.

41
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,650
Take care of yourself.

42
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,970
I've been pushing myself
too hard lately.

43
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,610
I've been feeling kind of off.

44
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,699
Then,

45
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,410
would you like me to take a look at you?

46
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,170
No, that wouldn't be appropriate.

47
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,930
Why don't you come by my office

48
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,250
after work?

49
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,579
Of course.

50
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,370
I'll swing by tonight.

51
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,890
I'm almost there.

52
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,619
Everyone in the office

53
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,219
is gone

54
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,619
except Mu Jie's assistant.

55
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,739
Security does rounds once every hour.

56
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,170
You've got 45 minutes.

57
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,939
Don't mess this up, rookie.

58
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,819
Mr. Instructor, can you
keep that assistant distracted?

59
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,570
No need to worry about me.

60
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,739
Just do your part.

61
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,259
I don't want to,

62
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,170
but whether you succeed

63
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,570
determines if my mission works.

64
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,619
Need me to teach you

65
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,939
how to talk to women?

66
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,650
Save it.

67
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,699
If I can handle you,

68
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,259
handling her should be easy.

69
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,530
Just don't let her handle you instead.

70
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,530
Nobody alive

71
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,970
could handle me.

72
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,930
Hello?

73
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,490
Cat got your tongue?

74
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,170
Shut up.

75
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,650
Vice Director Jiang.

76
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,930
What did you say?

77
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,819
Your heart's

78
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,530
racing.

79
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,379
Let's give you

80
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,130
a little checkup.

81
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,930
Zhu Li,

82
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,690
how much longer

83
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,890
will this checkup take?

84
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,170
Jiang Zhen?

85
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,670
What's going on over there?

86
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,339
Uh,

87
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,770
Vice Director Bai

88
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,290
might be coming back soon.

89
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,410
I locked the door.

90
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,530
Ignore him.

91
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,610
I'm feeling dizzy.

92
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,290
I'll just take a short nap.

93
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,539
That's all it takes
to knock you out now?

94
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,010
I'm no worse than you.

95
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,370
All right.

96
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,330
Then let's see

97
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,250
how tough you really are.

98
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,450
I found a false bottom in this drawer.

99
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,619
Nothing inside.

100
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,530
Look somewhere else then.

101
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,650
Is it

102
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,770
this spot

103
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,050
or this one?

104
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,850
My shoulder hurts.

105
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,530
Massage it for me.

106
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,570
Sure thing.

107
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,650
Massage counts

108
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,250
as therapy too.

109
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,619
How much longer until you're done?

110
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,899
Almost there.

111
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,570
Can't hold out any longer?

112
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,930
Fine, I'm coming over.

113
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,290
So I made you impatient,
Vice Director Jiang.

114
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,579
Vice Director Jiang,

115
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,770
I've admired you for quite a while.

116
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,570
Just kept it to myself

117
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,370
because of Ms. Mu.

118
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,570
I can't stand Mr. Bai.

119
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,650
He struts around

120
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,170
like everyone's supposed
to fall for him.

121
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,770
Jiang Zhen, what is she talking about?
Who is she calling a show-off?

122
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,530
Make her explain herself!

123
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,450
You're my type.

124
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,170
I like your restraint.

125
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,850
Makes me want

126
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,850
to break it.

127
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,499
What's she up to?

128
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,219
Jiang Zhen, you only got close to Mu Jie
to infiltrate Amethyst Group.

129
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,459
That was a last resort.

130
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,179
Don't throw yourself away again

131
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,770
over some unreliable lead!

132
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,360
Save your words.

133
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,970
Fuzzy...

134
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,890
handcuffs?

135
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,850
That's it?

136
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,890
I don't buy it.

137
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,970
Bai Fan!

138
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,200
Enough!

139
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,699
Let me see what other toys you've got.

140
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,229
- Bai Fan.
- Looks like I missed the fun.

141
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,339
Bai Fan, be serious!

142
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,549
In that short time,

143
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,989
I missed quite a scene.

144
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,919
Step aside.

145
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,570
Excuse me. Let me see.

146
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,290
Ten gigs of data?

147
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,899
Why so much?

148
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:50,050
(Files)

149
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,890
Even though they all
joined the medical team,

150
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,419
the team itself

151
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,290
didn't break any rules.

152
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,890
We went through all that for nothing.

153
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,019
Why not?

154
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,810
Third Young Master, please calm down.

155
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,610
Jiang Zhen.

156
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,299
- What's wrong?
- Fine, spill it.

157
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,810
Explain it to me.

158
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,299
Why can't I get

159
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,739
on the Morning Star Project?

160
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,819
Third Young Master,

161
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,419
that was Ms. Mu's call.

162
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,090
I just follow orders.

163
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,139
If you're in charge of it,

164
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,139
just put my name

165
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,490
on it too.

166
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,330
I don't have the authority.

167
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,779
But you said you follow orders?

168
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,619
I want you to do it now.

169
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,849
Put my name on it!

170
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,699
Third Young Master,

171
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,410
for the last time,

172
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,090
it was Ms. Mu's decision.

173
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,019
If you have a problem,

174
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,890
take it up with her.

175
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,330
Who does she think she is?

176
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,730
Once I'm back on my feet,
you'll be the first I fire.

177
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,859
Third Young Master,

178
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,330
keeping busy?

179
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,299
Third Young Master,

180
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,090
you're hardly
around the company these days.

181
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,850
What do you want?

182
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,970
We're just checking in on you.

183
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,250
Back still giving you trouble?

184
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,899
Look at Vice Director Jiang.

185
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,059
His leg's already good to go.

186
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,010
Want me to connect you with his doctor?

187
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,539
- No thanks.
- All right.

188
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,690
I'll be back on my feet soon.

189
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,019
I heard Zhu Li signed you up

190
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,730
for some Morning Star Project.

191
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,059
How do you know that?

192
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,250
What's this Morning Star Project anyway?

193
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,920
It's nothing for regular people like you.

194
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,859
Don't poke your nose
into something you shouldn't.

195
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:14,250
Just curious.

196
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,459
Then go ask your sister-in-law.

197
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,170
She knows more than I do.

198
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,930
Why her?

199
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,610
You're not scared to say it, are you?

200
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,459
Forget it.

201
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,339
Trying to rattle me won't work.

202
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,210
I'd never tell.

203
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,979
And if you push me,

204
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,179
I'll make

205
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,930
all of you regret it!

206
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,370
Get out of my face.

207
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,819
I think I've seen

208
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,810
that scar before somewhere.
