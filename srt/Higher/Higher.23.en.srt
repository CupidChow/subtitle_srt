00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,010
You should be content.

191
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,979
If you've got time, think about

192
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,339
how you'll host me

193
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,770
when I'm here again.

194
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,970
Stop bragging already.

195
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,810
Gentlemen.

196
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,979
From here on,

197
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,210
I have a more important mission for you.

198
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,130
- Yes.
- Yes.

- Hi.

201
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,779
- I'm here to apply for the job.
- Sure, give that to me.

202
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,999
- I'm telling you, you've got to get rid of
- Stop nagging,

203
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:11,570
- that bad habit of yours.
- can you? You're like an old nag.

204
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,810
Enough.

What are you looking at? Let's go.

207
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,450
Nothing.

208
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,330
It's nothing. Let's go.
