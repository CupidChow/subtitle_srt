(Bai.)

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,200
(The crown daisy
is good for your health.)

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,640
(Why aren't you eating?)

16
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,430
Bai?

17
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,590
I'm allergic to crown daisy, Xiaotong.

18
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,000
Who's Xiaotong?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,280
Yeah, I've never heard you mention her.

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,120
Who's Xiaotong?

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,560
Bai.

22
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,480
Just call me Ya.

23
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,790
Jiang Zhen.

24
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,480
Do you ever feel

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,950
that something's wrong
about this world?

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,640
What's wrong about it?

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,790
I don't know either.

28
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,870
It just feels strange.

29
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,870
As if it has something to do with Ya.

30
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,640
But I can't remember anything.

31
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,000
That's enough.

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,640
You're the one acting strange.

33
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,920
What could be wrong with Ya?

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,960
Stop overthinking.

35
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,840
Relax.

36
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,120
Don't be paranoid.

37
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,310
Bai.

38
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,750
You don't

39
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,080
look too good.

40
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,910
Let me take you home.

41
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,520
I'm fine.

42
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,630
But I really think

43
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,800
you don't look well.

44
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,310
Come on.

45
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,520
I'll get you home.

46
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,280
It's okay. I'm a grown man.

47
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,190
I can't let you escort me,

48
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,030
right?

49
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,310
Let's go.

50
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,270
Ya...

51
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,520
Does it look nice?

52
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
Yes.

53
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,560
I like it too.

54
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,840
Even though my brother
and I are half-siblings,

55
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,470
we're still brother and sister.

56
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,520
I'll take good care of you.

57
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,920
Ya.

58
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,750
Have you seen Bai?

59
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,030
No.

60
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,960
Ms. Mu.

61
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,160
Have you seen Bai Fan?

62
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,960
No idea.

63
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
I don't know.

64
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,240
Bai Fan often causes trouble out there.

65
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,510
I'm worried about him,

66
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,830
so I have to find him now.

67
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,230
Why?

68
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,360
You can't go home without me?

69
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,390
Don't joke around.

70
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,560
I have something serious to tell you.

71
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,830
Do you remember
you mentioned Xiaotong's name

72
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,560
during dinner?

73
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,680
Who's Xiaotong?

74
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,750
I don't know her.

75
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,950
What's with you lately?

76
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,870
Well, are you imagining things

77
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,950
because you haven't had enough rest?

78
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,430
Seriously, you really don't remember

79
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,070
Xiaotong?

80
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,190
You make it sound like
there's something between me and her.

81
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,160
The only one in my heart is Ya.

82
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,560
Does it look nice?

83
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,270
Yes.

84
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,430
You too feel something's off,

85
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,310
don't you?

86
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,240
This world is fake.

87
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,510
Everything is fake.

88
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,680
Take me away, please.

89
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,310
Did you do something to me?

90
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,000
Zhen.

91
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,510
You said you'd help me.

92
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,310
So you have to help me.

93
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,040
When did I ever say that?

94
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,120
What are you talking about?

95
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,480
You have feelings for me,

96
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,430
so you need to help me.

97
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,480
Let's run away together.

98
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,830
Let's leave this place.

99
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,070
Let's go somewhere far away from here.

100
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,360
Only you can save me now.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,040
I beg of you.

102
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,040
Let's run away from this world.

103
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,080
Please?

104
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,470
Run?

105
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,240
Do you know something?

106
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,750
I can't say it.

107
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,040
If I do so, I'll die.

108
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,120
If you don't say it,

109
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,510
how can I help you?

110
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,270
Sister-in-law.

111
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,000
What do you want to eat?

112
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,240
I'll order for you.

113
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,670
Let's go.

114
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,630
Have you lost your mind, Chen Jiachuan?

115
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,430
What did you just call me?

116
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,480
Jiang Zhen.

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,630
No.

118
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,190
You just called me Chen Jiachuan.

119
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,070
You must be hearing things.

120
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:50,771
You once said Ya was suspicious.

121
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,620
What did you mean by that?

122
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,840
When did I ever say

123
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,950
there was something wrong with Ya?

124
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,560
What's wrong with you?

125
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,040
Do you really remember nothing?

126
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,430
If you haven't been resting well lately,

127
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,920
then rest more.

128
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,750
Don't worry,

129
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,720
leave the company to me.

130
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,950
Tell me.

131
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,600
Why did we come to this company?

132
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,960
Well…

133
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,720
Also,

134
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,830
why did we steal

135
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,310
a disc with nothing on it?

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,360
Well, isn't it because…

137
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,830
And who exactly is Xiaotong?

138
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,720
Why did you blurt out her name

139
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,560
without a second thought?

140
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,160
Why was there a photo of a girl

141
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,680
under my couch?

142
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,070
Why does she feel familiar,

143
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,800
but I know nothing about her?

144
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,640
Bai Fan.

145
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,800
Who are we, really?

146
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,000
Bai Fan.

147
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,750
What are you doing down there?

148
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,600
Come up here.

149
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,270
Bai Fan.

150
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,310
Don't go up there.

151
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,960
Don't.

152
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,480
None of this is real.

153
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,320
Trust me.

154
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,950
Bai.

155
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,800
Why aren't you listening to me?

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,560
What on earth is going on here?

157
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,630
I often heard Xiaotong mention you.

158
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,670
And I've wanted to meet you since then.

159
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,480
Until that day you saved me.

160
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,670
That's when I wanted to make you mine.

161
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,510
Who is Xiaotong?

162
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,480
Who is Xiaotong?

163
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,710
Bai Fan.

164
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,550
Why won't you help me?

165
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,480
Why did you just watch

166
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,720
Nong Cangqin torture me?

167
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,720
Nong Cangqin?

168
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,630
What are you talking about?

169
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,790
I don't want to stay here.

170
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,480
Take me away, please.

171
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,040
Take me with you.

172
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,720
She often told me

173
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,600
that she had

174
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,000
two brothers who doted on her.

175
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,510
But that doesn't matter anymore.

176
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,910
You both belong to me now.

177
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,720
Fine.

178
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,870
Once we've dealt with this,

179
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,200
we'll come help you.

180
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,030
You never loved me from the start.

181
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,000
You were using me
from the very beginning.

182
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,480
You all have been using me.

183
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,240
You have never loved me!

184
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,260
Bai.

185
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,670
Both your disappointment and sadness

186
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,200
will go away soon.

187
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,440
You'll love me like you used to.

188
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,200
You,

189
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,240
me,

190
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,150
and Jiang Zhen.

191
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,440
We'll be the happiest family

192
