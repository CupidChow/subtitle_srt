=Episode 18=

13
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,469
I peeked at the documents
Mu Jie recently signed

14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,140
and found a huge sum of company funds
unaccounted for.

15
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,309
I probed the Technical Department director
for answers.

16
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,550
The Supercontrol No. 3 project
is still at a standstill.

17
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,789
Do you think the company is running

18
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,110
illegal experiments again?

19
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,379
Make a note of the accounts
where the money's being funneled.

20
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:17,860
I'll have Jiang Zhen look into it.

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,730
Okay.

22
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,770
Everything's in place, right?

23
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,730
Send him over later.

24
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,850
Okay.

25
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,930
Third Young Master,

26
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,179
you're looking sharp today.

27
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,419
Get out of my way.

28
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,740
Can't you see I'm busy?

29
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,130
Busy with what? I can help.

30
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,639
I've got things to do.

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,730
I'm going to...

32
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,399
I'm heading to the restroom.

33
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,099
Restroom?
You're a grown man acting shy now?

34
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,340
I'll push you there. Come on.

35
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,730
Okay, okay, I'll tell you the truth.

36
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,610
I'm joining the Morning Star Project.

37
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,670
Your sister-in-law agreed to that?

38
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,970
She didn't want to,

39
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,610
but I caught her red-handed.

40
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,179
Caught her?

41
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,090
That means the experiments
are going on inside the company.

42
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,620
How do you know?

43
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,770
Don't ask so many questions.

44
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,379
She made me swear to secrecy.

45
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,930
If I slip up,

46
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,800
she'll kick me out of the project.

47
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,370
I have to go.

48
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,530
If Nong Cangnan's telling the truth,

49
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,690
those experiments are happening

50
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,410
on company grounds.

51
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,339
I suspect that missing money is funding

52
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,250
the Morning Star Project.

53
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,730
So

54
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,699
where's the Supercontrol No. 3 chip now?

55
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,210
After a thorough check,

56
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,170
the only place it could be
is inside the company's R&D center.

57
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,859
Since Ya failed to unlock

58
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,979
the Supercontrol key last time,

59
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,930
no one's set foot in the lab.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,930
Which means tonight,
we're going to find out what's going on.

61
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,959
I'm coming with you.

62
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,930
No, it's too risky.

63
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,770
Did you forget?

64
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,370
Unlocking that chip needs my DNA.

65
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,690
No more second guessing.

66
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,470
We move tonight.

67
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,539
Ya and I will handle the break-in.

68
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,530
You stay here and provide tech support.

69
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,290
Stay safe.

70
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,210
Bai Fan,

71
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,720
if things go south,

72
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,059
pull out immediately.

73
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,690
Don't try to come rescue me or Ya.

74
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,340
That's not how I operate.

75
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,259
Do as I say.

76
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,450
You're more valuable here.

77
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,330
Bai, be careful.

78
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,690
No problem. Good luck.

79
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,130
The development
of Supercontrol No. 3 is complete.

80
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,850
We'll awaken soon.

81
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,890
Once our bodies recover,

82
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,690
this world will be forever changed.

83
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,450
Nong.

84
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,290
Nong.

85
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,130
For all the years we've spent together,

86
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,370
when you wake up,

87
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,330
will you let me go?

88
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,110
You're so adorably naive.

89
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,920
You're my wife.

90
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,330
Nong,

91
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,330
please let me go.

92
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,330
Every day is a battle.

93
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,210
When I try to sleep,

94
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,319
those...

95
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,850
disabled people come back for revenge.

96
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,280
I'm just so tired.

97
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,890
Please let me go.

98
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,810
I haven't had a good night's sleep
in over a year.

99
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,210
Honey, don't worry.

100
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,330
I'll be with you forever.

101
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,290
I'll protect you.

102
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,450
Nong,

103
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,819
I beg you.

104
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,450
Please let me go.

105
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,499
Please.

106
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,850
Just let me go.

107
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,210
I never want to come here again.

108
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,330
Don't be silly.

109
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,170
You'll always be with me.

110
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,379
Turn right at the entrance,

111
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,979
then head to the staff office.

112
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,739
Everything's normal.

113
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,970
Keep watching.

114
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,050
Jiang Zhen, do you feel something's off?

115
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,899
Notice anything unusual?

116
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,459
No, more like things

117
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,410
are going too smoothly.

118
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,790
Jiang, what's wrong?

119
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,330
Ya, should we rethink this?

120
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,330
We've already come this far.

121
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,690
What if it's a trap?

122
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,629
Jiang,

123
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,669
if the Supercontrol No. 3 chip
gets completed,

124
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,079
the fallout will be catastrophic.

125
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,299
We need that experimental data now

126
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,290
to stop the worst from happening.

127
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,179
There's no time to hesitate, Jiang.

128
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,890
We have to act now.

129
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,410
Jiang Zhen, what do you think?

130
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,459
Bai Fan, I'm willing to take the risk.

131
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,619
I've reviewed
all the surveillance footage.

132
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,730
Nothing unusual so far.

133
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,890
But I still don't recommend
pushing forward.

134
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,530
Bai Fan, be ready to pull out.

135
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,459
If we're not out

136
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,939
in five minutes,

137
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,259
no matter what,

138
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,090
- you retreat.
- Roger that.

139
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,330
Let's go.

140
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,770
Bai Fan, get out of there!

141
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,640
No one

142
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,210
is leaving.

143
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,290
Nong Qianya, you traitor!

144
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,490
And you too, Jiang Zhen.

145
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,610
You're both headed straight for prison.

146
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,170
Nong Cangnan,

147
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,610
do you understand what joining
the Morning Star Project means?

148
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,890
What it means?

149
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,899
This is what it means.

150
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,090
I can stand again.

151
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,450
Check the news.

152
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,419
A man who was paralyzed for years

153
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,459
suddenly regained the ability to walk

154
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,850
but then jumped off a building

155
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,490
to his death.

156
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,130
Before he died,

157
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,050
he was part of the Morning Star Project.

158
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,370
Once you join,

159
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,410
not only your body

160
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,010
but even your mind

161
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,330
is controlled by the chip.

162
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,330
Jie,

163
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,850
is she telling the truth?

164
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,210
Cangnan,

165
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,330
you're Nong's biological brother.

166
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,250
He'd never do that to you.

167
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,770
Then why did she let you
join the project?

168
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,770
Nong Cangnan,
you're Cangqin's real brother

169
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,570
and mine too.

170
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,890
The only one
you're not related to is her.

171
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,650
Cangnan,

172
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,010
we share blood.

173
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,570
No matter what happens,

174
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,770
I'll never abandon you.

175
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,899
That woman put you in the project

176
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,019
to control you

177
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,370
and use you against me.

178
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,330
If both of us go down,

179
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,170
who will control Amethyst Group?

180
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,019
How dare you, Mu Jie!

181
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,570
You tricked me!

182
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,930
Cangnan,
I'm not cut out to run the company.

183
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,209
I'll never challenge you

184
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,770
for the chairman position.

185
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,690
Amethyst Group belongs to you.

186
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,810
Qianya,

187
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,139
I have

188
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,810
underestimated you.

189
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,010
Detain Mu Jie!

190
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,290
Chen Jiachuan from Gale Training Camp.

191
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,979
It's time we had

192
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,450
a proper face-to-face talk.

193
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,810
Nong Cangqin.

194
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,210
Cangqin?

195
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,870
Cangnan.

196
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,990
Useless trash.

197
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,130
Ya,

198
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,450
you never thought I'd be standing
in front of you again, did you?

199
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,770
With Ya's DNA and Qin Bo's chip,

200
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,090
I've cracked Supercontrol No. 3.

201
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,890
Now none of you can threaten me.

202
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,090
Evil deeds always catch up.

203
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,890
I suggest you quit while you still can.

204
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,930
Quit?

205
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,930
I'm about to start a great new era.

206
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,050
Why would I quit?

207
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,010
Because you've erased humanity.

208
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,890
Humanity?

209
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,970
Bring him in.

210
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,770
