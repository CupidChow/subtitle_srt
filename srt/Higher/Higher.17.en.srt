=Episode 17=

13
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,890
Why should I turn myself in?

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,619
I didn't do any of this.

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,810
Mu Jie,

16
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,970
I never thought
you'd be this kind of person,

17
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,509
that you'd stoop so low.

18
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,700
And you?

19
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,269
You used my feelings

20
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,930
to get close to me.

21
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,860
So where do you

22
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,739
draw the line?

23
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,939
Answer me.

24
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,429
Do you even understand
what Supercontrol No. 3 really is?

25
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,090
That scar on the back of your neck.

26
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,709
Is it from using
the brain-computer interface

27
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,500
to control disabled people?

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,620
I don't know what you're talking about.

29
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,100
Mu Jie,

30
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,379
stop being stubborn.

31
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,299
I know you're not like this.

32
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,980
It's not too late

33
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,290
to turn back.

34
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,570
Then tell me,

35
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,700
how do I do that?

36
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,370
If you want to,

37
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,860
we can.

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,910
Then I want to go with you.

39
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,260
We can run away far from here,

40
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,500
together.

41
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,930
Running away won't fix anything.

42
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,650
Right now, you're the only one
who can save me.

43
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,420
I'm begging you.

44
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,420
Help me,

45
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,700
please?

46
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,250
Right.

47
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,020
You got close to me

48
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,370
just to investigate Amethyst Group.

49
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,109
All of you have been using me.

50
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,779
You never loved me!

51
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,930
You brought this on yourself.

52
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,090
I told you

53
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,780
it wasn't me.

54
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,739
Why won't you believe me?

55
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,650
How am I supposed to believe you?

56
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,460
Fine.

57
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,130
I'll prove it to you.

58
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,900
Bai,

59
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,620
how's the food?

60
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,130
You've improved a lot. It's delicious.

61
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,530
It is?

62
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,549
But you didn't touch your favorite

63
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,090
braised chicken with potatoes.

64
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,389
Oh,

65
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,580
it was too far away.

66
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,410
I'll eat it now.

67
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,690
Bai.

68
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,930
Is something on your mind?

69
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,109
No, I'm just eating.

70
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,460
I'm fine.

71
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,410
Are you thinking about Jiang Zhen?

72
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,019
It's late

73
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,900
and he still isn't back.

74
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,900
Where did he go?

75
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,580
He went to see Ms. Mu.

76
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,090
My sister-in-law?

77
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,580
Bai.

78
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,970
I've never known how to bring this up,

79
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,950
but I feel like I should warn you.

80
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,940
She's not as simple as she seems.

81
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,940
You need to be careful around her.

82
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,540
Careful?

83
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,290
Mu Jie, have you lost your mind?

84
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,300
Zhen,

85
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,490
did you ever love me?

86
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,780
Stop struggling.

87
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,850
Let me handle this.

88
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,940
Bai,

89
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,909
have you and Jiang Zhen

90
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,140
been investigating something lately?

91
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,380
It's okay if you don't want to tell me,

92
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,949
but whatever it is,

93
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,650
I'll help you.

94
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,220
Don't worry.

95
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,410
Jiang Zhen's strong and smart.

96
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,170
I'm sure he'll be fine.

97
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,090
Do you really want

98
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,050
to know

99
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,900
what Supercontrol No. 3 is?

100
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,610
It's a brain-computer interface chip.

101
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,260
We implant it in disabled people

102
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,429
so they can control their limbs

103
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,610
with their thoughts.

104
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,460
Your leg was crippled.

105
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,460
You should understand
better than anyone.

106
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,850
The body can heal,

107
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,780
but the brain is under
someone else's control.

108
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,970
You make them kill themselves,

109
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,580
kill others,

110
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,130
and

111
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,340
even send them to kill me.

112
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,170
That wasn't aimed at you.

113
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,020
Don't take it personally.

114
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,170
You come at me all high and mighty,

115
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,380
accusing me, but you conveniently ignore

116
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,989
how you used me,

117
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,390
lied to me,

118
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,530
and toyed with a woman's feelings.

119
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,300
Jiang Zhen,

120
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,780
what exactly am I to you?

121
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,810
I admit,

122
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,260
if I hurt you, I'm sorry.

123
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,020
But you still have to answer

124
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,359
for what you did.

125
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,780
Answer for it?

126
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,330
Based on what?

127
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,569
Those worthless pieces of paper
you found?

128
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,790
Mu Jie,

129
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,460
I advise you to turn back.

130
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,660
Turn back?

131
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,739
Fine, then take me with you.

132
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,970
I'll turn back.

133
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,380
Jiang Zhen,

134
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,340
you should take a good look
at the people around you.

135
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,220
Are they friends

136
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,530
or foes?

137
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,530
What do you mean?

138
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,589
Do you really think

139
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,259
Nong Qianya's kidnapping

140
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,140
was that simple?

141
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,050
You're underestimating my sister.

142
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,490
Mu Jie, don't think you can shift

143
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,380
the blame to Ya by saying that.

144
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,170
Ya?

145
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,610
Ya.

146
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,380
Ya.

147
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,940
Sounds like you're pretty close.

148
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,789
You better figure out

149
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,780
what kind of person

150
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,090
she really is.

151
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,900
Why are you back so late?

152
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,370
Jiang.

153
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,100
Ya.

154
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,580
Are you hiding something from us?

155
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,970
What are you talking about?

156
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,210
Ya,

157
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,090
did you stage

158
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,899
your own kidnapping?

159
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,540
What are you talking about?

160
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,010
You come back late
and start talking nonsense.

161
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,340
The kidnapping

162
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,850
was staged by me.

163
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,869
But I had no choice.

164
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,730
I can't go back to the Nong family.

165
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,770
Because I found out
their biggest secret.

166
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,130
My eldest brother was never in a coma.

167
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,420
Impossible.

168
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,820
His body can't move,

169
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,730
but his mind is awake.

170
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,300
Amethyst Group's
brain-computer interface research

171
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,010
started because of him.

172
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,730
He was bedridden by illness.

173
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,420
To stand again,

174
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,660
he started the Morning Star Project.

175
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,460
It failed at first,

176
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,259
but finally, he developed

177
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,940
the consciousness transfer technology.

178
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,730
What does that mean?

179
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,709
My brother used that technology

180
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,820
to live inside my sister-in-law's mind.

181
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,370
The one lying in bed

182
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,460
is just an empty shell.

183
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,010
Then I want to go with you.

184
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,370
We can run away far from here,

185
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,730
together.

186
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,250
I'm begging you.

187
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,730
Help me.

188
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,180
So...

189
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,890
that was her asking me for help.

190
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,940
Feeling sorry for her now?

191
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,090
If she were the mastermind,

192
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,060
I could tell myself

193
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,460
I was doing the right thing.

194
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,730
But she's also a victim.

195
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,420
That makes it hard for me
to come to terms with that.

196
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,220
We judge actions, not thoughts.

197
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,660
We're only human.

198
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,540
We can't open her head

199
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,890
to tell which actions were hers

200
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,180
and which were Nong Cangqin's.

201
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,500
You know,

202
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,540
technology can sometimes be

203
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,730
so terrifying.

204
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,580
If one day I'm controlled,

205
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,250
you have to kill me

206
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,730
without hesitation.

207
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,850
How old are you?

208
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,180
That's childish.

209
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,610
Dawn will break.

210
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,610
