Last time you swiped a chicken.

Now it's apples.

What's next?

You're always fooling around

00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,749
And I'm cleaning up after you!

18
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,760
Use your head for once!

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,709
(Chen Jiachuan)
Twenty laps.

20
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,830
(Instructor at Gale Special Academy)
Two hundred push-ups.

21
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,600
(Bai Fan, Ace Cadet, Gale Special Academy)
You're never done, are you?

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,709
What did you just say?

23
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,759
Yes, Master.

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,709
Lost your voice at home?

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,060
Yes, Master.

26
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,229
Brother.

27
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,119
Xiaotong.

28
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,279
What are you doing here?

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,470
Skipping class?

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,860
It's the weekend. I came to see you.

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,589
I bet you're not here

32
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,910
just for me.

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,729
I've been craving
your canteen's spicy crayfish.

34
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,639
Come on.

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,830
I'll take you there.

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,230
Here.

37
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,060
Xiaotong!

38
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,700
Xiaotong!

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,030
Xiaotong!

40
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,140
Why?

41
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,060
Why?

42
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,430
Why?

43
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,470
Why?

44
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,340
Why?

45
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,990
Why?

46
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,980
No!

47
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,130
(Three years later)

48
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,810
(Scan complete. Target locked.
Supercontrol No. 2 experimental file.)

49
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,799
Hurry! A thief in the records room!

50
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,979
Go check the records room!

51
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,220
- Hurry!
- Go!

52
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,690
(Jiang Zhen,
Vice Director of Amethyst Group)

53
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,359
Don't move.

54
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,820
Hand it over.

55
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,930
(Bai Fan, Captain
of Gale Special Academy)

56
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,380
Bai Fan?

57
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,260
It's been three years.

58
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,519
Instructor Chen, still as tough as ever.

59
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,150
Guess your leash broke.

60
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,910
Who let you out?

61
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,919
First day on the job.

62
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,110
Instructor Chen...

63
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,350
No.

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,599
Vice Director Jiang.

65
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,350
And I've already scored such a big win.

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,780
I'm really grateful to you.

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,870
Want to catch me?

68
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,510
Bring your neck over here.

69
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,940
Let me sharpen my blade.

70
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,830
The Gale Training Camp

71
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,620
has other students, Chen Jiachuan.

72
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,950
Three years apart,

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,950
and you still haven't improved one bit.

74
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,500
Three years,

75
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,510
and your bad habits are still the same.

76
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,910
If they found out...

77
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,860
you joined Amethyst Group
as an undercover...

78
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,150
what do you think would happen?

79
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,100
Do you think they'd believe
some lowly security guard

80
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,590
or me, the vice director?

81
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,829
Movement inside!

82
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,020
Hurry!

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,799
Vice Director Jiang.

84
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,919
Why are you here?

85
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,180
The alarm went off

86
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,300
five minutes ago.

87
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,030
What took you so long?

88
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,980
What are you all doing?

89
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,780
Amethyst Group...

90
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,220
is hiring nothing but useless guards.

91
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,060
Stop standing there.

92
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,030
Get moving and investigate.

93
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,620
Yes, sir.

94
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,999
(Security Department Director's Office)
(Xiaotong's death must be connected)

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,239
(to Amethyst Group.)

96
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,070
(Three years undercover,
and this is my key to the truth.)

97
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,869
(Jiang Zhen,)

98
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,780
(it's boring being alone.)

99
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,220
(I'll keep you company.)

100
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,300
(Now the game's getting interesting.)

101
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,389
(The Amethyst Group,
a global leader in tech)

102
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,269
(developed the Supercontrol No. 2 chip.)

103
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,719
(It cracked a technical problem)

104
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,359
(that autonomous driving
could never solve.)

105
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,869
(Now, the Supercontrol No. 3)

106
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,289
(is being fully upgraded.)

107
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,070
(It will keep them
at the cutting edge of technology.)

108
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,039
(Amethyst Group)

109
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,780
The young mistress
has returned to the country.

110
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,679
She carries the key

111
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,950
to unlock the Supercontrol No. 3 chip.

112
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,429
But on her way to the company,

113
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,710
she vanished.

114
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,300
Only her personal belongings
were found in the car.

115
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,679
With the chip just stolen,

116
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,069
we can't risk another mistake.

117
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,479
If we can't find her,

118
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,390
we can't activate Supercontrol No. 3.

119
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,780
Let Mr. Mu decide what to do.

120
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,799
(Mu Jie, Chairman)
I pay you

121
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,830
to solve problems for me.

122
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,100
Not to hand me more trouble.

123
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,620
Vice Director Jiang.

124
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,100
Have anything to say?

125
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,030
(Why did Bai Fan try
to steal the chip?)

126
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,199
(It seems finding the young mistress)

127
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,510
(is the only way to take the lead.)

128
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,620
Right now, the top priority

129
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,270
is to find the young mistress.

130
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,429
Vice Director Jiang.

131
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,220
I'll handle this matter.

132
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,270
Don't complicate things.

133
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,780
- But, Vice Director Jiang...
- Was I not clear enough?

134
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,300
A guard dog
wanting to run the Nong family.

135
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,220
If you didn't know better, you'd think
this company now belongs to the Jiangs.

136
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,810
(Nong Cangnan,
Eldest Son of Amethyst Group)

137
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,660
Third Young Master, perfect timing.

138
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,270
Why don't you take my seat

139
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,510
and guard the Nong family?

140
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,599
Why you...

141
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,830
Fine, I'm not going to argue with you.

142
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,309
My sister

143
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,590
likely just went to a friend's place.

144
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,620
No need to get all worked up.

145
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,119
Or maybe

146
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,950
someone doesn't want her to come back.

147
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,590
What's that supposed to mean?

148
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,150
My brother's paralyzed,

149
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,430
but he's not dead.

150
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,510
If you want to take his place,

151
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,039
you'll have to wait.

152
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,390
Cangnan.

153
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,620
If you're tired from walking,

154
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,799
sit down and rest.

155
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,030
My former sister-in-law,

156
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,510
the company's still partly mine.

157
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,339
I won't let him

158
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,950
take my brother's place.

159
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,149
Vice Director Jiang's capability

160
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,239
is undeniable.

161
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,950
But always working alone

162
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,550
must be exhausting.

163
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,790
Why not get yourself an assistant

164
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,310
to make things easier for you?

165
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,070
Last night,

166
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,950
I ran into some trouble.

167
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,390
Thankfully, Bai...

168
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,790
Bai Fan.

169
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,430
Bai Fan.

170
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,959
I saw his impressive skills.

171
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,860
Since we're short on people,

172
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,790
let him be your assistant.

173
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,500
Bai Fan, Security Captain,
reporting for duty.

174
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,590
Another mouth means another burden.

175
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,100
- I think...
- Perhaps you don't trust me.

176
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,860
Or don't you trust

177
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,020
Ms. Mu's judgment?

178
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,070
Alright.

179
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,670
The urgent task now

180
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,909
is to find the young mistress

181
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,909
and launch
the Supercontrol No. 3 project.

182
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,140
Don't worry.

183
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,999
I'll make sure to bring her back.

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,359
And if you don't?

185
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,959
I'll bring her back for sure.

186
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,220
Want to bet?

187
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,710
Sure, I'm in.

188
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,239
If you can't bring her back,

189
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,430
then what?

190
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,380
If I can't bring her back,

191
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,549
my seat as the vice director

192
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,260
will be yours.

193
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,710
Deal.

194
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,429
Yaoji.

195
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,350
Dig up clues about her disappearance.

196
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,830
Meet at the usual spot in an hour.

197
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,470
Ms. Mu wants me

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,590
to work with you.

199
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,140
Not necessary.

200
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,090
(Unlocking car door)

201
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,350
Ms. Mu gave me access to this car.

202
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,860
Autopilot engaged.

203
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,669
Are you nuts?

204
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,509
Put it down.

205
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,900
I can't put any of it down.

206
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,470
This isn't your concern.

207
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,119
This is a personal score
between him and me.

208
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,239
I was lying low there.

209
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,100
He just had to hound me.

210
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,669
So of course I had to
drag you in and arrest you.

211
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,439
Right?

212
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,020
Itching for a punch, huh?

213
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,860
Why so hot-tempered?

214
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,100
You're not cute anymore.

215
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,500
That's my coffee.

216
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,430
Yours?

217
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,199
Here.

218
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,430
Psycho.

219
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,590
Psycho.

220
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,700
Where's the disc?

221
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,190
You want it?

222
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,269
Trade for it.

223
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,740
Oh, I forgot to mention.

224
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,350
Without the disc I have,

225
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,140
yours is worthless.

226
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,439
Exactly.

227
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,749
Without the one in my hand,

228
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,950
yours is useless.

229
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,480
Get out.

230
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,980
This is Yaoji?

231
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,190
Nope.

232
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,909
Why?

233
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,220
Don't kill me!

234
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,460
