Let me help you, come.

Done.

00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,900
Got it.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,190
Third Young Master, come.

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,700
Your back is fine now?

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,990
My back...

22
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,910
Just move around a bit
and it will be fine.

23
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,110
Just move around a bit
and it will be fine.

24
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,030
Take care, Third Young Master.

25
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,630
Such bad luck.

26
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,830
Let you come to work
and you are sleeping here.

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,030
I have only been away for a few days
and the discipline has become this lax.

28
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,470
- Go.
- Yes.

29
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,060
Happy cooperation.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,709
Why are you not talking?

31
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,660
Are you isolating the two of us?

32
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,630
Why do you need to say so much
just to drink?

33
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,709
Do you know why he is unhappy?

34
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,619
Why?

35
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,310
Because he does not talk nonsense.

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,959
Scientific research shows
that talking nonsense prolongs life.

37
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,659
It suits all ages.

38
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,279
Really?

39
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,440
Even more useful for the old.

40
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,809
Then I will not live to a hundred?

41
00:02:26,809 --> 00:02:27,769
Look at your rosy cheeks.

42
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:29,870
- He talks nonsense all the time.
- And that hairline...

43
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,870
Even a passing dog gets sweet-talked.

44
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,309
And you believe it.

45
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,500
Idiot.

46
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,909
I am going to the toilet.

47
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,100
You two keep drinking.

48
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,179
I have sent everyone away.

49
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,539
Stop arguing.

50
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,439
Captain Chen.

51
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,810
Are you satisfied

52
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,850
working with me today?

53
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,970
So-so.

54
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,370
Do not drag me down in the future.
And I will not interfere in your business.

55
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,970
Not dragging you down?

56
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,739
That is a bit difficult.

57
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,859
With that mouth of yours,

58
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,530
you might as well be with Yaoji.

59
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,739
Where are you going?

60
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,010
Home to sleep.

61
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,610
Let me ask you something serious.

62
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,610
Say it.

63
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,059
How much longer

64
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,130
before Yaoji can crack Xiaotong's data?

65
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,410

Let us take a look together.

79
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,930
Let us see who the mole really is.

(Nong Cangnan)

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,850

83
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,970
Impressive, Third Young Master.

84
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,619
The Technical Department

85
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,890
must have messed this up.

86
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,290
I will go to them and correct the error.

87
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,339
Alright. Third Young Master enjoys playing.

88
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,090
He was joking with everyone.

89
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,690
Now he has left.

90
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,290
Let us talk about the real matter.

91
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,099
It has now been confirmed.

92
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,010
The young mistress's DNA is fine.

93
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,219
It was the engineer who originally developed
this device who tampered with it.

94
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,099
He stole one of the chips.

95
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,499
That is why our specimen

96
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,050
could not be recognised by the system.

97
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,069
That chip is now

98
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,170
in the hands
of a former employee named Qin Bo.

99
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,490
He is currently hiding in Xiangshan.

100
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,019
So

101
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,570
if we want
the young mistress's key to work,

102
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,659
we must find this man surnamed Qin

103
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,749
and get the chip.

104
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,619
Yes.

105
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,059
We must send someone

106
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,650
to negotiate with Qin Bo.

107
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,450
Vice Director Jiang.

108
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,079
You will have to make the trip yourself.

109
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,570
I am now

110
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,090
Captain Jiang.

111
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,250
I still need time to familiarize myself with
my new position. I will not create extra trouble.

112
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,450
I will go.

113
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,420
This is originally the responsibility
of our Security Department.

114
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,370
I will take good care
of him along the way.

115
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,939
It is just talking
to that man named Qin.

116
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,690
Why must you insist
on dragging me along?

117
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,170
Vice Director Bai is new here.

118
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,339
It is good to get to know
an old employee.

119
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,530
That is why
we must bring Captain Jiang along.

120
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,759
An old employee should naturally
be accompanied by the old leader.

121
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,200
It will help them get familiar.

122
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,819
Vice Director Bai,
are you really that afraid

123
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,570
that you cannot
get things done on your own?

124
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,250
Alright.

125
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,370
The two of you will go together.

126
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,610
(Why does Bai Fan also want
to find Supercontrol No. 3?)

127
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,770
Zhen.

128
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,050
Why do you not want to go?

129
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,650
Because I want to stay here

130
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,810
to protect you.

131
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,210
Of course I also hope

132
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,410
that you can stay by my side
to protect me.

133
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,290
But for this matter,

134
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,480
I can only feel assured if you go.

135
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,130
If one day I made a mistake,

136
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,810
would you still, like now,

137
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,810
stand by my side as always

138
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,530
and protect me?

139
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,650
My life belongs to you, Madam.

140
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,610
Protecting the company
is my responsibility.

141
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,210
Naturally, I will also protect you.

142
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,659
Sometimes

143
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,169
I really want to implant a chip in you.

144
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,770
So you will only listen to me

145
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,210
and love me.

146
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,770
Madam.

147
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,290
Is it that you

148
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,330
do not trust me?

149
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,930
If I do not trust you,
who else can I trust?

150
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,210
Qin Bo's background is not simple.

151
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,570
Be careful.

152
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,250
Bring yourself and the chip

153
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,890
back to me safely and intact.

154
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,299
(Amethyst Group)

155
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,779
(Supercontrol Project.
Retrieve the chip)

156
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,699
(Find Qin Bo. Retrieve the chip)

157
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,770
Why exactly do you not want
to come to Xiangshan?

158
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,499
Yaoji said Xiaotong's data

159
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,730
can be cracked tomorrow.

160
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,090
Yet at this time you insisted
on dragging me out.

161
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,219
We have waited three years.

162
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,930
Can't we wait another day or two?

163
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,530
We have waited three years.

164
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,610
So we should not stir up extra trouble.

165
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,179
I was wondering why it took so long.

166
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,530
Turns out we came to a place
where not even birds come.

167
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,699
Whenever I come out with you,

168
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,179
things never go smoothly.

169
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,370
With you here, I feel more at ease.

170
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,970
Fine then, let's have something to eat.

171
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,179
Boss.

172
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,339
Two bottles of soda.

173
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,729
One serving of fried pancake.

174
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,939
And a bowl of noodles for him.

175
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,139
Do not add spring onions
or coriander to the noodles.

176
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,330
You can make it a bit spicy.

177
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,650
Alright.

178
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,490
Here you go.

179
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,179
To be honest.
The last time we acted together,

180
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,369
you did not like it one bit.

181
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,850
Boss, is the food ready?

182
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,200
Coming.

183
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,660
Enjoy.

184
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,579
If you are hungry, start eating.

185
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,090
You are actually quite nice.

186
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,330
Mate, can I borrow a lighter?

187
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,890
Where are you two brothers from?

188
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,139
Our company is holding
its annual meeting.

189
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,920
We were sent to Xiangshan
to have a look around.

190
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,139
Mate.

191
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,010
Do you know where else nearby
we can get food?

192
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,339
You want to know?

193
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,890
Come with us then.

194
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,170
Brother.

195
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,010
Do not point the tip
of your knife at people.

196
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,970
Is this how you treat guests?

197
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,410
That is rude.

198
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,770
If you want to get to him,

199
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,090
you must get past me first.

200
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,579
Bai Fan, the soda's

201
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,770
off.

202
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,970
