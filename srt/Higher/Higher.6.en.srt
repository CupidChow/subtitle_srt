13
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,500
The young mistress's
key authentication failure

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,460
has directly affected the development
progress of Supercontrol No. 3.

15
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,990
What should we do for the next step?

16
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,900
Let's hear the proposal.

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,950
Technical Department.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,869
You are Captain Jiang now,

19
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,190
not the vice director.

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,270
Aren't you meddling a bit too much?

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,830
Yes, Mr. Bai is in charge of security
and your ability is certainly not lacking.

22
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,420
Why don't you tell Mr Mu

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,860
how to push Supercontrol No. 3 forward?

24
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,940
I found it.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,300
I found it.

26
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,030
I found it.

27
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,709
What did you find?

28
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,300
I found the thief who broke into
the confidential room.

29
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,759
There were two of them working together
and one was even wearing a security uniform.

30
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,350
That means he's definitely an insider.

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,559
Although their faces are blurry for now,

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,119
please rest assured.

33
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,780
I will have the company's AI
reconstruct their faces.

34
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,309
Just give me two days

35
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,220
and I will have a clear view of them.

36
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,959
This matter is my responsibility

37
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,310
and I will take care of it.

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,769
We are all in the same boat.

39
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,060
There's no you or me.

40
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,119
Do not interfere.

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,470
I will handle it.

42
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,680
- Yaoji.
- Hello, please do not hang up.

43
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,820
I have something to tell you.

44
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,880
The number you have dialed
is currently on another call.

45
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,970
Yaoji.

46
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,419
Delete him for me.

47
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,930
Wait, big brother.

48
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,099
Big brother.

49
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,010
Is there something wrong with your head?

50
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,459
How many times have I told you? Huh?

51
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,059
Do not mess around with that Bai fellow.

52
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,459
It wasn't me.

53
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:54,379
You wouldn't even know
if that old fox sold you out.

54
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,930
Listen to me carefully.
You are my man, not his.

55
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,580
If you dare mess around
with that Bai fellow again, I am telling you,

56
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,819
believe it or not,

57
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,059
I will delete you too.

58
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,250
I...

59
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,330
Nutcase.

60
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,219
Big brother.

61
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,339
This old pal of mine

62
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,370
is resourceful and efficient.

63
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,540
When it comes to connections,
if he dares to claim second,

64
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,730
no one would dare claim first.

65
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,339
And the friend you're talking about is?

66
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,530
Him.

67
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,059
That guy?

68
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,659
He dares to call himself number one?

69
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,539
Big brother.

70
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,690
- Exaggeration is sometimes a figure of speech.
- Right.

71
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,810
That's why I say Yaoji is cultured.

72
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,090
Big brother.

73
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,450
People who can speak as well
as he does are rare these days.

74
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,939
Can I add him back on WeChat?

75
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,330
Let's talk business.

76
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,490
Don't just stand there.

77
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,999
Hurry up and take it out.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,450
It might expire later.

79
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,779
If Brother Yao says it,

80
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,170
we have to get it done.

81
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,530
I've got wide connections.

82
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,619
I know a hacker.

83
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,819
Put this virus

84
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,339
into Nong Cangnan's computer,

85
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,090
it'll even take down the AI.

86
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,759
What's that supposed to mean?

87
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,120
What do you mean, what does it mean?

88
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,939
That's my seat.

89
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,290
What do I mean?

90
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,610
Get up.

91
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,330
I sit here every day.

92
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,019
Get your facts straight.

93
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,419
Alright, you dare point at me?

94
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:29,880
Now I'm mad.

95
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,819
Let me put down my coffee
and I'll tell you this.

96
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,099
- Snatching my spot in front of everyone?
- What, you want a fight?

97
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,639
- I've never feared you for this.
- Bring it on.

98
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,659
Enough.

99
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,810
Arguing and making a scene over a seat.

100
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,050
So embarrassing.

101
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,659
I think Third Young Master is right.
Today, neither you nor I will sit here.

102
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,210
Third Young Master will. Come.

103
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,490
Third Young Master. I think this wheelchair
doesn't suit your style.

104
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,810
Here, have a seat.

105
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,410
Third Young Master,
you left your coffee.

106
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,690
Put the lid on.

107
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,059
Drink it slowly. You've worked hard,
Third Young Master.

108
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,610
Let me help loosen your muscles.

109
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,290
What on earth am I eating?

110
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,250
Three years without action.

111
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,490
You're a bit rusty after all.

112
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,170
Find some time to see an eye doctor.

113
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,610
When people get older,

114
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,330
they love to push themselves.

115
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,090
Watch out, there's someone behind you.

116
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,610
Afraid you might get bored.

117
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,170
I'm here to entertain you.

118
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,850
Are you insane?

119
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,610
Say one more nonsense word

120
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,730
and I'll make sure
you're not lonely tonight.

121
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,099
Jiang Zhen, Nong Cangnan is back.

122
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,179
Will you stop already?

123
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,099
This time I'm serious.

124
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,330
I'm not lying to you.

125
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,479
- Haven't you lied to me enough?
- It's not like that.

126
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:07,179
What will it take for you to believe me?

127
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,290
- Nong Cangnan is about to be back.
- Alright.

128
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,859
My most handsome, heroic,

129
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,290
adorable,

130
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,730
brave master.

131
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,530
Can't you believe me just this once?

132
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,259
If you fall into Nong Cangnan's hands,

133
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,850
I'll lose face.

134
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,210
Help me stall him.

135
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,090
How much time do you need?

136
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,779
Ten minutes.

137

(File generating)

138
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,459
Once I leave, no one will be watching
the monitors for you.

139
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,810
You're on your own.

140
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,810
What's going on here?

141
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,219
Sorry.

142
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,410
Sorry.

143
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,610
Can you be a bit more careful?

144
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,459
Third Young Master,
heading to the washroom?

145
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,539
- I'll help you.
- I'm done. I'm going back.

146
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,859
Yes.

147
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,050
Stop.

148
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,819
Yes.

149
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,579
Third Young Master, don't strain yourself.
I'm not exactly skilled at this.

150
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,250
Back up.

151
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,570
Why did we stop?

152
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,050
What's going on?

153
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,450
Let me check.

154
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,450
Maybe it's broken.

155
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,170
Can it be fixed?

156
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,690
It can.

157
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,859
Of course it can.

158
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,050
Then fix it quickly.

159
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,530
How much longer do you need?

160
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,779
Five minutes.

161
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,939
Hurry.

162
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,330
You want me to hurry?

163
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,739
I'm hurrying.

164
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,899
Fastest in the world.

165
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,739
You're the slowest.

167
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,930
Have you checked everything in here?

168
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,250
Finished.

169
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,099
Third Young Master's hair
actually looks nice.

170
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,999
The scarf's not bad either.
Like the Little Prince.

171
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:01,619
Stop dawdling.

172
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,050
I've got important business.

173
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,099
Alright.

174
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,730
No, it's my back.

175
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,099
Squatting too long makes it numb.

176
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,130
- Here, give me a hand.
- Here.

177
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,970
Sorry.
