Had a nice nap? Wake up!

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,879
Unbelievable.

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,350
You can pass out anywhere.

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,279
I didn't expect
Gale Training Camp's top instructor

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,350
to get knocked out at a street stall.

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,390
Right back at you.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,940
You weren't much better.

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,630
The hunter was taken down by the fox.

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,660
Tell me that's not embarrassing.

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,069
I fell asleep
and you couldn't handle it?

23
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,390
What'd you do without me?

24
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,750
If you weren't here, I'd be out already.

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,230
Over there.

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,599
There are tools.

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,690
Let's go.

28
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,500
- Go.
- Go.

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,300
Seriously? Show some teamwork.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,149
Three, two, one, lift.

31
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,470
- Hold it.
- Lift.

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,349
Up and towards me.

33
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,540
Up!

34
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,149
Hold steady.

35
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,420
Up!

36
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,860
- Okay.
- Okay.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,220
Come on.

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,429
My knee!

39
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,559
My back! Watch my back!

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,750
Ouch, my back!

41
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,700
Not my back.

42
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,509
My back!

43
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,910
Ow, my back!

44
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,940
What are you doing?

45
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,910
Quit sticking your bottom out.

46
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,060
Oh, right.

47
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,910
Before you passed out,

48
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,590
what did you call me?

49
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,750
What did I call you?

50
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,150
What do you think I called you?

51
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,380
Let's move.

52
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,750
What brand is that?

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,030
Not bad. Good taste.

54
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,679
The number you dialed is unavailable.

55
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,540
Please try again later.

56
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,189
Proceed accordingly.

57
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,379
- Hello. The number you dialed...
- Same place as last time.

58
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:08,670
You know that place we loved.

59
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,839
Zhu Li.

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,030
Have you seen Bai and Jiang Zhen?

61
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,660
Vice Director Bai
and Captain Jiang went to Xiangshan.

62
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,929
The stolen chip from our company

63
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,030
is with a man named Qin in Xiangshan.

64
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,730
(Recent Calls: Jiang, Bai)

65
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,940
- Self-driving ready.
- Head for Xiangshan.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,220
No need to be so formal.

67
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,030
Everyone's here.

68
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,940
Good, everyone's here.

69
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,189
Looks like you guys are exhausted.

70
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,780
Even your faces are sour.

71
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,820
This makes me feel bad for you.

72
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,660
So we won't add to your troubles.

73
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,749
We'll skip dinner this time.

74
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,679
Next time, perhaps.

75
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,030
We'll head out first.

76
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,870
Buddies.

77
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,430
We're all just working folk.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,239
Same roots, same origin.

79
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,909
Why fight each other?

80
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,870
No need for us to tear each other apart.

81
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,100
Don't be rash.

82
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,389
Easy.

83
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,100
I didn't think this through.

84
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,780
I shouldn't have
made you work for nothing.

85
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,430
How about this?

86
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,509
I'll stay.

87
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,389
I'm worth more.

88
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,780
If you want to kill someone,
start with him.

89
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,620
Keep me for ransom.

90
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,630
Zip it.

91
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,799
Quiet, all of you.

92
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,320
What do you want with me?

93
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,030
Boss.

94
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,150
Hey, the boss is talking.

95
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,950
Don't you remember me?

96
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,239
I...

97
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,030
We had drinks together.

98
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,660
I can't recall.

99
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,990
See?

100
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,429
Big shots forget fast.

101
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,429
Come on.

102
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,420
That night at the bar?

103
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,999
Remember now?

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,740
What exactly is Amethyst Group up to?

105
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,599
That's impossible.

106
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,950
It was you.

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,479
Anyone from Amethyst Group

108
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,150
is no good.

109
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,620
I'll give you one more chance to talk.

110
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,000
Bai Fan.

111
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,150
Don't waste words on them.

112
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,950
If they'd ambush us at a street stall,

113
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,150
it means they know exactly who we are.

114
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,910
As expected from
Vice Director Jiang of Amethyst Group.

115
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,660
You have a sharp eye.

116
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,660
Me?

117
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,999
Yeah, I'm a vice director now.

118
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,190
It's me.

119
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,300
Jiang Zhen. Bai Fan.

120
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,290
You're here on behalf of Amethyst Group

121
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,300
for this, aren't you?

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,660
Hand it over.

123
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,590
Name your price.
We'll agree to anything.

124
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,830
Anything at all?

125
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,660
Yeah. Let's hear it.

126
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,999
I want Amethyst Group

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,980
wiped off the face of the earth.

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,190
Buddy.

129
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,540
You just got fired.

130
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,190
It's not that bad.

131
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,950
Seriously?

132
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,180
Do you even know what they did to me?

133
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,239
Boss, time's up.

134
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,389
We should go.

135
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,709
Once my client signs off on this batch,

136
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,629
I'll come back
and take my time with you.

137
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,350
Keep an eye on them. Move.

138
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,350
This feels familiar, huh?

139
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,860
For three years,

140
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,919
besides running your mouth,

141
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,309
what else did you do?

142
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,500
Tch.

143
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,379
If I hadn't bought us time just now

144
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,030
with my silver tongue,

145
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,910
you'd be dead already.

146
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,509
Still, your acting was terrible.

147
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,070
I couldn't even watch.

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,190
Fine.

149
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,740
See that guy?

150
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,940
Get it now?

151
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,420
It has to be me?

152
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,710
Didn't you just say my acting was bad?

153
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,829
My head!

154
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,799
Hey!

155
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,629
Help him out.

156
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,359
My head's killing me!

157
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,239
It's going to explode!

158
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,910
Come on, take a look.

159
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,230
Shut up.

160
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,700
Quiet, darn it.

161
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,350
That one actually hurt.

162
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,479
Did you get it?

163
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,670
No, I missed.

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,679
Try again.

165
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,309
Seriously?

166
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,069
Come on, you're good at acting.

167
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,590
It was too on point.

168
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,869
- It was way too good.
- Shut it.

169
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,100
- I'll nail it this time.
- Shut up, you.

170
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,719
Dude, his cards are 3-5-7-8-9.

171
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,910
He's bursting you.

172
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,260
Shut it.

173
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,270
I was helping.
Why are you telling me to shut up?

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,629
You have long legs and a big mouth.

175
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,510
You must have a death wish.

176
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,150
Hurt him,
and you'll be the one doing down.

177
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,140
Move!

178
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,260
Go!

179
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,740
After them!

180
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,709
Go!

181
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,580
Don't run!

182
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,969
Stop!

183
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,869
Move!

184
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,950
Stop!

185
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,360
This way!
