13
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,140
Sorry.

14
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,399
You both seemed busy,

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,750
so I thought I'd cook you something.

16
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,330
Dinner's ready.

17
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,310
Eat up.

18
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,980
- Go on.
- Eat up.

19
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,900
Dig in.

20
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,140
Thanks, Ya.

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,390
Jiang Zhen loves fried eggs.

22
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,420
Have some more.

23
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,620
And Bai here

24
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,580
is crazy about broccoli.

25
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,789
No need to be polite.

26
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,869
If there's not enough,

27
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,310
there's more in the kitchen.

28
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,710
Is it good?

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,870
Wonderful.

30
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,260
Glad to hear that.

31
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,030
It's good. Really good.

32
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,270
Good.

33
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,220
Here.

34
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,620
Eat up/

35
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,550
This is incredible, Bai!

36
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,180
It's delicious.

37
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,220
Looks pretty ordinary to me.

38
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,820
Jiang Zhen,

39
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,709
why do you never act like yourself

40
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,060
around Bai?

41
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,559
See?

42
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,980
Good looks attract jealousy.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,280
Know your worth.

44
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,399
But I really think it's good.

45
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,660
I should have more.

46
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,350
If you like it,
I'll make it for you again.

47
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,029
Then, can I request a dish?

48
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,119
Of course.

49
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,709
I want…

50
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,900
Cola chicken wings.

51
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,100
Nope.

52
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,839
Last time he made those,

53
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,269
he ate so much he made himself sick.

54
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,679
Yeah, I can't compare to some people.

55
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,540
Some can't even tell salt from sugar.

56
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,740
Bai Fan, if eating won't shut you up,

57
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,069
I can feed you something else.

58
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,739
Sure. Go get it.

59
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,919
- Fine.
- Bet you can't even take three steps.

60
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,289
The last time I had a meal this good

61
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,300
was my childhood birthday.

62
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,719
But that was so long ago,

63
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,280
I can barely remember it.

64
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,490
It's been years
since anyone celebrated with me.

65
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,740
- Next time...
- We'll celebrate with you.

66
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,510
Really?

67
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,470
You'd better mean it.

68
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,419
Of course.
Jiang Zhen is the best at birthdays.

69
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,719
When it was Xiaotong's birthday,

70
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,479
he prepared so much.

71
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,780
It was like he wanted
to give her the whole world.

72
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,190
I'm full.

73
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,150
Getting used to being back home?

74
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,239
I wasn't overseas for long.

75
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,100
I only left after university.

76
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,980
Where did you go to university?

77
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,770
Jingbei University.

78
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,640
What is it?

79
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,829
Nothing.

80
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,799
Jiang Zhen's sister, Xiaotong,

81
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,220
went there too.

82
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,310
It's just that…

83
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,450
She's gone now.

84
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,869
Bai Fan, take Ya home.

85
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,420
Alright, I get it.

86
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,579
What are you doing?

87
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,899
You can't move around much.
I'm tidying up for you.

88
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,739
Finish and get out.

89
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,930
Fine.

90
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,540
Where's my bag?

91
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,699
Bai Fan, you've gone too far.

92
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,739
- No, I left it right here.
- Out!

93
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,499
- The gray one with blue edges!
- Get out!

94
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,419
When did you get a bag?

95
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,939
It's got my butterfly knife.

96
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,130
Out!

97
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,010
Did it sprout legs and walk off?

98
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,299
No way.

99
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,619
That's a nice knife.

100
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,419
This knife...

101
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,339
This knife...

102
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,619
Hey, I have the same one.

103
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,810
Don't touch my stuff.

104
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,039
Yours is a knock-off.

105
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,019
- Put it down.
- I'll bring you the real deal.

106
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,819
Alright.

107
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,539
Fine.

108
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,299
It's all yours.

109
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,499
All yours.

110
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,250
This one's yours too.

111
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,490
That's not mine!

112
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,939
Bai Fan, stop hanging around here.

113
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,850
Get out. Now.

114
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,019
My head's spinning.

115
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,219
I have a headache.

116
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,090
I need to rest.

117
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,339
I'll lie down here for a bit.

118
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,530
It won't take long.

119
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,499
Just a moment.

120
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,690
What are you doing?

121
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,930
Bai Fan, come here.

122
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,810
You just wait.

123
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,140
Even if I die,

124
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,980
I won't let you stay at my place.

125
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,930
Ya.

126
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,930
Come here.

127
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,810
Sister-in-law.

128
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,650
What are you so afraid of?

129
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,490
I'm just looking out for you.

130
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,370
It's late. Where have you been?

131
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,850
I had dinner at Jiang Zhen's.

132
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,770
Dinner?

133
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,450
Was it good?

134
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,770
Not bad.

135
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,979
You call me careless,

136
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,730
but you're just as clumsy.

137
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,930
It's been dangerous outside lately.

138
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,970
Girls should come home earlier.

139
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,690
