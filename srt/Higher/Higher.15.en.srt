I think I've seen
that scar before somewhere.

00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,399
I knew it.

Yaoji.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,239
I sent you a photo.

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,119
Look into anything

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,830
you can find about it.

20
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,069

We already have plans tonight.

Ms. Mu wants you
to sort this out by tonight.

This is for the meeting
the day after tomorrow.

Can I do it tomorrow instead?

27
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,550
But Bai and Vice Director Jiang...

28
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,349

I can have barbecue with Jiang Zhen

and Bai.

49
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,500
Is that asking too much?

50

As long as you don't mind him,

51
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,100
we can celebrate

52
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,980
with you every year.

I wish all of us can make

our dreams come true.

59
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,380
And your third wish?

60
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,869
You can't say the third one out loud,

61
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,239
or else it won't come true.

62
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,239
That's all right.

63
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,870
Whatever it is,

64
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,430
I'll make it happen.

65
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,000
Thanks, guys.

66
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,300
My wish will come true.

67
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,830
Next year, I wish the three of us

68
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,860
can be in the same spot

69
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,430
eating barbecue again.

70
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,130
We'll see.

71
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,590
Bai, Jiang,

72
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,030
thank you for celebrating my birthday
with me today.

73
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,980
Here, a toast to both of you.

74
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,400
Cheers!

75
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,060
Cheers!

76
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,520
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

77
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,950
My mother never celebrated my birthday.

78
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,350
When I was little,

79
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,719
I once picked up

80
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,540
a candle someone had thrown away

81
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,950
and burned a hole in my clothes.

82
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,470
She beat me for it.

83
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,420
Later, she passed away.

84
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,510
My father brought me back
to the Nong family,

85
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,220
but no one ever remembered my birthday.

86
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,599
I always

87
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,030
spent it alone,

88
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,860
especially overseas.

89
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,100
I never thought

90
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,710
you two would celebrate with me today.

91
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,060
Don't worry.

92
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,790
You will

93
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,740
never spend a birthday alone again.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,670
You'll have two friends with you.

95
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,269
I will be like an older brother

96
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,470
to you.

97
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,580
That's right.

98
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,170
We have plenty of years ahead.

99
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,139
This year,

100
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,220
next year, every year,

101
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,040
we will spend it together.

102
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,750
All right.

103
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,430
Cheers!

104
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,510
Together it is.

105
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,260
Cheers!

106
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,159
What's wrong?

107
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,030
I was thinking about Nong Cangnan.

108
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,429
Nong Cangnan?

109
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,579
I noticed

110
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,300
he's been in contact
with some shady people.

111
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,910
He disappeared
for several days recently.

112
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,420
When he came back,

113
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,390
there was a new scar
on the back of his neck.

114
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,420
He isn't nice to me,

115
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,629
but he is still my half-brother.

116
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,660
I'm a little worried about him.

117
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,180
This is so good.
Let's add two more orders of bacon.

118
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,750
This will do.

119
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,090
Sir. Make it less greasy and less spicy.

120
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,599
Sir,

121
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,270
based on the clue Ya gave,

122
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,300
I found out all the medical staff

123
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,030
had been part of a medical experiment.

124
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,910
It was being run

125
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,150
in secret by certain people.

126
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,409
What kind of experiment?

127
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,540
I don't know,

128
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,030
but someone does.

129
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,479
Who?

130
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,070
The city's information broker,

131
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,720
"Prince."

132
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,320
Prince?

133
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,860
They say he is mysterious.

134
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,369
No one has seen him.

135
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,070
No one even knows
if he is a man or a woman.

136
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,540
Just that he is ruthless

137
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,660
and rich.

138
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,910
Good news.

139
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,470
I heard Prince

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,660
is throwing a party at a bar
in the next few days.

141
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,660
But it's members only.

142
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,830
We can't just walk in.

143
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,300
So we'll have to find another way.

144
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,350
How?

145
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,140
I have an idea.

146
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,389
You brought the stuff?

147
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,389
Yes.

148
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,660
But what for?

149
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,550
Well...

150
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,670
What?

151
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,990
Come here.

152
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,220
Bai Fan, what are you doing?

153
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,659
Relax.

154
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,590
Just making you cuter.

155
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,470
What?

156
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,270
Ya, get him.

157
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,250
What's going on?

158
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,510
Hey, if you get that on my face,
you are dead!

159
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,940
Bai Fan,

160
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,380
you're always messing with me.

161
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,980
Isn't this nice?

162
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,740
You walk around
with that sour look all day.

163
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,950
This will freshen you up.

164
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,830
I don't need it.

165
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,900
It's for your own good.

166
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,490
Stop talking. Go to sleep.

167
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,790
Why does it have to be me?

168
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,449
Because you're the pretty one.

169
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,999
It would be a waste not to dress you up.

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,669
We can't send Ya in, can we?

171
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,369
Why not you?

172
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,710
Want me to let her try instead?

173
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,719
I'm too masculine.

174
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,149
I'd blow our cover right away.

175
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,900
Are you saying I'm not masculine?

176
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,400
I've scoped out the place.

177
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,530
Too many people in the hallway,
should be easy to handle.

178
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,000
The security in the private room
shouldn't be as tight as the entrance,

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,119
so we'll use a business meeting as cover.

180
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,129
I'll handle the guards,

181
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,959
you get Prince

182
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,430
to give up the intel.

183
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,060
Watch for my signal.

184
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,439
I'm the one in charge.

185
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,459
I'm your instructor.

186
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,860
Former instructor.

187
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,070
What's your business here?

188
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,910
We...

189
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,220
We are...

190
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,700
Tell them.

191
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,620
You two are late.

192
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,790
You're here to perform
for Prince, right?

193
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,019
Yes.

194
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,599
We're here to perform for Prince,

195
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,980
the esteemed elder.

196
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,620
Esteemed "elder"?

197
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,140
Are you talking about me?

198
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,170
- You never told me Prince was a woman.
- I didn't know either.

199
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,550
What now?

200
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,479
Um... I meant

201
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,479
the one and only Prince,

202
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,410
beloved by all ages,

203
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,830
men and women alike.

204
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,350
Flattered,

205
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,310
but flattery isn't much of a talent.

206
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,310
What else can you do?

207
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,669
Roleplay.

208
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,190
I play a lone agent

209
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,789
sneaking into a castle

210
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,140
to rescue the princess from the villain,

211
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,430
and she's the femme fatale
trying to stop me.

212
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,209
After a fierce battle,

213
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:30,830
we save you, the princess,
and bring you back to our side.

214
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,859
Exciting

215
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,100
enough?

216
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,470
Interesting,

217
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,740
but I'm not a big fan of thrills.

218
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,119
Wait, Prince.

219
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,100
We... We can also tone it down.

220
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,340
Go on.

221
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,239
We can sing, dance, do stand-up,

222
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,500
you name it.

223
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,190
And you, unusual young lady,

224
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,590
what can you do?

225
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,439
She can...

226
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,199
She can...

227
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,350
She can smash a rock on her chest.

228
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,560
I like that.

229
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,959
We'll save that for the finale.

230
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,670
First, we'll sing and dance

231
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,310
