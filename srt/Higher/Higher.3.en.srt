Excuse me,

18
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,830
who are you?

19
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,679
Jiang Zhen.

20
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,990
Vice Director
of Security at Amethyst Group.

21
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,500
I'm here to take you home.

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,230
Bai Fan.

23
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,630
Security Captain.

24
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,470
Future vice director.

25
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,660
Thanks for saving me.

26
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,750
But

27
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,110
can you not send me
back to the Nong family?

28
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,709
Everyone's waiting for you.

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,220
They're really worried.

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,820
But if going back

31
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,060
means I'll end up dead at their hands,

32
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,630
are you sure
you still want to take me home?

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,260
The highway's under construction anyway.

34
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,870
We can't get through today.

35
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,100
Let's find a place to rest.

36
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,430
What's your relationship?

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,940
- Family of three.
- Siblings.

38
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,540
You share the good looks.

39
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,430
But we only have one room left.

40
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,260
You must be kidding me.

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,709
We can try another place.

42
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,799
It's fine.

43
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,079
It's peak travel season.

44
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,359
You're welcome to try.

45
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,710
Let's just stay here.

46
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,780
We booked first.

47
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,660
Close the curtains.

48
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,030
Close the curtains.

49
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,220
It's busted.

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,870
Brother Jiang, I'm done changing.

51
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,540
Young mistress, you don't need to worry.

52
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,869
Once we're back tomorrow,

53
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,060
everything will be fine.

54
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,500
No need to be scared of me.

55
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,540
But he's no good.

56
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,030
If he lays a hand on you,

57
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,430
use this knife and stab him.

58
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,780
Do the clothes fit?

59
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,190
Why are you holding a knife?

60
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,630
That's not how you hold it.

61
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,869
Hold it this way.

62
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,239
You'll cut your hand like that.

63
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,239
Hold it by the handle.

64
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,780
Grip it with both hands.

65
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,990
If you run into
someone like Jiang Zhen, stab him.

66
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,630
Madam.

67
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,750
Everything's on track.

68
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,030
I've found the young mistress.

69
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,559
Tomorrow morning,

70
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,100
I'll bring her back to you myself.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,660
Who's on the phone?

72
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,150
None of your business.

73
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,630
If you want the disc I have,

74
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,679
you'd better be nice to me.

75
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,919
Bai Fan, tell me.

76
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,860
Why did you join Amethyst Group?

77
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,950
Life's a game.

78
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,910
Chen Jiachuan.

79
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,620
What have you been
doing these three years?

80
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,470
If you can't handle it,

81
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,180
just tell me.

82
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,070
I'll give you a hand.

83
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,660
It's barely dark out.

84
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,740
And you're already dreaming.

85
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,310
If you don't try,

86
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,550
how will you know?

87
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,990
Get down.

88
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,350
Why should I?

89
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,860
I can't sleep with you on the bed.

90
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,350
How is that my fault?

91
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,230
Get down.

92
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,460
Give me the blanket.

93
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,620
What are you doing?

94
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,020
Let go.

95
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,980
Let go.

96
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,060
What are you doing? Give it here.

97
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,430
You two,

98
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,910
can you keep it down?

99
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,719
Chen Jiachuan, why must you do this?

100
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,100
Get out of my way!

101
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,750
Xiaotong.

102
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,260
What?

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,749
So,

104
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,940
where's Bai Fan?

105
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,540
He went to get breakfast.

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,599
I'll get the car.

107
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,359
Pack up.

108
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,550
We're leaving soon.

109
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,090
(Parking Exit)

110
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,350
Stealing from me?

111
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,700
Stealing from me?

112
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,799
This is for ambushing me!

113
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,990
Stop! Stop!

114
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,139
Darn it.

115
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,460
Third Young Master.

116
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,119
It's you?

117
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,780
My bad.

118
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,710
Jiang Zhen, don't get cocky.

119
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,830
Someone's even better
at catching you off guard.

120
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,790
(Chen Jiachuan,)

121
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,910
(how many times
will you fall for his tricks?)

122
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,309
Young Mistress.

123
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,100
You still have to go home.

124
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,189
Trust me.

125
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,620
I'll protect you.

126
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,310
(Say whatever you want.)

127
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,710
(Bai Fan!)

128
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,730
She should be here by now.

129
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,190
Almost.

130
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,160
- This is the young mistress.
- Bai Fan found her first.

131
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,940
She's gorgeous.

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,710
Anything for the company.

133
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,319
Why is it Bai Fan?
Where's Vice Director Jiang?

134
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,510
Yeah.

135
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,310
Qianya.

136
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,510
You've been through a lot.

137
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,190
Sister-in-law.

138
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,550
Since Bai Fan found her first,

139
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,899
the company has decided...

140
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,940
Wait.

141
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,860
Bai Fan.

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,430
You're quick to take credit, aren't you?

143
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,190
Vice Director Jiang.

144
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,029
I should thank you for helping me

145
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,220
bring her back a step faster.

146
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,900
- Thanks.
- Be honest.

147
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,790
Who actually found her?

148
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,239
Qianya.

149
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,950
Which one of them found you first?

150
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,430
Bai Fan.

151
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,020
Aren't you worried
I'll kick you out of Amethyst Group?

152
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,959
I was the one helping Ms. Mu

153
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,020
in a dark underground garage.

154
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,590
I got back her precious bag.

155
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,060
Bai Fan.

156
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,380
Winning over one woman

157
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,550
won't secure your position.

158
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,620
How noble.

159
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,100
But if I'm not mistaken,

160
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,759
the reason you became vice director

161
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,079
was because of the dark, windy night

162
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,569
when the helpless lady

163
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,250
met her handsome bodyguard.

164
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,070
The Supercontrol No. 3 project
still hasn't progressed.

165
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,450
(Nong Cangqin, Chairman, Amethyst Group)
The shareholders are already upset.

166
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,950
Even though I'm divorced from Nong,

167
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,430
the company

168
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,220
is still mine to protect.

169
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,070
Tell me, does Amethyst Group

170
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,310
have a mole in its ranks?

171
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,550
Madam.

172
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,020
You already have someone in mind.

173
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,310
You're the vice director
in charge of security.

174
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,350
Haven't you noticed anyone suspicious?

175
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,100
If that person is you,

176
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,500
I'll be heartbroken.

177
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,340
So heartbroken...

178
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,940
that I'll kill you.

179
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,550
Zhen.

180
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,060
Don't forget you were
the one who saved me.

181
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,479
But now, what do you have here?

182
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,140
Care to show me?
