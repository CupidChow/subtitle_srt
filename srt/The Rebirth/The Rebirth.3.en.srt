00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,680
<b>Miss, please stand up</b>

2
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,760
<b>So it's you</b>

3
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,280
<b>Unfortunately, little Uncle Wang</b>

4
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,840
<b>My family is short of one person</b>

5
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,079
<b>My nephew dares to ask you for someone</b>

6
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,840
<b>Please do as you please</b>

7
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,640
<b>Miss Shen</b>

8
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,280
<b>If you like</b>

9
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,840
<b>You can come with me now</b>

10
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,640
<b>I'll take you home</b>

11
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,639
<b>This is for you</b>

12
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,560
<b>Look</b>

13
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,039
<b>General Xihe and His Royal Highness the Crown Prince</b>

14
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,520
<b>A perfect match made in heaven</b>

15
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,319
<b>Yes, they are a perfect match</b>

16
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,199
<b>Why are you standing there?</b>

17
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,199
<b>Here you go</b>

18
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,960
<b>A new batch of items has arrived in our store</b>

19
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,560
<b>Feel free to take a look and choose</b>

20
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,240
<b>How is it? Good quality and low price</b>

21
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,039
<b>I'm leaving first</b>

22
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,560
<b>People from this street all come to our store to buy</b>

23
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,719
<b>I like</b>

24
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:14,960
Miss Shen very much.

25
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,039
<b>If you don't want to go home,</b>

26
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,840
you can live in my house first.

27
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,759
<b>I promise you that</b>

28
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,439
you will be safe.

29
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,400
<b>I'm sorry, Pei Lang.</b>

30
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,759
<b>He has the same mark as the murderer.</b>

31
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,360
<b>I must get close to him</b>

32
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,039
<b>To find out the real culprit</b>

33
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,439
<b>Thank you, Your Highness, for your kindness.</b>

34
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,240
<b>But Qianye</b>

35
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,960
<b>has decided to follow the prince</b>

36
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,520
until death

37
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,360
<b>I'll take my leave.</b>

38
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,279
<b>Thank you, Your Highness.</b>

39
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,439
<b>This is the token of the prince's house.</b>

40
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,199
<b>Your Highness</b> <b>I've found out</b>

41
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,680
<b>It was indeed the one who framed you. </b>

42
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,079
<b>I know it without checking.</b>

43
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,560
<b>But</b>

44
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,519
<b>who exactly imitated your method that night ?</b>

45
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,759
<b>Sneaked into Xi Mansion to kill people</b>

46
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,240
<b>I don’t know yet</b>

47
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,040
<b>This person has amazing body skills</b>

48
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,639
<b>And he even knows your spiritual power moves very well</b>

49
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,439
<b>He can even imitate 70% to 80% of them</b>

50
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:25,579
<b>This</b>

51
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,000
<b>is really weird</b>

52
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,920
<b>Continue to investigate</b>

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,800
<b>Yes</b>

54
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,040
<b>In addition</b>

55
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,600
<b> that Shen Qianye</b>

56
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,680
<b>seems</b>

57
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,160
<b>to have sneaked in on purpose</b>

58
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,680
<b>This matter is clearly related to the Xi Family</b>

59
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,839
<b>It’s not in vain that Pei Lang</b>

60
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,600
has gone to so much trouble to frame me

61
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,839
<b>It seems that more people still believe him</b>

62
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,839
<b>Prince</b>

63
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,480
<b>You have to be more careful</b>

64
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,800
<b>I have so many enemies</b>

65
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
<b>and this one is still missing</b>

66
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,079
<b>Yes</b>

67
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,720
<b>Keep this</b>

68
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,519
<b>Don't let Shen Qianye find it</b>

69
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,160
<b>It's</b>

70
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,879
<b>The night of the full moon</b>

71
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,240
<b>Inside and outside cooperation</b>

72
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,800
<b>I'll help you break through the dark formation</b>

73
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,240
<b>Act according to the plan</b>

74
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:53,800
<b>Pei Lang </b> 

75
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,000
This is impossible

76
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,199
<b>Pei Lang</b>

77
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,759
<b>You are the murderer</b>

78
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,079
<b>The Prince's Mansion is unguarded tonight </b>

79
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,079
<b>Lao Liu</b>

80
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,920
<b>Come, come, come</b>

81
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,079
<b>You go first</b>

82
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,920
<b>Come, come, I have something to tell you</b>

83
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,680
<b>Come, come, come</b>

84
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,879
<b>Lao Liu, let me tell you</b> 

85
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,399
As for the destruction of the General's Mansion

86
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,959
<b>His Highness should give you the first credit</b>

87
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,800
<b>If you hadn't been lurking for so many years</b>

88
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
<b>How could it have been so smooth</b>

89
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,879
<b>No way</b>

90
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,839
<b>I heard</b>

91
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,920
<b>Your Highness used the lives of everyone in the Xi Mansion</b>

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,639
to exchange for a great reward from the King.

93
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,920
<b>I just feel sorry for General Xihe.</b>

94
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,480
<b>I didn't expect His Highness's heart</b>

95
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,680
to be so cruel.

96
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
<b>How can we understand</b>

97
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,680
the affairs of important people ? 

98
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,839
Thanks to General Xihe, His Highness

99
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,879
has gained enough fame. 

100
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,720
I heard that the Queen has already made up her mind.

101
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,959
<b>She wants to use the name of the Qianqiu Birthday Banquet</b>

102

to meet the noble ladies of the capital

103
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,920
. <b>Once the storm is over,</b>

104
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,279
she will find an excuse to re-elect the Crown Princess.

105
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,060
<b>Who</b>

106
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,800
<b>Who</b>

107
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,439
<b>Quickly</b>

108
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,279
<b>Begonia</b>

109
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,759
<b>Isn't this the wood soul of General Xihe?</b>

110
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,519
<b>Begonia</b>

111
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,759
<b>I'll go and report to the Crown Prince.</b>

112
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,480
<b>Hurry up</b>

113
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,919
<b>Come in</b>

114
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,879
<b>How is it</b>

115
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,279
<b>Have you found the answer you wanted</b>

116
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,159
<b>You let me find it on purpose</b>

117
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,399
<b>Every wrong has its perpetrator</b>

118
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,200
<b>Since you are seeking revenge</b>

119
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,320
<b>You shouldn't have found the wrong enemy</b>

120
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,000
<b>What else do you know</b>

121
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
<b>I also know</b>

122
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,080
<b>You are not Shen Qianye</b>

123
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,559
<b>A weak woman who has lived in seclusion for a long time</b>

124
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,960
<b>Will appear at the scene of the Xi family's house raid</b>

125
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,559
<b>Now you're climbing onto my bed</b>

126
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,519
<b>It's hard not to be suspicious</b>

127
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,879
<b>Who are you?</b>

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,919
<b>Who I am</b>

129
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,279
<b>Isn't important</b>

130
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,799
<b>The prince also said</b>

131
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,960
<b>I'm just a revenger</b>

132
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,919
<b>Giving you a chance</b>

133
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,759
<b>Kill your enemy with my own hands</b>

134
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,759
<b>Don't be impatient, prince</b>

00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,840
<b>Who is my enemy?</b>

136
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,080
<b>It's still hard to say</b>

137
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:40,960
<b>What do you mean</b>

138
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,399
<b>You've tried so hard to let me discover all this</b>

139
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,519
<b>What if it's a game within a game</b>

140
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,320
<b>I can kill you now</b>

141
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,000
<b>Will the prince be willing to do that?</b>

142
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,320
<b>Knowing the weather</b>

143
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,000
<b>Focus</b>

<b>It's all your fault</b>

<b>Come here</b>

146
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,200
<b>How about it</b>

147
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,200
<b>Don't run</b>

148
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,399
<b>The man who promised me to grow old together</b>

149

<b>turned out to be the knife-wielding man who wiped out my entire family</b>

00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,519
<b>Quick</b>

153
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,080
<b>You are using me again</b>

154
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,879

crabapple flower <b>which has the same wood soul as General Xihe</b>

<b>but he wanted to kill her so badly</b>

00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,879
<b>It seems</b>

158
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,519
<b>he is still afraid that she is not dead</b>

159
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:24,440
<b>Stupid</b>

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,720
<b>Thank you, Your Highness, for saving my life just now</b>

<b>Qianye dare not</b>

<b>Only I can do</b>

172
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,399

<b>But in fact, I helped you too, right</b>

178
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,120
<b>That day was a full moon night</b>

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,559
<b> I said</b>

186
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,840
<b>I don't like people who are too smart</b>

187
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:01,720
<b>Prince</b>

188
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,559
<b>Are you going to bite back</b>

189
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,559
<b>Why did you marry him</b>

190
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,360
<b>I have my own reasons</b>

191
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,000
<b>Shen Qianye</b>

192
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,279
You would rather be sucked by me as my antidote

193
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,480
than be my wife
