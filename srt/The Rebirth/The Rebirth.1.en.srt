<b>It's indeed General Xihe who has returned victorious</b>

<b>and the house is raided</b> 

71
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,639
Why

72
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,960
<b>Old General Xi Ming is trying to rebel</b>

73
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,759
<b>This is how he led the entire Xi family to commit suicide out of fear of crime</b>

74
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,360
. <b>Even General Xihe, who</b>

75

had just returned from the battlefield

76
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,480

<b>Committed suicide out of fear of</b>

78
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,799
crime. <b>Treason is a crime punishable by the death of nine generations of the clan.</b>

79
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,360
<b> Even General Xihe, the future Crown Princess</b>

80
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,120
, was no exception

81
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,799
. <b>It was heard that</b>

00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,759
the Crown Prince

83
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,679
shed tears for the future Crown Princess's death,

84
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,120
and some ministers

85
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,360
even reported him to the court.

86
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,679
<b> How could</b>

87
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,399

00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,399

<b>Hurry up and move here. </b> <b>In just a few days , our Xi Mansion</b>

90
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,159
has gone from being a loyal and good general admired by everyone

91
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,639
to a traitor hated by everyone.

92
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,120
<b>Hurry, hurry, hurry</b>

93
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,320

<b>Wedding dress of the former Crown Princess Xihe</b>

<b>Thinking back then</b>

101
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,120
<b>The relationship between Your Highness the Crown Prince and General Xihe</b>

102
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,240
<b>was known to everyone</b>

103

<b>Enviable</b> <b>Now what about now</b>

104
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,399
<b>So pitiful</b>

105
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,440
<b>Yes </b> 

106
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,279
Your Highness the Crown Prince

107
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,639
<b>There is no time to waste</b>

00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,799
<b>Pei Su</b>

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,200
<b>Why is he here</b>

110
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,440
<b>This wedding dress is really gorgeous</b>

111
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,720
<b>If it is given to the new dancer in Chaomu Tower</b>

112
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,039
<b>She will definitely outshine all the other beauties</b>

113

<b>Uncle Wang</b>

114
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,559
<b>This is Xihe's wedding dress</b>

115
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,159
<b>I won't tolerate your abuse like this</b>

116
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,039
<b>Whoever grabs it will own it</b>

117
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,720
<b>The wedding dress is</b>

118
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,679
<b>The throne is</b>

119
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,879
<b>Where did this little mouse come from?</b>

120
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:46,679
<b>It's boring</b>

121
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,200
<b>Who are you? </b>

122
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,039
<b>Why are you doing this?</b>

123
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,840
<b>Commoner Shen Qianye</b>

124
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,240
<b>Once received favors from General Xihe</b>

125
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,440
<b>I think if the general were still alive,</b>

126
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,240
he would not want to see Prince Pei Su

127
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,559
treat the wedding dress like that

128
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,879
, so he resorted to this desperate measure. 

129
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,360
Given Xihe's personality,

130
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,279
it would indeed be like this.

131
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,519
<b>Miss, please stand up.</b>

132
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,879
<b>I'll take my leave.</b>

<b>Now</b>

134
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,480
is not the time to recognize you.

135
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,320
<b>I will definitely find out</b>

136
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,679
<b>who wiped out my entire Xi family.</b>

00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,440
<b>Second Miss, are you okay?</b> 

138
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,159
I'm fine.

139
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,840
<b>You're finally back.</b>

140
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,919
<b>I heard that you caused quite a stir in the Xi Mansion</b>

141

and angered the prince. 

142
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,600
Are you going to rebel?

143
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,559
<b>I advise you not to provoke me now.</b> 

144
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,440
Where do you get the tone from?

145
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,639
<b>If it weren't for the fact that the Crown Princess's family had just died,</b>

146
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,559
<b>The whole capital is in a panic</b>

147
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,320
<b>I don't want to cause trouble for the Shen family</b>

<b>Otherwise</b>

149
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,240
<b>I would have beaten you to death</b>

150
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,879
<b>Get out</b>

151
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:14,960
<b>You get out too</b>

152
