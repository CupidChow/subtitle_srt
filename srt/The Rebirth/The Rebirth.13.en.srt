<b>We have investigated </b> <b>it</b>

<b>It was Jian Eying</b>

<b>She</b>

15

<b>Cranberry flower</b>

<b>General Xihe</b>

<b>Didn’t strange traces of wood soul attack appear there?</b>

35
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,439
<b>It should be some kind of forbidden technique</b>

36
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,439
<b>Yes</b>

37
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,520
<b>The case has not been clarified yet</b>

38
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,199
<b>The palace is anxious to close the case</b>

<b>Great revenge has been taken</b>

<b>When my father found out he was deceived</b> <b>he</b>

<b>he had thrown her into a mass grave long ago</b>

53
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,000
<b>It seemed that they used</b>

54
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,800

<b>Jane Eying</b>

56
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,520

<b>Where were you going just now?</b>

58
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,600
<b>I am losing control of myself now</b>

<b>It 's okay</b>

60
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,040
<b>This is all the Queen's fault</b>

61

<b>If it's a big mistake</b> 

62

<b>The night the Xi family was massacred</b>

72
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,160

<b>Did I go out?</b>

76
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,639

81
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,040

<b>The scar on my left arm</b>

<b> Last time </b>

<b>I haven't even prepared the money for the journey</b>

<b>How can I rashly take you away?</b>

108
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,639
<b>Last time you rejected me by claiming you were poisoned</b>

109
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,839
<b>That was right</b>

185
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,879
be compared with General Xihe

186
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,159
<b>In my Cangwu country, since ancient times</b>

187
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:18,799
<b>One person, one soul</b>

188
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,120
<b>Wood souls can never be exactly the same</b>

189
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,200
<b>Maybe it's just a coincidence</b>

190
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,200
<b>You are Xihe</b>

191
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,000
<b>Your Highness</b>

192
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,799
<b>What do you think if Xihe were alive</b>

193
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,720
<b>Will you be like me</b>

194
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,799
<b>a</b>

195
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,679
waste who can't even awaken the Wood Soul

196
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:43,879
<b>Besides</b>

197
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,039
<b>Do you think General Xihe</b>

198
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,120
<b>will treat you like this</b>

199
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,879
<b>She can't come back</b>

200
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,720
<b>It's getting late</b>

201
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,720
<b>Your Highness should go back and rest</b>

202
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:08,759
<b>I will marry you</b>

203
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:11,759
<b>to be the Crown Princess</b>

204
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,279
<b>I will propose tomorrow</b>

205
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,559
<b>Meeting His Royal Highness</b>

206
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,000
<b>I know you married me for a purpose</b>

207
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,440
<b>My purpose</b>

208
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,879
<b>Haven't you always known it</b>

209
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,200
<b>I love Your Highness</b>

210
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,039
<b>You are really not Xihe</b>

211
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,919
<b>So Your Highness</b>

212
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,080
<b>Is it just because I look like General Xihe</b>

213
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,240
<b>I'm just a substitute</b>

214
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,639
<b>No</b>

215
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,960
<b>The queen's mourning period has not yet ended</b>

216
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,360
I'm afraid it's not appropriate for me to get married.

217
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,799
My mother's last wish

218
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,879
was for me to get married and start a family.

219
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:15,960
Miss Shen

220
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,720
, I'm willing to offer you a generous gift to marry

221
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,519
you.

222
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,679
I hope you'll consider it carefully.
