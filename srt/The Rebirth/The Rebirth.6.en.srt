00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,239
<b>Your Majesty</b>

2
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,359
<b>Even without the Wood Soul</b>

3
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,599
<b>I would still be a good sword</b>

4
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,840
<b>You should use this trick against the Crown</b>

5
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,239
Prince <b>Your Majesty</b>

6
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,640
<b>The Crown Prince has surrounded the palace with his men</b>

7
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,359
<b>The opportunity has come</b>

8
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,000
<b>Uncle, I'm sorry</b>

9
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,599
<b>Please come with me</b>

10
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,039
<b>The Crown Prince is so arrogant</b>

11
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,879
<b>He broke into the palace without any explanation</b> 

12
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,280
He just wanted to arrest people

13
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,599
<b>You won't even let me die with a clear conscience</b>

14
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,599
<b>Uncle</b>

15
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,919
, I'm following the King's orders

16
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,759
<b>To thoroughly investigate the Xi family massacre</b>

17
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,120
<b>Now</b>

18
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,599
<b>My nephew suspects you are involved in this case</b>

19
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,479
<b>Where's the evidence</b>

20
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
<b>This token</b>

21
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,439
<b>is yours, uncle</b>

22
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,439
<b>But it happened to appear in Xi Mansion</b>

23
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,719
<b>Little Uncle Wang</b>

24
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,879
<b>Can you explain something?</b>

25
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,000
<b>Bring it up</b>

26
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,599
<b>A few days ago, there was a thief in the palace</b>

27
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,919
<b>Who happened to steal this token of mine</b>

28
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,560
<b>I have to thank my nephew</b>

29
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,759
<b>for finding my lost property</b>

30
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,080
<b>so that I wouldn't wrongly accuse him</b>

31
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,159
<b>It's a coincidence</b>

32
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,680
<b>I thought he was just trying to steal the palace's property</b>

33
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,599
<b>But I didn't expect that this token</b>

34
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,240
<b>was in my nephew's hands</b>

35
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,199
<b>Could it be that</b>

36
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,240
<b> he was instructed by someone to</b>

37
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,519
frame me  

38
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,680
Your Highness

39
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,480
<b>Save</b>

40
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,240
<b>In that case</b>

41
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,399
<b>this thief</b>

42
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,720
<b>will be handed over to Your Highness for disposal</b>

43
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,439
<b>It turned out to be a misunderstanding</b>

44
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,040
<b>I'm sorry to bother you, little uncle.</b>

45
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,560
<b>I hope you'll forgive me.</b>

46
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,319


47
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:03,120
No problem. <b>I hope</b>

48
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,319
you're all right, little uncle.

49
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,199
<b>No problem.</b> <b>Don't worry, Your Highness.</b> 

50
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll take my leave.

51
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,180


52
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,439
Let's go.  

53
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,800
Miss Shen guessed early in the morning that the Crown Prince

54
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,600
would cause trouble in the near future.

55
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,480
<b>She was right.</b> <b>Yes</b>

56
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,680
, Your Highness. <b>This is the Lingxi incense that Miss Shen gave you.</b>

57
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,399
<b>Thank you for giving her the chance.</b>

58
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,560
<b>It's up to her now.</b>

59
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,680
<b>Miss Shen</b>

60
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:13,879
<b>Your Highness</b>

61
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,360
<b>Your Highness</b>

62
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,319
, save me. <b>Save me.</b>

63
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,639
<b>Thank you, Crown Prince, for saving me.</b> 

64
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,000
Miss Shen, there's no need to thank me.

65
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,560
<b>As long as you're okay.</b>

66
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,040
<b>This</b>

67
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,839
<b>This is all because of the little prince</b>

68
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,720
<b>This is unreasonable</b>

69
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,600
<b>It's simply lawless</b>

70
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,800
<b>Last time, His Royal Highness the Crown Prince asked me</b>

71
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,000
<b>If I was willing to go with you</b>

72
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,759
<b>I dreamed day and night of leaving that devil's den</b>

73
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,959
But the prince won't let me go

74
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,319
<b>Your Highness</b> <b>I even stabbed him</b>

75
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,720
<b>What should I do</b>

76
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,199
<b>Can you save me</b>

77
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,800
<b>Can you take me away from the prince</b>

78
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,319
<b>Send me back to the Shen Mansion</b>

79
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,199
<b>As far as I know</b>

80
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,759
<b>The little prince's mansion has many spirit slaves</b>

81
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,560
<b>Why does he target the girl so much</b>

82
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,920
<b>I</b>

83
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,800
<b>I</b>

84
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,759
<b>Don't be afraid</b>

85
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,399
<b>I know the prince's secret</b>

86
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,759
<b>The opportunity has come</b>

87
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,519
<b>What opportunity</b>

88
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,160
<b>Use his hand</b>

89
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,879
<b>Send me back to the Shen Mansion safely</b>

90
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:01,879
<b>By the way</b>

91
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,279
<b>The Crown Prince came so quickly</b>

92
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,120
<b>I guess there must be traitors in your mansion</b>

93
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,279
<b>Why not use the same trick</b>

94
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,519
against them

95
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,000
<b>Find them</b> <b>You really put a lot of effort into marrying the Crown Prince</b> 

96
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,959
You're so flattered

97
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,319
Indeed

98
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,839
<b>No man</b>

99
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:17,240
<b>would be willing to marry the plaything of his mortal enemy</b>

100
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,279
<b>And you even rejected him</b>

101
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,399
<b>So</b>

102
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,720
<b>The best way to gain Pei Lang's trust is</b>

103
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,879
<b>to betray me and you</b>

104
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,279
<b>Prince</b>

105
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,800
<b>Are you afraid that I will make it real?</b>

106
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,679
<b>Wouldn't that be more interesting?</b>

107
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,679
<b>But I'm very curious</b>

108
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,000
<b>What gift did you prepare for the Crown Prince?</b>

109
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,799
<b>Of course</b>

110
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,080
<b>Your fatal weakness</b>

111
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,279
<b>Spiritual power is weakest on full moon nights</b>

112
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,600
<b>It will definitely heal</b>

113
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,039
<b>If you're serious</b>

114
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,799
<b>I 'm scared</b>

115
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,360
<b>That's not enough</b>

116
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,039
<b>This is how the play needs to be acted</b>

117
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,679
<b>to be real</b>

118
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:41,840
<b>Your Majesty</b>

119
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,679
<b>I see you really like that Lingxi incense</b>

120
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,879
<b>You've been burning it for several days</b>

121
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,559
<b>You don't like it</b>

122
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,600
<b>If that's the case</b>

123
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
<b>Then I'll throw it away</b>

124
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,720
<b>Don't move</b>

125
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,519
<b>Let's talk about it in a few days</b>

126
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,000
<b>Yes</b>

127
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,639
<b>Prince</b>

128
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:02,559
<b>Prince</b>

129
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,559
<b>How is your injury?</b>

130
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:07,960
<b>No problem</b>

131
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,960
<b>Let's talk business</b>

132
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,559
<b>Pei Lang believes you</b>

133
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,960
<b>I have already made an agreement with Pei Lang</b>

134
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,360
<b>He will take me out of the palace</b>

135
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,440
<b>and send me home safely</b>

136
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,960
<b>I will tell him your secret</b>

137
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,000
<b>After I return home</b>

138
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,519
<b>I will ask my father to submit the engagement letter</b>

139
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,919
<b>and get the qualification to attend the Queen's Autumn Banquet</b>

140
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,840
<b>Every official's family in the royal capital</b>

141
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,480
<b>can only submit one engagement letter</b>

<b>Your cheap father</b>

143
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,919
<b>will definitely give it to Shen Qianling</b>

<b>Prince</b> 

145
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,279
You underestimate me too much

146
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,440
<b>I have my own way</b>

147
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,960
<b>But you</b>

148
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,440
<b>His Royal Highness the Crown Prince knows your weakness</b>

149
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,600
<b>On the night of the full moon</b>

150
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,759
<b>You must be careful</b>

151
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,879
<b>Don't die</b>

152
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,519
<b>Don't worry about it</b>

153
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,759
<b>Miss</b>

154
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,399
<b>His Royal Highness asked me to tell you</b>

155
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,320
<b>Get in the carriage</b>

156
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,559
<b>You can go home</b>

<b> His Royal Highness</b>

<b>Since that's the case</b>

160
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,679
<b>What His Royal Highness wants</b>

161
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,360
<b> Your Majesty </b>

<b>Your Royal Highness</b>

<b>Then Miss Shen should be fine</b>

165
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,360
<b>I heard from the brothers in the palace</b>

<b>that she had injured the Crown Prince before</b>

167
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,080
<b>and was thrown into a dark room</b>

168

<b>and tortured for several days</b>

169
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,480
<b>Interesting</b>

170
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,320
<b>It seems</b>

171
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,759
<b>The show is about to begin</b>
