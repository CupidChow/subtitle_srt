00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,040
<b>Why</b>

2
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,719
<b>Are you still thinking about your Crown Prince?</b>

3
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,959
<b>The Prince is jealous</b>

4
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,599
<b>You haven't answered me yet</b>

5
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,120
<b>Why do you insist on being the Crown Princess</b>

6
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,480
? <b>Prince</b>

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,480
<b>In the game of thrones</b>

8
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,239
<b>only those closest to the throne</b>

9
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,120
<b>can make the most deadly moves</b>

10
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,760
<b> Only if he trusts me and relies on me</b>

11
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,760
<b> and regards me as his closest ally </b>

12
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,680
<b>can I grasp his secrets and manipulate his decisions</b>

13
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,560
when he is most vulnerable 

14
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,959
<b>and even change the direction of the entire court</b>

15
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,760
<b>Empty words</b>

16
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,159
<b>When you have power</b>

17
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,280
<b>I will be the first one to be silenced</b>

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,840
<b>If I'm not mistaken</b>

19
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,960
<b>Pei Lang will take action against you soon</b>

20
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,280
<b>The Xi family rebelled and the people were outraged</b>

21
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,360
<b>and they will definitely demand the elimination of the remaining evil</b>

22
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,000
<b>When the Xi family was wiped out</b>

23
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,120
<b>Your phoenix flower bloomed in the Xi family</b>

24
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,199
<b>With this flaw</b>

25
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,280
<b>You think he will miss the opportunity</b>

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
<b>You are not stupid</b>

27
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,479
<b>The same</b>

28
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,439
<b>Since that is the case</b>

29
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,800
<b>I will wait and see</b>

30
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,639
<b>I also ask the prince to help me awaken the wood soul</b>

31
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,879
<b>From now on</b>

32
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,000
<b>I am your knife</b>

33
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,439
<b>If you don’t send</b>

me off <b>You can’t bear to see me get hurt</b>

35
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,199
<b>Then why don’t you persuade me not to go to the battlefield</b>

36
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,199
<b>You are a natural born general</b>

37
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,520
<b> I cherish you</b>

38
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,759
<b>Respect you</b>

39
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,159
<b>How could I trap you in the boudoir</b>

40
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,240
<b>Ahe </b>

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,840
<b>Remember</b>

42
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,719
<b>No matter when</b>

43
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,280
<b>I will never break your wings</b>

44
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,319
<b>Father and Mother</b>

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,480
<b>An unfilial daughter is as blind as a blind man</b>

46
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,839
<b>This gave Pei Lang the opportunity</b>

47
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,680
<b>Don't worry</b>

48
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,360
<b>I will definitely clear the Xi family's grievances</b>

49
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,759
<b>Let Pei Lang</b>

<b>Begonia</b>

00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,360
<b>I'll go report to the Crown Prince</b>

53

<b>Quickly</b>

<b>Your Majesty</b>

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,120
<b>What you should hear</b>

56
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,199
<b>Did she hear everything</b>

57
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,000
<b>Yes</b>

58
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,560
<b>She also left this</b>

59
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,480
<b>Begonia</b>

60
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,040
<b>It seems she wanted to test the Crown Prince</b>

61
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,680
<b>Change it to this</b>

62
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,319
<b>Phoenix Flower</b>

63
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,120
<b>If my good nephew</b>

<b>knew it was me who came today</b>

65
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,319
<b>He would not leave me any chance of survival</b>

<b>Your Majesty</b>

67
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,319
<b>As you expected</b>

<b>Your Highness the Crown Prince</b>

69
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,560
<b>Tomorrow at the meeting in the capital,</b>

70
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,800
there will be a big move. 

71
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,720
You are worthy of being my good nephew.

72
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,199
<b>Your Majesty</b>

73
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,680

<b>Something bad has happened to Your Majesty.</b>

<b>Your Majesty</b>

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,199
<b>The people of the capital have gathered at the palace gate,</b>

77
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,120
<b>demanding</b> 

78
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,480
the elimination of the remaining members of the Xi family.

79
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,199
<b>If public discontent spreads</b>

80
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,040
, the consequences will be disastrous.

81
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,399
<b>I hope Your Majesty will</b>

82
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,639

<b>Your Majesty</b>

84

<b>There have been rumors in the streets and alleys that</b>

<b>the prince's wood soul, Phoenix Flower,</b>

86
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,160
<b>had appeared in the Xi family</b>

87
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,519
and had tried every means to stop the raid on the Xi family.

88
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,519
<b>And he also spoke nonsense</b>

89
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,600
about the Crown Prince's raid on the family.

90
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,800
<b>The people all think</b>

91
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,199
<b>The prince covets the throne</b>

92
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,120
and has long been involved with the Xi family.

93
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,680
<b>The prince has always acted recklessly.</b>

94
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,600
<b>I have also heard that the prince</b>

95
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,759
is involved with that forbidden technique and

96
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,439
has been trying to achieve immortality.

97
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,120
<b>I think you should</b>

98
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,360
<b>Okay</b>

99
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,920
<b>Stop talking</b>

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,839
<b>Your Majesty</b>

101
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,720
<b>Father, please calm</b>

102
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,040
down. <b> Ministers</b>

103
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,720
<b>I am just anxious to share your worries.</b>

104
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,519
<b>Your son volunteers</b>

105
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,160
to investigate the remnants of the Xi family.

106
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,439
<b>In that case</b>

107
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,120
<b>Lang'er</b>

108
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,199
<b>I will leave this matter to you.</b>

109
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,439
<b>But you must remember</b>

110
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,120
<b>Don't wrongly accuse your uncle.</b>

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,800
<b>Yes</b>

112
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,120
<b>Lang'er</b>

113
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,079
<b>Do you blame your father?</b>

114
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,399
<b> I dare not</b>

115
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,600
favor your uncle.

116
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,519
<b>It is because I am not as good as my uncle.</b>

117
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,439
<b>You are self-aware.</b>

118
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,759
<b>This is your advantage.</b>

119
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,639
<b>It is because your mother's family has dragged you down.</b>

120
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,800
<b>You have been isolated as the crown</b>

121
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:38,160
prince and have always been under tremendous pressure.

122
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,120
<b> I will not let you down.</b>

123
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,199
<b> Without talent,</b>

124
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,279
hard work alone is not enough.

125
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,839
<b>Look at your uncle.</b>

126
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,360
Although he is lazy and

127
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,000
a little eccentric

128
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,600
, he has the noble Wood Soul

129
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,639
and the strongest spiritual power.

130
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,480
Please rest assured, father

131
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,480
. I will redouble my efforts.

132
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,560
That's very good.

133
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,080
I have lived in the capital for many years

134
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,559
and have never been here.

135
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,799
You know how to find a place

136
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,200
.

137
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,720
I often came here with my parents when I was young.

138
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,799
What is this?

139
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,440
This incense is called Lingxi Incense

140
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,519
and is unique to Lingxi Tower. It

141
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,639
was my mother's favorite.

142
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,039
It is quite good.

143
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,600
I heard that His Royal Highness the Crown Prince

144
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,559
has recently been instigating the ministers

145
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,480
to say that you are secretly colluding with the Xi family and

146
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,399
plotting such a vicious scheme.

147
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,600
<b>Since you have evidence against him</b>

148
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,480
, why don't you just expose him?

149
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,840
<b>The Xi family was powerful,</b>

150
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,000
but they were slaughtered overnight. 

151
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,679
It was a godsend opportunity. 

152
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,759
<b>If you don't make good use of it</b>

153
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,639
, wouldn't you be ashamed of the dead souls

154
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,200
? <b>Don't you think so?</b>

155
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,679
<b>Your Highness is right</b>

156
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,919
. <b>Your Highness and the Crown Prince are truly evenly matched.</b>

157
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,120
<b>To you,</b>

158
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,600
<b>the forty-four lives of the Xi family</b>

159
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,440
are nothing but

160
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,679
pawns in your struggle for power and profit.

161
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:43,639
<b>That's natural.</b>

162
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,320
<b>Have you forgotten?</b>

163
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,799
<b>Pei Lang is my nephew.</b>

164
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,679
<b>We have the same blood flowing in our veins.</b>

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,519
<b>Recently, people are talking about</b>

166
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,559
<b>the Crown Prince's wolfish ambitions.</b>

167
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,080
<b>Your Highness must be careful.</b>

168
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,080
<b>If you have time to worry about me</b>

169
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,399
, you should worry more about yourself.

170
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,600
<b>What are you worried about me for?</b>

171
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,960
<b>It's really not easy</b>

172
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,399
for your body to awaken the Wood Soul.

173
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,559
<b>I'm willing</b>

174
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,000
to pay any price.

175
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,639
<b>Forgot to ask you</b>

176
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,559
why you are so obsessed with revenge for the Xi family.

177
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,759
<b>The Xi family</b>

178
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,159
has done me a favor. 

179
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,039
It's all in the past.

180
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,600
<b>Being grateful</b>

181
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,840
is good.

182
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,840
<b>But are you sure Xihe is dead?</b>

183
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,600
<b>The Xi family was wiped out.</b>

184
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,240
<b>Everyone knows it.</b>

185
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,759
<b>If you look closely,</b>

<b>you and Xihe are really similar.</b>

187
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,000
<b>Your Majesty is joking.</b>

188
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
<b>It's not the looks.</b> 

189
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,360
It's the personality.

190
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,279
<b>There's a bit of a resemblance.</b>

191
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,080
<b>Which point</b>

192
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,320
<b>Unrepentant</b>

193
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,000
<b>Your Majesty</b>

194
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,440
<b>Xihe has something to report</b>

195
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,039
<b>General Xihe</b>

196
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,000
<b>You have worked hard guarding the border</b> <b>I</b>

197
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,399
<b>want to report the prince</b>

198
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,639
<b> for his excessive extravagance</b>

199
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,919
<b>and I earnestly request the king</b>

200
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,639
<b>to reduce the royal palace's expenses by half</b>

201
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:51,559
<b>This</b>

202
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,360
<b>reduce the royal palace's expenses by half</b>

203
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,120
<b>Your Majesty</b>

204
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,080
<b>Xihe went to the border</b>

205
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,120
<b>and witnessed firsthand the hardships of people's lives</b>

206
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,559
<b>but the prince</b>

207
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,759
<b>was extremely extravagant</b>

208
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,399
<b>and became a borer of my Cangwu</b>

209
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,919
<b>looking for natural treasures every day</b>

210
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:05,919
<b>I think</b>

211
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,399
<b>this is of no benefit to the people</b>

212
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,519
<b>General Xihe</b>

213
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,840
<b>what you said</b>

214
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,759
<b>It's a bit too biased</b>

215
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,440
<b>The prince's expenses</b>

216
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,720
<b>concern the reputation of our royal family</b>

217
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,759
<b>However</b>

218
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,759
<b>the people and their livelihood</b>

219
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,279
<b>must also be considered</b>

220
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,000
<b>so</b>

221
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,039
<b>how about reducing the palace's expenses by half</b>

222
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,200
and distributing them to the border

223
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,159
<b>this</b>

224
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,639
<b>I will obey your majesty's order</b>

<b>Your</b>

226
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,360
Majesty is a bit too biased 

227
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,639
if there is a deep brotherly love

228
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,600
<b>even His Royal Highness the Crown Prince does not treat him this way</b>

229
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:55,919
<b>that is</b>

230
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:56,960
<b>General Xihe</b>

231
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,519
<b>please stay</b>

<b>The general's great love</b>

233

<b>is a blessing to the people of our dynasty</b>

234
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,320
<b>but there is one thing I can't understand</b>

235
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,440
<b>why the general dislikes me so much</b>

236
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,320
<b>You spend all your money on pleasure</b>

237
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,840

238
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,360
<b>You and I have different ideals and cannot work together</b>

239
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,879
<b>What a different ideal</b>

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,399
<b>General</b>

<b>You will regret it</b>

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,559
<b>I never regret it</b>

<b>You must not let Pei Su</b>

<b>Eating the ancient banyan fruit that promotes the growth of the Wood Soul</b>
