00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:25,519
<b>Why did you think of asking me to drink with you today?</b>

2
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,480
<b>Why</b>

3
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:30,680
<b> You want to get drunk with the Crown Prince</b>

4
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,719
<b>And we have to choose a day</b> 

5
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,359
Why did you suddenly think of drinking?

6
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,680
<b>Why</b> 

7
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,120
You want to get drunk with the Crown Prince

8
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,480
<b>And we have to choose a day</b>

9
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,959
<b>I'm ready</b>

11
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,439


12
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,199
I'm ready to accompany you anytime <b>Ahe</b> 

13
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,560
Pei Su will be executed tomorrow

14
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,840
<b> Have you heard</b>

15
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,560
?  <b>You suspect</b>

16
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,319
me  

17
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,199
No  <b>I</b> <b>You suspect</b>

18
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,159
I poisoned the wine

19
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,199
<b>To knock you out</b> <b>To save Pei Su</b>

20
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,719
<b>Pei Lang</b>

21

<b>I thought you were different</b>

22
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,439
<b>I'm sorry, Ahe</b>

23
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,560
<b>Today</b>

24
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,680
<b>is my mother's birthday</b>

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,639
<b>Ahe</b>

26
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
<b>It's all my fault</b>

27
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,319
<b>From now on</b>

28
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,560
<b>there will be no more grudges between you and me</b>

29
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:43,879
<b>Okay</b>

30
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,159
<b>Okay</b>

31
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,639
<b>Pei Lang</b>

32
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,280
<b>Perhaps you are indeed the person</b>

in this world <b>who knows me best</b>

34
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,039
<b>Unfortunately</b>

35
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,680
<b>I know you too</b>

36
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,800
<b>Prince</b>

37
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,040
<b>You are going to die tomorrow anyway</b>

38
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,279
<b>Why not leave all the money to me</b> 

39
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,439
You don't know what is good for you

40
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,839
<b>Leave quickly</b>

41
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,399
<b>Ah He</b>

42
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,560
<b>Remember</b>

43
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,399
<b>Wood Soul is the Art</b>

44
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,920
<b>Body Movement is the Tao</b>

45
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,600
<b>The former is like the surging tide</b>

46
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,079
<b>sometimes fluctuates</b>

47
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,399
<b>The latter is like a towering boulder</b>

48

<b>unchanging</b>

49
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,839
<b>Don't be afraid of losing your Wood Soul</b>

50
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,879
<b>Control the Art with the Tao</b>

51
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,040
<b>The weak can defeat the strong</b>

<b>What's wrong</b>

56
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,040
<b>It's not good</b>

57
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:51,759
<b>Pei Su</b>

<b>Do you blame me</b>

<b>My life</b>

<b>How do you know</b>

75
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,519
<b>Knock three times</b>

76
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,879
<b>To keep the troops in place</b> <b>and</b>

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,839
<b>I will always</b>

79
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,439
<b>I will never believe you again</b>

80
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,519
<b>I thought</b>

81

<b>you wouldn't remember</b>

82
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:08,959
<b>You forgot</b>

83
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,399
<b>I have read every one of your battle reports</b>

84
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,839
<b>It was obviously not you who destroyed the Xi family</b>

85
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,079
<b>but you used forbidden techniques for me</b>

86
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,480
<b>I should have believed you</b>

87
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,639
<b>There is no need to say more</b>

<b>The token is missing</b>

<b>It's my fault</b>

92
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,399
<b>Okay</b>

93
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,480
<b>Look how scared you are</b>

<b>recorded in the library</b>

<b>Using wolfsbane flower juice as medicine</b>

106
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,320
<b>can repair ancient books</b>

<b>and restore fragments</b>

108
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,639
<b>It is</b>

109

<b>You have restored the ancient books</b>

110
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,840
<b>which is equivalent to</b>

111
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,159
repairing a dead branch for the statue of the Evergreen Goddess

112
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,000
<b>It wants to thank you</b>

113

<b>Asu</b>

115
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,120
<b>Look at how my potted plant is growing</b>

116
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,879
<b>It is lush and leafy</b>

117
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,759
<b>very good</b> <b>Not good enough</b>

118
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,919
<b>Look at its many branches</b>

<b>Looks lush and green</b> 

120
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,960

121
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,559
<b>Will it overshadow the</b>

123
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,519
