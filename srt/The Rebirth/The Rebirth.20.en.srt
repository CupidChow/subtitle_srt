00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,920
<b>I didn't expect that after being seriously injured,</b>

2
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:27,719
Pei Su's wood soul was still so powerful.

3
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,920
<b>It's a pity that I couldn't completely control him and turn him into a blood slave.</b>

4
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,719
<b>Your Majesty</b>

5
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,599
<b>Now that the Xi family has fallen</b>

6
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,159
, the biggest worry in my heart has been resolved

7
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,359
. <b>It's more important to take care of your body.</b>

8
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,680
<b>As for the prince</b>

9
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,000
, there will always be a time to deal with him in the future.

10
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,680
<b>Although I failed to kill him with one blow</b>

11
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:53,000
, he will never be able to regain the memory of tonight.  <b>The title of</b>

12
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,959
slaughtering an entire family

13
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,200
and harming loyal and good people

14
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,519
<b>I will give it to my good brother.</b>

15
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,080
<b>No</b>

16
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,400
<b>Impossible</b>

17
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,599
<b>This is all fake.</b>

18
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,400
<b>Father clearly told me</b>

19
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,680
that it was only to demote the Xi family.

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,639
<b>How could it be</b>

21
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,680
<b>How could this be</b>

22
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,680
<b>It's you</b>

23
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,879
<b>The murderer must be you</b>

24
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,639
<b>My father is the most wise monarch in the world</b>

25
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,520
<b>How could he do such a thing</b>

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,680
<b>Pei Lang</b>

27
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,000
<b>Can the statue of the Evergreen Goddess deceive people?</b>

28
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,560
<b>You and I are both royals</b>

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,120
<b>You should know it clearly in your hearts</b>

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,599
<b>No</b>

31
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,439
<b>It's fake</b> 

32
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,360
It's all fake  <b>Step back</b>

33
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,240
<b>You traitors</b>

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,879
<b>How dare you seriously</b>

35
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,080
injure His Royal Highness the Crown Prince <b>You deserve to die</b>

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,719
<b>The Crown</b>

37
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,319
Prince may be of noble status

38
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,400
<b>But he is still a child after</b>

39
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,360
all <b>It's inevitable that he will act emotionally</b>

40
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,479
<b>If</b>

41
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,479
<b>I will definitely assist Your Highness</b>

00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,719
<b>Get on with it</b>

46
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,479
<b>Go away</b>

<b>Are you okay?</b>

49
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,960
<b>King Cangwu must have calculated it well</b>

50
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,319
<b>Today is the night of the full moon</b>

51
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,919
<b>That's why he chose today to take action</b>

52
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,000
<b>Don't worry about me</b>

53
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,000
<b>Go quickly</b>

<b>Pei Lang won't hold out for long</b>

55
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,439
<b>They will catch up soon</b>

<b> With the way you are now</b>

57
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,040
<b>How can I</b>

58
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,480
<b>If you were here today</b>

59
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,600
<b>I would leave without hesitation</b>

<b>Excuse me</b>

71
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,000
<b>Have you seen a girl?</b>

72
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:40,759
<b>Girl</b>

73
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,839
<b>Sir, your injury</b>

<b>Who is that girl to you?</b>

75
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,920
<b>Is she so important?</b>

76
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,399
<b>To be honest</b>

77
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,040
<b>She is my wife</b>

78
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,639
<b>We were returning from the Western Regions after doing business</b>

79
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,759
<b>But we encountered bandits</b>

80
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,079
<b>That's why we got injured and lost contact</b>

81
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,240
<b>No matter what, I must find her</b>

82
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,360
<b>You saved my life</b>

83
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,680
<b>I'll repay you someday</b>

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,439
<b>Asu </b>

<b>Where are you going?</b>

87
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,360
<b>Afu</b>

88
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,000
<b>Let's go</b>

<b>Let's go</b>

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,399
<b>Husband </b>

91
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,279
<b>You used your blood in the medicine</b>

92
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:37,879
<b>More than that</b>

93
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,439
<b> Do you know how much effort it took</b>

94
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,759
for me to carry you here

95
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,879
<b>I'll tell you</b>

96
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,720
<b>These</b>

97
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,120
<b>But these are all you owe me.</b>

98
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,920
<b>You must pay them</b>

99
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,560
back one by one

100
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,079

101
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,079
<b>With interest</b>

102
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,879
<b>Okay</b>

103
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,199
<b>This village is called Qiandeng Village</b>

104
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,800
<b>Because the villagers are good at making lanterns</b>

105
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,399
<b>It's not far from the capital</b>

106
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:16,040
<b>But it's quite secluded in the valley</b>

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,800
<b>I think</b>

108
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,360
<b>They won't catch up with us for the time being</b>

109
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,199
<b>We should leave as soon as possible</b>

110
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,639
<b>To avoid any more trouble</b>

111
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:24,920
<b>Yes</b>

112
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,519
<b>But Aunt Wang said that</b>

113
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,439
there was a heavy rain here a few days ago

114
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,600
<b>The only road out of the village was destroyed</b>

115
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,319
<b>What should I do</b>

116
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,920
<b>Or</b>

117
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,319

<b>It was not until later that I found out.</b>

188
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,960
<b>It was my brother who wanted to make me a blood slave.</b>

189
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,120
<b>But because he was not proficient in the technique,</b>

190
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,120
he failed.

191
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,480
<b>So every full moon night,</b>

192
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,960
I would go crazy

193
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,440
and want to suck blood.

194
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,559
<b>I hate myself. I</b>

195
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,679
am afraid that I will become a bloodthirsty monster.

196
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,440
<b>Until later</b>

197
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,120
<b>I found a way to suppress it</b>

198
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,720
, which is to practice forbidden techniques.

199
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,399
<b>But I didn't expect that</b>

200
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,639
<b>this was also part of my brother's plan.</b>

201
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:35,240
<b>Every full moon night</b>

202
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,279
<b>my brother would use burning coca</b>

203
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,320
<b>to seduce me</b>

204
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,399
<b>to kill people according to his will</b>

205
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,600
<b>But every time I woke up</b>

206
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,639
<b>I didn't remember anything</b>

207
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,279
<b>It's okay</b>

208
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,559
<b>In the future</b>

209
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,879
<b>We will face it together</b>

210
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,279
<b>Go home</b>

211
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,000
<b>Let's go</b>

212
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,919
<b>Okay</b>

213
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,919
<b>I told you not to play with me</b>

214
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,480
<b>Come on</b>

215
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,559
<b>Let's go</b>

216
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,639
<b>Go slowly</b>

217
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,320
<b>Go slowly</b>
