<b>and you still need me to save you</b>

4
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,879
<b>You are also more stupid than I thought</b>

5
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:43,519
<b>Your Highness owes me a favor now</b>

6
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,840
<b>Remember</b>

7
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,519
this in the future <b>You'd better survive first</b>

8
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,040
<b>Your Highness the Crown Prince should be on his way</b>

9
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,719
<b>Have you thought about how to lie?</b>

10
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,920
It's perfect 

11
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,080
<b>Your Highness</b>

12
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,439
<b>Your Highness saw it with your own eyes</b>

13

<b>You should believe me now</b>

14
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,919
<b>Your Highness planned everything</b>

15
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,319
<b>How could you not know</b>

16
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,280
<b>Didn't you say</b>

17
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,240
<b>that he would become weaker on the night of the full moon</b>

18
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,680
<b>That was false news Pei Su gave me</b>

19
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,439
because he knew I had ulterior motives

20
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,520
<b>He wanted to use you to kill me</b>

21
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,560
<b>Your Highness, do you know that there is a kind of drug? </b>

22
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,520
<b>Within half an hour after taking it</b>

23
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,000
<b>Your power will be greatly increased</b>

24

<b>Ahe</b>

25
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,639
<b>I am going to pacify the border</b>

26

27
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,680

date <b>Can you</b> <b>get engaged to me first</b>

29
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,919
<b> It is dangerous</b>

30
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,840
<b>I am afraid that Xihe will not accept</b>

31
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,680

32
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,199
<b>When you return</b>

<b>Okay</b>

35
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,399
<b>Xihe</b> 

36
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,759
If Your Highness still doesn't believe it

37

<b> then fulfill Pei Su's wish</b>

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
<b>Kill me</b>

39
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,879
<b>Don't think I will let you go</b>

40
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,000
<b>What are your intentions?</b>

41
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,519
<b>I do have an intention</b>

42
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,639
<b>and</b>

43
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,439
it is hope

44
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,279
<b>Your Highness, can you marry me?</b>

45
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,680
<b>If I return safely</b>

46
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,720
<b>We will be together for a hundred years</b>

47
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,480
<b>If I</b>

48
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,720
<b>If you die on the battlefield</b>

49
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,519
<b>I will never marry</b>

50
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,680
<b>Have you forgotten something?</b>

51
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,040
<b>You want me to go to King Cangwu</b>

52
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,319
and report the Crown Prince

53
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,000
<b>Yes</b>

54
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,240
<b>As long as King Cangwu starts to suspect the Crown Prince now</b>

55
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,680
, that's enough

56
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,519
<b>Your Majesty</b>

57
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,199
<b>Your Majesty</b>

00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,279
<b>What's the matter?</b>

59
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:55,879
<b>Your Majesty</b>

60
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,519
<b>The prince sent a letter to the palace on a fast horse</b>

61
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,839
, saying that he was assassinated

62
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,199
<b>and suspected that the Crown Prince was responsible</b>

63
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
<b>and was seriously injured</b>

64
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,680
<b>Then your Majesty must summon the Crown Prince to the palace</b>

65
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,519
<b>It's not the time yet</b>

66
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,199
<b>You are so anxious</b>

67
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,839
<b>Your Majesty, are you referring to?</b>

68
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,279
<b>The Crown Prince or the Prince</b>

69
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,319
<b>Both are very anxious</b>

70
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,839
<b>Prince</b>

71
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,720
<b>You have suffered this torture for more than ten years</b>

72
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,800
<b>Is it possible</b>

73
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,279
<b>that</b> <b>this is not a disease at all</b>

74
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,000
<b> You mean</b>

75
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,519
<b> I have read ancient books</b>

76
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:39,120
<b>and found that this disease is related to coca</b>

77
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,879
<b>Coca is just an ordinary herb</b> <b>and</b>

78
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,120
it will not harm me so much

79
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,120
<b>Coca alone may not be able to</b>

80
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,920
<b>but if combined with the art of bewitching</b>

81
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,720
<b>it may achieve such an effect</b>

82
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,040
<b>There is indeed coca</b>

83
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,000
in the palace

84
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,000
<b> Are you saying that the Crown Prince has feelings for you</b>

85
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,279
<b>Of course</b> <b>He only said a few words to me</b>

86
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,120
the whole night

87
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,199
<b>and then left in a hurry</b>

88
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,439
<b>Didn't he talk to Shen Qianye as well?</b>

89
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,399
<b>What kind of talk was that?</b>

90
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,399
<b>The prince loathed her to the extreme.</b>

91
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,879
<b>He even said she was bringing shame upon herself.</b>

92
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,199
<b> Don't worry, mother.</b>

93
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,519
<b>The position of the Crown Princess is definitely mine.</b>

94
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,639
<b>Then why did he say she was bringing shame upon herself?</b>

95
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,480
<b>It seemed he said she was a fake.</b>

96
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,679
<b>A</b>

97
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,720
fake. <b>Since she's a fake</b>

98
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
, that means

99
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:49,600
<b>she looks very much like the person the prince cares about the most.</b>

100
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,519
<b>Mother,</b>

101
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,720
<b>Which gold hairpin would you say would look good on me?</b> 

102
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,759
Or, why don't

103
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,279
you change my head ornament for me some other day? 

104
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,720
You've already lost to Shen Qianye.

105
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,120
<b>What's the use of this head ornament?</b>

106
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:01,080
<b>It's impossible for the prince to hate her.</b>

107
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,279
<b>Hating isn't scary.</b>

108
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,519
<b>The scary thing is that he didn't care at all</b>

109
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,440
<b>She left</b>

110
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,879
<b>The prince disappeared immediately</b>

111
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,720
<b>And didn't show up again in the second half of the night</b>

112
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,559
<b>You</b>

113
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,399
<b>are not paying attention where</b>

114
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,600
you should be <b>You are working hard when you shouldn't</b>

115
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,720
<b>Did I ask you to harm her</b>

116
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,879
How could I give birth to a fool like you

117
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,519
<b>Mother</b>

118
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,879
<b>If Shen Qianye really becomes the Crown Princess</b>

119
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,279
<b>Then we won't have a good life</b>

120
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,399
<b>Don't be afraid</b>

121
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,240
<b>I will never let Shen Qianye</b>

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,480
<b>The burden on us, mother and daughter</b>

<b>How</b>

125
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,440
<b>What kind of head ornaments do you fancy again</b>

126
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,519
<b>In your mind, I am so short-sighted</b>

127
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,639
<b>Only concerned with clothes and not with household affairs</b>

128
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,120
<b>Household affairs</b>

129
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,080
<b>Now you see your true self</b>

130
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,519
<b>I heard that the Queen has officially started selecting the Crown Princess</b>

<b>You are an important official in the court</b>

<b>Qian Ye went to the Qianqiu Banquet last time</b>

<b>No, no</b>
