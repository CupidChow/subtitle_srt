<b> I didn't have the chance to see you</b>

2
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,879
at the last Qianqiu Banquet

3
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,879
<b>Last time, it was my fault</b>

4
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,159
<b>and I angered His Royal Highness the Crown Prince</b>

5
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,760
<b>so I have to take my leave first</b>

6
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,079
<b>I just took this opportunity</b>

7
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,000
<b>to apologize to the Queen</b>

8
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,959
<b>I never expected</b>

9
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:48,959
<b>the Crown Prince</b>

10
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,599
<b>to actually come to propose marriage</b>

11
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,079
<b>My son</b>

12
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,480
<b>still has some youthful spirit</b>

13
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:00,239
<b>and always likes to joke</b>

14
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,079
<b>Miss Qianye, please don't take it seriously</b>

15
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,280
<b>Queen, please forgive me</b>

16
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,039
<b>Qianye doesn't understand jokes</b>

17
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,759
<b>He likes to take everything seriously</b>

18
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,639
<b>I think he took the engagement with Cheng Qi</b>

19
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,840
seriously

20
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,960
<b>Soon I will draft an imperial decree</b>

21
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,039
<b>to appoint you</b>

22
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,919
<b>Grant him a marriage</b>

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,520
<b>I'm afraid you have to ask His Royal Highness the Crown Prince</b>

24
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,159
<b>Okay</b>

25
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,039
<b>I'll take you to ask him now</b>

26
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,919
<b>Queen, I'll take my leave first</b>

27
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,479
<b>Do you</b>

28
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,360
know  

29
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,680
why I called you here today 

30
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,639
<b>You want to kill me</b>

31
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,400
<b>You're really smart</b>

32
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,560
<b>You know I want to kill you</b>

33
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,400
<b>Of course</b>

34
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,400
<b>Even my stepmother knows</b>

35
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,159
<b>Granting a marriage won't work</b>

36
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,919
<b>It will only make the Crown Prince more rebellious</b>

37
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,479
<b>You won't be able to end it then</b>

38
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,120
<b> So</b>

39
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,439
there's only one way to make the Crown Prince give up 

40
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,960
and that's my death

41
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:37,759
<b>If you weren't reincarnated in the Shen Mansion</b>

42
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,479
<b>and the stepdaughter of Jian Eying</b>

44
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,520
<b>It has to be you</b>

45
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,000
<b>After all, you are smarter</b>

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,319
than that girl Xihe 

47
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,800
<b>If she was smarter</b>

48
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,680
<b>The Xi family</b>

49
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,439
<b>could probably live longer</b>

50
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,639
<b>Even if they are stupid, they won't be exterminated</b>

51
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,520
<b>So</b> 

52
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,039
The queen was also involved

53
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,759
in the unjust extermination of the Xi family

54
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,080
<b>So what if she was involved</b>

55
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,520
<b>Their whole family is stupid</b>

56
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,599
<b>Although you are smart</b>

57
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,639
<b> You</b>

58
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,480

59
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,279
<b>You will still die if</b>

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,120
you disobey discipline

61
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,439
<b>My mother's family is of humble origin</b>

62
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,439
, but they are very good at bewitching

63

<b>Do you smell the fragrance of coca</b>

64
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
<b>Today</b>

65
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,600
<b>You will definitely die</b>

66
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,879
<b>If I die</b>

67
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680

<b>You</b>

69

<b>You sent away all the guards to kill Shen Qianye</b>

<b>I will</b>

120

<b>Since I knew you wanted to kill me,</b>
