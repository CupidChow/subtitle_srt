Hiding the marriage and participating in the election

75
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,720

<b>Aren't you curious about</b>

82
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,680
Admitting the marriage is a dead end.

83
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,879
<b>I'm a little curious.</b>

84
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,879
<b>Will you die from your ruined reputation?</b>

85
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,680

<b>How this world evaluates women</b>

98
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,879
<b>One person's love is called chastity</b>

99

<b>Two people's longing is called disaster</b>

100
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,160
<b> The moon surrounded by stars is called fairy</b>

101
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,120
<b>The admiration of all people</b> <b>is a legend</b>

102
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,279
<b> You have a marriage contract</b>

<b> Tell me</b>

<b> Are you forced to</b>

109
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,399
I did conceal the marriage contract

110
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,360
<b>This</b>

111
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,959
<b>is a capital crime</b>

112
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,199
<b>You dare to admit it directly, you dare to do it and take responsibility for it</b>

113
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,439
<b>To be favored by the Crown Prince, the Prince,</b>

114
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,240

115
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,879
<b>Of course he is not an ordinary person</b>

116
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,519
<b>It's okay, Qianye</b>

117
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,639

<b>Believe me</b>

120
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,480
<b>Qianye</b> <b>Pleads guilty on behalf of the Shen family</b>

121
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,360
<b>The Shen family concealed the engagement and submitted the engagement letter</b>

<b>Let me participate in the selection of the Crown Princess</b>

123
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,120
<b>So it was the Shen family</b>

141
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,519
<b>I didn't expect it to be such a coincidence.</b>

<b>Why did mother say that?</b>

184
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,279
<b>It wasn't me who asked them to fight</b>

185
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:28,919
<b>Besides</b>

186
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,759
<b>You were the one who called Cheng Qi back</b>

187
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,320
<b> Isn't</b>

188
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
this <b>the situation you wanted to see</b>

189
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,159
<b>Qianye</b>

190
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,600
<b>Our Shen family prospers together,</b>

191
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,679
and we perish together

192
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,960
<b>Aren't you afraid that some of them will get hurt</b>

193
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,360
<b>What does it have to do with me</b>

194
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,279
<b>Don't let them fight</b>

195
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,159
<b>Whatever you want, just ask for it.</b>

196
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,200
<b>Okay.</b>

197
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,279
<b>Then</b>

198
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,919
Shen Qianling will pay me back for all the suffering I've endured before.

199
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,759
<b>Yes.</b>

200
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,200
<b>Stop fighting.</b>

201
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,399
<b>Stop fighting.</b>

202
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,519
<b>Your Highness, there's no need for the Crown Prince to fight for Qianye.</b>

203
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,960
<b>Qianye has already decided</b>

204
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,240
to marry the Prince.

205
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,240
<b>From now on,</b> 

206
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,639
you will be at the Prince's disposal.

207
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,519
<b>Qianye</b>

208
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,200
<b>You must not do that.</b>

209
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,639
<b>She's mine.</b>

210
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,919
<b> Your betrothal gifts should</b>

211
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,759
be returned to you.

212
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,240
<b>Shen Qianye</b>

213
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,519
<b>Mother</b>

214
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,960
<b>How could you let her humiliate me like this?</b>

215
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,000
<b>Qianling</b>

216
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,759
<b>Mother</b>

217
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,600
<b>Mother</b>

218
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,840
<b>I thought my sister was sincerely admitting her mistakes.</b>

219
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:02,200
<b>I didn't expect that she still despised me in her heart</b>

220
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,639
<b>Since that's</b>

221
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,000
the case <b>If something like today happens again in the Shen Mansion</b>

222
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,639
<b>I won't be able to help</b>

223
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,360
<b>Mother</b>

224
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,600
<b>She is sincere </b>

225
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,600
<b>That's good</b>

226
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,519
<b> Since that's the case</b>

227
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,039
<b>Then</b> <b>add one more hour</b>

228
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,600
<b> You </b> 

229
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,320
are empty

230
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,799
<b>Xiaomei</b>

231
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,679
<b>has a very different personality</b>

232
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,440
since she fell into the water

233
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:55,559
<b>I don't think she has changed</b>

234
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,879
<b>she was just pretending to be pitiful</b>

235
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,039
<b>and now her true colors are revealed</b>

236
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,000
<b>No matter what</b>

237
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,480
<b>she can't live</b>
