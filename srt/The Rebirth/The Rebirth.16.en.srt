00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:21,920
<b>This won't do</b>

2
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,799
<b>They have to be replaced with pearls sent as tribute from Siam</b>

3
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,959
<b>Your Highness</b>

4
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,760
<b>Isn't this specification a bit too high?</b>

5
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,079
<b>We can't just follow the Xi family's rules</b>

6
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,040
<b>After all, the Shen family is not well-known</b>

7
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,200
<b>That's why</b>

8
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,879
<b>the highest specifications are needed</b>

9
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,959
<b>Even you think so</b>

10
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,159
<b>What about others?</b>

11
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,840
<b>I understand</b>

12
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,719
<b>Your Highness wants to use the highest specifications</b>

13
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,560
<b>to tell everyone</b>

14
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,719
<b>that she is the one you cherish</b>

15
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,000
<b>and that no one should underestimate her</b>

16
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,079
<b>Since you know that</b>

17
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,519
<b>I won't say any more</b>

18
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,760
<b>In short</b>

19
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,200
, she must not be treated badly

20
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,439
<b>Your Highness, don't worry</b>

21
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,079
<b>Give this painting to Shen Qianye</b>

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,359
<b>and you must personally watch her open it</b>

23
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,319
<b>Yes</b>

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,840
<b>Ah He</b>

25
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,640
<b>My mother passed away not long ago</b>

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,760
<b>We can't have a truly grand wedding</b>

27
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,920
<b>I won't invite anyone tomorrow</b>

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,360
<b>This wedding</b>

29
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,719
<b>is only for you and me</b>

30
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,800
<b>I hope you can forgive me</b>

31
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,000
<b>This</b>

32
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,719
<b>The Crown Prince asked you to give it to me</b>

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,719
<b>Yes</b>

34
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,240
<b>His Highness also specifically instructed me</b>

35
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,840
<b>I must make sure you open it and take a look</b>

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,039
<b>Wish you</b>

37
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,759
<b>a long and happy marriage</b>

38
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,639
<b>Tell His Highness</b>

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,560
<b>I received the painting</b>

40
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,840
<b>I like it very much</b>

41
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,000
<b>Yes</b>

42
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,879
<b>Your Highness, please leave</b>

43
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,000
<b>She won't come</b>

44
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,960
<b>Why doesn't she believe me</b>

45
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,319
<b>She has no reason to believe an enemy</b>

46
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,039
<b>Sometimes the answer is simple</b>

47
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,719
<b>It's just that you don't want to believe it</b>

48
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,000
<b>Perhaps she has her own difficulties</b>

49
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,039
<b>Your Majesty, please go</b>

50
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,520
<b>Sometimes she hates you</b>

51
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,439
<b>which is actually not a bad thing</b>

52
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,080
<b>Even if she hates me</b>

53
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,840
<b>I will keep her by my side</b>

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,800
<b>Your Majesty</b>

55
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,360
<b> You don't want to</b>

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,800
<b>Miss</b>

57
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,960
<b>Don't you want to marry the Crown Prince</b>

58
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,719
<b>Why? </b>

59
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,840
<b>Being able to marry the Crown Prince</b>

60
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,759
<b>is the glory of the entire Shen family</b>

61
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,919
<b>and it's what I want to do most</b>

62
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,280
<b>Go and watch at the door</b>

63
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,000
<b>Yes</b>

64
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
<b>Why are you here</b>

65
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,879
<b>Don't you hate me</b>

66
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,720
<b>If you hate me, you should stay by my side</b>

67
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,319
<b>and then find a chance to kill me</b>

68
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,319
<b>Why did you marry the Crown Prince</b>

69
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,079
<b>You come now</b>

70
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,199
<b>to commit suicide</b>

71
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,160
<b>I know</b>

72
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,199
<b>He must have used some tricks to make you find me</b>

73
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,480
<b>So that you know my whereabouts</b>

74
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,000
<b>I know it too</b>

75
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,560
<b>You didn't come to see me</b>

76
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,920
<b>Not necessarily because you hate me</b>

77
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,160
<b>You are protecting me</b>

78
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,319
<b>Don't think too much</b>

79
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,360
<b>I just hate you</b>

80
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,120
<b>Yes</b>

81
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,680
<b>She just hates you</b>

82
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,040
<b>You knew she was Xihe a long time ago, right</b>

83
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,759
<b>On the day the Xi family was massacred</b>

84
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,360
<b>You also went to the scene</b>

85
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,120
<b>And used forbidden techniques</b>

86
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,439
<b>Right</b>

87
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,120
<b>Don't listen to his lies</b> 

88
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,399
He is using you as bait

89
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,040
<b>To achieve his goals by any means</b>

90
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,759
<b>Enough</b>

91
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,639
<b>I don't need the prince to teach me what to do</b>

92
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,639
<b>I have my own judgment</b>

93
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,959
<b>Prince</b>

<b>Tomorrow</b>

<b>I will come</b>

<b> The auspicious</b>

101
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,879
time is almost here

102
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,639
<b>We have to hurry</b>

103
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,680
<b>His Royal Highness the Crown Prince might be getting impatient</b> <b>Hurry up, hurry up</b>

00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,040
<b>Please check again for me</b>

106
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,600
<b>Are my shoes a little loose</b>

107
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,319
<b>Miss </b>

108
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,279
<b>You've said it twice</b>

109
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,000
<b>Really?</b>

110
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,439
<b>Are you waiting for him</b>

111
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,399
<b>Pei Su</b>

112

<b>I want to tell you</b>

117

<b>I was wrong</b>

118
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,639
<b>The Xi family was wiped out</b>

119
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,159
<b>I have responsibilities too</b>

<b>I wanted to see you first</b>
