<b>The Crown Prince is wise</b>

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,199
<b>The prince went to the Shen Mansion to propose marriage today</b>

81
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,240
<b> It was no accident</b>

82
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,399
<b>While he was competing with you for Shen Qianye</b>

83

<b> At the scene</b>

87
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,720
in Xi Mansion <b>We</b>

88
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,879
also found black lines near the wound on the corpse

89
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,959
<b>It seems like a unique trick</b>

90
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,920
<b>He must have been there that night</b>

91
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,279
<b>But this does not prove that he was an accomplice</b>

92
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,720

<b>When Xi Mansion was ransacked</b>

96
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,120
<b>all the items were put into the internal affairs treasury</b>

97
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,480
<b>You need the palace's consent to view it</b>

<b>Got it</b>

99
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,879
<b>I will definitely get the evidence</b>

100
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,720
