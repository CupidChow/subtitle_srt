<b>you forgot about your sister after just a few days</b>

6

<b>Look</b>

55
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,959
<b>She also said</b>

<b>Do you know you are wrong</b>

97
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,120
<b>Kneel down</b>

186
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,360
<b>that the second young lady was bullied again today</b>

187
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,679
?

188
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,600
<b>Only by attracting everyone's attention</b>

189
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,279
will my father have no way out 

190
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,039
otherwise

191
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,000
<b>with just a few words from you</b>

192
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,840
<b>even if he knows in his heart</b>

193

<b>that I was abused by them</b>

194
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,080
<b>I won't admit it for the sake of face</b>

195
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,519
<b>Let alone come</b>

196
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,639
<b>Be careful</b>

197
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,879
<b>I'm really fine</b>

198

<b>Second Miss</b>

199
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,120
<b>Why did you just get beaten</b>

200
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,480
<b>but recover so quickly</b>

201
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:10,279
<b>The self-torture trick also has its skills</b>

202
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,679
<b>This is a blood pill</b>

203
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,559
<b>Second Miss is so amazing</b>

204
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,720
<b>Where did you learn this from</b>

205
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,080
<b>Dad</b>

206
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,120
<b>I'm about to get a beating</b>

207
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,480
<b>You still want me to read books</b>

208
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,000
<b> You can use them</b>

209
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:34,879
<b>Nothing</b>

210
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,559
<b>An old friend</b>

211
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,600
<b>taught me</b>

<b>Eldest Miss</b>

215
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,159
<b>Don't</b>

216
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:51,919

217
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,720
<b>Give me</b>

218
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,000
<b>Eldest Miss, let go</b>

219
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,519
<b>Housekeeper</b>

<b>Mother</b>

221
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,200
<b>Mother</b>

222
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,879
<b>Mother</b>

223
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,799
<b>Why did you give Shen Qianye those nice things?</b>

224
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,919
<b>She doesn't deserve them at all</b>

225
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,799
<b>Okay, come and sit down</b>

226
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,480
<b>You little fool</b>

227
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,039
<b>Mother did this all for you</b>

228
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,639
<b>Didn't you notice</b>

229
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,799
<b>Your father's anger subsided yesterday</b>

230
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:14,720
<b>Really</b>

231
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,519
<b>That's great</b>

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,759
<b>Then</b>

233
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:18,919
<b>Father said</b>

234
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,440
<b>that he would gather the whole family today</b>

235
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
<b>Is he talking about</b>

236
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
<b>sending me to the Qianqiu Banquet</b>

237
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,639
<b>Of course</b>

238
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,279
<b>Dad</b>

239
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,559
<b>Dad</b>

240
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:30,879
<b>When are you going to</b>

241
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,120
<b>send me to the Qianqiu Banquet?</b>

242
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,879
<b>Do you think my outfit is okay?</b>

243
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,200
<b>Dad</b>

244
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
<b>Where are you going?</b>

245
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,200
<b>Look at what you two did.</b>

246
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,039
<b>We didn't do anything.</b>

247
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,919
<b>You handed Qian Ling to me without my consent.</b>

248
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,120
<b>Now the rumors are spreading that I mistreat my legitimate daughter.</b>

249
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,879
<b>Don't think that sending a few pieces of clothes to Qianye</b>

250
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,320
will solve the problem. 

251
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,480
You had a fight with her that day.

252
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,000
<b>I haven't held you accountable yet.</b>

253
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,720
<b>I know I was wrong.</b>

254
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,639
<b>Mother</b>

255
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,399
<b>Anyway</b>

256
00:11:58,879 --> 00:11:59,799
<b>Qianye went to the Qianqiu</b>

257
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,080
Banquet .

258
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,919
<b>My</b>

<b>father</b>

260
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,519
<b>
went</b> away.

261
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,039
<b>Father</b>

262
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,080
<b>Qianye left.</b>

263
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,799
<b>What a pity.</b>

264
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,159
<b>In my opinion, that</b>

265
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,080
's not necessarily

266
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:21,879
the case.

267
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:22,799
<b>How do you mean?</b>

268
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,399
<b>Think about it.</b> <b>Who on earth has the ability</b>

269
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,279
to help the second young lady escape from the palace

270
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,240
and send her

271
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,000
back home safely?

272
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,519
<b>Could it be His Royal Highness the Crown Prince?</b>

273
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,360
<b>That night</b>

274
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,879
<b>I saw the Crown Prince's carriage</b>

275
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,159
<b>bringing back the Second Young Miss</b>

<b>Sir</b>

00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,039
<b>Even the Queen</b>

278
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,840
<b>has to listen to the Crown Prince's opinion</b>

279
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,080
<b>My daughter</b>

280
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,360
<b>used to be aloof and cowardly</b>

281
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,519
<b>how come she suddenly became so popular</b>

282
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,120
<b>This girl should not be underestimated</b>

283
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:52,799
<b>If</b>

284
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
<b>she really wins the favor of the noble</b>

285
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,600
<b>then she</b>

286
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,360
might be able to help me

287
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,080
rise to prominence one day

288
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,039
<b>Oh</b>

<b>Okay</b>

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,639
<b>My Lord is busy with this matter</b>

<b>You have worked hard on the way</b>
