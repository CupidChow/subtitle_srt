<b>Pei Su</b>

<b>Pei Su</b>

3
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,239
<b>You know everything, right?</b>

4
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,519
<b>Congratulations</b>

5
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,640
<b>I</b>

6
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,480
<b>I was afraid he had other plans for marrying me</b>

7
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,799
<b>so I tried to delay for a while</b>

8
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,680
<b>Aren't you disappointed?</b>

9
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,319
<b>I actually backed off at this time</b>

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,360
<b>Hate makes people strong</b>

11
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,240
<b>Love makes people back off</b>

12
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,319
<b>You've fallen in love with him</b> 

13
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,639
You're right

14
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,520
<b>I have no reason to back off</b>

15
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,000
<b>Wish you</b>

<b>Your blessing</b>

18
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,639
<b>I will not accept</b>

19
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,439
<b>This is a gift from Uncle Wang to Qianye and me</b>

20
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,199
<b>I thank Uncle Wang on behalf of Qianye</b>

21
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,120
<b>You want to irritate me</b>

22
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,599
<b>I dare not</b> 

23
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,520
Why did you marry her

24
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,479
<b>Before Uncle Wang</b>

25
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,280
<b>Don't you want me to marry her?</b>

26
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,639
<b>To put it bluntly</b>

27
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,759
<b>She's just</b>

28
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,400
a spy sent to me by Uncle Wang

29
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,240
<b>She knew it was a trap but she still jumped into it</b>

30
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,319
<b>Thank you, Uncle Wang</b>

31
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,520
<b>for the trap</b>

32
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,879
<b>Send more people to keep a close eye on Pei Su for me</b>

33
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,759
<b>You can't slack off for even a quarter of an hour</b>

34
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,639
<b>Yes</b>

35
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,360
<b>Why is it you?</b>

36
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,240
<b>Why are you following me</b>

37
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,560
? <b>The prince sent someone to follow</b>

38
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,399
you

39
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
<b>I'm here to tip you off</b> <b>Since he already knows</b>

40
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,800
<b> I'm your spy</b>

41
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,560
<b>Why not act it out</b>

42
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,439
<b>Don't you want me to marry him?</b>

43
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,439
<b>The closer we get</b>

44
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,480
<b>The closer our wedding date will be</b>

45
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,680
<b>As you wish</b>

46
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,720
<b>Aren't you afraid that he will marry you?</b>

47
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,040
<b>It's a trap</b>

48
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,319
<b>My marrying him</b>

49
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,920
<b>is also a trap</b>

50
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,319
<b>You better be careful</b>

51
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,120
<b>Have you found evidence that</b>

52
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,920
proves Pei Su is involved in the Xi family massacre

53
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,000
<b>Still looking</b>

54
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,319
<b>He is getting more and more cautious</b>

55
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,959
<b>If there is no evidence</b>

56
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,240
<b>Then make up evidence</b>

57
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:58,680
<b>Understood</b>

58
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,319
<b>I said that the wine was not good</b>

59
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,079
<b>But you refused to listen</b>

60
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:07,879
<b>Look</b>

61
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,199
<b>This is the emperor's</b>

62
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,040
capital

63
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,120
<b>People disappear every day</b>

64
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,480
<b>How shameful</b> 

65
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,240
Yes

66
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:25,279
<b>And they all disappear near the palace</b>

67
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,439
<b>Don't you think it's a coincidence, father?</b>

68
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,920
<b>The prince wants to say that this matter is related to me</b>

69
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,720
<b>Why beat around the bush</b>

70
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,439
<b>This is what Uncle Wang said himself</b>

71
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,439
<b>I didn't frame you</b>

72
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,079
<b>Brother Wang</b>

73
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,439
<b>Although I am flamboyant, I am not stupid</b>

74
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,279
<b>If I really wanted to take action</b>

75
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,920
<b>Why would I be around the palace</b>

76
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,639
<b>Okay</b>

77
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,040
<b>I called you two here</b>

78
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,759
<b>not to make you suspect each other</b>

79
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,279
<b>Hasn't the Xi family been executed</b>

80
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,959
<b>How come there are still people missing</b>

81
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,720
<b>Moreover</b>

82
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,560
<b>the injuries of the missing people this time</b>

83
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,040
are the same

84
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,360
as those suffered by the guards

85
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,279
on the day the Xi family was exterminated

86
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,079
<b>This person seems to be practicing forbidden techniques</b>

87
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,319
<b>Since the founding of Cangwu</b>

88
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,800
<b>This</b>

89
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,439
matter is of great importance

90
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,160
<b>If the real culprit is found</b>

91
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,439
<b>he will be executed</b>

92
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,319
<b>Your Highness</b>

93
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,199
<b>Pei Su seems to know that we are setting a trap for him</b> <b>He has been staying indoors these days</b> <b>Inviting those court ministers</b> <b>Now everyone is his witness</b> <b>We can't find any new evidence</b> <b>The full moon night is coming soon</b> <b>Your Highness</b> <b>You should take a rest</b>

94
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,040
The

95
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,360
prince

96
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,879
and

97
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,600
I

98
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,360
were

99
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,839
the

100
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,439
only

101
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,600
ones

102
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,519
who went to Xi's house that day <b>I am the only one</b>

103
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,480
who could have used the forbidden technique 

104
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,319
It is hard for me not to doubt myself

105
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,079
<b>Even so</b>

106
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,560
<b>You were forced</b>

107
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,639
<b>To resist</b> 

108
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,279
the damage caused by coca to your body

109
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,600
<b>you had to seek out ancient methods</b>

110
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,519
<b>and practice the forbidden technique</b>

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,040
<b>What's strange is that</b>

112
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,560
<b>the wounds on the recently missing civilians</b>

113
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,480
<b>were also caused by forbidden techniques</b>

114
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,680
<b>You mean</b>

115
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,600
<b>there are other people who know forbidden techniques</b>

116
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,120
<b>I thought it was a trap set by the prince</b>

117
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,240
<b>to create exactly the same wounds</b>

118
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
and frame me

119
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,200
<b>until I went to the Dali Temple to examine the wounds and found</b>

120
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,720
<b>that was not the case</b>

121
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,720
<b>So</b>

122
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,960
<b>The prince is just playing along</b>

123
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,600
<b>He can't find any evidence against me</b>

124
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,519
<b>He's getting anxious</b>

125
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,000
now <b>It's almost the fifteenth</b>

126
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,120
<b>He won't miss this opportunity</b>

127
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,559
Ever since I sucked your blood

128
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:27,080
<b>I have an uncontrollable power in my body</b>

129
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,120
<b>I lose control from time to time</b>

130
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,799
<b>It's all Pei Lang's conspiracy</b>

131
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,799
<b>He has spies in the palace</b>

132
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
<b>As long as you leave the palace</b>

133
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,159
<b>and kill someone</b>

134
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,840
<b>he will arrest you immediately</b>

135
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,440
<b>You ruined his plan</b>

136
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,159
<b>So he</b>

137
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,039
<b>I suspect</b>

138
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,360
<b>that he let me back on purpose</b>

139
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,279
<b>He has a backup plan</b>

140
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,159
<b>But I can't guess this time</b>

141
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,159
<b>What's in his mind</b>

142
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,399
<b>I think</b>

143
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
<b>I seem to be part of his plan</b>

144
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,440
<b>He married me</b>

145
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,360
<b>As if he had seen through everything</b>

146
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
<b>Seen through what</b>

147
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,039
<b>Seen through my purpose</b>

148

<b>Little Uncle Prince</b>

<b>Don't be fooled</b>

<b>Impossible</b>

<b>I'll give you one more chance</b>

<b>Are you sure you want to be with him</b>

163
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,720
<b>Then I'll help you</b>

164
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,679
<b>These are the king's guards</b>

<b>They are all top-notch masters</b>

166
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,279
<b>They will definitely force me to take action today</b>

<b>No</b>

168
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
<b>You can't take action</b>

169

<b>This is Pei Lang's purpose</b>

<b>He wants to force you to take action</b>

171
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,559
<b>Then fabricate evidence to harm you</b>

172
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,399
<b>I will find a way to break through</b>

173
