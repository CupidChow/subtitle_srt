<b>The less movement the enemy makes,</b>

16

<b>What are you going to do?</b>

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,799

<b>Using forbidden techniques to recall the dead</b>

<b>Since</b>

33
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,879
<b>I have borrowed life from heaven</b>

34

<b>I am not afraid of death</b>

40

<b>But before I die</b>

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,919
<b>there is one most important thing to do</b>

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,680
<b>You and I were master and disciple. </b>

43
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,639

<b>Back then you gave me a pear</b>

47

<b>I planted it here</b>

48
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,960
<b>Now the pear tree has grown tall and majestic</b>
