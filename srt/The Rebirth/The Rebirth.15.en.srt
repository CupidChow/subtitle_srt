<b>All this time</b>

3
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,239
<b>Have you been using me</b>

4
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,319
<b>Some things</b>

5
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,359
<b>I just found out</b>

6

<b>Take it down </b>

<b>You don't think you've won, do you?</b>

00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,080
<b>You don't think your father</b>

<b>I know you want to put the blame on me</b>

20

<b>But Pei Lang</b>

21
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,400
<b>Do you really not want to know the truth?</b>

22
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,680
<b>The truth is</b>

<b>You, Pei Su</b>

<b>Soon</b>

28
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,840
<b>All of this will be revealed to the world</b>

29

<b>What did you say</b>

32

<b>I said</b>

33
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,360
<b>You will never get</b>

<b>your father's attention</b>

35

<b>Because in his eyes, your mother's family</b>

will always be inferior 

37
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,840

38
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,280
<b>Naturally, the one he cares about the most</b>

39
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,039
<b>I don't need it at all</b>

40
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,520
<b>Yes</b>

<b>Cangwu Country is mine</b>

<b>Everything is mine</b>

48

<b>You are not worthy to compete with me</b>

<b>What if I just want to fight?</b>

50
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,319
<b>You'll be dead soon</b>

51

<b>Your Highness the Crown Prince</b>

53

<b>The guards sent someone to ask</b>

<b>What should we do with Shen Qianye?</b>

<b>I understand</b>

57
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,560
<b>I will arrange for someone to deal with it as soon as possible</b>

58

<b>Anyone who betrays His Highness the Crown Prince</b>

<b>Anyone who dares to disrespect the Crown Princess</b>

<b>I actually backed down at this time</b>

<b>Hate makes people strong</b>

<b>You've seen it wrong</b>

00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,120
<b>It's really you</b>

84
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600

<b>I was wrong</b>

<b>What do you regret</b>

90
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,240
<b>I regret not keeping you</b>

91
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,759
<b>I shouldn't have let you go back to the Xi family</b>

<b>I knew the Xi family was going to be wiped out</b>

93
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,240
<b>Destroyed</b>

94
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,240
<b>Didn't the Xi family commit suicide out of fear of punishment</b>

95
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,399
<b>I regret letting you go home</b>

96
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,199
<b>So</b>

00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,279
<b>I still can't help but come to you</b>

<b>Everything is too late</b>

<b>You know it is</b>

101
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,279
<b>Prince</b>

102
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,680
<b>Prince</b>

103
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,199
<b>How is Shen Qianye</b>

104
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,839
<b>Did the prince do anything to her</b>

105
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,720
<b>Not really</b>

106
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,560
<b>But she will become the Crown Princess tomorrow</b>

107
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
<b>Pei Lang will not marry a</b>

<b>No</b>

<b>Prince</b>

113
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,399
<b>The prince has blamed you</b>

114

for the Xi family's massacre

115
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,439
<b>The king is furious</b>

116
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,240
<b>and ordered the execution</b>

<b>We need to leave the city quickly</b>

118
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,840
<b>Give me a quarter of an hour</b>

<b>Prince cannot go</b>

120
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,320
I came to you

121
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,519
because I have something to tell you.

122
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,320
What is it?

123
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,360
Are you being wronged?

124
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,080
I was framed by Pei Lang

125
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,879
. I know.

126
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,840
<b>He framed you</b>

127
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,080
<b>But you deserved it</b>

128
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,000
<b>You did practice forbidden techniques</b>

129
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,799
<b>And wiped out the entire Xi family</b>

130
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,720
<b>Didn't you</b>

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,399
<b>It's dangerous for you to marry him</b>

132
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,559
<b>Do you think I</b>

133
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,360
would still believe what you said now 

134
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,879
You can disbelieve me

135
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,080
<b>You can also kill me</b>

136
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,919
<b>But if you hadn't had a single doubt in your heart</b> 

137
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,440
Your sword wouldn't have deviated an inch that day

138

<b>Come with me</b>

<b>But she said</b>

190
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,759
<b>She would wait for me to come back</b>

191
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,080
<b>She said she would wait for me to come back</b> 

192
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,679
I still have

193
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,519
<b>A lot of things I haven't asked her to do</b>

194
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,799
<b>She said she would wait for me to come back</b>

195
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,919
<b>She said she would wait for me to come back</b>

196
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,960
<b>She said she would wait for me to come back</b>

197
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,320
<b>Your Highness</b>

198
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,159
<b>After Pei Su escaped from prison</b>

199
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,919
, the first person he went to find was Shen Qianye.

200
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,360
<b>Should we take action?</b>

201
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,120
<b>I will protect Qianye.</b>

202
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:04,639
<b>But</b>

203
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,120
<b>If they leave the capital,</b>

204
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,600
it will be difficult for us to track them.

205
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,200
<b>I believe Qianye</b>

206
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,519
will not go with him.

207
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,399
<b>How can it be difficult to track them?</b> 

208
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,039
I'm still waiting for him to attend my wedding.

209
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,159
<b>Your Majesty, please leave quickly.</b>

210
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,320
<b>We don't have much time.</b> 

211
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,559
Wait one more day.

212
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,679
<b>The prince has already issued a city-wide warrant for your arrest.</b> 

213
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,440
Stay one more day.

214
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,799
<b>There's an extra risk.</b>

215
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,120
<b>It doesn't matter.</b>

216
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,519
<b> I have my own way to deal with</b>

217
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,279
it. <b>Your Majesty ,</b>

218
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,000
do you need me to send someone to plead with the king?

219
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,159
<b>In the past, the king always kept the brotherhood in mind.</b>

220
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,759
<b>I won't really attack the prince</b>

221
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:39,679
<b>No</b>

222
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,879
<b>We must not let him know</b>

223
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,159
our whereabouts
