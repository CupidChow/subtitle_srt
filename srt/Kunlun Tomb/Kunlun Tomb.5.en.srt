00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:51,580
Hello?

5
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,260
Yes, I heard that.

6
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,860
Two to three hours, I guess.

7
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,900
We are two mountains away.

8
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,100
Ah?

9
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,380
Hello?

10
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,820
Hello?

11
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,860
See you later.

12
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,780
Hu.

13
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,260
So

14
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,980
if we manage

15
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,900
to get rid of our Red Spots,

16
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,620
what do you plan to do next?

17
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,420
What do you mean?

18
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,180
Do you

19
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,380
want to

20
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,500
visit my hometown together?

21
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,300
Your hometown?

22
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,420
What's so interesting about it?

23
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,940
I can't understand the local dialect,

24
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,460
nor am I used to the diet there.

25
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,980
Most importantly,

26
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,820
I have no friends there.

27
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,820
You have me.

28
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,980
Eyes on the road.

29
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,980
Now, you're being an airhead.

30
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,700
You are bringing

31
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,500
a random stranger to your hometown.

32
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,980
You worry about everything.

33
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,260
Thank god you met me.

34
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,260
If you run into someone scummy,

35
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,180
you'll be their easy target.

36
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,020
All right.

37
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,860
I get it now.

38
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,540
I won't bring it up again.

39
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,740
What...

40
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,540
Here you go.

41
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,940
What is this?

42
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,780
Is this even edible?

43
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,940
You don't want it?

44
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,780
Give it to me then.

45
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,540
It's okay.

46
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,620
I'll hunt something for you

47
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,740
in the woods.

48
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,300
I won't eat either. Let's go.

49
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,500
Just a reminder.

50
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,500
Due to the high altitude,

51
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,540
water can never boil here.

52
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,060
Thank you.

53
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,060
Xiang.

54
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,460
You found the toilet?

55
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,020
Xiang.

56
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,260
Didn't they say you have Yin Yang Eyes?

57
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,780
Can you take a look at me?

58
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,980
So?

59
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,980
You're scaring me.

60
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,740
There is

61
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,940
an evil ghost behind you.

62
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,180
Don't joke around.

63
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,380
Please don't joke around.

64
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,060
Behind me?

65
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,220
Evil ghost?

66
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,540
Red Spot.

67
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,020
She saw it.

68
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,740
Let me help you.

69
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,260
A quarrel?

70
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,420
No.

71
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,460
So?

72
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,340
She didn't want to burden me.

73
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,260
All right?

74
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,340
I was talking about Ke.

75
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,700
Is this a prank?

76
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,260
Ke's condition has stabilized,

77
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,740
but he'll need time to recover.

78
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,980
Our supplies have arrived?

79
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,500
I have packed

80
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,580
whatever Jin sent us.

81
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,460
You found any guide?

82
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,580
I found one.

83
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,020
A man from Kangba called First.

84
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,100
He's apparently the only person here

85
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,460
who has been to Mount Karamir.

86
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,420
Not bad.

87
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,740
You're efficient.

88
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,460
The higher-up will take note of this.

89
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,940
Hu.

90
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,260
Can we hold that off first?

91
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,460
Why?

92
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,420
Hu,

93
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,980
this is not my fault.

94
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,020
Mr. Ming and Han Shuna screwed it up.

95
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,100
They paid in Hong Kong dollars...

96
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,500
All right.

97
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,420
I'll talk to him later.

98
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,260
Here.

99
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,180
Why did you bring a wheelchair here?

100
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,340
Hu,

101
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,260
you're just meeting him.

102
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,340
Why are you bringing
a wheelchair with you?

103
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,340
Are you worried
that they might break your legs

104
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,940
or are you breaking someone else's legs?

105
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,740
Seriously?

106
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,580
I don't have time for you.

107
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,260
Wait.

108
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,660
Be civil, please.

109
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,500
You might get your rear handed to you.

110
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,500
Hi there.

111
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,540
May I ask

112
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,940
if Gema lives here?

113
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,100
Gema.

114
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,580
Hu Bayi?

115
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,220
You see this?

116
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,620
This is a wheelchair.

117
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,220
With it,

118
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,580
you can travel around.

119
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,100
Done.

120
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,140
I bought this for you from Beijing.

121
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,220
Do you want to give it a spin?

122
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:55,980
Come on.

123
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,700
Careful.

124
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,460
Support her head.

125
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,460
Come on.

126
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,660
Your leg.

127
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,180
Let's go.

128
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:05,980
Careful.

129
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,460
Upward. Upward. Good.

130
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:12,900
Come on.

131
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,460
Let's get your legs tucked in.

132
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,780
Cover your lap.

133
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,060
So?

134
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,180
Do you like it?

135
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,300
Do you want to get some air?

136
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,420
Let's go.

137
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:39,980
Here we go.

138
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,660
Let's move.

139
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,460
You can go wherever you want now.

140
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,180
How convenient.

141
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,940
Do you like it?

142
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,740
Push it like this.

143
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,420
Take her out often.

144
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,380
Gema, you can now go out.

145
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,500
So?

146
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,740
It's great, isn't it?

147
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,220
Stop crying.

148
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,100
I was incompetent back then.

149
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,060
That's why

150
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,260
you and the big guy became like this.

151
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,220
Captain Hu.

152
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,580
You risked your life to protect us.

153
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,380
For that, I am grateful.

154
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,180
This feels amazing.

155
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,180
Show me around.

156
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,500
Let's go.

157
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,380
Let's go!

158
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,980
Ciji, you have guests.

159
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,700
Turn around.

160
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,220
Turn around, please.

161
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,820
If there isn't enough space,
you can pull it back a bit

162
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,380
before turning.

163
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:08,740
You'll get used to it.

164
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,660
Ciji!

165
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,420
This is my brother, Ciji.

166
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,180
He

167
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,980
and his wife
have been taking care of me.

168
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,420
Hi.

169
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,260
I'm Hu Bayi.

170
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,460
Ciji.

171
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,380
Captain Hu gave me this.

172
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,700
It's a wheelchair.

173
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,180
With this,

174
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,580
I can go out.

175
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,940
I can see the world outside.

176
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,420
You are...

177
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,460
He's the Captain Hu I told you about.

178
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,460
He rescued me

179
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,420
from the pack of wolves.

180
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,620
You saved my sister.

181
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,260
That makes you my family's savior.

182
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,100
My friend.

183
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,900
Stay here for a few days.

184
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,940
We'll ride and hunt together.

185
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,500
I'm afraid I'll have to say no.

186
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,220
I came here because I have business
in Mount Karamir.

187
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,660
Maybe after I come back?

188
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,220
Karamir?

189
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,420
Ciji, haven't you been there before?

190
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,860
Guide Captain Hu, please.

191
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,380
You have been to Karamir?

192
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,700
It is a dangerous place.

193
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,060
I'm the only one here who's been there.

194
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,740
Gema.

195
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,900
What is Ciji's Mandarin name?

196
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,980
First.

197
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,220
You even have firearms here?

198
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,300
Here.

199
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,420
Where did you get these?

200
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,060
Some are from the wolves-hunting squad.

201
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,660
Some were confiscated

202
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,140
from the foreign poachers.

203
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,660
Two of them
were inherited from my father.

204
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,980
You're natural with guns.

205
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,300
Allow me to introduce

206
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,620
Tashi and Gesang.

207
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,340
They are my wolves-hunting helpers.

208
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,140
They will go with us.

209
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,740
Sure.

210
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,020
Tashi delek!

211
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,220
Tashi, is it?

212
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,900
I remember you.

213
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,980
When I asked for directions last time...

214
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,980
You were the yak herder.

215
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:17,980
Yes.

216
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,980
Hi.

217
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,420
What are you looking at?

218
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,380
They are haunted too?

219
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,700
You're not a yak.

220
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,620
I'm sure you can't see anything unholy.

221
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,100
These dungs stink!

222
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,460
Have some wine.

223
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,940
Thank you.

224
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,780
Have some wine.

225
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,060
Please have some.

226
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,460
That's enough.

227
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,220
My friend, come sit inside.

228
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,060
Let me do it.

229
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:31,608
Okay.

230
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,580
Come sit with us.

231
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,300
All right.

232
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:38,660
Sure.

233
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,900
Come on, Chief Yang.

234
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,900
Come sit inside.

235
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,460
What a feast.

236
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,708
Sit.

237
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,580
What's the matter?

238
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:54,860
Let's sit.

239
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,300
Have some buns.
Wine will be served later.

240
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,100
Thank you.

241
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,420
Welcome to my humble abode.

242
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,020
Let's have a toast.

243
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,300
Come on.

244
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,700
A toast.

245
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,580
My faraway friends!

246
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,700
Come on.

247
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,020
The altitude here is high.

248
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,180
If we chug it,

249
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,660
will we die?

250
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,300
Take it easy.

251
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,300
Just chug it.

252
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,420
Come on, my friends.

253
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,460
Drink up.

254
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,300
Come on.

255
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,980
Drink up.

256
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,580
Cheers.

257
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,300
Let me give you a refill.

258
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,180
Drink up.

259
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,020
Chug it.

260
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,500
Go.

261
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,540
Chug it.

262
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,860
Thank you.

00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,860
Drink!

271
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,460
Mr. First.

272
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,700
Based on what you told me,

273
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,460
we'll head into the mountain
tomorrow on yaks?

274
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,540
To enter Mount Karamir via Gazebuqing,

275
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,860
we have to traverse a badland.

276
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,300
The journey is grueling.

277
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,420
Even poachers won't go there.

278
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,420
Your four-wheeled sedan...

279
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,780
It's not a sedan.

280
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,460
Our jeep can take a few hits.

281
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,140
The clouds may be high,
but they are still below the sun.

282
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,860
The moon can be bright,

283
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,420
but it can never dry the yak dungs.

284
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,860
No vehicles

285
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,140
can get there.

286
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,940
All your belongings

287
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,820
will have to be carried by the yaks.

288
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,700
Hu.

289
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,700
If the yaks have to carry our luggage,

290
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,900
what about us?

291
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,020
Us?

292
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,420
We carry the yaks.

293
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,460
Travel on foot, of course.

294
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,420
Mr. First.

295
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,100
We are bringing guns

296
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,540
because that place is dangerous?

297
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,900
There are wolves.

298
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,220
Wolves?

299
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,620
Wolves!

300
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,580
Bring this to your aunt.

301
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,820
We have a wolves-hunting squad now

302
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,260
and we have chased them away.

303
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,580
But these cunning wolves

304
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,700
went somewhere we couldn't reach.

305
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,300
And we are going there right now.

306
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,260
Other than the wolves...

307
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,180
Is there anything else?

308
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,820
The older generation once mentioned

309
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,940
that there were ancient beasts

310
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,500
lurking in the depth
of the Snow Conch Ravine

311
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,540
where no humans dared to venture.

312
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,700
They are strong

313
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,260
and ravenous.

314
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,300
Much more fearsome than the wolves.

315
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,380
It's dangerous.

316
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:50,820
Beasts?

317
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,700
Mr. Ming.

318
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,060
You heard that?

319
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,780
It will be dangerous.

320
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,380
In my opinion,

321
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,140
Na and Xiang

322
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,500
both have altitude sickness.

323
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,060
Either you go back

324
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,340
or you stay here.

325
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,060
I can just

326
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,620
handle your matter on your behalf.

327
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,900
Hu,

328
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,700
please put yourself in my shoes.

329
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,380
As the old saying goes,

330
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,580
filial piety is the most important
among all kind deeds.

331
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,020
It's the thought that matters.

332
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,260
I'm nearly 60 years old.

333
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,820
I'm not long for this world.

334
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,020
Hu.

335
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,380
Mr. Ming here just has a simple wish.

336
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,940
That's why he rebuts you.

337
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,300
In fact,

338
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,380
he swore before his mother's grave

339
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,900
that he would find his father.

340
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,420
Exactly.

341
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,220
If I can't even do this,

342
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,220
how am I supposed to live happily?

343
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,100
All right.

344
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,540
Stop it already.

345
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,500
However,

346
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,100
if something dangerous comes up...

347
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,420
I'll deal with the consequences.

348
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,660
Come on.

349
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,740
You have my words.

350
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,300
Good.

351
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,100
You have my words.

352
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,860
All right.

353
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,660
Okay.

354
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,100
I'll take your words.

355
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,100
Have some wine.

Are you going to Mount Karamir?

358
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,660
Didn't you say
that is a dangerous place

359
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,780
and I shouldn't go there?

360
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,860
Why are you going then?

361
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,420
That was meant for you, not for me.

362
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,620
I have been there many times.

363

Another song, please.

364
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,220
There are more here.

365
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,300
I know a song.

366
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,380
I'll sing.

Why are you bringing
this blade with you?

373
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,060
Didn't you say you would only carry it

374

375

Hu.

386
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,620
Hi, Lamu.

387
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,620
Why did you come here in a hurry?

388
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,860
Are you done preparing?

389
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,420
First is here too.

390
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,980
Little girl.

391
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,100
What did you say just now?
You were so happy.

392
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,740
Don't pee by the river!

393
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,860
What did she say?

394
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,500
There's a saying here,

395
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,620
the river is the way back home.

396
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,460
If the children pee by the river,

397
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,820
they will be chastised.

398
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,860
And so, Lamu asked me to tell you

399
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,940
not to pee by the river.

400
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,220
That's uncivilized.

401
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,620
I...

402
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,020
Wait.

403
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,780
I wasn't the only one peeing.

404
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,260
Have a safe trip.

405
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,460
Follow closely. Hurry up.

406
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,900
Have a safe trip.

407
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,260
Have a safe trip.

408
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,580
See you!

409

Come back safely.

Let's go.

415
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,420
Thank you.

416
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,820
Let me do it.

417
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,580
Not bad, Fatty.

418
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,180

I'm not all right. I can't walk further.

So much for being your best friend.

425

Stop.

Why are we stopping?

434
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,620
I came here to collect herbs

435

ten years ago.

436
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,740
I don't know if the path is still there.

437
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,100
Let me scout by the Yanshou Cliff.

438
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,540
I'll go with you

439
00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,820

440

Sure. Good for you.

Why are they staying there?

447

They dare not cross the bridge.
