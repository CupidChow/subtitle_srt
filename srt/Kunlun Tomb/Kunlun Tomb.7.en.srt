There's a saying among us herdsmen.

5
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,980
Chhaang which is sweet

6
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,500
is brewed by a beautiful lady.

7
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,820
Without the beautiful lady,

8
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,900
chhaang cannot be sweet.

9
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,340
A lovely lady
is like an auspicious bird.

10
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,260
It won't simply fall into your ranch.

11
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,660
Here you go.

12
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,500
No thanks. It's too early to drink.

13
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,340
You go ahead.

14
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,300
Alright.

15
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,780
The four snowy peaks are visible.

(Dragon Peak)

17
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,580
Ahead of us is Dragon Peak.

18
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,100
Stay alert, everyone.

19
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,620
Let's go.

20
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,500
Okay.

21
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,740
Xiang.

22
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,220
Hurry up.

23
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,780
Na.

24
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,140
Are you okay?

25
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,660
Just go.

26
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,700
Go ahead.

27
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,700
Mrs. Lei.

28
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,340
Can you still manage?

29
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,980
Already reached your limits?

30
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,100
I need to pee.

31
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,260
That mountain is magical.

32
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,180
Xiang, can you feel it?

33
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,020
Where's Shuna?

34
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,980
Xiang.

35
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,220
Wasn't Shuna behind you?

36
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,180
She was behind me just a moment ago

37
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,460
and asked me to go ahead.

38
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,500
What is it?

39
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,300
Shuna and Xiang
were trailing at the back.

40
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,020
But Shuna went missing after a while.

41
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,220
There are so many glaciers and crevices.

42
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,540
It's too dangerous.

43
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,620
We must go back and find her.

44
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,220
How did we lose her?

45
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,380
You guys take a break here.

46
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,020
Come. We'll search for her.

47
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,540
Let's go.

48
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,260
Han Shuna!

49
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,380
Han Shuna!

50
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,860
Han Shuna!

51
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,700
Han Shuna!

52
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,980
Na!

53
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,500
Han Shuna!

54
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,420
Na!

55
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,060
Na!

56
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,900
Is that her?

57
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,740
Na.

58
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,020
Sir.

59
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,180
We found Na!

60
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,380
You found Na?

61
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,500
Where is she?

62
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,140
Over there.

63
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,100
She fell down?

64
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,660
She didn't fall to her death, did she?

65
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,980
Probably just got knocked out
at this depth.

66
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,580
I don't know what happened.

67
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,780
Let's just rescue her first.

68
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,220
I'll go with you.

69
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,300
Be careful.

70
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,380
Over here.

71
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,260
Han Shuna.

72
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,860
Shuna.

73
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,980
She's awake.

74
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,660
Are you okay?

75
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,060
How are you feeling?

76
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,860
Come, slowly.

77
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,300
Are you injured?

78
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,500
Try and sit up.

79
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,020
Feeling any discomfort?

80
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,140
There are only two scratches
on her face.

81
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,580
I guess she should be fine.

82
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,500
Can you move your arm?

83
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,260
Try and move it. Show me.

84
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,700
Move your arm.

85
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,380
How about your legs? Come on.

86
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,620
They look fine.

87
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,700
Move them so I can check them for you.

88
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,980
They are fine.

89
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,660
It's okay. Take your time.

90
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,500
Come, sit up.

91
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,540
Chief Yang.

92
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,220
Sit here for now.

93
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,180
Where...

94
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,140
Where am I?

95
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,100
Why are there so many corpses
in the wall?

96
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,420
Don't be scared.

97
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,780
These are ancient corpses
frozen inside the wall.

98
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,340
Isn't this your area of research?

99
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,500
Why are you so scared?

100
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,940
That's not the same.

101
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,420
I don't normally examine
ancient corpses

102
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,220
in a place like this.

103
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,460
Actually,

104
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,660
if you didn't accidentally
fall into this place,

105
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,380
we wouldn't have found it.

106
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,660
Chief Yang.

107
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,860
Do you think

108
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,140
this could be

109
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,580
the tomb of the Samsara Sect's chief?

110
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,340
W-Why are these people
standing in a row?

111
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,580
Isn't it too crowded?

112
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,620
The Samsara Sect is also a devotee
of the Demon Kingdom.

113
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,980
They worship caves and the abyss.

114
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,980
That's why these corpses

115
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,540
are arranged in such a fashion.

116
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,700
Why are they all looking down?

117
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,980
They're gathered in a circle.

118
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,260
What are they looking at?

119
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,660
Preparing a meal?

120
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,940
Cook more, please. I'm a big eater.

121
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,740
Mr. First.

122
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,940
Where are you going?

123
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,220
I'm going to bury some flares.

124
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,100
Aren't flares supposed
to go up in the sky?

125
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,980
Why are you burying them?

126
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,940
To keep wolves away.

127
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,860
So you guys are using flares
as land mines?

128
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,420
Pretty ingenious, my comrades.

129
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,740
Keep this in mind.

130
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,980
If you don't see the enemy... No.

131
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,860
If you don't see the wolf,
don't set up a tripwire.

132
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,300
Here, eat it while it's hot.

133
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,300
Those corpses down there.

134
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,140
Do they have something

135
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
to do with the crystal?

136
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,660
I don't think so.

137
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,980
There were so many of them.

138
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,340
It's definitely not what you think.

139
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,580
Calm down.

140
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,740
We haven't reached
the Nine-Level Demon Pagoda yet.

141
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,340
Besides,
Peter will go down there as well.

142
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,540
If there are any treasures,

143
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,060
we'll get our share.

144
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,420
Whatever it is,

145
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,540
wait for my cue before you do anything.

146
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,500
Don't worry.

147
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,940
I've never failed you, have I?

148
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,180
Come now.
Eat it while the food is still hot.

149
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,100
Eat up.

150
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,740
Look at you.

151
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,300
You're an adult

152
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,780
but you barely know how to take care
of yourself. Don't you find it cold?

153
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,020
Come, sit down.

154
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,220
Let me warm you up.

155
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:58,980
Shuna.

156
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,420
What would I do

157
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,100
without you?

158
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,860
Good thing you realized that.

159
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,980
Looking after you for over 10 years
wasn't all for naught.

160
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,220
I guess I'm pretty lucky.

161
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,460
If I hadn't met you,

162
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,380
you'd probably be warming

163
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,140
someone else's hands now.

164
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,460
If I didn't meet you back then,

165
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,980
and you didn't bring me
out of that place,

166
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,700
I don't even know
whether I could still be alive.

167
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,460
Don't you worry.

168
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,060
Just focus on what you wish to do.

169
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,300
I'll never leave you.

170
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,980
Should I

171
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,740
give you guys some space?

172
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,940
It's okay.

173
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,220
Come and eat.

174
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,620
Dig in.

175
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,420
We still have to head down afterward.

176
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,700
These guys are frozen solid.

177
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,660
Who do you think they were?

178
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,980
Could they all be Mr. Ming's dad?

179
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,060
That's enough nonsense.

180
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,540
I'm going to light the candles.

181
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,060
Go spray the ginger juice.

182
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,060
Once we uncover the corpse

183
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,020
and determine its orientation,

184
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,740
we'll know
where the Nine-Level Demon Pagoda is.

185
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,580
Hurry up.

186
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,540
Determining orientations
is my expertise.

187
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,940
With the Shuizejie Diagram
and Nine Halls Diagram,

188
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,380
a bit of calculation is all it takes.

189
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,540
Alright. Come.

190
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,540
One, two, lift.

191
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,460
Here. Yes.

192
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,820
Hu.

193
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,820
Let's do it.

194
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,260
Okay.

195
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,420
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

196
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,380
One, two, lift.

197
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,780
What a weird posture.

198
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,380
What are these beads on the corpse?

199
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,540
Step aside.

200
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,780
Let the professional take a look.

201
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,020
Shuna, come here.

202
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,860
Come, look.

203
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,420
The extreme condition here

204
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,740
is indeed ideal for preserving
the ancient corpses.

205
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,460
It's salt.

206
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,660
This is indeed a golden mummy
of the snow mountain.

207
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,700
Great.

208
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,820
We're rich.

209
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,940
I know it's a mummy.

210
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,660
But why is it called
a "golden mummy of the snow mountain"?

211
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,660
Is it made from gold?

212
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,620
Clueless, huh, Fatty?

213
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,020
It's a special method of mummification.

214
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,500
Very complicated.

215
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,060
First,

216
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,820
the corpse

217
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,660
is set in a fixed position.

218
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,580
Then it is placed in a stone coffin.

219
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,820
Next, fill it up with salt.

220
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,180
After three months,

221
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,540
when the salt
has been completely absorbed,

222
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,580
various spices

223
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,140
and medicinal offerings

224
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,340
are rubbed on it.

225
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,580
Lastly, when the substances harden,

226
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,940
a layer of molten gold

227
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,340
is painted on it.

228
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,460
Hence, the golden mummy.

229
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,340
Then

230
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,180
it must be worth quite a lot.

231
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,500
Definitely.

232
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,340
Listen.

233
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,820
This thing?

234
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,060
You can't settle for any offer

235
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,340
that's less than 1.5 million yuan.

236
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,660
1.5 million?

237
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,580
Is it really worth that much?

238
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,340
In ancient Egypt,

239
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,780
only pharaohs and nobles were mummified.

240
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,460
I'm almost certain

241
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,260
this is the Samsara Sect's chief.

242
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,180
Peter.

243
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,980
Bring this mummy up.

244
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,340
Hold on.

245
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,660
Don't worry, Hu.

246
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,660
Once the good is sold,

247
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,060
you'll get what is promised.

248
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,260
Mr. Ming.

249
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,180
That isn't what we meant.

250
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,020
Right.

251
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,940
Do you think we're all like you?

252
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,300
What is it?

253
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,740
Worried about your cut of the profit?
That's negotiable.

254
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,380
Mr. Ming.

255
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,860
I meant to say

256
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,900
that since we've determined this

257
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,940
to be the tomb
of the Samsara Sect's chief,

258
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,380
then based on how the body is placed,

259
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,620
we now know

260
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,020
the location
of the Nine-Level Demon Pagoda.

261
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,500
We have what we came for.

262
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,340
So we should leave the corpse be.

263
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,340
Alright?

264
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,500
You must be joking.

265
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,100
The cut of the profit?

266
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,580
We can talk it over.

267
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,780
I think I've made it very clear.

268
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,740
Do you still not get it?

269
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,980
Don't touch it.

270
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,660
What if I insist?

271
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,260
I dare you to try.

272
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,260
Let's see if I will let you.

273
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,060
What's this all about, Mr. Ming?

274
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,780
Are we disbanding the alliance?

275
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,900
You're not going to look for
your dad anymore, huh?

276
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,940
I am.

277
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,620
Mr. Ming.

278
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,100
Listen to me.

279
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,140
Turn back while you still can.

280
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,140
Don't paint yourself into a corner.

281
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,460
Let's go.

282
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,180
Sir!

283
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,460
Come on. Let's go check it out.

284
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,180
Are you alright?

285
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,580
Shuna!

286
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,420
Na.

287
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,460
Shuna!

288
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,820
Shuna!

289
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,220
