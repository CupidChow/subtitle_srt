After you cross the bridge,
you'll find Yanshou Cliff.

00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,260
Go.

00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,300
After you two.

7
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,580
You call this a bridge?

8
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,060
Why are they staying there?

9
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,300
They don't dare to cross the bridge.

10
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,540
Really?

11
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,500
And who was mocking me just now?

12
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,540
Jesus! This is way too deep.

13
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,140
Chief Yang, stay there first.

14
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,820
I'll cross the bridge

15
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,500
and I'll see what I can do
to bring you guys over.

16
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,020
Don't come yet. It's too dangerous.

17
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,340
Just the height of it!

18
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,260
Imagine if you fall...

19
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,260
Careful.

20
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,660
I can do it.

21
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,220
Couldn't you warn me earlier?

22
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,300
I saw nothing.

23
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,060
Stop right there.

24
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,340
Chief Yang, it's too dangerous.

25
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,060
Stop.

26
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,100
Please. I beg of you.

27
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,980
Come on. Let me give you a hand.

28
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,580
Come on.

29
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,940
No need.

30
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,380
I'll give you a hand.

31
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,060
Are you going or not?

32
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,380
If not, don't get in my way.

33
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,580
I just wanted to help you.

34
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,100
Go now.

35
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,820
Careful.

36
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,020
She won't let me help her.

37
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,180
If she makes a misstep,
I'll be worried sick.

38
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,740
She crossed the bridge just like that.

39
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,100
Impressive.

40
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,100
Legend has it

41
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,940
that during the full moon,

42
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,580
the beasts in the mountain

43
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,980
would jump from the Yanshou Cliff

44
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,380
to appease the mountain god

45
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,220
(Yanshou Cliff)
with their death.

46
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,420
But none of the elderly in my clan

47
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,100
has seen it before.

48
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,380
I heard

49
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,740
this is the spot
where they jump to their death.

50
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,060
They sure picked a nice spot.

51
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,020
It has a great view.

52
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,700
The fog has lifted.

53
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,900
The path is still there.

54
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,940
It's getting dark soon.

55
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,980
Hurry up and set up our camp.

56
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,860
Although I have been to Yanshou Cliff,

57
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,300
I have never spent a night here.

58
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,700
As for the camp spot...

59
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,580
Since all of you look exhausted,

60
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,300
should we set up the camp right here?

61
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,500
No.

62
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,460
The altitude here is too high.

63
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,500
Mr. Ming and Xiang won't be able to take it.

64
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,940
The valley bottom

65
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,020
is more suited for a recovery purpose.

66
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,460
Valley bottom?

67
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,820
What do you think, First?

68
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,060
Sure.

69
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,180
Let's go.

70
00:04:40,528 --> 00:04:45,325
(Bone Ravine)

71
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:49,868
Be careful.

72
00:04:51,572 --> 00:04:52,820
Come on.

73
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,540
Careful.

74
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,020
Careful.

75
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,540
Mind your head.

76
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,700
Here.

77
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,460
All right.

78
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,620
Come on.

79
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,300
Have some tsamba.

80
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,660
Thank you.

81
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,380
Eat something.

82
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,100
I don't have the appetite.

83
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,220
How can you

84
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,660
dine in a place like this?

85
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,580
All those skeletons

86
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,780
are giving me the creeps.

87
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,860
There, there.

88
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,380
You just have to make peace with it.

89
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,900
The tsamba

90
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,780
fills you up,

91
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,940
but it's so dry and bland.

92
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,220
If we can braise the yaks,

93
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,340
we...

94
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,700
It was just a suggestion.

95
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,700
I wasn't planning...

96
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,940
He leaves no waste.

97
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,580
When your family

98
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,700
is so poor
that someone died from starvation,

99
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,020
you wouldn't waster any food either.

100
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,860
What are you staring at?

101
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,900
I didn't want to waste food.

102
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,700
Suit yourself.

103
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,500
Eat something.

104
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,100
Smoke.

105
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,860
Smoke a pack.

106
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Smoking in the highland is akin
to gradual suicide.

107
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,020
I need to talk to you.

108
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,380
I'm all ears.

109
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,020
Something felt off

110
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,260
when we arrived at the Bone Ravine.

111
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,740
Have you checked the animal remains?

112
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,300
What about it?

113
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,460
Logically speaking,

114
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,980
animal suicide is just a myth,
and therefore, not substantiated.

115
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,060
But where do these bones come from?

116
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,580
The way I see it,

117
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,740
we're getting closer and closer

118
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,540
to the Nine-Level Demon Pagoda.

119
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,660
So they have something to do with it?

120
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,980
You're saying

121
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,100
that the animal suicide

122
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,220
is a special ritual

123
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,500
performed by the Demon Kingdom?

124
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,060
What's so funny?

125
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,420
Do you notice

126
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,340
how you always

127
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,940
finish my sentences?

128
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,660
Is it because you're too smart

129
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,660
or we know each other

130
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,900
much better now?

131
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
Actually...

132
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,420
Actually, I want to show you this.

133
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,660
An eye-shaped mark?

134
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,860
Uncle Ming!

135
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,140
What did you see?

136
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,060
What's the matter, Xiang?

137
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,740
Watch out, everyone!

138
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,980
Take cover!

139
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,900
Hurry up. Get up!

140
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,780
Quick.

141
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,220
Run!

142
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:20,980
Sir.

143
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,940
Over here!

144
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,900
The yaks are gone.

145
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,700
Our supply is on the yaks.

146
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,580
Stay here and don't move.

147
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,220
Careful!

148
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,180
Fatty. Come.

149
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,180
Bring guns.

150
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,020
Why did you stop?

151
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,060
Why aren't we giving chase?

152
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,140
Watch out!

153
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,860
Not bad, First.

154
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,180
You have a quick reflex.

155
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,180
Hu.

156
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,820
Where do you think the wolves come from?

157
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,900
Wolves hunt in packs.

158
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
I think Bone Ravine

159
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,660
is most probably their hunting ground.

160
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,500
No way.

161
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,460
Is the camp in danger?

162
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,620
Let's head back.

163
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,220
To where?

164
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:25,780
Back to camp.

165
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,620
But...

166
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,660
What about the yaks?

167
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,580
Move.

168
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,620
Don't!

169
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:20,980
Wolves.

170
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,900
Stay calm.

171
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,020
Don't fire.

172
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,780
Wolves are crafty.

173
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,860
They must be scouts.

174
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,860
They are here to see what we have.

175
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,420
Hu Bayi, save me!

176
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:32,980
Hu!

177
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,220
There's an alpha there.

178
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,340
It's still alive.

179
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,580
Kill the alpha and the rest will flee.

180
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,660
Kill this white fur alpha

181
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,020
and the other wolves will be
a walk in the park.

182
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,980
How sure are you of this, Fatty?

183
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,460
Don't you worry.

184
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,340
We'll have some wolf pelts
to keep us warm soon.

185
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,620
This alpha sure is smart.

186
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,180
First.

187
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,300
Now is not the best time.

188
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,300
Fret not.

189
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,260
That beast cannot escape.

190
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,340
It seems like the Bone Ravine

191
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,260
is where this pack of wolves
hunt their prey.

192
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,860
This fallen Tibetan blue bear

193
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,180
is their food.

194
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,100
They are cunning,

195
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,660
so stay vigilant.

196
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,420
Their ambush might arrive anytime.

197
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,340
Is that why you rushed back here?

198
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,660
This place is no longer safe.

199
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,180
Let's leave now.

200
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,540
We ate too much.

201
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,460
It's good to take a stroll

202
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,980
and move a bit.

203
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,340
We won't be able to sleep anyway.

204
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,540
Let's go.

205
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,460
First.

206
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,420
Let's go.

207
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,380
Pack up.

208
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,260
Let's get the yaks back.

209
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,700
Okay.

210
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,380
First.

211
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,620
How much longer do we have to travel?

212
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,740
We've arrived.

213
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,620
We have?

214
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,740
Snow Conch Ravine

215
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,260
is up there.

216
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,660
Karamir is inside.

217
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,180
What's wrong? Let's take a break.

218
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,260
No.

219
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,540
Look.

220
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,380
They have been talking.

221
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,100
Perhaps,

222
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,740
they are badmouthing us
with those Tibetans.

223
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,100
How should we get up there?

224
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,700
Via this way.

225
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,140
Scale the snow slope.

226
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,860
Take a break.

227
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,100
That path leads upward?

228
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,180
Yes.

229
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,820
But the yaks can't travel further.

230
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,660
This is the end
for the yaks and our supply.

231
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,580
I'll find a camping spot.

232
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,100
Ignore them. Rest now.

233
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,380
No.

234
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,580
Don't walk that fast.

235
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,300
Hu.

236
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,980
If the yaks can't scale it,

237
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,460
what should we do with our supplies?

238
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,380
What else can we do?

239
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,180
We'll carry them, of course.

240
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,500
The non-essentials

241
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,860
will stay at the camp
with First and others.

242
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,340
What are...

243
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,100
Wait.

244
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,580
Chief Yang,
what constitutes an essential?

245
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,100
All of them are essential.

246
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,060
Especially...

247
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,980
the yaks. Don't you think?

248
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,620
Fatty.

249
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,100
What did you find?

250
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,940
We found...

251
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,220
the wrong path.

252
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,700
The wrong path?

253
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,860
Seriously?

254
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,980
Calm down now.

255
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,700
Let's go.

256
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,700
Hu.

257
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,620
Even though I am more than happy

258
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,780
to offer my service,

259
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,020
that doesn't mean
you can order me around like a slave.

260
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,900
You want me to carry such a heavy load.

261
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,780
What if

262
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,220
my weight causes
the glacier to collapse?

263
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,860
Mr. Wang Kaixuan.

264
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,660
Where are your

265
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,340
perseverance and resilience?

266
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,740
If the yaks can't scale this,

267
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,020
we'll just have to
overcome this challenge ourselves.

268
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,660
Besides,

269
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,100
I didn't order you like a slave.

270
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,220
You made it sound so wrong.

271
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,340
Hu.

272
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,260
This is favoritism. This is not right.

273
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,500
See.

274
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,780
Miss Na

275
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,260
and Xiang are both women.

276
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,740
They don't have much strength,

277
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,540
so I totally understand if you won't
let them carry a lot of things.

278
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,100
But why is he empty-handed?

279
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:37,900
See?

280
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,660
Look at him.

281
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,780
If you make him carry something,

282
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,420
chances are,
he'll disappear along with the supplies.

283
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,740
And I won't disappear

284
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,900
along with the supplies?

285
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,620
You won't.

286
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,260
Look at Chief Yang.

287
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,260
She doesn't whine about the hard labor.

288
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,340
Learn from her.

289
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,140
Stop

290
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,540
singing Chief Yang's praises.

291
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
Is she some exemplary soldier now?

292
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,260
Please don't get me wrong, Chief Yang.

293
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,260
I just want us to be treated equally.

294
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,500
All right?

295
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,740
Fatty.

296
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,620
Give me some of your luggage.

297
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,660
Look.

298
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,380
Look at the marvelous Chief Yang.

299
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,100
She is as warm

300
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,980
as the sun in spring.

301
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,860
Can you feel it?

302
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,540
Count yourself lucky

303
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,540
that she didn't give you
the cold shoulder.

304
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,380
She's being kind, all right?

305
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,140
You don't have to help him.

306
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,500
It's heavy.

307
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,140
But he eats a lot, so he has strength.

308
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,780
What is wrong with you?

309
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,020
You sure

310
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,740
we should let First and others stay here
and wait for us?

311
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,300
First.

312
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,900
We have arrived at the entrance
of Mount Karamir.

313
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,380
Thank you for your guidance.

314
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,260
You can go back now.

315
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,740
This is not where we say goodbye.

316
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,100
That's right.

317
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,180
The glacier behind is very dangerous.

318
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,020
We have decided

319
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,380
to go with you.

320
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,900
I have talked to them.

321
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,540
Unearthing the Demon Pagoda

322
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,060
allows us to accumulate good merits.

323
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,260
Besides,

324
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,540
the furry beast that hurt Gema

325
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,420
has shown up.

326
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,260
Those wolves will come again.

327
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,380
If I don't kill it myself,

328
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,740
I won't be able to face Gema
when I get back.

329
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,620
Just rest assured.

330
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,020
Among everyone here,

331
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,260
First is the only one
who has been to Karamir

332
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,380
and come back alive.

333
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,620
That's right.

334
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,860
Let us tag along.

335
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,140
We will be of help.

336
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,140
Don't worry.

337
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,660
We'll go with you.

338
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,060
Where in Karamir is your destination?

339
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:41,900
There is a glacier

340
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,020
surrounded by four snow mountains.

341
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,380
We call it the Dragon Peak.

342
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,860
The Nine-Level Demon Pagoda should be
on the Dragon Peak.

343
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,620
Therefore, we need to locate
these four snow mountains first.

344
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,300
Uncle Ming.

345
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,380
Are you all right?

346
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,780
Careful.

347
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,340
Are you okay?

348
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,180
Don't move.

349
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:22,820
Don't...

350
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,220
Not bad, Mr. Ming.

351
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,580
I think soon,

352
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,460
there will be a new entry to
the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars.

353
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,940
The Twenty-Fifth Filial Exemplar,

354
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,340
He Who Searches for His Father.

355
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,620
What should we do?

356
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,140
They are here

357
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,340
and they have been following us.

358
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,420
We must find a safe spot

359
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,820
to settle down before it gets dark.

360
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,060
Sir.

361
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,340
Na.

362
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,940
Drink it.

363
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:20,940
No.

364
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,060
Altitude sickness. Headache.

365
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,260
I'll hit the hay now.

366
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,980
Can I call you Duji from now on?

367
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,980
Duji?

368
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,260
What does it mean?

369
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,220
Duji

370
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,580
means courageous in Mandarin.

371
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,580
Gema always mentions

372
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,740
that you are her savior
and how brave you are.

373
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,980
After spending these few days together,

374
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,180
you did prove yourself

375
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,580
to be a respectable gentleman.

376
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,220
You flatter me, First.

377
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,820
But I like this name.

378
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,740
We were talking about
the four snow mountains that day.

379
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,860
You had something else to tell me,
didn't you?

380
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,300
(Karamir)

381
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,900
(means the Sea of Disaster.)

382
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,100
(The Dragon Peak you're heading to)

383
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,940

00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,940
(when the glacier is melting.)

387
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,820
(There are holes everywhere)

388
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,420
(and cirques within the ice caves.)

389
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,860
It is said that demons dwell in cirques.

390
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,220
I almost didn't make it back alive

391
