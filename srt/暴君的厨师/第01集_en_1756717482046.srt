Your Highness

3
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:19,204
We have brought Yan Zhiyong from the water lava

4
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,982
The man I'm about to face

5
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,485
He is the most powerful foodie in North Korea

6
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,987
Also the most terrifying tyrant

7
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,489
Yan Xijun

8
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,949
(Lee Xian, the King of Korea)

9
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:03,456
Your Highness, you must punish this ghost girl

10
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,042
Punish the Chaotong

11
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,504
-Requests Your Highness to purify the court's guild
-Requests Your Highness to purify the court's guild

12
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,236
last night

13
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:38,324
This woman offered strange food
Disturbing my mind

14
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,751
Therefore, she immediately...

15
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,977
Be on the job and be familiar with it!

16
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,353
(Waiting to be familiar with: the chef of Shuilajian)

17
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,730
Why?

18
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,941
-What? Wait for familiarity?
-When you can get familiar with it?

19
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,401
A woman?

20
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,194
Starting today

21
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,573
You have to prepare meals for me every day. No mistakes are allowed

22
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,490
but

23
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,451
If your dishes are repeated

24
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,161
Or it may not be in line with my wishes

25
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,040
I will give you a death

26
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,042
What a joke

27
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,295
My dream is nothing more than becoming a Michelin three-star chef

28
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,548
As a result, today I became the chef of the tyrant

29
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,509
Do you have something to say?

30
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,719
or…

31
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,972
Do you want to die now?

32
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,077
This guy will kill me sooner or later, right?

33
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,455
I must go back alive

34
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,540
anyway

35
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,380
Your Highness

36
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,633
The little one confuses you with food. The sins are extremely evil.

37
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:22,220
Although this contract is not fair...

38
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,848
A small constituent

39
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,810
He is scattered and serves you

40
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,412
My name is Yan Zhiyong

41
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,289
You may not believe it if you say it

42
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,499
I'm from 2025

43
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,876
How could I come here?

44
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,296
That's it...

45
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:03,094
Lesson 1: Chili sauce butter bibimbap

(Golden Pot Competition Cooking Competition)

48
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,437
Dear gentlemen, ladies

49
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,857
The top cooking competition in France

Aiming to discover creative and innovative chefs

51
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,487
The mission of the final is to make royal meals for a king

52
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,907
I saw exquisite dishes taking shape

53
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,159
Dear gentlemen, ladies

54
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,785
A month-long game

55
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,954
Now enter the final five minutes countdown!

56
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,756
Excuse me! gentlemen!

57
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,093
What's up?

58
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,636
My stove is broken

59
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,679
What?

60
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,064
There are only four minutes left now

61
00:05:56,147 --> 00:06:00,401
Please note that if the dishes are not completed within time
Will be disqualified

62
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,071
The winner will receive a prize of 100,000 euros…

63
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:16,167
And in Paul Bonner's
Opportunity to be a chef at the “Happy Healing” Restaurant

64
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,669
That's a three-star Michelin restaurant

65
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,645
Madam, what are you doing? Are you crazy?

66
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:36,979
It's a little bit

67
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,941
You cannot use unauthorized materials to create fire

68
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,779
“Nothing is worse than an unfinished dish”

69
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,197
Is this a French proverb?

70
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,698
I totally agree

71
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,160
I'd rather be a little crazy

72
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,496
Wait no...

73
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,301
Time to roast with open flame

74
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,554
Although the steak is completely cooked

75
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,931
But this step is crucial

76
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,226
Because it can make the surface fry until the color

77
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,645
And create a unique flavor and aroma

78
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,313
This is called Maillard's reaction

79
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,777
Two minutes left Please complete your dishes

80
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,185
One minute left
Please don't touch anything when the time comes

81
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,469
Time is here!

82
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,430
Now the judges decide who the champion will fall.

83
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,265
Stay tuned!

(Golden Pot Competition Cooking Competition)

85
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,729
Please introduce your dishes

86
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:45,024
这道菜叫 is a "vocally"

87
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,610
-Turkish means "Sultan's Joy"
-The combination is very creative but...

88
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,196
I think the Sudan may not be too satisfied

89
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,281
In the era of great geographical discovery

90
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,619
Spices like lilac are more precious than gold

91
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,706
The royal family also uses these spices to make dishes
To demonstrate their status

92
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,833
IMHO, this combination is not coordinated

93
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,336
Hello everyone judges This is a turkey roll

94
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:09,632
Queen of Louis XVI
Marie Antoinette's favorite please use it slowly

95
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,805
Every time you chew it, you can taste a new taste

96
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,056
but

97
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,183
You think the brisket in the middle

98
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,227
Is it well matched with other ingredients?

99
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,312
Oh, it's you

100
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,399
The problematic player who broke the rules

101
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,401
I prepared Chateaubrion deer steak

102
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,237
The tenderloin is roasted in reverse and then smoked with straw

103
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,906
The sauce is made with red ginseng and raspberries

104
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,741
Adds a bitter and sweet flavor

105
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,535
This is soybean mash

106
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:41,372
A kind of tile crisp
Korean cereal powder made by rice crispy flour

107
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,792
I'm still serving it with orange caviar

108
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,003
I can smell the smoky scent

109
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,130
The color of the tenderloin is better than I thought

110
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,464
This is Dao Yuchen

111
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,342
Made with straw open flame barbecue technology that has been passed down for hundreds of years

112
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,178
That's a skill that originated in the Joseon era

113
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,180
The Joseon era?

114
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,098
That's right

115
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,310
A long time ago, when South Korea was still called North Korea
There is a monarch named Yan Xijun

116
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,688
He is both a tyrant and a foodie

117
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,357
And this deer steak is his favorite

118
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,830
The bitter and sweet sauce adds a sense of cooking

119
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,335
Raising with straw is a very complex technique

120
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,212
But the heat perfectly penetrates every inch of flesh

121
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,757
And I can't smell the fishy smell of venison

122
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,259

Yes, I'm packing my luggage and I'll go to the airport later

You must be very tired, right? Go and have a rest

153
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,960
I heard that there will be a total solar eclipse later today

154
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,170

Oh, right

158
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,844
If you have a book, you have to bring it back

159
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,304
What book?

160
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,055
It is a historical document from North Korea

161
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,516
I asked Professor Pierre from the University of Sorbonne to help me find it

162
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,686
He said he would send it to you. Remember to bring it back.

163
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,146
OK

Meet a solar eclipse in flight
It is considered a special luck

178

185
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,490
Oh no

186
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,575
Oh my God

187
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,836
Oh no, it's over

188
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,762
what to do? This is an antique book

189
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,266
Make the stain first

190
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,643
Wipe off with water

191
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,567
"Looking at the Clouds"?

192
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,122
(Kurimbuiler)

193
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,541
(Prepare four egg yolks…)

194
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,543
This is a recipe

195
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,170
Is this recipe?

196
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,760
How did you tear off this page?

197
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,013
(Return the World)

198
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,976
What... World Farm?

199
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,562
I don't know either

200
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,981
Is the previous pages okay?

201
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,906
All are wet. Oh, what should I do?

202
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,999
"My Love"

203
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:03,420
"If one day you read this book"

204
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:08,258
"I hope you can come back to me"?

205
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,054
What?

206
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,349
This is a romance novel from the Joseon era

207
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,142
("Wangyun Lu")

208
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,527
What's going on? what happens?

209
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,370
Hello?

210
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,164
I'm here!

211
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,709
Help!

212
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,255
Why can't it be opened?

213
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,341
Hello? Can you help me open the door?

214
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,430
Let me go!

215
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,266
How could you treat me like this?

216
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,809
Drag the nave out!

217
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:05,894
Queen Mother

218
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,523
Your Highness!

219
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,817
How could your Highness be like this...

220
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,944
Enough! Drag her down!

221
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,863
Let me go!

222
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,364
Queen Mother...

223
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,076
-The Lord!
-Never do not

224
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,288
You must hold it back

225
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,708
You have to hold back

226
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,891
The center of the red heart!

227
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,246
-Dinner!
-Yes Your Highness

228
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,710
Order the military officers

229
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,463
Send the deer to the Siyuyuan

230
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,173
Yes Your Highness

231
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,383
(Changxuan Du Xueli)

232
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,929
It's late

233
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,557
Why not go back to the palace first?

234
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,478
The gang of thieves who appeared during the last hunt

235
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,688
I'm afraid it will attack again

236
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,273
The old minister is really worried

237
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,984
How dare you say such ominous words?

238
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,489
It's really a worry

239
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,449
I'm wrong

240
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,160
Today is a special day

241
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,705
How can you end the hunting just now

242
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,171
The time is here!

243
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,180
(The tenth year of Yan Xijun, Jiashen year)

244
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,974
rise!

245
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,976
bye!

246
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,769
rise!

247
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,981
The Lord has gone out of the palace to hunt?

248
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,899
What nonsense is this?

249
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,609
The food-saving ceremony should have begun long ago

250
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,111
(The Grandmother of King Niju, King Li Jung)

251
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,696
Forgive the guilty princess

252
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,365
It's a villain's dereliction of duty

253
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,367
Everyone knows solar eclipse

254
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,495
It is a sign that God holds the king accountable for his faults

255
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:32,833
Your Highness does not seem to realize how serious this matter is

256
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,585
You should be careful in your words and actions and abstain from killing. You can...

257
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,462
Enough, stop talking!

258
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,882
Don’t you understand the Lord?

259
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,593
It's all because of Shuyuan

260
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,845
Confucian scholars

261
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:48,223
They all gathered outside the palace and submitted a memorial to request punishment for her

262
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,519
Are you saying that the Lord went hunting because of this?

263
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,189
Because she has no peace for a day

264
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,318
The Queen of the Princess, you should teach her a lesson

265
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,236
To show your majesty...

266
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,863
Is it really just that?

267
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,491
Did the Lord remember

268
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:10,078
Is it the deposed concubine Yan?

269
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:15,584
I remember she seemed to die at this time.

270
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,920
So the former king...

271
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,423
What kind of style is this

272
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,842
Hunting on the day of the food-saving ceremony?

273
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,219
It's really heartbreaking

274
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,889
He knew it was a great gift for the country's destiny

275
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,391
But he wanted to hunt

276
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,644
Is this still necessary to ask?

277
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:40,567
Someone must have said or done something
Annoyed the Lord

278
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:46,907
I don't know what hurt his heart this time

279
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,618
Your wine is so good

280
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,453
Have you drunk until dawn again?

281
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,621
Dawn?

282
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,665
Is it still morning now?

283
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,960
I really came into the palace while drinking all the way

284
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,840
But you told me

285
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,552
Why didn’t Ren Du accept the order?

286
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,346
He's going to pick red again

287
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,388
(Caihong: I collected beauties and horses for Yan Xijun)

288
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,225
Our country is in chaos.

289
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,810
This state affairs

290
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,730
Just like that romantic woman

291
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,732
Same as the skirt, chaotic

292
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,988
The ceremony is still underway

293
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,825
Who is so noisy?

294
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:30,992
Quiet

295
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,369
Everyone is quiet

296
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,623
Assist the main

297
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,960
Govern the world with virtue and wisdom

298
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,340
Birds singing in the sun, dark sky

299
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,050
A solar eclipse has really happened

300
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,808
Where did you pick the heroes of Songzai?

301
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,977
Go to the Gyeonggi Superintendent

302
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,609
All heard

303
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,612
After the hunting, I will go to the Gyeonggi Supervisory Camp

304
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,698
The one who hunted the most deer today

305
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,325
I will have a great reward!

306
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,416
Start hunting!

307
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,961
Something happened to your Highness

308
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,255
What happened?

309
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,008
Are you also worried about the food-saving ceremony?

310
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,051
Yes

311
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,097
Hunting during eclipse is a rare pleasure

312
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,850
Besides, it's just starting to be interesting

313
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,227
But it is said that if the king does not attend the ceremony

314
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,687
Will anger God

315
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,316
There will be a ghost girl appearing

316
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,779
Demon woman...

317
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,957
What happened?

318
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:08,089
I don't believe in those strange powers and gods

319
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,052
In the era of New Confucianism, still talking about ghost girls?

320
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,992
How does it smell like Fendol?

321
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,382
etc.

322
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,259
What website is this?

323
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,636
ah? How could I be on the net?

324
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,595
What's going on?

325
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,140
Hello? Is anyone here?

326
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,225
Hello?

327
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,644
What exactly happened?

328
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,153
What to do? No signal?

329
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,447
This is bad

330
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,206
hateful

331
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,089
I'm here!

332
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,467
I swear I was in the toilet on the plane just now

333
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,345
what happens?

334
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,348
What's going on?

335
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:45,895
It's a fox!

336
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,606
Chase quickly!

337
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,483
Your Highness!

338
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,116
Your Highness!

339
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,036
Your Highness!

340
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,793
Damn it! Why is 5G network speed so poor?

341
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,422
Is it because I am in the deep mountains that there is no signal?

342
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,509
Ouch my arm

343
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,847
Where am I?

344
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,807
Which country is this?

345
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,439
arrow?

346
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:37,781
fox?

347
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,121
Oh my waist

348
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,294
I'm right here!

349
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,713
What?

350
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,632
OMG

351
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,674
These people are crazy

352
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,010
You are shooting arrows at people!

353
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,554
Don't look here! Stop cumming!

354
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,431
The fox ran over there!

355
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,031
Who are you?

356
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:21,783
Are you Korean?

357
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,164
The figure is really suspicious

358
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,628
No, wait a moment

359
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,964
The fox ran over there

360
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,133
Stop cum

361
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,217
What are you doing?

362
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,024
Why is he chasing me?

363
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,861
Don't follow me!

364
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,868
OMG!

365
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,230
Is this South Korea?

366
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,982
You shot the arrow, right?

367
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,276
Who are you?

368
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,071
She looks quite weird

369
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,740
From hair to clothing

370
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,994
Is she holding a silver dagger?

371
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,333
Listen to his tone, it must be South Korea.

372
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,628
Playing role-playing?

373
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,422
Why are you wearing Korean clothes?

374
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:03,593
You want to know who I am
Shouldn’t you introduce yourself first?

375
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:07,305
I kept calling the fox and ran over there. Didn't you hear it?

376
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,223
Heard

377
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,265
What?

378
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,811
Then why are you still shooting arrows at me? Are you crazy?

379
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,524
No, stop! Wait a moment!

380
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,983
What the hell are you?

381
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,944
This can emit ten thousand volts of electricity

382
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,321
Do you know what a stun gun is?

383
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,159
electric shock?

384
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,745
It is said that if the king does not attend the ceremony

385
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,789
Will anger God

386
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,542
There will be a ghost girl appearing

387
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,419
Is she a ghost girl?

388
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,965
Are you a human or a ghost?

389
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,843
Or the nine-tailed fox?

390
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,553
What is the reaction?

391
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,055
I'm just an ordinary person

392
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,807
You monster

393
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,934
Who would call you "a person"?

394
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,353
You're crazy...

395
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,688
No, wait a moment

396
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,190
Listen to me OK

397
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,526
I'm not an ordinary person either

398
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,112
I'm a Michelin three-star chef

399
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:05,738
"Zhu Chu"?

400
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,700
Weird dressing and frivolous words

401
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,743
Plus that confused look

402
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,954
You must be a ghost girl, undoubtedly

403
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,292
Begging for food

404
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,085
Is this guy wrong?

405
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,837
I can't stand it anymore

406
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,090
What did you say? OK I admit I dress like a beggar

407
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,885
I accidentally fell into the woods and of course my clothes got dirty

408
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,387
But do you think your outfit is normal?

409
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,806
What did you say? "you"?

410
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,808
How dare you be so rude?

411
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,186
What about that? Do you want me to call you "me"?

412
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,525
Oh, wait, are you an actor?

413
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,527
Are you filming a costume drama?

414
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,362
It seems you're filming

415
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,363
Is it a movie or a TV series?

416
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,407
What you said

417
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,284
Nothing

418
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,077
It's understandable

419
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,749
Are you crazy? How can you face that person?

420
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,501
OK, you cum

421
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:01,961
You're cum

422
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,596
My shoulder bag

423
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,597
What the hell?

424
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,016
Did he really shoot an arrow at me?

425
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,144
This hand

426
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,229
It seems to have shaken

427
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,232
Don't move!

428
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,486
You will come down from the horse immediately!

429
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,696
I'll say

430
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,200
I'm a Taekwondo black belt

431
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,576
You're dead

432
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,830
Let's go, ghost girl

433
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,005
Taekwon!

434
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:49,801
Taekwon!

435
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,766
Taekwon!

436
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:04,273
Oh, your arrows are used up

437
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,985
I want to call the police

438
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,112
I sued you for attempted murder and asked you to go to jail. Do you know?

439
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,532
My cousin's husband's uncle's niece and son-in-law

440
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,784
A lawyer from a prosecutor

441
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,836
-etc
-Your cousin's husband's

442
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,921
Uncle's niece and son-in-law?

443
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,090
Isn’t that the same as outsiders?

444
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,469
Oh My God

445
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,888
So you still have a sword?

446
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:40,268
No matter which official he is from

447
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,519
But he also...

448
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,773
The heads will soon fall

449
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,487
Don't come here!

450
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,351
My stun gun!

451
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,936
It's the ghost girl's silver dagger

452
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,855
Are you so brave?

453
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,523
It's just a spark.

454
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,987
This must be a dream

455
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,530
If it's a dream, wake up

456
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,241
Where did that aura go just now?

457
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:38,951
God, Buddha

458
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,871
I swear I will be a good person Hallelujah Amen

459
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,372
I'll give it to you now

460
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,666
Go on the road

461
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,586
Namo Amitabha!

462
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,599
A traitor?

463
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,398
not good!

464
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,339
Your Highness!

465
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,556
Your Highness!

466
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,938
Your Highness is gone

467
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,275
Carefully search the entire woods!

468
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,317
-yes!
-yes!

469
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,577
Get out of the way!

470
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,579
Lord Ren is here!

471
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,544
I really can't stand it

472
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,213
Those who don't know thought it was His Highness on a tour

473
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,506
Ren Songzai

474
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,258
As the prince consort, he became the emperor

475
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,218
Nowadays, the power is at its peak

476
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:20,928
(Ren Ruihong, Ren Songzai)

477
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,388
My son

478
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,557
Is the matter done?

479
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,936
I only said one thing to the servants of the kitchen in Jingji Supervisory Camp

480
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,314
"If you want to survive, run away quickly."

481
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:35,067
Even so, don't take it lightly

482
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,029
Hong Jingda, the Gyeonggi Observation Author

483
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:41,032
He is an old stubborn person who thinks Shuyuan and Jiang

484
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:44,994
Continuously slandering in bewitching the Lord

485
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,829
Father?

486
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,457
I'll handle everything, Father

487
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,667
You don't have to worry about leaving

488
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:11,938
Oh My God!

489
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,279
Yes, we fell down together

490
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,493
A traitor?

491
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:35,253
Wait, did he really get shot?

492
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:37,713
Really won

493
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,676
Wait, wait a moment

494
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,135
Hello?

495
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,012
Is there anyone here?

496
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,889
There are people injured!

497
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,354
Hello

498
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,231
Hello, wake up

499
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:56,816
presumptuous

500
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,652
What a scammer, please sober up!

501
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,112
Really

502
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:04,865
Blood!

503
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,955
It's important to stop bleeding first

504
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,511
I should have a paste

505
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,557
Found

506
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,311
Give you more

507
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,230
No matter how crazy you are

508
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,941
I can't stand by death and refuse to save me.

509
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,572
By the way, call 119

510
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,329
My phone is in my shoulder bag

511
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,498
I don't want to touch him

512
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,876
I'll search your pocket

513
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,252
OK?

514
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,545
Where is his cell phone?

515
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,383
Why don't you have a pocket?

516
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,595
Are you here?

517
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,724
Are you looking for this?

518
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,977
My God!

519
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,022
I think there must be some misunderstandings here

520
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,941
I want to ask your phone for you to call someone

521
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,151
Because you look very hurt

522
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,072
I can't use my phone, either
Because you shot my shoulder bag through!

523
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,114
What?

524
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:28,908
presumptuous!

525
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,701
You want to confuse me with nonsense again

526
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,994
So that the accomplices can shoot arrows?

527
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,954
You have paranoia

528
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,624
I was at the scene, but it doesn’t mean I am the murderer!

529
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,751
Don't be quibbling!

530
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,504
When you arrive at the charity palace, you will naturally find out the mastermind behind it.

531
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,672
Calm down Yan Zhiyong

532
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,549
You crazy man!

533
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,676
Didn't you see that I helped you stop the bleeding?

534
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,512
I saved your life!

535
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,515
Did she help stop the bleeding?

536
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,016
If this is true

537
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,686
Then you must have something else to do if you keep my life

538
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,648
I saved you, are you just repaying me?

539
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,358
I'll make it clear

540
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,861
No matter how abnormal your mind is
I'm not interested in your life!

541
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,281
Stop talking nonsense, die, ghost girl!

542
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,875
Hand over the dagger quickly!

543
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,419
Don't think about it

544
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,546
I'm leaving, don't follow me, do you hear?

545
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,673
stop!

546
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,591
I will order you in the name of the King of Korea!

547
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,305
"King"? You can speak quietly

548
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,932
Don't say anything. Do you know?

549
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,602
What a weird guy

550
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,897
Doesn't she understand human words?

551
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,407
I'm very good at using a knife.

552
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,669
Her ability to use a knife is indeed extraordinary

553
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:19,935
Have you seen it?

554
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,854
Is she really a ghost girl?

555
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,740
Say your name Ghost girl

556
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,866
"prostitute"?

557
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,786
I'm not a prostitute! I'm just an ordinary person!

558
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,038
people?

559
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,831
In that case, who is your father?

560
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,459
It's true that you are so helpless!

561
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,085
Is the "true" clan?

562
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,130
You're kidding me

563
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,882
I am a chef!

564
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,842
Chef Yan Zhiyong!

565
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:52,927
"Zhu Chu"?

566
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,513
I have never heard of Zhu Chuyan's family

567
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,268
Who are you?

568
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:03,562
I am a chef!

569
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,397
It's a chef!

570
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,444
alright

571
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:54,780
Alas, so tired

572
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,254
I'll take a look

573
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,259
Hello

574
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,094
Hello

575
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:33,777
What's this?

576
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,864
Have you tied up my man?

577
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,199
Let's play tricks, stand up quickly

578
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,036
Do you want to die?

579
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,331
Haven't you figured out the situation yet?

580
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,001
Get up quickly or I'll leave by myself

581
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,469
All right

582
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,518
Lead the way

583
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:10,481
Really, why do you say every word in an orderly tone?

584
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,404
Follow up

585
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:24,203
How far do you want to take me before killing me?

586
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,496
Really!

587
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,124
Can you stop talking nonsense?

588
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,169
If I wanted to kill you, I wouldn't save you

589
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:35,464
You tie me up
It also seemed to have helped me

590
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,512
So you admit that I'm saving you, right?

591
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,597
I admit you didn't want to kill me

592
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,141
Then you admit that I am not a prostitute anymore, right?

593
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,227
I didn't say "prostitute"

594
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,354
I'm talking about "ghost girl"

595
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,356
So speechless

596
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,275
Let's go

597
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,111
Keep up

598
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,237
Let's go

599
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,155
Let's go!

600
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:05,994
(Fengde Palace)

601
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,413
What's going on?

602
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,706
You said that Your Highness has not returned to the palace yet?

603
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,086
Your Highness seems to be in a state of hunting
Delayed the time to return to the palace

604
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,087
(Supervisor Palace Qiuyue)

605
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,213
wrong

606
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,008
Although Your Highness loves hunting, this has never happened

607
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,221
Something must have happened

608
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:25,931
Could it be...

609
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,642
Lord Dajun, did he do it?

610
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,229
(Seven years ago)

611
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,606
Do you know who I am?

612
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:44,658
The first time I noticed you was in a brothel

613
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:49,663
You weren't even a formal prostitute at that time

614
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:54,168
I heard that your mother sold you to Li Jinshi

615
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,629
Did you really kill him?

616
00:45:58,922 --> 00:45:59,756
Yes

617
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,051
You live in hell every day

618
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,723
Endless beatings during the day

619
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:10,142
At night, I have to bear that beastly man

620
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:13,187
But for women living on this land

621
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,314
This is commonplace

622
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,441
so what?

623
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,195
Is it natural for us to live like livestock?

624
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,988
If I go back to that kind of day

625
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,324
I'll kill him again

626
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:33,874
I can

627
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,210
Save you out

628
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,005
what do you want from me?

629
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,432
You want

630
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,894
Have a good night with me before I die?

631
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,103
You think too

632
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,398
Am I the superficial man?

633
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,943
What I want

634
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,153
Not to make you my woman

635
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,739
It's your loyalty

636
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:09,826
I killed two damn nobles today

637
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,413
But tomorrow may become a sharp blade aimed at your neck

638
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,882
How do you kill a dead person?

639
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,093
I'm dead

640
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,554
Dead ten years ago

641
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:40,357
He is waiting for the opportunity and will not act so rashly

642
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,485
- Qiuyue
-Yes

643
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,904
I must send a secret decree to the Lord

644
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:48,865
yes

645
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,830
An urgent message came from the palace

646
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,837
Lord, Lord

647
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,465
Haven't returned to the palace yet

648
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,343
Have you met an assassin again?

649
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,178
If so

650
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:13,849
The person behind him must be the remnants of the Wuyin scholars' disaster

651
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,976
Who dares to act without our knowledge?

652
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,520
Not everyone we know

653
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:22,190
Lost your lord like us
There are countless close friends or brothers

654
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,067
We can't all know each other

655
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:28,905
Even if someone really acts without permission

656
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,992
We can't blame them, either

657
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:39,499
We choose to wait until the time is right before taking action

658
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:43,128
Even if the Lord is a tyrant

659
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:47,257
We must not move against time, either

660
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,054
If among us

661
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,473
There really is someone...

662
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,313
Action without authorization

663
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,233
Then he will pay the price

664
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:08,654
Don't forget

665
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,282
Wait for the opportunity

666
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,535
It is our destiny to correct the world

667
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,455
-Yes
-Yes

668
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,225
water

669
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,521
Get water

670
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,941
Hello

671
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,984
I'm thirsty, too

672
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,611
You go find a tavern nearby

673
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,822
I want to drink cinnamon tea

674
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,408
So speechless

675
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,660
Are you a fan of being?

676
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,913
Do you really think of yourself as the king of North Korea?

677
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:01,665
It seems you finally understand

678
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,793
I am the king of this country

679
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,008
Did you hurt your head or your chest?

680
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,055
It seems you don't want to believe it

681
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,313
- Look carefully
- Really

682
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,232
What do you want me to see this time?

683
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,695
So what's wrong?

684
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,120
What's this?

685
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,164
Is this a dragon?

686
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,918
Oh, if you have a dragon, you will be the king

687
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,670
Oh My God

688
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,297
It's so sad

689
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,673
Dragon robe like this

690
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,550
You can rent for three hours at Fengdeok Palace for 10,000 won

691
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,469
-Do you really think I'll believe this?
-What?

692
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,929
Rent a dragon robe in the palace?

693
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,682
Yes, everyone will wear Korean clothes and go shopping in the palace

694
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,267
Foreigners like it

695
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:09,149
Why do you just don’t believe that I am the king?

696
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,525
What about you?

697
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:13,653
Why don’t you believe that I am the chef?

698
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,322
You're so annoying

699
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,032
What if I am really the king?

700
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:20,160
I'll take more responsibility for you because you are a patient

701
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,580
Walk

702
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:25,999
Walk

703
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:27,250
hurry up

704
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:29,628
OK

705
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,050
Even though you are not the woman I like

706
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,427
But when we return to the palace

707
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,096
I will give my grace

708
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,308
I will give my grace

709
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,854
What kind of grace?

710
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,482
There must be a limit to madness. Don’t talk nonsense!

711
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,859
How dare you attack me?

712
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,237
I was panicked and didn't say anything

713
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,405
But I get rough when I hear rude words

714
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,158
shut up! Is that an excuse?

715
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,285
It's incredible

716
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,663
Who are you?

717
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:05,705
Are you really an actor?

718
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:06,748
I am...

719
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,668
This country's...

720
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,964
king

721
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,968
Are you really persistent?

722
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,386
Enough

723
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,306
Let's go while I'm still patient with you

724
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,516
Walk

725
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:28,645
Walk

726
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,315
It's a house!

727
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,151
Very good

728
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,198
Hello!

729
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,285
Can you walk slowly?

730
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,957
I know this is just thatched house

731
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,751
But you can't kick someone's door like this

732
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,629
Everything on this land is owned by me

733
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,050
Why should I talk nonsense to you?

734
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:00,886
Really

735
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:08,727
Hello?

736
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,771
Interrupted, is anyone there?

737
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,231
Be quiet

738
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:16,026
We're still under the ban

739
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:17,569
"Not forbidden"?

740
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,738
Yes, Shaguling Forest is my hunting ground

741
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,907
So here is uninhabited

742
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,158
Banned...

743
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,412
I remembered Yan Xijun

744
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,748
What? "Yan Xijun"?

745
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,250
Banned signs refer to signs that are prohibited from entering and leaving

746
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,713
In order to expand his hunting ground

747
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:40,467
Demolition of houses and drive away the people
Then the boundary was drawn with markers

748
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,261
Who is Yan Xijun?

749
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,722
The royal family members do not know each other

750
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:48,183
Didn’t you say you are the king?

751
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,644
Don’t you even know the tyrant Yan Xijun?

752
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,730
What kind of envoy he sent to be a treacherous minister

753
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:58,151
Collect all the women in North Korea and offer them to him

754
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,653
Do you really don't know?

755
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:01,529
"Caihong"?

756
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,574
You are talking about me, are you?

757
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,619
Of course not, he was a person hundreds of years ago

758
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:11,665
And Yan Xijun is the king

759
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:12,916
The worst tyrant in North Korea

760
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,377
Why is he a tyrant?

761
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,712
You really don't know?

762
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:19,839
He does whatever he wants and acts arbitrarily

763
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,467
To build your own hunting ground, oppress the people

764
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,427
He also brought all the women to his side through Caihong

765
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,889
Kill unfaithful ministers and establish the majesty of the royal family

766
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,349
This is the way to support the country

767
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:32,060
The original people in the hunting ground just moved to another place

768
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:34,020
Picking red also has its noble meaning

769
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,022
You should first understand his intention

770
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,857
Instead of calling him a tyrant ruthlessly

771
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,109
What other treacherous officials?

772
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,988
You aren't talking about you, why are you so excited?

773
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,782
But to be honest

774
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,243
Not to mention the others, that Caihong is too much

775
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,120
How can people do that?

776
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,789
The ghost girl from Zhu Chulai, please listen to me

777
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:55,333
You called me that again

778
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,334
The greatest responsibility of the king

779
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:59,963
It is to give birth to descendants and continue the royal bloodline and the lifeblood of the country

780
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,340
The king who gave kindness to many women in order to seek heirs

781
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:05,552
and loyal ministers who follow their noble intentions
How can you blame each other?

782
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,681
You're crazy

783
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:11,349
Reading history books is stupid

784
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:14,144
Any excuse to continue the heirs

785
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:15,687
He's a lustful person

786
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,398
-What a good excuse
-What? "erotic"?

787
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,942
How dare you speak so sarcastically?

788
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,402
OK OK OK

789
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:25,655
You can give birth to your descendants slowly

790
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,033
What we need to do next is to make me feel at ease

791
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,243
I'm about...

792
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,955
A man like you has no interest

793
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,292
Aren't you afraid of a disaster?

794
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,756
Not afraid, Your Highness, I am a person who counts every day

795
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:43,840
You are presumptuous!

796
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,341
Release the ties immediately!

797
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,386
I won't loosen your ties right away!

798
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:52,474
What?

799
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,851
Let go of me!

800
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,025
It's so uncomfortable to wear this wet dress

801
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,193
This one is just right

802
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,333
Ouch, my whole body hurts

803
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:22,212
What an inexplicable day

804
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:23,797
Yes?

805
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:28,426
I should say this

806
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,100
Have you heard it?

807
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:37,727
Heard

808
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:42,649
Is anyone here?

809
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,284
Hello?

810
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,329
Is anyone here?

811
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,584
Hello?

812
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,591
Where is the switch of the light? Too dark

813
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:10,927
Is anyone here?

814
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,304
Hello?

815
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:15,348
You thief!

816
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,976
Didn’t your father teach you?

817
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,561
What? Thief?

818
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:22,230
You obviously stole my clothes but still dare not admit it?

819
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,317
Oh, is this dress yours?

820
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,527
sorry

821
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,570
never mind

822
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,530
-Get out quickly
-Okay, I'll leave now

823
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,115
I'll leave

824
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:35,869
But can you tell me where this is first?

825
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,287
Which area is this?

826
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,455
I said forget it, get out of here

827
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,999
-Get out quickly!
-etc!

828
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:43,334
-Get out!
-Wait a moment!

829
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,419
Stop making trouble!

830
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:47,922
What happened today?

831
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,092
It's really endless, right?

832
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:55,638
alright

833
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,016
Listen to me

834
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,019
I know you'll misunderstand now

835
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:03,480
But it was too dark and I didn't know where I was

836
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,440
I saw a room and came in

837
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:07,984
Do you think I will believe it?

838
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:12,197
If that's the case
Shouldn’t you speak out first to ask if there is a master?

839
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,199
I shouted but no one responded

840
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,658
That's why I thought it was an empty house

841
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,077
So what if it’s an empty house?

842
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,829
Then you can wear someone else's clothes

843
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,165
Are you still wandering around like your own home?

844
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,626
The whole area here is Shaguling Forest

845
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:27,253
So why don’t you know where this is?

846
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,672
You also call it Shaguling Forest?

847
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,549
I'm not asking this

848
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:35,428
Which area is this?

849
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,515
How dare you scream here!

850
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,476
This is the hunting ground of the king

851
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,269
If caught, you will be dragged away.

852
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,063
Do you really don’t know about the ban?

853
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,398
"The King"? "Not forbidden"?

854
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,734
We're still under the ban

855
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:52,946
This is Shaguling Forest
My hunting grounds, so no one lives in it

856
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:57,158
It's going crazy

857
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,745
Everyone here is like foreigners

858
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,374
Wait, you're wearing Korean clothes too

859
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,087
This is the set, right?

860
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,630
"Scene"?

861
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:11,965
What is that?

862
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,008
It's the place to make movies and TV series

863
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:16,928
"Shop Movie"? "Shop room and room"?

864
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:20,682
Stop kidding, I'm a little scared when you do this

865
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:23,726
I am the one who is afraid of now!

866
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,437
What he said wouldn't be true

867
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,856
I've really come to the Joseon era

868
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:33,444
Which year is this year?

869
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:34,696
Which year?

870
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,531
I'll think about it

871
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:39,033
Last year was the year of Guiwei

872
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,827
So this year is the year of Jiashen

873
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,412
In the year of Jiashen?

874
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:43,913
What happened this time?

875
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,040
He actually used the heavenly stems and earthly branches to record the year?

876
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,667
No

877
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:49,836
You just said...

878
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,005
Where is this?

879
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:55,633
You are such a strange person

880
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:58,553
You don't know we're here
Within the prohibition of Shaguling Forest on Chidao Island

881
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:00,805
I don't know what year it is

882
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:04,058
People who don't know think you are from another world

883
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:05,852
That…

884
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,814
Where is the nearest convenience store?

885
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:11,232
Convenience...what?

886
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:14,235
What strange word is that?

887
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,570
What are you talking about?

888
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:18,489
Ah, it's the supermarket

889
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:21,284
Super...what?

890
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:23,661
Oh my God

891
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:26,748
She doesn't even know about convenience stores and supermarkets

892
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,125
impossible

893
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,918
This must be a dream

894
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,553
But how can you get hungry when dreaming?

895
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,097
to be honest

896
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,141
I'm a little hungry

897
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,435
Would you care for something to eat?

898
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:50,229
Isn't this a dream?

899
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,899
Really, stop talking stupid

900
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,109
Get up quickly, okay?

901
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,364
I have to find my shoulder bag first

902
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:02,700
There is a way to find the phone in your bag

903
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,247
Wait until we finish eating

904
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,541
Can you take me to the nearby cliff?

905
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,502
Go to the cliff?

906
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,754
Is this time?

907
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:18,800
I lost something and must be retrieved.

908
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:23,262
There is only one cliff nearby

909
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,306
What's there to eat here?

910
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,141
I'll make it for you to eat

911
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:33,856
Oh my God

912
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:41,698
Who is he?

913
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,452
What? Going asleep so soon

914
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:50,289
Let's go where are we going?

915
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,417
Just come with me

916
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:54,752
Wow

917
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,965
-Is this Schisandra?
-Yes

918
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,592
Oh, it's bracken? Is this what you tanned?

919
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,470
Yes, I picked it all and dried it

920
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,222
No, this is radish water Xinqi

921
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:10,685
This one is so delicious

922
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,272
one two three

923
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,412
By the way, what's your name?

924
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:30,538
My name is Jang Geum

925
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:34,375
-Xu Changjin
-My name is Yan Zhiyong

926
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:35,585
How old are you?

927
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:36,711
I'm eighteen years old

928
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:38,296
Oh, I'm bigger than you

929
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:39,839
Then I don't need honorifics

930
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:40,965
OK

931
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,009
alright

932
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,934
Just use firewood

933
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,061
Not even a rice cooker

934
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,813
There is not even a light

935
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:59,150
How could there be such a place now?

936
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,278
Not to mention her

937
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,616
Where did you find these in Jang Geum?

938
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:10,286
Most people use their eyes to find fruits or herbs

939
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,538
But I'm using the nose

940
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,708
You're a dog's nose?

941
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,169
Very sensitive sense of smell

942
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:26,344
Wheat rice and wild vegetables…

943
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,222
(butter)

944
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,515
(Sungrass Beef Bitter Pepper Sauce)

945
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:34,143
By the way, I have this

946
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:43,319
Here

947
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:44,946
I'm carrying it

948
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,460
It's time for you to see my skills

949
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,216
This is a real natural health meal

950
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:45,172
Deep fragrance

951
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,341
The breath of spring

952
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,510
This is the taste of nature

953
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,555
-Is the amount of rice enough?
- Just now

954
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:57,935
-What is that?
-alright

955
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,287
Miss This smells like flat hazel

956
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:19,373
-God
-Oh, are you talking about hazelnuts?

957
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,500
This is called coking cream

958
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:26,047
If the cream is heated to coke
It will turn brown and exude the aroma of nuts

959
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:30,927
If you use this instead of sesame oil

960
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:33,679
You can make bibimbap with completely different flavors

961
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:36,641
So beautiful that I can't bear to eat

962
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,059
It's like a painting

963
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:42,229
I have to get some crumbs

964
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:45,566
"Guanba"?

965
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:49,111
Look at him

966
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:52,990
Hello, wake up

967
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:56,827
Why do you sleep so hard?

968
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:59,622
A few hours ago you called me a ghost girl and wanted to kill me

969
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,084
Give it some food before you go to bed

970
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:08,297
No

971
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,842
It's awkward, really stingy

972
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,302
What?

973
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,012
"Xiao Qi"?

974
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,557
I have a lot of them.

975
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:21,894
Open your mouth

976
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:24,897
Really no need

977
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,568
Your body is very honest

978
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,612
Hurry up, just take a bite

979
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:34,991
How can I believe you?

980
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,243
Hurry up, my hands are sore

981
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,328
Since you insisted on doing this

982
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,706
Then you taste it first

983
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,374
(The palace maids need to taste the food for the king to try the poison)

984
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:44,917
What? Test the poison?

985
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:49,088
Oh my God

986
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:50,297
Hey, Jang Geum, let's eat together

987
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:53,634
No

988
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:55,845
He's not a bad person

989
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:57,388
It's just a little hard to serve

990
01:06:57,471 --> 01:06:58,848
bring it on

991
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,184
That…

992
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,813
That little one is rude

993
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,524
He is not feeling well

994
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:09,859
Please forgive me

995
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,236
Who are you?

996
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,363
That's it...

997
01:07:15,656 --> 01:07:18,409
The owner of this room is Xu Changjin

998
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:19,493
Say hello

999
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,662
-Get polite
-Shut up!

1000
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,956
No one can stay within the prohibited sign

1001
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,709
Oh, that's it...

1002
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:30,963
OMG

1003
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:33,382
Are you two making movies?

1004
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:35,718
What's going on?

1005
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:38,220
Stop worrying, eat quickly

1006
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,555
Now it's the best food

1007
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:41,766
I'll try it first

1008
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:48,647
It looks pretty gorgeous but it's actually wheat rice

1009
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:49,690
Please

1010
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:52,276
This is not ordinary wheat rice

1011
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:56,405
This is a bibimbap made by Michelin Three Star Chef.

1012
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:59,283
It's the most advanced French bibimbap

1013
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:01,535
"Paper-spreading rice"?

1014
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,412
I didn't use sesame oil

1015
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:06,040
It tastes much lighter than just adding chili sauce

1016
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:07,625
And the flavor is stronger

1017
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,085
"Spicy shackle sauce"?

1018
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:10,628
"Imperial Oil"?

1019
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:13,756
Come

1020
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:16,926
It seems like mixing rice with other things

1021
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:20,554
No soy sauce, what did you use?

1022
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,182
What is that bright red thing?

1023
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,189
It's really worth it when we pick the vegetables ourselves

1024
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:32,316
The aroma is absolutely incomparable to the ones sold in supermarkets

1025
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:47,456
Delicious, salty and light

1026
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:50,626
Eat quickly Jang Geum

1027
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:52,753
When that fool changes his mind, he will be gone

1028
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:57,216
How dare I, this humble person

1029
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:02,680
It seems you still understand some class rules

1030
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:04,849
"Squad's banned"?

1031
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:08,936
What's going on with this weird atmosphere?

1032
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:12,857
It feels like I've really traveled through time

1033
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,277
Alas, don't care

1034
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:18,863
Come

1035
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:19,864
Open your mouth

1036
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,013
What are you doing?

1037
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:47,099
There's nothing I can do about you

1038
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:48,726
Do you eat it or not?

1039
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:50,895
You scoop a spoonful

1040
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:54,481
Forget it, it has nothing to do with me if you starve to death

1041
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:57,318
How can I stuff such a big spoon into my mouth?

1042
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:01,572
I admit defeat I admit defeat

1043
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:10,289
Ouch, our little princess
Are you satisfied with such a small mouthful?

1044
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,666
-Open mouth
-What did you call me?

1045
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:14,001
Princess?

1046
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,796
After a closer look, it turned out to be a prince

1047
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,256
Little Prince Please use

1048
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:34,730
how? Delicious, right?

1049
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,402
You really want to harm...

1050
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:41,820
how? Can't you eat spicy food?

1051
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:43,739
Really

1052
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:46,033
Is it that spicy? I think it's okay

1053
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,082
This is not spicy This is delicious

1054
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:54,750
Try it

1055
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,132
What kind of food is this?

1056
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:06,136
-Do you think it's spicy, too?
-yes! I'm almost terrible!

1057
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:09,723
From the real trick, what poison did you put in it?

1058
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:11,392
The conditions are so poor

1059
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:13,644
I made bibimbap for you with bitter pepper sauce and butter

1060
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:15,562
You actually said that to me?

1061
01:11:16,313 --> 01:11:18,232
Forget it, stop eating, I'll eat the rest

1062
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:19,858
Wait No

1063
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,026
I want to eat more

1064
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:28,117
It was spicy and painful at first, but what should I say?

1065
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,077
After that hot energy passes

1066
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:33,122
You can taste the flavor
Instead, it makes people unable to stop

1067
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,374
-Yes?
-Um

1068
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:38,961
This is the most delicious food I've ever eaten

1069
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:42,423
I just knew it was delicious, right?

1070
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:13,704
Come

1071
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:31,180
Look? I'll know

1072
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:34,141
Delicious, right? Very delicious, right?

1073
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:37,770
Don't put the spoon down

1074
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:41,398
Come

1075
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:43,192
Open your mouth

1076
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:45,486
Open your mouth

1077
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:50,908
Is it tasty?

1078
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,327
Delicious Mother

1079
01:12:53,994 --> 01:12:57,039
You can't eat well just because you're scolded by your grandmother

1080
01:12:57,122 --> 01:12:58,123
(The deposed concubine Yan and Li Xian’s biological mother)

1081
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,501
The king is a person who knows how to be polite to others

1082
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:02,836
Be polite to your family

1083
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,588
Be compassionate to God

1084
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:08,133
And the hearts of others

1085
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:11,720
Is it that spicy?

1086
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:18,352
All finished eating Let's clean up Jang Geum

1087
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:19,353
OK

1088
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:24,108
Thanks

1089
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:28,278
I'll do it

1090
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:31,490
Adult, do you want a bowl?

1091
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,243
-No need, he probably won't drink it
-yes

1092
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,203
Wash dishes here?

1093
01:13:36,286 --> 01:13:37,413
Here

1094
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:40,874
Did he cry because it was too spicy?

1095
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:43,293
Not so hot that I want to cry

1096
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:44,586
It's so strange

1097
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:47,297
Just a dish

1098
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:49,967
I remembered my mother

1099
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:57,433
Open every stone by the river and look for it!

1100
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:58,600
-yes!
-yes!

1101
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:04,690
Too unreasonable
Isn't your nose as good as a dog?

1102
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:07,693
Does it smell that bad?

1103
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,612
I think the taste is OK

1104
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:15,409
When we go out
Just put it here to dry

1105
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:18,787
This is my revenge

1106
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:27,087
oops

1107
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:30,382
It's pretty normal when he fell asleep

1108
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:36,180
You are really meticulous to your husband

1109
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:37,931
Stop talking nonsense

1110
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:40,893
Jang Geum, did you always think so?

1111
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:42,561
Yes, otherwise why...

1112
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:43,896
Not that

1113
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:46,607
-I'll explain to you on the way
-OK

1114
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:50,694
Let's find my shoulder bag first

1115
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:54,448
He felt uncomfortable, he seemed to be hurt.

1116
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,460
From the stream we can see that the path we are walking is correct

1117
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:08,045
Look, what am I talking about?

1118
01:15:08,128 --> 01:15:10,881
Only this road leads to the cliff

1119
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:16,887
Miss, do you want to wash the soil on your hair?

1120
01:15:18,138 --> 01:15:20,349
May I? It's a bit dirty indeed

1121
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:23,685
Oh, so cold!

1122
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,312
Coldier than I thought

1123
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:26,438
OMG

1124
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:29,483
This little water is also called cold

1125
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:30,692
Look at mine

1126
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,196
Oops It's so cool!

1127
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:36,198
Then I'll just wash my hair

1128
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,953
Oh my God, it's so comfortable!

1129
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,121
Your Highness!

1130
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:46,833
Is the dragon body okay?

1131
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:49,962
Do I seem to be fine?

1132
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:51,338
Please forgive me for your sins

1133
01:15:51,421 --> 01:15:53,465
The Weichen will definitely find the thieves and behead them

1134
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,676
His Highness

1135
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:11,608
Listen well

1136
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:15,654
There is a thief nearby who has humiliated me.

1137
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:17,739
- Find it
-Abide by your order Your Highness!

1138
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:39,595
Miss

1139
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:40,679
Um?

1140
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:42,514
Use this to dry your hair

1141
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,640
Thanks

1142
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:50,230
I'm sorry to have misunderstood you were a thief

1143
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:52,107
fine

1144
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:55,777
After all, I broke into your house without permission and wore your clothes

1145
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,946
That's right

1146
01:16:59,823 --> 01:17:02,075
By the way, why are you hiding in life?

1147
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,160
Isn't this your home?

1148
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:07,748
I live here to avoid Caihong

1149
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:11,293
Picking red also has its noble meaning

1150
01:17:12,919 --> 01:17:13,754
Picking red?

1151
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:15,505
That's right, it's Caihong

1152
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:16,923
Don't you know?

1153
01:17:17,507 --> 01:17:20,302
Just capture all the women into the palace

1154
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:22,012
Do you really don't know?

1155
01:17:22,095 --> 01:17:25,682
I know, but that's all in the Joseon era

1156
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:31,480
Where do you think this is not North Korea?

1157
01:17:31,563 --> 01:17:34,733
Are you saying that all the fool said is true?

1158
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:36,151
"That fool"?

1159
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:39,279
Oh, is that adult who has a bad brain?

1160
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:42,491
So, is Yan Xijun in power now?

1161
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:45,786
who? "Yan Xinjun"?

1162
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,498
Since you know Caihong
How could you not know Yan Xijun?

1163
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:52,334
I've never heard of this name

1164
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:55,837
Who is below?

1165
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:59,216
Hey someone there

1166
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:01,593
Here!

1167
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:34,710
"The Tyrant's Chef"

1168
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:38,588
Who are you?

1169
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:41,133
I'm from the future five hundred years later

1170
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:45,137
Is that true? I'll spare your life today

1171
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,723
-Open the door quickly!
-Miss!

1172
01:18:48,765 --> 01:18:50,517
You can do it within the specified time

1173
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,520
Make a dish that satisfies them?

1174
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:56,148
If we do well, will we let us go?

1175
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:57,858
If what you said is true

1176
01:18:57,941 --> 01:18:59,651
I will taste it myself

1177
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,486
What are you doing while standing

1178
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:04,156
Take that sinner right away!

1179
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,532
I'm dead

1180
01:19:05,615 --> 01:19:08,118
He is really Yan Xijun

1181
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:19,171
