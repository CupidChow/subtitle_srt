1
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

2
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,397
I see you are here.

3
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,047
What is taking her so long?

4
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,181
Everyone.

5
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,809
We must go and tell His Majesty.

6
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,771
Or she is going to die!

7
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,983
But His Highness has become unconscious.

8
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,110
This is beyond anything we can do.

9
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,695
We should not get involved rashly.

10
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,782
That is exactly how
the former chief royal cook met his end.

11
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,492
They will make up crimes
she did not commit if they must.

12
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,621
Then are you saying
we just sit back and do nothing?

13
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,918
How could you all be like this?

14
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,922
If you will just sit here and do nothing,

15
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,173
I will go on my own.

16
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,217
I will go to His Majesty.

17
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,720
No.

18
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,264
You stay here.

19
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,516
I will go.

20
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,434
Cook Maeng.

21
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,229
Cook Maeng…

22
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,731
Fine. I might as well.

23
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,152
I will come as well.
No, I will lead the way.

24
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,571
Let us try.

25
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,697
Yes, I will join too.

26
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,744
-Eunuch Yoon.
-Greetings.

27
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,830
Eunuch Yoon!

28
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,999
-Our miss…
-What is going on?

29
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,709
Our miss is…

30
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,426
How pleased will she be

31
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,595
when she sees this?

32
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,763
GOCHO

33
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,310
I cannot wait to see the look on her face.

34
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,235
If she jumps into my arms like last time…

35
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,697
Thank you so much!

36
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,929
I believe this was the stance.

37
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,307
This time,

38
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,809
I will not fall over.

39
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,019
Your Majesty!

40
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,855
Your Majesty.

41
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,482
Yes.

42
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,860
-Is she here?
-The chief royal cook

43
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,197
was tortured and imprisoned.

44
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,075
The chief royal cook was tortured?

45
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,826
What on earth are you saying?

46
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,248
Grand Prince Jinmyeong
is on the verge of death.

47
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,332
Jinmyeong?

48
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,963
He fell ill after he ate
the chief royal cook's chicken dish,

49
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,090
so the Queen Dowager is furious.

50
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,467
She interrogated
the chief royal cook herself

51
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,469
and then threw her into prison.

52
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,139
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

53
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,151
Cook Yeon.

54
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,870
Open the door immediately.

55
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,456
Your Majesty, with all due respect…

56
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,251
How dare you?
Open the door right this instant!

57
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:57,463
I wish I could,
but Her Royal Highness took the key.

58
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,466
What did you say?

59
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,264
Commander.

60
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,600
Break down this door!

61
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,893
Yes, Your Majesty.

62
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,478
Your Majesty.

63
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,404
I am sure you have heard by now.

64
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,822
QUEEN DOWAGER JAHYEON
YI HEON'S STEPMOTHER

65
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,825
My son Jinmyeong
ate the food that wench made

66
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,328
and now lingers on the brink of death.

67
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,248
What in the world are you saying?

68
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,463
I also ate the chicken
the chief royal cook prepared.

69
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,840
That is why I find it
even more suspicious.

70
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,050
What?

71
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,552
Are you implying
that I was behind all this?

72
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,511
If only

73
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,308
I had questioned it
when you were so kind to my son,

74
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,642
if I had prevented it,

75
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,729
then perhaps this would not
have happened to my Jinmyeong.

76
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,775
Why would I do such a thing
when I have no reason to fear him?

77
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,403
If something unfortunate
were to happen to you,

78
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:06,616
Jinmyeong would take the throne,
and maybe that is what you fear!

79
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,289
I dare you to say that again.

80
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,917
At last, you show your true colors.

81
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,627
Say it again!

82
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,299
Hand over the key.

83
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,052
It is a royal command.

84
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,473
You will not have it
as long as I am breathing.

85
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,725
Kill me.

86
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,228
I said it was a royal command!

87
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,854
Your Majesty!

88
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,399
Please. Your Majesty.

89
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,945
Your Majesty.

90
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,989
Calm down.

91
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,783
You must not do this.

92
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,578
What are you all doing?

93
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,704
Cover her immediately!

94
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,254
Put the sword down.

95
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,590
You're not helping me by doing this.

96
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,262
You know better than anyone
that I wouldn't do such a thing.

97
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:10,972
So…

98
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,308
So put down the sword,

99
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,478
and please prove my innocence.

100
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,736
You must never

101
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,364
become a tyrant.

102
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:34,704
COURSE N° 10 JOSEON RESTAURANT

103
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,343
If we must become political enemies

104
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,180
just because we are blood-related…

105
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,351
then it is only right
that I put an end to it all right now.

106
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,395
Your Majesty.

107
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,272
I know what happens here.

108
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,815
I know the future.

109
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,735
If you use that sword now,

110
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,612
everything will get out of control.

111
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,908
The situation is already past
the point of control.

112
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,284
No.

113
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,119
Nothing has happened yet.

114
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,288
Put down the sword.

115
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,583
And no matter what happens,

116
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,044
you must restrain yourself.

117
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,546
You must stand strong.

118
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,674
Please leave. Now.

119
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,093
If I leave now…

120
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,805
you will die.

121
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,935
If you do this, everyone will die!

122
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,021
Do you want me to hang myself right now?

123
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,731
Will you believe me if I do that?

124
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,700
Believe me.

125
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,302
To think that you, Queen Dowager,

126
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,599
who always seemed on my side
and embraced me with your kind grace,

127
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,229
had been harboring such a different heart.

128
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,149
I now realize what truly lies beneath

129
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,402
your benevolent facade.

130
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,990
I, myself,
will get to the bottom of this incident.

131
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,910
If you torture the chief royal cook again
before the truth is out,

132
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,913
there will be hell to pay.

133
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,207
Very well.

134
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,836
However, if something
were to happen to Jinmyeong before then,

135
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,547
I will see to it that the wench pays.

136
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,720
If you wish to punish her,

137
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,973
you will have to dethrone me first.

138
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,695
Your Majesty.

139
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,156
You must have been scared.

140
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,742
It must have been hard.

141
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,788
You must stay strong.

142
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,583
Okay.

143
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,295
You have to remember

144
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,798
what I said.

145
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:34,884
All right.

146
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,511
I will not forget it.

147
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,018
Your Royal Highness,

148
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,937
it appears His Majesty
has set forth plans in secret.

149
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,397
Brother.

150
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,484
How could you utter such disloyal words?

151
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,570
I did not tell you
to spare you from the concern,

152
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,239
but Principal Drafter Yi
of the Office of Royal Decrees

153
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,993
is looking for the draft of the record
that details how the deposed queen passed.

154
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,495
The draft of the historical record

155
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,289
that details
how His Majesty's mother passed?

156
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,583
If His Majesty is looking for the draft

157
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,211
with the knowledge
that we were involved in her death,

158
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,922
would it not be
so that he can oust our Han family

159
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,257
that put him on the throne?

160
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,219
I believe this is connected

161
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,471
to what happened
to Grand Prince Jinmyeong.

162
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,515
No.

163
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,227
Brother, think back
to the Muin Literati Purge.

164
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,686
OPPRESSION OF SARIM FACTION SCHOLARS
IN THE 4TH YEAR OF YEONHUIGUN'S REIGN

165
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,524
His Majesty is someone who would
make pretenses to exile individuals.

166
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,360
He is not one to scheme or plot.

167
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,613
And to use poison of all things?

168
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,910
This is not His Majesty's doing.

169
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:48,040
Not to mention, His Majesty has changed
since the chief royal cook came here.

170
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,043
He has become a different person.

171
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:56,424
Will you believe me only after
the other princes fall unconscious?

172
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,886
The only one to escape this crisis

173
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,891
will be the idiotic Grand Prince Jesan.

174
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,103
Jesan…

175
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,564
Grand Prince Jesan…

176
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,690
GRAND PRINCE JESAN
SUPERINTENDENT OF SAONGWON

177
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,901
Her Grace Consort Kang

178
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,195
has contributed a great deal to our plan.

179
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,116
What happened to Grand Prince Jinmyeong
is unfortunate,

180
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,785
but the Grand Royal Queen Dowager
and her Han relatives

181
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,497
will not be able to avoid
clashing with His Majesty.

182
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,748
If His Majesty

183
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,960
eradicates the Han family
that has long served him,

184
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:36,881
that will be our chance
to claim the cause to oust a tyrant

185
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,092
and turn our swords against him.

186
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,218
Your Highness.

187
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,598
Why are you allowing
that enemy Yi Jang-gyun to live?

188
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,017
He led the men who massacred
our tutors and brothers

189
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,852
who were in hiding during the last purge.

190
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:50,895
Regardless,

191
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,898
he still has a role to play.

192
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:54,982
We still

193
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,568
need him alive.

194
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,071
I do hope Grand Prince Jinmyeong

195
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,240
does not regain consciousness.

196
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,450
It does not matter now.

197
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:09,788
His Majesty and the chief royal cook
will not be able to avoid

198
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,458
this arrow of fate.

199
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,340
I understand why the Queen Dowager
caused a scene out of fury,

200
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,758
but Cook Yeon had no reason

201
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,343
to harm the Grand Prince
she had just met today.

202
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,056
Find out if Grand Prince Jinmyeong
ate anything else

203
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,557
after the meal with me,

204
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,061
whom he met, and where he went.

205
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,730
Look into every detail and report to me.

206
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,065
Yes, Your Majesty.

207
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,591
Your Majesty, please take a look at this.

208
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,385
What is this?

209
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,678
It is the log from the dispensary.

210
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:46,260
We also ate the chicken
His Majesty and His Highness ate,

211
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,554
but none of us suffered in any way.

212
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,682
I even ate an extra leg in secret,
and I am perfectly fine.

213
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,143
I ate some of the skin,
but nothing happened to me.

214
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,562
My problem is that I have too much energy.

215
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,939
The ingredients are clearly not to blame.

216
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,233
The royal physician
will check every ingredient.

217
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,819
Inform me immediately
if anything else comes to mind.

218
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,158
Your Majesty,

219
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,035
I spoke to those at the royal kitchen,

220
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,328
and those at Naeuiwon, Royal Clinic,

221
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,789
carefully inspected all the ingredients
used in the roasted ogolgye,

222
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,042
and they did not find anything unusual.

223
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,378
I knew it.

224
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,048
You can see that I am fine.

225
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,845
Could Grand Prince Jinmyeong
be suffering from something else?

226
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,097
What makes you think that?

227
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,641
The royal physician said

228
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,852
his symptoms only arise
when one ingests poison,

229
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,939
but he did not take anything poisonous.

230
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,485
How about you visit

231
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,071
the quarters of the Queen Dowager
and check on His Highness?

232
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,666
How is he?

233
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,709
GRAND PRINCE JINMYEONG
YI HEON'S HALF-BROTHER

234
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,711
Your Royal Highness.

235
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,546
I apologize.

236
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,591
What a disaster this is.

237
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,927
How could the heavens be so cruel?

238
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:14,390
His Majesty the King has arrived.

239
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,400
Is he recovering?

240
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,319
We are searching for a cure.

241
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,405
I apologize for the delay, Your Majesty.

242
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,201
What could have possibly
made you come to my quarters,

243
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,995
which is usually
the least of your concerns?

244
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,456
You speak out of line,
Your Royal Highness.

245
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,625
Your Majesty.

246
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,752
What brings you here?

247
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:48,007
The royal physician examined all the food
Grand Prince Jinmyeong consumed that day

248
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,010
but did not find
anything unusual about it.

249
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,557
Is what His Majesty said true?

250
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,893
Yes, Your Royal Highness. It is true.

251
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,895
I also looked into

252
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,440
who Grand Prince Jinmyeong met
in the last fortnight,

253
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,902
but I was told he was always here with you
under your care.

254
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,362
That is why I came to see you.

255
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:20,080
That is why
I blame the food he ate that day.

256
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,138
What are those medicinal herbs?

257
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,476
They are herbs
used in the restorative medicine

258
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,437
that His Highness takes regularly
due to his poor health.

259
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,315
Restorative medicine?
What is that doing here?

260
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,485
Grand Prince Jesan, the Superintendent
of Saongwon, Office of Royal Meals,

261
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,237
personally sends the herbs
every fortnight.

262
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,990
Then I inspect the contents here

263
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,160
and have them sent to Naeuiwon
to prepare the medicine to be brewed.

264
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,787
I must take them with me.

265
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,290
I will inspect them myself.

266
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,583
Yes, Your Majesty.

267
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,044
Chang-seon.

268
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,171
Yes, Your Majesty.

269
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,299
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

270
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,302
I doubt there will be
anything wrong with it.

271
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,806
Do you really think Grand Prince Jesan
would send the wrong herbs?

272
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,349
Your Majesty.

273
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,935
The reason
Grand Prince Jinmyeong's life is at risk

274
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,187
is because of that
wretched chief royal cook.

275
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,396
Your Royal Highness.

276
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,024
Mind your words.

277
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,863
If word of this
were to spread outside the palace,

278
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,407
what would that do
to the reputation of the royal family?

279
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,090
Your Royal Highness.

280
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,300
Are you all right?

281
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,513
I am so afraid of His Majesty.

282
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,223
I…

283
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,144
do not fear him anymore.

284
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,521
The day my son dies,

285
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,274
the chief royal cook and His Majesty

286
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,402
will both pay dearly.

287
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,237
-Your Royal Highness.
-Your Royal Highness.

288
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,198
Your Royal Highness,
it is I, Court Lady Kim.

289
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,123
What is it?

290
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,708
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager

291
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,044
has sent me to get the key to the prison
where the chief royal cook is being held.

292
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,047
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager sent you?

293
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,799
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

294
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,150
Does something concern you, Your Majesty?

295
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,574
What am I to do
if nothing is wrong with the herbs either?

296
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,993
Cook Yeon is not well.

297
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,580
To think that she must be
suffering in that cold prison

298
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,332
weighs on my heart.

299
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,084
I cannot stand it.

300
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,502
I sent Eunuch Yoon

301
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,088
to check on her
in the morning and evening,

302
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,550
and she is doing well and staying strong,
saying that it is where she stayed

303
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,552
when she first came to the palace.

304
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,888
You need not worry too much, Your Majesty.

305
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,431
What do you mean it is where she stayed?

306
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:29,603
I am talking about the prison
you had specially arranged for her

307
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,355
when she first came to the palace,
Your Majesty.

308
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,691
Think of it as a basic rule
to survive in the palace.

309
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,444
I will prepare
a special residence for you.

310
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,864
Do you still remember such a thing?

311
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,741
That is not like you.

312
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,494
However,

313
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,788
things are different now.

314
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,123
If I leave her be,

315
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,334
her life will not be worth living.

316
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,546
What must I do?

317
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,425
What must I do to save you?

318
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,728
Where on earth is my Mangunrok?

319
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:17,609
How did I end up in Joseon
only to suffer such hardships?

320
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,030
I want to go home so badly.

321
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,833
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager has arrived.

322
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,463
Over here. I'm in here.

323
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,307
I thought you would be struggling,

324
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,767
but I see you have managed to adapt
even in this place.

325
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:56,273
Gil-geum and I stayed here for a while,

326
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,816
so I'm used to it.

327
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,527
I will ask you just one thing.

328
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,323
Did you truly try to kill
the Grand Prince?

329
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,783
No.

330
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:10,746
Please don't tell me
you also believe that.

331
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,457
Then did His Majesty put you up to it?

332
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,793
What are you saying?

333
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,879
You know what he's like.

334
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,547
If he wanted someone dead,
he'd do it himself.

335
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,093
You must keep your wits sharp.

336
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,138
His Majesty is under suspicion
because of you.

337
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,141
If this continues,

338
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,144
he will end up in grave danger.

339
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,188
His Majesty will be in danger?

340
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:40,275
All kinds of malicious rumors
are running rampant throughout the palace.

341
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,236
They say Grand Prince Jinmyeong
is on the verge of death

342
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,865
because you, the chief royal cook,
poisoned his food.

343
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,993
They say His Majesty's judgment
has been clouded

344
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,497
because he keeps
the gwinyeo cook too close to him.

345
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,250
If you fail to prove your innocence,

346
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,087
you will be tortured at Uigeumbu,
State Tribunal,

347
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,341
for attempting to murder a grand prince
and die amid great suffering.

348
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:08,136
So much so that you would
want to take your own life.

349
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,140
If I get you out of here,

350
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,226
can you find evidence

351
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,269
to prove your innocence?

352
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,357
If you do,

353
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,860
I promise to find evidence,
no matter what.

354
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,571
If you fail to prove your innocence…

355
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,204
you must put an end to it

356
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,456
yourself.

357
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,177
It's a real silver dagger.

358
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,516
I will give you three days.

359
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:58,728
You must

360
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,022
find evidence.

361
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,610
Yes, I will.

362
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,413
Is that His Majesty's natgeotsang,
daytime meal?

363
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,375
-Oh my goodness!
-Miss!

364
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,502
-My goodness. What happened?
-Miss!

365
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,462
-Oh my goodness.
-Miss!

366
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,923
-My gosh!
-Look how haggard you have become!

367
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,508
Just a moment!

368
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,802
I'll explain everything later.

369
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,971
Let me serve the natgeotsang first.

370
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:33,889
Sure.

371
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,558
Cook Maeng,
put the rest of the jeon on the table.

372
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,602
Cook Sim and Cook Min,
get the other side dishes.

373
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,353
-Okay.
-Okay.

374
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,148
-Hurry!
-Okay.

375
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,622
Your Majesty, your natgeotsang is ready.

376
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,291
I do not want it. Take it away.

377
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,836
Your Majesty, I told you many times.

378
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,671
You shouldn't skip your meals.

379
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,590
Chief Royal Cook?

380
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,803
Am I hearing things again?

381
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,565
Your Majesty.

382
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,360
Cook Yeon.

383
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,698
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

384
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:38,995
I missed you so much.

385
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,501
How did you get out?

386
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,296
All kinds of malicious rumors
are running rampant throughout the palace.

387
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,715
They say His Majesty's judgment
has been clouded

388
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,677
because he keeps
the gwinyeo cook too close to him.

389
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,515
Your Majesty.

390
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,060
You don't seem to understand,
so let me make it very clear.

391
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:09,025
There are misunderstandings
and absurd rumors going around the palace

392
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:13,071
because you keep hugging
and kissing a woman you don't even like.

393
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,838
I'll explain everything

394
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,465
while you have your--

395
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,470
What are you doing?

396
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,432
That was

397
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,144
for the woman I cherish the most.

398
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,146
That was my kiss.

399
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,888
Try it.

400
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,527
Try this too.

401
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,571
Very well.

402
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,540
This too.

403
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,168
Cook Yeon.

404
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,711
Eat with me today.

405
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,630
Pardon?

406
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,175
Your Majesty, that'd be inappropriate.

407
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,220
Are you talking back to me?

408
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,806
No, but…

409
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,060
Then eat.

410
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,773
Go on.

411
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,484
Okay.

412
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,294
You appear to have become rather haggard.

413
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,214
Please make sure to eat your meals.

414
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,634
I could say the same about you.

415
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:48,560
Tell me.

416
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:50,937
How did you get out?

417
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,898
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager released me.

418
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,191
After you eat,

419
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,069
we must uncover the truth together.

420
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,821
Uncover the truth

421
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,698
together?

422
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,199
Yes.

423
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,909
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager let me out

424
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,496
on the condition
that I do that within three days.

425
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,585
What kind of silly promise is that?

426
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,260
It's more serious than you think.

427
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,017
Forget what you promised my grandmother.

428
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,560
Do you think I would let you die?

429
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,233
Your Majesty.

430
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,029
Do you really like me?

431
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,625
Do you really have feelings for me?

432
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,548
You should eat.

433
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,096
Her Royal Highness

434
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,434
is concerned that foul rumors about us
are going around the palace.

435
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:12,977
From now on,

436
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,980
you can't do what you did to me earlier.

437
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,565
In that case,

438
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,109
tell me in detail

439
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,153
what I can and cannot do.

440
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,322
Do you really not know?

441
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,033
You can't do anything
without my permission, okay?

442
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,078
Be more specific.

443
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,664
Well…

444
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:36,084
Hugging me wherever you please,
calling me out at night,

445
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,879
getting drunk and kissing me,

446
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,214
or doing what you did earlier…

447
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,674
Anyway, you can't do any of that.

448
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,307
How very silly.

449
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,475
Silly?

450
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,603
I'm being serious here,
and you call it silly?

451
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,729
Yes.

452
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,232
Do you want some rice punch?

453
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,233
No.

454
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,860
Don't mind me,
who focuses on silly things.

455
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,945
Do not be like that.

456
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:05,530
Here.

457
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,365
Drink it.

458
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,743
Go on.

459
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,091
The cooks have gotten much better.

460
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,269
The old hag released the chief royal cook?

461
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,395
KANG MOK-JU
FOURTH JUNIOR CONSORT, YI HEON'S CONCUBINE

462
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,355
She must have gone senile.

463
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,816
She has only earned
three more days to live.

464
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,276
Three days, you say?

465
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,696
Will the chief royal cook
find evidence first,

466
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:49,115
or will Grand Prince Jinmyeong die first?

467
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,868
I guess it would not be so bad
to stand by and watch.

468
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,291
If you have something on your mind,
do tell.

469
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,086
Why did you release the chief royal cook

470
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,881
when you should have tortured
the truth out of her?

471
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,507
Release her?

472
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,344
Do you still not see
what His Majesty is thinking?

473
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,931
He is searching for an excuse
to exterminate our Han family.

474
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,435
We cannot be sure of that.

475
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:21,397
Whatever the case, we need His Majesty
to remain on the throne.

476
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,317
That is of grave importance to our family.

477
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,985
Just wait and see

478
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,697
what the chief royal cook will do

479
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:34,202
if she cannot find evidence
within three days.

480
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,704
DAY 1 OF THE INVESTIGATION

481
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,664
Look at this.

482
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,291
Ginkgo nuts, chestnuts, jujube.

483
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,294
None of the ingredients in your dish
were unfamiliar to Grand Prince Jinmyeong.

484
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,921
Then could it be the butter…

485
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:47,423
-I mean, could it be the suyu?
-Suyu?

486
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:52,261
After eating it, did he seem dizzy
or develop any rashes?

487
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,846
I am not certain about rashes.

488
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,058
Can eating a lot of ginseng make you ill?

489
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,435
I used ginseng to cook the meal.

490
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,771
Eating too much of it

491
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,065
can cause headaches or sleeplessness,

492
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,693
but it would not cause one
to become unconscious.

493
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,445
I tasted the ingredients
of Jinmyeong's medicine.

494
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,155
What is the one that tastes rather odd?

495
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,573
Could that be musk?

496
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,908
It was not musk.

497
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,744
They were small and round,
almost bean-like,

498
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,287
with a foul taste.

499
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,330
Your Majesty.

500
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,625
It is normal for restorative medicine
to taste bitter and foul.

501
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:26,421
The bitterness was unlike
any of the other ingredients.

502
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,301
DAY 2 OF THE INVESTIGATION

503
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:39,976
Your Majesty.

504
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:49,318
What did the maids who cleaned out
Grand Prince Jinmyeong's chamber pot say?

505
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:54,323
They said there was nothing unusual
about his fecal matter.

506
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,908
I apologize for the bad news,
Your Majesty.

507
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,673
My gosh, miss. You are finally back.

508
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,344
What should I do?

509
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,014
No matter how hard I look,
there's no hope.

510
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,016
It is the second day already.

511
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,021
Anyway, what is in here?

512
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:29,859
Ingredients of Grand Prince Jinmyeong's
restorative medicine and food records.

513
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,110
I see.

514
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,279
Let me see. Goodness.

515
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:39,202
They are incredibly precious herbs.

516
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,331
What could this smell be?

517
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,918
Why? Does it smell strange?

518
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:52,381
Miss, this smells of rats.
They must have nibbled on them.

519
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,092
Come on, that's ridiculous.

520
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,678
They wouldn't have let rats
eat His Highness' medicine.

521
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,724
This is definitely
the smell of rat droppings.

522
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:02,725
Is it?

523
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,815
It does smell revolting.

524
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,234
DAY 3 OF THE INVESTIGATION

525
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:15,238
So Grand Prince Jinmyeong
has never been picky about food?

526
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:18,199
That is right.
He is not a picky eater like His Majesty,

527
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,368
and he has never suffered
such a high fever before.

528
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:24,163
Maybe the chicken dish
did not cause the illness after all.

529
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,583
Other than my food, the only thing he had
was his usual restorative medicine.

530
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,752
Chief Royal Cook.

531
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,546
You must hurry to His Majesty's quarters.

532
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,048
His Majesty has suddenly collapsed.

533
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,216
His Majesty?

534
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,885
Your Majesty,
the chief royal cook is here.

535
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,305
Your Majesty, are you all right?

536
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,350
You are here.

537
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,186
Do not cause a fuss.

538
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,356
Is he all right?

539
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,693
His Majesty has had
a lot on his mind lately,

540
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,695
and that seems to have exhausted him.

541
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,575
Wait.

542
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,120
Does His Majesty have a fever?

543
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,080
How did you know that?

544
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:10,835
Aren't his symptoms similar
to those of Grand Prince Jinmyeong?

545
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,386
Now that you mention it, it is strange.

546
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,762
Why do I have

547
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,724
the same symptoms as Jinmyeong?

548
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:28,436
You tasted the medicinal herbs
during the investigation.

549
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,273
If you have a fever like the Grand Prince,

550
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,525
then his illness…

551
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:39,280
Could it be related to
one of the medicinal herbs?

552
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,948
To a medicinal herb?

553
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,533
Yes.

554
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,784
His Majesty said

555
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,662
one of them had a foul taste,

556
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,622
and Gil-geum said

557
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,750
it smelled like rat droppings.

558
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:55,129
But musk and milkvetch root
do not have a foul taste,

559
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,839
and while the other medicinal herbs
might smell musty,

560
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,342
they don't smell like rat droppings.

561
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:02,303
The smell of rat droppings
and a foul taste…

562
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,264
Could it be…

563
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:07,892
oryeongji?

564
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,019
ORYEONGJI: MEDICINAL HERBS
MADE FROM DRIED FLYING SQUIRREL DROPPINGS

565
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:10,937
Oryeongji?

566
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,855
What is that?

567
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,815
In China, there are flying squirrels

568
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,567
that glide using their skin
stretched between their limbs.

569
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,528
The feces of flying squirrels
that have been prepared for medicinal use

570
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,781
is called oryeongji.

571
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,866
By "feces," you mean…

572
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,618
Rat droppings?

573
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,582
That is why it tasted so disgusting.

574
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,586
Then does the medicine contain oryeongji?

575
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,422
I will have to check to be sure,

576
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:42,051
but I do not believe oryeongji is included
in His Highness' medicinal herbs.

577
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:46,639
Also, oryeongji is not a poison
but a valuable medicinal ingredient.

578
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,934
Then is it not that either?

579
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,563
Your Majesty, did you eat anything
other than the ginseng porridge

580
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,982
from the royal kitchen today?

581
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,484
What else would I have eaten?

582
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,445
Ginseng.

583
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,865
When oryeongji is ingested with ginseng,

584
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,534
everything changes.

585
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,703
How so?

586
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,246
It becomes a sangbanyak.

587
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,747
In other words, poison.

588
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,457
Poison?

589
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,168
Then could it cause death?

590
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,255
Yes. If oryeongji and ginseng
are consumed together,

591
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,840
it causes chills and a fever.

592
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:24,051
If consumed in excess,
it could threaten one's life.

593
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:28,681
Then isn't His Majesty's life
in danger too?

594
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:32,476
Even if oryeongji were included
in the Grand Prince's medicine,

595
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,270
His Majesty only tasted it,

596
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:37,565
so his symptoms will disappear in time.

597
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,110
That's a relief.

598
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,654
If Jinmyeong is in such a critical state

599
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:48,909
because he ate a chicken dish with ginseng
and the medicine with oryeongji…

600
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,621
Is there an antidote?

601
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,873
Yes, Your Majesty.

602
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,126
I can make an antidote.

603
00:38:57,209 --> 00:39:00,463
However, it will take some time.

604
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,340
In that case, confirm the facts

605
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,176
and promptly make
an antidote for Jinmyeong.

606
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,552
Yes, Your Majesty.

607
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,310
Someone

608
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,396
poisoned him by cunning means.

609
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,190
The culprit must be someone

610
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:22,693
who knows that oryeongji and ginseng
become a poison when eaten together.

611
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,612
Indeed.

612
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,073
Chang-seon.

613
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,037
Yes, Your Majesty.

614
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,247
Send the Chief Royal Secretary to Naeuiwon

615
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,460
and have him identify
who tampered with Jinmyeong's medicine.

616
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,795
Yes, Your Majesty.

617
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,385
My uncle manages the medicinal herbs,

618
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,678
so who would tamper with them?

619
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,098
The culprit

620
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,475
must be someone close by.

621
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,018
Think carefully, Your Majesty.

622
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:03,567
Grand Prince Jinmyeong
will wake up soon, won't he?

623
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,363
It is all thanks to you.

624
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,740
I'm relieved.

625
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,578
Your Majesty, you should lie back down.

626
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,497
Come on.

627
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,467
Your Majesty.

628
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,012
I told you not to do this
without my permission.

629
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,391
Let us allow just this.

630
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:40,062
But if someone were to come in…

631
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,441
It is to cure my headache.

632
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,236
Just for a while.

633
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,197
Stay here just a while.

634
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,339
Greetings, Chief Royal Secretary.

635
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,801
Name every person who handled
Grand Prince Jinmyeong's medicine.

636
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:11,760
Yes, my lord.

637
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,223
A female physician named Eo Yeo-bun

638
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,350
was in charge of
the Grand Prince's medicine,

639
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,519
but no one has seen her in days.

640
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,105
FEMALE PHYSICIAN EO YEO-BUN

641
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,607
BREWED MEDICINE

642
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:35,910
What?

643
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,662
The one who tampered with the medicine
is the female physician?

644
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,873
Yes, Your Majesty.
She added oryeongji to the medicinal herbs

645
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,209
and sent it
to the Queen Dowager's quarters.

646
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,169
However, Your Majesty,

647
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,546
I went to look for her
upon hearing that she had gone missing,

648
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,590
but she had already fled.

649
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,469
Send the palace guards
to find her immediately.

650
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:54,553
Yes, Your Majesty.

651
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,311
Can we find her by tomorrow?

652
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:05,022
The time I promised Her Royal Highness
is almost up.

653
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,315
Do not worry.

654
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,609
We found the culprit.

655
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:12,738
Your innocence has now been proven.

656
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,783
I will speak with my grandmother.

657
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,539
Why do you think
the female physician did it?

658
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,710
In such matters as this,
there is always one who commands it.

659
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,048
We must find the physician
if we are to find out who that is.

660
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,801
How can we find someone
who went into hiding?

661
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,805
Finding someone in hiding?

662
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:44,186
Gong-gil is better at that
than any slave hunter.

663
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,021
Find this physician.

664
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,690
You must find her tonight.

665
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:48,732
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

666
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,325
Your Grace, a message has arrived
from Grand Prince Jesan's residence.

667
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,620
Im Song-jae came to meet His Highness,
as he is the Superintendent of Saongwon,

668
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,372
claiming to be looking for
a missing female physician.

669
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,124
-What?
-That is not all.

670
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:09,503
He used that as an excuse
to search His Highness' residence.

671
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,049
Is it possible he has caught on?

672
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,801
I believe His Highness is under suspicion.

673
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:20,889
Chu-wol.

674
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,559
We must silence that female physician.

675
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,476
Take care of it.

676
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,186
Yes, Your Grace.

677
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:30,274
FORBIDDEN

678
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:32,693
My lady.

679
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,696
You are here.
It must have been an arduous journey.

680
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,324
Is it all over?

681
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:41,327
Can I return to Naeuiwon now?

682
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,244
Yes.

683
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,497
However, we must go somewhere else first.

684
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,833
Where is that?

685
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,796
The afterlife.

686
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,687
How dare you, you lowly jester.

687
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,981
So you are the wench

688
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:12,733
who killed my sister Ok-dan.

689
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,027
What are you talking about?

690
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,864
She had this in her hand when she died.

691
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,286
It is your weapon.

692
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,623
I cannot see clearly because it is dark.

693
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,969
Oh, you are one nasty woman.

694
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,721
You wench.

695
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,307
You look a complete mess
with your hair in disarray.

696
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,727
This damned wench.

697
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:52,272
A rotten wench like you should go to hell!

698
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,942
You speak with a tongue
as foul as your lowly birth.

699
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,111
I will silence
that vulgar mouth of yours for good.

700
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,446
Do you not fear the heavens?

701
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:03,951
Very well.

702
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,412
This is the day you die.

703
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,932
Why did you kill my sister?

704
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,559
Did the king command it
after he took her for chaehong?

705
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:29,643
His Majesty?

706
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:32,813
You fool.

707
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,649
Tell the truth!

708
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,110
Why? Do you want revenge?

709
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:42,614
So you were the one
who has been trying to kill His Majesty.

710
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,587
Tell me who ordered you to kill her.

711
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,214
Was it Kang Mok-ju or the king?

712
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,258
Your tongue will be the death of you.

713
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:07,598
This is where you die.

714
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,526
I see it was Consort Kang's order.

715
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,321
All the court ladies at Jahongwon…

716
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,159
die when their use is done.

717
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,536
Who says so?

718
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,914
Who gets to decide that?

719
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,209
Why?

720
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,044
Why?

721
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,879
Why did you kill her?

722
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,105
Shall I tell you the truth before you die?

723
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,609
Your sister incurred
Her Grace's displeasure

724
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,320
because she tried to win
His Majesty's favor.

725
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,782
It must have been
for her starving brother.

726
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,408
You took someone's life

727
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,995
over such a trivial matter?

728
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,664
She died because of you.

729
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:17,042
You do not deserve to be called humans!

730
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,126
Die!

731
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,527
Look.

732
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,903
Wake up.

733
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:46,613
Do you hear me?

734
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,286
Please spare me.

735
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:54,162
I am sorry.

736
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:57,207
Tell the truth, and I will spare you.

737
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,544
Did you tamper with

738
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,588
Grand Prince Jinmyeong's medicine?

739
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,089
Yes.

740
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,594
I was scared of Her Grace Consort Kang,
so I had no choice.

741
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,681
The person behind it all

742
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,518
was Consort Kang, not the king.

743
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,146
It was that sly wench.

744
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:20,731
The truth is,

745
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:25,277
there is someone behind Her--

746
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,531
Who is there?

747
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,038
I got rid of the female physician,

748
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:39,374
but Gong-gil was incredibly skilled,

749
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,753
so I was unable to take care of Chu-wol.

750
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,713
Were you injured?

751
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,341
It is nothing serious, Your Highness.

752
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,092
I see a mere jester

753
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,346
possesses great skill.

754
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,183
I will have Consort Kang
take care of Chu-wol.

755
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,353
Go to the butchers' village
and get Yi Jang-gyun right away.

756
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,063
Yes, Your Highness.

757
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,574
No matter how much we torture her,

758
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:17,037
she insists she had nothing to do
with Grand Prince Jinmyeong's incident.

759
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:23,001
Look up and face me, criminal.

760
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,631
I heard you were
the inspector court lady at Jahongwon.

761
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,257
Did Consort Kang put you up to it?

762
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,760
No, Your Majesty.

763
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:34,221
Her Grace knows nothing of it.

764
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,431
I had a personal grudge,

765
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,600
and I did everything on my own.

766
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:39,976
Please believe me, Your Majesty.

767
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,312
-This is not getting anywhere.
-Please believe me.

768
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,024
I will ask Consort Kang myself.

769
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,612
Your Majesty!

770
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,197
Your Majesty.

771
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,241
Your Majesty!

772
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:06,962
Chu-wol.

773
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,844
His Majesty the King has--

774
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,851
Your Majesty.

775
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:22,477
Was it you?

776
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,855
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

777
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:30,318
Not only did your trusted court lady
hide the physician who was involved

778
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,738
in Grand Prince Jinmyeong's poisoning,

779
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,364
but she was caught
trying to kill her as well.

780
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,825
Do you still plan to continue
to feign ignorance?

781
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:40,287
I know nothing about that.

782
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,581
Why did you do it?

783
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,833
How can there be a reason
when I know nothing of the matter?

784
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,460
Do you not believe me?

785
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,837
What do you gain from doing this?

786
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,630
I gain nothing.

787
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:51,631
Actually,

788
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:55,093
you came to see me
after a long while to wrongly accuse me,

789
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,429
so perhaps that is a gain on my part.

790
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,014
Do you truly…

791
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,476
wish to die?

792
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,812
Your Majesty.

793
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,856
If you wish to punish me,

794
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:11,109
bring forth the evidence.

795
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,783
You committed a grave sin worthy of death.

796
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,244
The least you should be doing
is pleading for your life.

797
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,330
But very well.

798
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,081
I shall bring evidence.

799
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,259
GANGNYEONGJEON

800
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,772
How did you know?

801
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:52,025
I heard you told Gong-gil
that if he had the jesters

802
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,736
stir up a scene under the guise
of searching for the physician

803
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,321
while keeping an eye on Consort Kang,

804
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:01,159
he would be able to locate the physician.

805
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,912
Gil-geum was attacked

806
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,122
during the competition
against the cooks of the royal kitchen,

807
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,958
and Gong-gil saved her.

808
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,043
He said the attacker
was dressed like a court lady,

809
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:12,838
and I thought if anyone here
was brazen enough to do that,

810
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:18,176
it would be Her Grace Consort Kang.

811
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,556
Are you saying something similar
happened then too?

812
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:24,516
Yes.

813
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,353
Your Majesty, your medicine is here.

814
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,659
Your Majesty.

815
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,036
This is cheongyeolyak,
which will eliminate the toxic effects

816
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,705
of oryeongji and ginseng.

817
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:47,998
CHEONGYEOLYAK:
HERBAL MEDICINE TO COUNTER A FEVER

818
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,709
CHOI MAL-IM
KING'S SENIOR COURT LADY

819
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,096
What about Grand Prince Jinmyeong?

820
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:05,265
Now that Your Majesty
has taken the medicine,

821
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,351
we will be serving it
to Grand Prince Jinmyeong.

822
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,147
I must be there to witness it.

823
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,690
Your Majesty,

824
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:17,193
you must rest
and recover from the effects.

825
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,320
I am fine.

826
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,572
Come with me.

827
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:21,489
Yes.

828
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,338
His Majesty the King has arrived.

829
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:42,594
Your Majesty.

830
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,601
The royal physician
has prepared an antidote.

831
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:51,686
-Cheongyeolyak.
-Yes.

832
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:55,732
It will help bring down
the excessively high fever.

833
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,819
Hurry and give Jinmyeong the antidote.

834
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,573
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

835
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:48,827
Grand Prince Jinmyeong.

836
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,204
Do you feel better?

837
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:53,081
This is such a relief.

838
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,916
I am so glad.

839
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,710
He is better at last.

840
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,089
Grand Prince Jinmyeong!

841
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:02,882
What is the matter?

842
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,009
Grand Prince!

843
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:05,468
What is happening?

844
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,512
He is having a seizure!

845
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:09,973
Grand Prince Jinmyeong.

846
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,478
-Grand Prince.
-His pulse is fast and frail.

847
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,815
His body lacks the nutrition and energy
to take the medicine.

848
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,443
Prepare another medicine
to treat him immediately!

849
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:25,447
What good is making more medicine
when he cannot even swallow?

850
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:28,324
-Grand Prince Jinmyeong.
-Grand Prince!

851
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,784
-Grand Prince.
-Oh dear.

852
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:32,495
Could it be because…

853
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:37,167
The reason the antidote isn't working

854
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,252
is because he hasn't been eating, right?

855
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:42,255
Yes. You could say that.

856
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:47,343
I will prepare some food to restore
Grand Prince Jinmyeong's energy.

857
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:50,972
Are you planning to flee?

858
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,267
Queen Dowager.

859
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:57,312
The royal physician
confirmed Jinmyeong's state

860
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:59,397
was caused by a sangbanyak.

861
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:02,150
The female physician
who was involved has died,

862
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:06,446
but we apprehended a Jahongwon court lady
who tried to kill that physician.

863
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:10,116
So why do you still blame
the chief royal cook?

864
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:12,452
Grandmother.

865
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,582
The court lady is being interrogated,

866
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,293
so we will soon find out
who was behind it.

867
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:21,753
That is right.

868
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:25,507
If the chief royal cook wanted to flee,
she would not have come here at all.

869
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,013
Go ahead.

870
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:34,099
-Your Majesty!
-It is a royal command.

871
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

872
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:46,236
Jinmyeong.

873
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,613
Please come to your senses, Jinmyeong.

874
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,702
If I'm right,

875
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:57,789
Grand Prince Jinmyeong
is showing symptoms of hypoglycemic shock.

876
00:56:57,872 --> 00:57:00,208
In other words, malnutrition.

877
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,961
I need to make a highly concentrated
nourishing dish that's easy to consume.

878
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,132
ROYAL KITCHEN

879
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:11,845
Attention, everyone!

880
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:15,598
-Chief Royal Cook!
-Miss! We were so worried about you.

881
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,308
What happened?

882
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,561
Sorry, Gil-geum. I'll explain later.

883
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:22,355
We're going to make a nourishing dish.

884
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,190
A nourishing dish?
What kind and with what?

885
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,650
Carp? Eel?

886
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:28,194
The dish is called "restaurant."

887
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,238
-"Resto…"
-"Restaro"?

888
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,073
Res… What is it called again?

889
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,616
There's no time, so we must hurry.

890
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,536
Gil-geum, I need you to make
gourd-shaped rice cakes with white rice.

891
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,289
Cook Maeng,
please make sujebi dough with wheat flour.

892
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:40,915
-Okay.
-Very well.

893
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,000
We are making a nourishing dish.

894
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,376
-Cook Min.
-Okay!

895
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,335
What shall I do?

896
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,963
Can you get me the ox feet soup we made
for the seoksura, evening meal?

897
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:47,964
-Okay.
-What about me?

898
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:50,175
Can you go to the storage in Naeuiwon

899
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,635
and get licorice, angelica root,
cheongung root, and velvet antler?

900
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:53,845
Sure.

901
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,118
Okay, nice.

902
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:20,538
What kind of dish is this restoran?

903
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:23,249
It's a nourishing dish that got its name

904
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,793
from the French word "restaurer,"
meaning "to restore."

905
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:29,172
We're making the Joseon version.

906
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:32,550
Oh, it is a Prance-style restoran.

907
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,220
So it is not an ordinary sujebi,
hand-pulled dough.

908
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,265
It's nice and thick.

909
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,976
It is as thick as a sauce.

910
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,520
You know so much now.

911
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,564
This is a velouté sauce.

912
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:48,650
Blatty sauce?

913
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,443
No, blotty sauce.

914
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,237
-Velouté sauce.
-Velouté.

915
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,363
-Velou…
-Give me that.

916
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,965
The chief royal cook has arrived.

917
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,345
I apologize for the delay.

918
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:20,348
Please help him sit up so he can eat.

919
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:26,729
How can I trust what you made
and give it to my son?

920
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,401
What is this?

921
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:35,280
It's a Joseon-style restaurant
with gourd-shaped rice cakes and sujebi.

922
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:37,365
Joseon-style "restoran"?

923
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,867
Gourd-shaped rice cakes?

924
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,744
How is this nourishing?

925
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,914
Rice cakes and sujebi
made with wheat flour

926
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,291
are rapidly digested
and absorbed into the body,

927
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,543
so they can be fattening
to ordinary people.

928
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:50,920
But Grand Prince Jinmyeong
is malnourished,

929
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,547
and this is exactly
what he needs right now.

930
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:56,050
The broth is made with ingredients
with invigorating properties,

931
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:58,678
including ox feet, velvet antler,
and cheongung root.

932
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,763
Very well. I get it.

933
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,056
All right.

934
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,058
Queen Dowager,
feed it to the Grand Prince.

935
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,435
Your Royal Highness.

936
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,562
I do not trust her.

937
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,064
If you do not trust her,

938
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,524
I will taste the food myself.

939
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,693
Your Majesty.

940
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:17,030
Your Majesty, it is not customary
for the king to taste the food first.

941
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:21,743
What better way is there
to ease the Queen Dowager's doubts?

942
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:23,995
Your Majesty, you cannot do it.

943
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:29,959
I would also like to taste the food
the chief royal cook prepared.

944
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,879
Your Majesty, I will taste the food.

945
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:33,921
No.

946
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,882
What are you doing?

947
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,259
You taste the food.

948
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:50,897
Your Majesty.

949
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,322
The broth is thick and rich.

950
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,326
The natural flavors of the ingredients
are flowing through my body.

951
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,829
I suddenly feel energized.

952
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:12,752
Queen Dowager, give it to him.

953
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:34,607
Just one bite.

954
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,408
Open up.

955
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:55,545
Look.

956
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:59,757
The spasms are subsiding.

957
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:04,387
Jinmyeong.

958
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,181
Mother.

959
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:08,808
Jinmyeong.

960
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,397
My goodness.

961
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:18,484
His pulse is stabilizing.

962
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,777
This is unbelievable.

963
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:22,155
Thank goodness.

964
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:24,282
I'm so relieved.

965
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,952
The heavens helped us.

966
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:37,587
That is it.

967
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,046
There you go.

968
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:52,977
Are you all right?

969
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:54,395
Yes.

970
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:56,689
The sudden release of tension
made my legs weak.

971
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:00,318
I'm so relieved.

972
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,361
I was really worried.

973
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,364
You have been through a lot lately.

974
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,366
You have too.

975
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:10,828
You were ill and stressed out.

976
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,330
It must've been rough.

977
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,166
I appreciate the sentiment.

978
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:19,086
Come to Unyeongjeong
at the nineteenth hour.

979
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,588
There is something I wish to show you.

980
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:22,006
Okay.

981
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:24,509
What?

982
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,428
What are you going to show me?

983
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:29,388
Well,

984
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:32,058
you will see for yourself.

985
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:34,644
Okay.

986
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,945
Is it Mangunrok?

987
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,239
Did he find it?

988
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:50,368
Is this it?

989
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:51,953
Yes, this is it!

990
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,122
I found it on the way here.

991
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,293
Thank you! Thank you so much!

992
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,962
I understand
how desperately you seek this book,

993
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:02,505
so I will find it for you by any means.

994
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:03,673
I said it was a royal command!

995
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,675
Your Majesty!

996
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,094
You must have been scared.

997
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:09,679
You must stay strong.

998
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:12,849
But

999
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:14,767
what's wrong with me?

1000
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,311
It's weird.

1001
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:19,605
My heart aches.

1002
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,821
All that was done came to nothing now.

1003
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:28,990
It seems things have taken
an unexpected turn, Your Highness.

1004
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:31,075
There is no need to be so pessimistic.

1005
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:32,535
Once a rift forms,

1006
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,829
it is hard to fill in.

1007
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,457
Consort Kang did her part.

1008
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,126
What do you mean by that?

1009
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:43,921
I am saying
she has laid the groundwork well.

1010
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:47,550
And she will also see to the rest herself.

1011
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,803
Let us meet in the evening.

1012
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,346
There is something I wish to show you.

1013
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:11,824
Chu-wol.

1014
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,077
Your Grace?

1015
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:22,668
Your Grace.

1016
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,756
Your Grace…

1017
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:36,015
Quench your thirst.

1018
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:47,985
You look a mess.

1019
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:48,945
Your Grace.

1020
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:50,863
Do not worry.

1021
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,532
I did not say a word.

1022
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,786
They may threaten my life,

1023
01:05:57,411 --> 01:06:00,998
but I will not say a word,
so do not worry, Your Grace.

1024
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,375
Do not worry.

1025
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,378
I will get you out of here.

1026
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,296
Right now, Your Grace?

1027
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:20,351
Yes.

1028
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:24,021
I appreciate
all that you have done for me.

1029
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:25,815
Your Grace.

1030
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:39,370
Your Grace…

1031
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:48,587
This is the only way

1032
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,966
you can get out of here, Chu-wol.

1033
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:24,206
What's taking him so long?

1034
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:25,916
It's scary out here.

1035
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,003
He always does whatever he wants.

1036
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:35,051
Your Majesty.

1037
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,597
Isn't that a Cheoyong mask?

1038
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,681
It is.

1039
01:07:41,515 --> 01:07:43,309
It is said to ward off evil.

1040
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:45,311
It also symbolizes
long life and abundance.

1041
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:48,230
Are you going to dance
the Cheoyongmu right now?

1042
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:51,484
I am thinking of performing it
at the banquet

1043
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:53,736
celebrating my grandmother's
seventieth year.

1044
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,822
She used to very much enjoy

1045
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,616
the Cheoyongmu I performed
when I was little.

1046
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:04,121
Why did you want to see me at this hour?

1047
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:08,000
I want you to be the first
to watch me dance.

1048
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:08,918
Me?

1049
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:09,835
Yes.

1050
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:11,462
Will you watch?

1051
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:13,005
Okay.

1052
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:16,008
Though I did watch you dance before.

1053
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:50,459
This might be

1054
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:52,837
the last time

1055
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:55,631
I get to watch that dance.

1056
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:01,971
-Who are you?
-No, stop! Wait!

1057
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:03,222
You crazy fool!

1058
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,932
I'm pretty good with a knife too.

1059
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:11,063
I'm a chef. It's the same thing as a cook.

1060
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:13,482
My gosh!

1061
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:19,113
As of this moment,
the chief royal cook of the royal kitchen

1062
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:20,948
is Ji-young of the Yeon family.

1063
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:25,703
You're not at all
the kind of man that I like.

1064
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:31,709
Let me see.

1065
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:36,463
Hide behind me.

1066
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:38,424
Right here.

1067
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:40,301
There is something on yours as well.

1068
01:09:46,473 --> 01:09:48,809
It's beautiful. Look at the colors.

1069
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:03,657
Stay as you are. Just for a while.

1070
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,242
Just for a while.

1071
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:07,036
Stay here just a while.

1072
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,666
I missed you so much.

1073
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:26,222
Was this always such a sad dance?

1074
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:43,906
Yi Jang-gyun.

1075
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:48,118
Yi Jang-gyun.

1076
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:50,371
You bastard!

1077
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:52,957
Control yourself.

1078
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:59,129
Your Highness, what are we to make
of his apprehension?

1079
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:02,716
It means the time has come.

1080
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:08,889
Look over there.

1081
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:25,239
Father?

1082
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:26,865
Father.

1083
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:29,451
Who is that senile old woman?

1084
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,453
She is our finishing touch.

1085
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:34,915
Is she the Internal Princess Consort?

1086
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:36,417
Pardon?

1087
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:40,462
Are you saying that woman is the mother

1088
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:42,339
of the deposed Queen Yeon?

1089
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:44,675
That is so.

1090
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:48,137
She is His Majesty's maternal grandmother,

1091
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:51,181
Internal Princess Consort Sim
from Goheung.

1092
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:57,563
She had something very important
in her possession.

1093
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:00,899
Inside that doll

1094
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:04,695
is the bloodstained garment

1095
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,365
the deposed queen wore
when she was poisoned to death.

1096
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:11,285
Your Highness.

1097
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,580
At last.

1098
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:15,748
It is done.

1099
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:20,836
Soon,

1100
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:23,839
the whole truth will come to light.

1101
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,468
On the day of
the Grand Royal Queen Dowager's banquet,

1102
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:30,220
the tyrant

1103
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:34,850
will lose control
and let loose his madness,

1104
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:37,394
and the palace will be drenched in blood.

1105
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:57,414
How was it?

1106
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,418
It didn't feel like this last time.

1107
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:04,963
But today,

1108
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:07,091
you looked cool.

1109
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:16,642
Oh, I'm fine.

1110
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:21,063
The breeze is cold at night.

1111
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:27,152
I must ask you something.

1112
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,658
Do you still

1113
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:37,287
wish to find Mangunrok and return?

1114
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,790
Of course. Why do you ask?

1115
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:40,874
I do not

1116
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:44,128
want you to leave.

1117
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:46,213
Wherever that may be.

1118
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:52,010
Do you finally believe
I'm from the future?

1119
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:56,473
I could tell

1120
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:58,767
you were not a person of this time.

1121
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:00,227
How?

1122
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:02,688
The day you made gochojang bibinbap.

1123
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:05,649
The day you prepared oat sheen.

1124
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:09,278
The day you served me doenjang paasta.

1125
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:12,781
I felt it all along…

1126
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,952
that you were not from this place.

1127
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:18,996
Then you knew all along,

1128
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:22,124
and you still mistreated me like that?

1129
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:24,126
Mistreated?

1130
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:25,544
What are you talking about?

1131
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:27,921
I don't believe this.

1132
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:30,799
Just find me Mangunrok already.

1133
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:34,052
Do you really wish to find that book?

1134
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:35,846
Wait.

1135
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:39,892
Have you not been looking for it
all this time?

1136
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:44,771
I am sure I will find it soon.

1137
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,316
However…

1138
01:14:50,068 --> 01:14:51,820
I did not want to look for it.

1139
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:54,948
Your Majesty.

1140
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,922
Be my companion.

1141
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:13,509
Your Majesty.

1142
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:16,845
-That's just not--
-I mean it.

1143
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,577
If you become my companion,

1144
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:45,624
every morning,

1145
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:49,461
I will make you bibinbap.

1146
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:53,048
That was the moment

1147
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:57,010
that I thought maybe it wouldn't be so bad

1148
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,721
even if I didn't go back

1149
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:02,349
to my time and my world.

1150
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,861
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

1151
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,488
In return, promise me something.

1152
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:00,782
Promise me that you won't be a tyrant.

1153
01:17:01,658 --> 01:17:04,494
Today marks the beginning of a new Joseon.

1154
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:07,581
A special guest will be coming tonight.

1155
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,668
The chief royal cook
was taken by a band of rebels.

1156
01:17:12,919 --> 01:17:14,796
You must be safe.

1157
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:17,716
Today!

1158
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:20,344
I will set everything right.

1159
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:25,932
Is there really no way to stop this?

1160
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:32,856
