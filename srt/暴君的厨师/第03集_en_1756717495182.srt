1
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,966
"The Tyrant's Chef"

2
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,436
Your Highness It's cool outside

3
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,188
It's time for you to go back to your bedroom

4
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,397
(Lee Xian, the King of Korea)

5
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,815
OK Let's go

6
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,610
Your Highness, please stay

7
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,072
Then we're going...

8
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,698
(Jiang Mozhu, Shuyuan, Li Xianci)

9
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,033
…Where?

10
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,577
how? Scared?

11
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,828
Of course I'm scared

12
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,207
Everything around me
They are all very strange, very scary

13
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,087
(Shen Shouhe, Yulin Guard)

14
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,090
What to do?

15
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,302
how?

16
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,555
Everything around you now
Isn't it that strange or scary?

17
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,434
Yes, nothing can be seen now
There's nothing to be afraid of

18
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,393
I thank you

19
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,063
This method is really creative

20
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,777
I have prepared a special residence for you

21
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,446
You just look forward to it

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,115
I will

23
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,034
Let's go

24
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:08,503
In this era, can the king do whatever he wants?

25
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,131
I told you to be careful!

26
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,493
What about Your Highness’s dragon body?

27
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,081
An unknown ointment was applied to the wound

28
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,374
It seems that the bleeding has stopped

29
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,920
One more step later, your highness's life may be worrying

30
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,130
God blesses

31
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,717
Fortunately, the injury did not worsen. I am very lucky. Your Highness

32
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,886
If the bleeding is not stopped

33
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,221
Is my life worrying?

34
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,389
You crazy man!

35
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,308
Didn't you see that I helped you stop the bleeding?

36
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,143
I saved your life!

37
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,273
OK, you all retreat

38
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,566
Yes Your Highness

39
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:19,991
Everything I saw and heard here today
You must forget it all

40
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,784
Yes Shuyuan's Lady

41
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,592
It's so dangerous, Your Highness

42
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,262
Can you ask who treated the wound and stopped bleeding for you?

43
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,306
It's that ghost girl

44
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,682
Demon woman?

45
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,435
You brought her back because she saved you

46
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,729
And not because she committed a crime?

47
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,397
It's true

48
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,900
But in this North Korea eight

49
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,570
No one wants to kill her more than me

50
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,365
I haven't seen you smile so happily for a long time

51
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,659
Are you upset about this?

52
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,495
Is Jiang Shuyuan upset?

53
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:09,415
Your Highness joked. How could I do this?

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,003
Didn’t you say that you had prepared a special residence for her?

55
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,422
Could it be another palace?

56
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,966
(A different palace: a special palace built by the king for future wives and concubines)

57
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:18,883
Other palaces?

58
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,262
Or is there a special residence arranged outside the palace?

59
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,514
Are you jealous?

60
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,392
Stop making fun of me

61
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,936
Tell me what's going on

62
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,563
Say it quickly

63
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,484
don’t worry

64
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,237
Her residence

65
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,657
It's much more special than other palaces

66
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,086
Really

67
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,338
Although I didn't expect it to be a five-star hotel

68
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,882
But is the "special residence" he mentioned is such a place?

69
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,761
It's just a broken prison cell in every corner of the palace

70
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,472
There is actually a prison room in the palace

71
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,058
This guy is really amazing too

72
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,893
Although it's mourning

73
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,480
But at least we changed our clothes.
Let's take a shower

74
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,650
After finally surviving, be content

75
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,360
It's right

76
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,529
We did survive

77
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,490
At least for now

78
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:32,206
Lesson 3: High-end cuisine

79
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,584
cell?

80
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:39,213
He said he wanted to kill her but his behavior was so abnormal

81
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,508
I think your highness is interested in that girl

82
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,344
That's just a moment of curiosity

83
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,180
It's strange to call her a ghost girl

84
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,349
She didn't fall from the sky
Where did it come out?

85
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,644
Go and take everything about that girl
All of them are checked clearly

86
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,146
How did they meet

87
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,440
How did it attract His Highness’s attention in the Gyeonggi Supervisor Camp

88
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:01,611
Isn’t it faster to ask directly?

89
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,280
Yes, I forgot that there is still Ren Songzai

90
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,324
Do you want me to pass the message?

91
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,618
Yes, let him come and see me

92
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:10,745
besides…

93
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,542
Leave this to Jizhang Dajun

94
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,710
Yes, ladies

95
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,053
(Shuilajian: a place to prepare imperial meals)

96
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,811
The new herbs today are very fresh

97
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,067
(Yan Fengzhi, the chief expert of the seventh grade)

98
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,862
Don't pound so hard, okay?

99
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,656
No grain of rice is allowed to be wasted

100
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,368
Be careful of the blade and don't hurt your hands

101
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,369
yes

102
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:52,870
Shen Made

103
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,875
The batter is too thick, add some water

104
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,876
yes

105
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,630
-Min Made
-Um?

106
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,424
The pancake is of the wrong shape

107
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,678
Fry it golden and it looks like it is appetite

108
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,596
-yes
- Really

109
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,891
I'll take a look

110
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,770
Watch whatever you want

111
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,110
By the way, have you all heard of it?

112
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,738
Your Highness brought a ghost girl back to the palace

113
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,323
prostitute?

114
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,452
Which prostitute in a brothel can make the master fall in love with it?

115
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,872
You fool I'm talking about a ghost girl, not a prostitute

116
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:40,042
It's a ghost who turns into a female body

117
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,753
Yes, Shen Mashu is right

118
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,923
The Lord brought a female ghost back

119
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:51,137
Don’t you ignore the rumors in the palace?

120
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,305
Have you finished all the work on your hands?

121
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,641
Things are all talking about in the palace

122
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,977
It would be strange if you don't know

123
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,688
Is it because you came from the kitchen of the Japanese restaurant?

124
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,983
That's why I'm so ignorant?

125
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:09,155
I understand because you are a master of three generations of single-letter

126
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,200
That's why the rumors in the palace are so well-versed

127
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,744
Meng Shushou, don’t you know?

128
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,662
The Golden Palace in front of the Great Princess

129
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,998
It's very different with Yan Mai

130
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,084
So he can be the first to know about big and small things in the palace

131
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,712
So the Queen Mother

132
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,006
Only then will he support his current tenure...

133
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,635
You fool, can you shut up?

134
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,512
What if someone hears it?

135
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,433
There is no one here except us

136
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,727
Did you drink again last night?

137
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,312
Don't drink so much!

138
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:46,484
In short, the next expert must be yours

139
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,821
This is indefinite

140
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,158
Maybe it's Meng's master

141
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,911
The ex-boyfriend has just passed away not long ago

142
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,997
Are you in a hurry to discuss the replacement?

143
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,667
If you want to stay and eat the leftovers on the main

144
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,252
Be careful when speaking

145
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,880
What’s wrong with talking about what has been decided?

146
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,591
You can't be a good player, so you feel unhappy?

147
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,510
Enough, Shen Made

148
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,429
Why do you want to squeeze Meng’s master in that way?

149
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,014
So what if he is unhappy?

150
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,391
This is the fact

151
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,476
No matter how much he jumps, it's useless

152
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,437
The next Shuilashima Waiting to be acquainted
It's time for you to be a master of Yan

153
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,231
Things are unpredictable

154
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,694
Official Yin, you are here

155
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,821
Shuyuan's Lady

156
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,907
She thinks that Meng is the best

157
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,158
Having said that

158
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,745
It has been more than half a month since my ex-boyfriend passed away

159
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,248
It's time for the Lord to appoint a successor

160
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,584
Yes, right

161
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,668
Everyone is OK

162
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,798
Lady

163
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,010
Jinshitui Palace Please tell me

164
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,015
The Great Queen's Daughter

165
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,100
I want to use some Korean fruits as tea

166
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,476
Empress Shuyuan ordered

167
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,146
Sanhe Porridge as a night snack

168
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,316
-Yes
-Yes

169
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,032
Don't waste food

170
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,492
-Yes, of course not
-We got it

171
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,411
He actually brought back a ghost girl?

172
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,329
Not only that

173
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,915
He also dealt with the Gyeonggi Superintendent Hong Jingda for the crime of treason?

174
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,921
I always have an ominous premonition

175
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,423
Hong Yingji?

176
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,884
Isn't it just him who takes Shuyuan

177
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,011
Comparing it to Yang Guifei of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang Dynasty?

178
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,804
Yes, it's him

179
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,686
Is your Highness

180
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:50,775
Are you really taking personal revenge?

181
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,987
Where is Jiang Shuyuan?

182
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,495
It's her ghost girl

183
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:06,040
I have prepared a special residence for you

184
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,542
Demon woman?

185
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,169
If it weren't for some background

186
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,339
Your Highness will never bring that kind of woman back

187
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,757
Who will it be?

188
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,135
Empress, all the emperors are in charge of their wishes

189
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,220
Let him in

190
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,857
Empress, can you be healthy recently?

191
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,568
I'm fine, I'm worried.

192
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:39,031
I heard that you didn't bring the beautiful fragrance when you picked red

193
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,074
Yes

194
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,452
But as you wish her grandfather
Hong Observation has been exiled

195
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,913
His family has also become official slaves

196
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:46,997
So

197
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,167
Why did you come back with that ghost girl?

198
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,045
Ah, that girl?

199
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,714
That was the decision of His Highness the Lord

200
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,466
I have no idea

201
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,844
So I can't explain it to the empress

202
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,058
It turned out to be you

203
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,605
It seems that your Highness made a decision that you don't even know

204
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,940
It's really unexpected

205
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,360
I heard she is very good at cooking

206
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,404
But she's just a skilled person

207
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,198
Weichen believes that this little thing is not worth the trouble of the Empress

208
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,159
Yeah?

209
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,911
What have you brought to me?

210
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,664
This is a jewelry copied from Hong Observation Mansion

211
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,088
Did Caihong only find these this time?

212
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,134
Of course not

213
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,596
After all the slaves and land deeds are sorted out...

214
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,139
Hong Observation turned into a family member who became an official slave

215
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,725
Find them and send them all to Zihongyuan

216
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:51,187
If you do this
The ministers in the court will object

217
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,647
Just the issue of exile by Hong Observer
There are already many different opinions

218
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,608
This is exactly the reason

219
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,652
If you don't want to leave a disaster in the future

220
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,489
You should be smarter before I give the order

221
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,828
Are you sure this is really OK?

222
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,079
Of course I'm sure

223
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,833
You are dereliction of duty first and dare to question me?

224
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,044
Since you insisted on this

225
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,087
I'll follow the orders

226
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,007
You've always been like this

227
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,051
Yes, ladies

228
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,261
The minister obeys the order

229
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:26,931
Father

230
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,558
Now it's time to find another good idea

231
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,268
What does this mean?

232
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,813
That Jiang Shuyuan relies on the favor of His Highness

233
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,858
In recent years, we have regarded us as her servants.

234
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,860
I'm a third-class person

235
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,779
She was just a fourth-ranked person who was domineering to me?

236
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,531
Be careful when speaking!

237
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,785
Have you forgotten that this is the palace?

238
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,287
If you can live such a prosperous and prosperous life

239
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,082
Even if I have been a servant for hundreds of years, I am willing to

240
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,000
Since you insist on being the current person

241
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,503
Why not serve him this time?

242
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,338
You might be talking about that ghost girl?

243
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:00,756
It's simply ridiculous!

244
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,761
Your Highness, except Jiang Shuyuan
Disdain for any woman

245
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,304
But that cunning nine-tailed fox

246
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,974
To put it bluntly, it's just a humble origin

247
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:13,018
Who said that the ghost girl can’t become the second Jiang Shuyuan?

248
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,229
Can you afford this consequence?

249
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,607
I've prepared a new fun for His Highness

250
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,693
Who does the Sacred Heart mean?

251
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,320
You'll see it in person soon

252
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,890
Who are you?

253
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,641
We're all going to die when caught

254
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,270
Don't make a sound

255
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,315
key?

256
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,488
hurry up

257
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,544
The sinner escaped and searched the palace thoroughly!

258
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,545
-yes!
-yes!

259
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,017
The sinner ran away and caught the ghost girl!

260
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,145
Let's go

261
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,276
What should we do in the middle of the night?

262
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,159
Look at the sky

263
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,285
Oh my God

264
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,371
Too beautiful

265
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,627
The ghost girl ran away

266
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,755
It seems that your highness has passed by himself

267
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,264
Let's get on!

268
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,686
bring it on!

269
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,232
Enjoy!

270
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,277
Come together!

271
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,782
Bliss!

272
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,036
bring it on!

273
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,583
Enjoy!

274
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,711
Come together!

275
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,423
Bliss!

276
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,059
Who are these people in Jang Geum?

277
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,602
I don't know either

278
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,689
Looks like an actor
But why are they here?

279
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,567
And where did that person go just now?

280
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,152
Everyone wears the same mask

281
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,154
-I can't tell who is who
-I guess it should be him

282
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,077
Oh my God!

283
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,499
So

284
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,710
Wandering under the moon, can you enjoy yourself?

285
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,298
What are you doing?

286
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,884
-Didn't you say you wanted to help us escape?
- That's it!

287
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,302
Can you let us go now?

288
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,804
Let you go?

289
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,732
Your Highness

290
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,150
Your Highness…

291
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,200
This performance was specially prepared for you.

292
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,577
I wonder if you still like it

293
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,663
Wait, who was the person wearing the mask just now?

294
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,248
It's Kongji there

295
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,628
Everyone stopped!

296
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,218
Are you referring to him?

297
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,887
What? Are you from the same group?

298
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,597
You've done a good job today as always

299
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,766
It's my honor Your Highness

300
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,733
(Kong Ji: Yan Xijun's side
A jester with many secrets)

301
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,906
Oh, look at that scoundrel

302
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:39,576
Tall and handsome

303
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,954
This is not the point.

304
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,580
He lied to us

305
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,167
I'm willing to be deceived by him again

306
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,044
-What's wrong with you?
-This person

307
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,589
I'm a very caring actor

308
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,007
His name is Kongji

309
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,175
Is he an actor?

310
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,971
That's right, his dance
It's really amazing to dance, isn't it?

311
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,348
really

312
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,267
You retreat

313
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,937
Your Highness, are you still enjoying your view?

314
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,357
Tonight is much more interesting than usual

315
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:14,987
Take it!

316
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:24,121
Thank you, Longen, Your Highness!

317
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,170
We will not return until we get drunk tonight!

318
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,423
Let's go and drink!

319
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,638
Let's go everyone!

320
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,599
-oops
-etc

321
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,851
Where have I heard of the name "Kongji"?

322
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,688
Guangdai Kongji's movie "The King's Man"!

323
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,858
I've heard of his name long ago

324
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,777
It's really pleasing to the eye

325
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,823
Be awake Jang Geum

326
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,575
I have meat today!

327
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,745
-Let's go!
-Let's play for a little longer!

328
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,455
Let's have fun!

329
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,592
I was shot by an assassin's arrow in the Shaguling Forest

330
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,469
Find out the mastermind behind the scenes in secret

331
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,100
Why do you want to do this?

332
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,310
For fun

333
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,395
how?

334
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,439
Do you think it's boring?

335
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,817
Just for fun, it's so complicated

336
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,611
I don't even have the fun of entertainment

337
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,488
If you dare to run away again

338
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,742
I won't let you go with a smile

339
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:49,248
As long as you stop sending that masked clown, everything will be fine

340
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,415
presumptuous

341
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,501
Do you have to talk back?

342
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,587
Do you really don’t want to live anymore?

343
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,216
Come! Is the soldering iron burning good?

344
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,509
-Yes Your Highness
-Yes Your Highness

345
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,147
Didn't you say it's just for fun

346
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,858
I'll say your temper needs to be changed

347
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,278
What's the use of changing it

348
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,906
I knew one day I would get into trouble

349
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,616
Start with her

350
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,493
-My?
-Why?

351
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,288
-Miss!
-etc

352
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,872
Jang Geum!

353
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,208
Miss!

354
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,127
Jang Geum!

355
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,087
Miss!

356
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,841
-Miss!
-Not good

357
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,137
Miss

358
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,305
Your Highness

359
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,975
Please listen to our words

360
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,561
Aren't you still very presumptuous just now?

361
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,187
How did you change your mind?

362
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,106
presumptuous? Are you talking about me?

363
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,651
I will never run away again

364
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,445
Is it OK?

365
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,447
Not running?

366
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,700
That's just right

367
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,245
It would be a pity to let you go like this

368
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,040
Let her go

369
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,458
-Yes Your Highness
-Yes Your Highness

370
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,971
Your Highness

371
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:31,683
Are we going to be sent back to prison now?

372
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,477
Of course not

373
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,481
I'm very hungry now

374
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,233
Prepare some food for me

375
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,569
So speechless

376
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,572
Do you want to eat the food I cook?

377
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,744
Miss, please agree to him

378
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:53,747
good

379
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,832
I'll prepare now

380
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,045
But I have a request

381
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,797
ask?

382
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,260
Please let Jang Geum be my helper

383
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,887
I'm not busy alone

384
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,311
Can

385
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:17,896
But in exchange

386
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:21,525
You have to do your best to make the best dishes

387
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,318
To satisfy everyone

388
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,987
Beef stewed far better than Jinggi-Jingying

389
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:33,662
Your Highness, do you have any dishes you particularly want to eat?

390
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,164
What dish do I want to eat?

391
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:41,795
"If you live, you will die. If you die, you will live."

392
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,423
If you make the same dish as before for survival

393
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,092
You'll die

394
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,010
If you want to die, make a new dish

395
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,096
You can live

396
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:55,142
Of course, the food must be satisfied with me

397
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,413
Miss

398
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,542
It's great to be able to enter the water skull

399
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,002
But are we really okay?

400
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:23,795
Something is wrong

401
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:25,797
Jang Geum

402
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,551
I'll definitely try my best to survive and go back

403
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,722
I want to go back to see my dad

404
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,101
Have a meal with him...

405
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,687
The more we need to cheer up

406
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,107
I'll do everything possible to survive

407
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,319
The highest palace between Shangshuila

408
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,072
Good Jang Geum

409
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,700
I'll hold on.

410
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,621
Oops Miss

411
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,206
That's really outrageous

412
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,667
Oh, Miss, what's wrong with you?

413
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,629
Why are you crying? Is it okay?

414
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,716
Stop crying

415
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,635
Thank you Jang Geum

416
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,391
I'm the winner of the cooking competition

417
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,976
"Voice"?

418
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,686
I got the highest score

419
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,856
The more difficult the task, the better I will do

420
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,941
So don't worry

421
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,734
You're so awesome

422
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,028
Let's come on

423
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,154
OK, we can do it

424
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,950
What? Let a woman prepare royal meal?

425
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,327
You're making such a joke too much.

426
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,453
(Changxuan Du Xueli)

427
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:41,498
(Duxuli: the head of the official in the Shuila bureau)

428
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,375
What can I do?

429
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,502
This is the Lord's Destiny

430
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,797
Can the Queen of the King know about this?

431
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,090
Residence

432
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,509
All the Lords Chen came in person

433
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,928
Don't you understand the seriousness of the matter?

434
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:58,056
But women can be palace maids in the Shuila

435
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,225
Or be a palace in the palace

436
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,018
I can see it at a glance

437
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,480
Your origin is different from those of you here

438
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,065
Where did you learn cooking skills?

439
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,775
Mingyue Pavilion?

440
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,616
Well, where I work

441
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,537
It's far from here, even if I say it, you won't know

442
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,039
From Sichuan in the Ming Dynasty? Or the Japanese house?

443
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,374
where?

444
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,668
In which barbarian country did you learn the cooking skills?

445
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,046
No, I'm...

446
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,798
You're too much

447
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:35,844
This is the Lord's Destiny
Why do you want to get to the bottom of it?

448
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,356
Hello, wait a moment

449
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,733
-Hello?
-etc

450
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:54,321
My God, you guys are really unfriendly

451
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,657
But then again, this is what the kitchen should look like

452
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,326
So good

453
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,828
How about we warm up?

454
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:12,422
Lord Chen, please allow me to apologize to you on their behalf

455
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,716
Your Highness specially ordered the experienced one

456
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,469
You must let other experienced players know this

457
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,845
Yes, adults

458
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,474
You go slowly

459
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,159
The fire is really strong

460
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,913
There are quite a lot of things

461
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,504
Wait, that's all?

462
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:00,512
I used cinnamon instead of cinnamon

463
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,473
Use tea leaves instead of onions

464
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,393
Use cinnamon instead of cinnamon

465
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,686
Use tealoa instead of onions?

466
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,646
Um

467
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,730
Although there is no

468
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,899
But in the future, those are very commonly used ingredients

469
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,067
Oh, the future?

470
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,860
OK Let's start

471
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:16,778
Let's get started

472
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,116
Miss

473
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,577
Where do I smell raw meat?

474
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,703
Raw meat?

475
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,706
I didn't smell anything

476
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,717
Your nose is really good

477
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,351
You don't know what it is, why did you taste it?

478
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,105
-Not beef
-What?

479
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:53,648
deer?

480
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,066
Is it venison?

481
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,486
Uncle, is there venison here?

482
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,821
deer?

483
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,114
Oh, right

484
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,325
The deer hunted by the Lord yesterday, after the treatment

485
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,869
Delivered to the stewardship

486
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,749
venison…

487
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,543
What's wrong, Miss?

488
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,672
-Jewelvet
-yes?

489
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,841
Deer steak is my specialty

490
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,885
"Deer Pray"?

491
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,052
Write down the practice

492
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,555
first…

493
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,488
Are you just presenting the imperial meal like this?

494
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:26,115
-right
-What kind of style is this

495
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,868
Prepare two meal tables quickly, one for the owner, and one for the meal

496
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:29,953
-Yes
-so what?

497
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:33,498
You mean the woman brought back by the Lord
Take over the water slag?

498
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,417
Isn't this true?

499
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,336
Too unfair

500
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,295
Oh my God!

501
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,799
What did you just say?

502
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,134
The Lord brings back a ghost girl

503
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,470
He even sent her into the water lair room?

504
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,388
Yes

505
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:52,308
She is using the venison she has hunted from the Lord for meals

506
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,268
What?

507
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,061
venison?

508
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,195
Is the ghost girl appointed as a very experienced person?

509
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,490
Are you saying she really knows how to cook?

510
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,908
Yes, ladies

511
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,579
Do you know what Your Highness asked her to do?

512
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,163
Little unknown

513
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,709
But a mere woman
How can I make a decent imperial meal?

514
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,378
Isn't the result obvious?

515
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,798
Your Highness's taste is extremely picky and sensitive

516
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,593
I really can't believe it

517
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,386
As far as I know

518
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,638
That ghost girl had cooked in Gyeonggi Supervisory Camp

519
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,515
And your highness was very satisfied with the food

520
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,559
Are you in Jinggi?

521
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,603
Have she cooked there?

522
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,520
Yes

523
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:41,107
However, it is impossible for a mere woman to learn cooking skills seriously

524
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,902
Just knowing how many decent side dishes can't last long

525
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,279
Wait until the ghost girl finishes cooking

526
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,114
You go and see it yourself

527
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,658
Try to find out her faults or flaws

528
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,702
Yes, ladies

529
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,042
- Qiuyue
-Yes

530
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,172
Is Your Highness in the bedroom?

531
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,423
Yes, ladies

532
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:08,509
I have to see him right away. Get ready

533
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,928
Yes, ladies

534
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,730
Change this one

535
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,023
(Corning Palace)

536
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,358
Why? Change this outfit?

537
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,526
Hurry up, hurry up

538
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,197
hurry up

539
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,281
Standing here

540
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,367
The food is about to cool down

541
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,868
-OK
-I'll take a look

542
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:37,914
Ready

543
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:38,998
Go there and stand

544
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,960
Your Highness

545
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,253
Your dinner is ready

546
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,130
Present

547
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,649
Why do you look disheveled in a big man’s clothes?

548
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,110
Let it go easily

549
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,745
(Zhimi Palace Cui Moren)

550
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,125
Oh, right

551
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,014
The food is here

552
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,980
Get up

553
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,940
Although he is the worst tyrant in North Korea

554
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,900
But I'm a person who knows history

555
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,569
It's OK Don't be nervous

556
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,945
What are you doing?

557
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,613
Let's explain the imperial meal

558
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,698
(Imperial meal: a meal prepared for the king)

559
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,539
Your Highness

560
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:05,460
This dish comes from the palace cuisine of Versailles

561
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,087
This is traditional French cuisine, i.e. "High-end cuisine"

562
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,882
(Haute Cuisine: French cuisine set)

563
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,843
"Hair room"? "Cake clean and bake"?

564
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,222
Pronounced as "haute cuisine"

565
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,363
First, prepare "appetizer" for you

566
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,617
Ran into raw beef tartare with various vegetables and raw egg yolks

567
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,702
Enjoy with Shanghai film

568
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,746
"Shallow meal"?

569
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,248
"Tata"?

570
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,586
Never seen raw meat make this way

571
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,838
Beef tartare

572
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,715
This dish has a long history

573
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,052
Are you mocking me?

574
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,553
How dare I?

575
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,060
Do you want me to eat this first?

576
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,646
That one is going to eat with this one

577
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,982
This dish must be mixed on the spot before tasting it

578
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,886
This is what is called "table service"

579
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,722
Appreciate the process of making food in front of you

580
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,349
It can also increase appetite

581
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,357
Please try it

582
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:54,902
Taste the meal

583
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:55,820
yes

584
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:14,839
Please try it

585
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,356
etc.

586
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,317
What does this taste like?

587
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,891
I have eaten raw meat before

588
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,268
But this taste is more plump and sweet

589
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,231
interesting

590
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:16,442
How to describe it?

591
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,945
Strong yet subtle

592
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,989
The taste never dissipates on the tip of the tongue

593
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,953
Next is "French Soup"

594
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:31,624
It is a thick porridge made of peas and milk

595
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,337
"Haishi soup"?

596
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,971
The color and fragrance are very curious

597
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:48,349
Your Highness, you think for food

598
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,643
Which is more important, taste or aroma?

599
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,811
Of course it tastes, right?

600
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,729
I think the aroma is more important

601
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,856
Why?

602
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,233
Taste of

603
00:37:57,316 --> 00:38:00,152
Only sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, salty

604
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,362
A total of five flavors

605
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,489
But the aroma is ever-changing

606
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,826
It makes sense

607
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,537
Yes Your Highness

608
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:11,956
Please use

609
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,968
This scent is not luxurious

610
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,096
But subtle and fresh

611
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,599
Refreshing taste

612
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:15,561
Like beans shining in the morning light

613
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,980
One by one, burst out from the pods

614
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:19,857
Yes?

615
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,692
Well said

616
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,569
Really exquisite

617
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:27,114
Then it's time for main course

618
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,370
The essence of high-end cuisine "meat main course"

619
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,206
(Viande: main course, meat dishes)

620
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,920
"Cake clean and bake"? "Meat main course"?

621
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,880
Really

622
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,423
What should I do with you?

623
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,473
I feel like you're mocking me again

624
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,642
Isn’t this just raw meat?

625
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,938
This is the deer tongue

626
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,815
Not eaten raw

627
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,067
I'll bake it for you here

628
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,075
Roast both sides slightly on charcoal fire

629
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:15,287
Not only can enhance the taste, but it also adds flavor and aroma

630
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,417
I have eaten deer meat from various methods

631
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,628
But this is unheard of

632
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:26,048
From ancient times to the present, deer symbolizes the king

633
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:29,218
His tongue is regarded as one of the eight treasures

634
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,011
It's a very rare ingredient

635
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,471
I didn't expect you to know this

636
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,641
So the struggle for the throne
It is called "Zhulu", right?

637
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:36,934
(Zhulu: Chasing the deer)

638
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,352
You're very smart

639
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:48,946
Her craftsmanship is far beyond this era

640
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:52,241
Where did this woman come from?

641
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:58,414
Unsatisfied desire for power Extreme narcissism

642
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,499
And a keen sense of taste

643
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,752
This is exactly what can satisfy all Yan Xijun's desires

644
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,546
The best meal

645
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,757
Who did you learn these skills from?

646
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,969
I know it's hard to believe

647
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,847
But I've said before that I'm from the future

648
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,640
What I said is true

649
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:24,482
You've been mentally ill so far. It's a pity

650
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,442
If you say you are from

651
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:29,111
A distant barbarian land or island, I will believe it

652
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,906
despite this

653
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,283
I am very satisfied...

654
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,454
The first meal you offered

655
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:43,209
At least you like my food. What a blessing

656
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,297
Your Highness, I'll try the poison

657
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,423
No need

658
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,344
Come and try this time

659
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,262
What? Am I?

660
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,603
OK Of course

661
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,087
(The deposed concubine Yan and Li Xian’s biological mother)

662
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,130
Come on, the prince will take a bite too

663
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,222
Very delicious Queen Mother

664
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:45,729
Come

665
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,774
Feed a bite to my wife

666
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,109
Why?

667
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,782
Are you saying that you want me to feed you?

668
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,367
Don't you want to?

669
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,495
No No

670
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,967
How do you see through my thoughts?

671
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,094
Um?

672
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,804
How did you know

673
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,349
Would I like this dish?

674
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,476
actually…

675
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,188
I've studied Yan Xijun

676
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,315
I also won the cooking contest with this dish

677
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:14,777
But I never thought I could make it for you to eat by myself

678
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,196
Very interesting

679
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:18,947
Yan Xijun?

680
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,700
You mentioned this name before

681
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,452
Who is this Yan Xijun?

682
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,914
Wait, it would be too dangerous

683
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,418
That's it...

684
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,671
I can't remember it now

685
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,387
Then change the question

686
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,349
Why do you want to make this dish?

687
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,517
Oh, that...

688
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,728
I thought about His Highness’s meal

689
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:53,857
I think I should try what the kings of other countries eat

690
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,236
In Europe, kings often eat such set meals

691
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:58,904
"Lotus porridge"?

692
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,116
Is that another name for the Southern Barbarians?

693
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,617
Southern Barbarians?

694
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:09,331
Is it called the Southern Barbarians in North Korea?

695
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,255
Go and report quickly

696
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,048
Can't go in now

697
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,091
What did you say?

698
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,717
How dare you stop the Empress?

699
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,969
Retreat

700
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:25,848
Empress, Your Highness is trying

701
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,724
Newly cooked dishes

702
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,351
No one is allowed to enter

703
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,407
No, mom

704
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,700
presumptuous!

705
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,577
Can you afford it?

706
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,705
-Empress, no
-Retreat!

707
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,290
Why is it so noisy outside?

708
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:53,208
I said no one was allowed to come in

709
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,922
Your Highness, I am Shuyuan

710
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,259
I have brought you precious paintings from the Ming Dynasty

711
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:06,138
But it seems that I came at the wrong time, so I took my leave first

712
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,934
That's so good. Get out

713
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,950
I'd better avoid it first

714
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:41,924
you…

715
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,595
Not an ordinary person

716
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:54,603
OK, but don't have to get your face so close

717
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,025
I...

718
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,570
You've been selected

719
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,531
What should I choose?

720
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,866
Why did you choose me? What to do?

721
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,469
Select me, is it...

722
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,972
No, what he said was that I would be grateful, right?

723
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,266
No, absolutely not

724
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:36,436
If I become the king's harem
Didn’t history change?

725
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,938
It's going crazy

726
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,773
What are you thinking? So stunning

727
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:52,661
I'll tell you to come, I'm going to tell you if I have something to do

728
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,871
Sure enough, the old routine of palace fighting dramas

729
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,081
Your Highness issued a clear order

730
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:57,874
All of them issued secret orders

731
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:02,004
-Tell me?
- When you serve His Highness in the future

732
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,673
Tell me everything I heard from His Highness

733
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,426
Want me to be your eyeliner for free?

734
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,972
IMHO, but to be honest, it's a bit difficult

735
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,724
You also know your highness's temper

736
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,934
If he finds it, everyone will be dead

737
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,185
And you see

738
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,854
I'm as timid as a mouse

739
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,816
Please forgive me. This is not for you

740
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,068
Don't you think you need an ally in the palace?

741
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,070
Of course, the more allies the better

742
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,698
Just when you served His Highness

743
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,950
Have Jiang Shuyuan been here?

744
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,201
Yes

745
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:36,455
His Highness drove her away for the sake of imperial meals

746
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,081
This is the first time

747
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,917
Naturally, Jiang Shuyuan will regard you as a thorn in her eyes in the future

748
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,002
Just for you

749
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,171
Then she will try every means to get rid of you

750
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,465
That is to say, if there is no arm help

751
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:49,051
You're here to be life-saving

752
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,471
That's right, it's too hard to survive

753
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,389
This guy has a strong insight

754
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,642
It's worthy of being a deal proposed by a top treacherous minister

755
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,186
I will support you in secret

756
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,605
I will protect you and help you survive in the palace

757
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:05,067
But I don't need any secret support

758
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,735
What I need is...

759
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:15,160
In this case, I have a condition

760
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,495
-condition?
-Yes

761
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,997
I need you to find something for me

762
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:23,585
If you can agree to me, I will consider your proposal

763
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,213
Do you want to negotiate with me now?

764
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,590
OK What are you looking for?

765
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,051
-"My shoulder bag"
- "Card bag"?

766
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,803
-Please holder bag
- "Card bag"?

767
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,388
That's that...

768
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:38,308
The one that can be hung on the shoulder and put things in it

769
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,852
What is it called in this era?

770
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,771
It looks like this

771
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:45,273
- Just call it a shoulder bag
-Shoulder bag

772
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,692
A bag that looks like this

773
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:47,943
burden!

774
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,278
Right

775
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,738
You mean your burden

776
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,782
Please help me find my baggage

777
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:58,620
The day I met Your Highness
It fell into the cliff of the Shaguling Forest

778
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:02,290
I want that bag to be intact

779
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,543
Nothing missing is possible

780
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,797
All you want is that baggage?

781
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,805
(Looking at the clouds)

782
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,311
OK, stop

783
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,397
Yes, ladies

784
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,941
How could Your Highness treat me like this?

785
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,359
That little one goes and asks Meng Shushou

786
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,695
Let him drive the ghost girl out of the water lazuli?

787
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,321
Any experienced person will neglect her

788
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,949
She can't hold on for a day

789
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,661
This idea is good

790
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,373
Can you guarantee that I will never see her again?

791
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,251
Yes, Empress, please leave it to Meng Shushou

792
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,183
Oh my God!

793
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,310
I've never eaten anything so delicious

794
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,061
Can't believe it

795
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,855
Demon woman!

796
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:13,528
I'm not in line with you

797
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,537
What's going on? Is the firewood wet?

798
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,999
Is this what everyone calls bullying?

799
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,126
Why are you so smoky?

800
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,297
Who made the kitchen messy?

801
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,298
Really

802
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,510
Is he wrong?

803
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,139
A snake! There is a snake!

804
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,809
-Jang Geum!
-What's wrong? What happened?

805
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,522
You are a sneaky little thing, I've caught you

806
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,981
Look at that snake!

807
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:54,069
It's really strange after a woman entered the water ramen

808
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,197
Ouch I'm so tired

809
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,660
What's this?

810
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,623
No! It's a cockroach!

811
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,792
Calm down, I'll deal with it

812
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,837
Where did it come out?

813
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:16,049
What to watch?

814
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,802
Oh my God, these people are crazy!

815
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,348
It seems you're exhausted again today

816
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:24,808
-yes
-Um

817
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:40,699
Xu Changjin

818
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:45,829
I'm more comfortable staying here

819
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,247
Feel like being at home

820
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,124
I really hope your highness

821
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:53,295
Let's stay here all day

822
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,839
Things will improve tomorrow

823
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,091
to be honest

824
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:00,802
I really hope it won't come tomorrow

825
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,681
The experienced players here are even more vicious than I thought

826
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,182
Their methods are really extraordinary

827
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:09,060
Why don’t I go directly to complain to His Highness?

828
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,229
They're probably going to die

829
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,566
Your Highness!

830
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,284
you're right

831
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:25,869
That would be messy

832
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,580
That's wrong

833
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,545
(Corning Palace)

834
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,019
Your Highness

835
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,230
All the Lords are asking for a visit

836
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,281
What are these?

837
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,075
Your Highness, I'm sorry for your words

838
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,493
It was the resignation submitted by the ministers

839
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,702
What?

840
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,039
What is the reason?

841
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,708
They are about your absence from the food delivery

842
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:17,420
And the exile of the Hong family of the Gyeonggi Superintendent

843
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,590
Punish a traitor who commits the crime of deceiving the king

844
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,051
Is there any problem?

845
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,010
Not so

846
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,304
Since Secretary Hong has been exiled for the crime of great rebellion

847
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,473
The ghost girl also committed a crime of great rebellion

848
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,934
They filed a memorial request to be sentenced to death

849
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:36,272
When will the sinner be punished? It is up to me to decide

850
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,825
Setting up a car hall

851
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,702
Meal

852
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,248
Bring Yan Zhiyong to the palace

853
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,708
Yes Your Highness

854
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:58,753
-Your Highness
-Your Highness

855
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:02,590
- Please check with Your Highness
- Please check with Your Highness

856
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,259
Your Highness

857
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:09,139
If the Gyeonggi Superintendent Hong Jingda was exiled for offending you

858
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,266
That's what the ghost girl

859
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:14,853
Arrested for the crime of treason and should be sentenced to death

860
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:19,607
Not only did the sinner not be severely punished

861
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,693
Instead, it was sent to the water lamb

862
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:24,029
This is too unfair

863
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:25,697
Enough

864
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,868
I don't want to listen anymore

865
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:32,579
That treacherous woman to survive

866
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:35,248
He deceived the Lord His Highness and Hong Jingda

867
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:38,752
This series of events has caused

868
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,755
You guys are really too much

869
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,132
You think your highness

870
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:47,427
Was it the exile of Hong Jingda for a mere ghost girl?

871
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:52,057
Do you really don’t understand the profound meaning of Your Highness?

872
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,518
How dare you offend His Highness for someone

873
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:59,272
The traitor submitted a memorial to ask for his order, which is really a great shame and humiliation

874
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,608
The ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the

875
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:06,321
The two adults said as if they knew the holy heart deeply

876
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:12,285
What a beautiful scenery

877
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:13,661
Your Highness

878
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,873
Please ask Your Highness to execute the ghost girl who humiliated Your Highness

879
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,667
Please take back the Hong Jingda Observation Envoy

880
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:20,919
The punishment of exile

881
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:24,130
- Please ask your Highness to agree
- Please ask your Highness to agree

882
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,467
You want a puppet

883
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:29,511
King?

884
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,475
Answer me!

885
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,561
The one who humiliated and offended the man

886
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,981
Do you want me to let him go?

887
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:57,413
OK

888
00:56:58,331 --> 00:56:59,207
very good

889
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:02,043
Then I gave my will

890
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,216
Your Highness

891
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:12,053
We have brought Yan Zhiyong from the water lava

892
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,727
well done

893
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:20,645
yes

894
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,147
I follow the instructions of the empress

895
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,941
Rumors were rumored that Hong Jingda was exiled

896
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,401
It's all because of that ghost girl

897
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:30,238
Rumors spread throughout the palace at once

898
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:31,489
well done

899
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:35,577
That ghost girl hasn't lived long too

900
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,120
Your Highness

901
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:40,081
Please punish this ghost girl with a terrible punishment

902
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,958
Punish the Chaotong

903
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:45,378
-Requests Your Highness to purify the court's guild
-Requests Your Highness to purify the court's guild

904
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,219
All the ministers listen to the order

905
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,722
last night

906
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,266
This woman offered strange food

907
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,934
Disturbing my mind

908
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,527
Therefore

909
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:11,696
She will immediately...

910
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,291
Be on the job and be familiar with it!

911
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,001
Why?

912
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:28,671
-What to be familiar with?
-When you can get familiar with it?

913
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:30,798
What?

914
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,511
Starting today

915
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,888
You have to prepare meals for me every day. No mistakes are allowed

916
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,348
but

917
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,475
If your dishes are repeated

918
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,061
Or it may not be in line with my wishes

919
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,563
I will give you a death

920
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:53,112
A cunning Jiang Shuyuan is not enough

921
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,114
Now I favor a ghost girl of unknown origin.

922
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,534
Holding that woman in her palm

923
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,744
We must get rid of her as soon as possible

924
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:05,583
The Prince Renzhu will not sit idly by

925
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,964
This is to eradicate the great prince and the concubine

926
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,049
Good opportunity for the Han clan

927
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:16,553
But the Lord brought a woman of unknown origin

928
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,764
We'll drive her out anyway

929
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,849
The Lord will understand soon

930
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,018
The king is addicted to female sex

931
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,354
How much turmoil will it bring to the country

932
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,403
Please forgive me, my mother

933
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,029
I didn't expect it to be like this

934
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:38,116
Your Highness personally appointed her as a skilled worker

935
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,159
I'm not convenient to interfere now

936
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,834
It seems

937
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:50,837
I have to rely on the power of others

938
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:53,423
(Ciqing Hall)

939
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:56,259
I didn't expect you, Jiang Shuyuan, to come

940
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,219
I really can see anything after living for a long time

941
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,887
Forgive the guilty concubine

942
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,849
I will come to see you often in the future

943
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,684
You've been here specially

944
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,145
I guess something is wrong

945
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,646
Let's talk about it. What's the matter?

946
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,398
To be honest with you

947
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,109
I am here for the ghost girl

948
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:14,861
Demon woman?

949
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,613
Yes, the princess

950
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:20,241
The one who confuses His Highness's mind
Cunning girl, relying on her cooking skills

951
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,286
Appointed as a skilled person

952
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,455
She's also a trick

953
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:30,126
What the hell are you trying to say?

954
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,462
She appeared on the eclipse

955
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,255
And the day she appeared

956
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:37,967
The Lord was also shot by the assassin

957
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:38,885
What?

958
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,387
The Lord was shot?

959
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,058
Why didn’t you report to Yu Ai’s family earlier?

960
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,727
It is the Lord who ordered the minister to keep silent

961
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,063
I dare not speak

962
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,314
only

963
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:54,692
Seeing that His Highness wanted to make her a skilled worker

964
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,611
I really can't sit still

965
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:59,280
Then came to pay homage to the great princess

966
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:03,826
No one knows the origin and background of the woman

967
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:07,705
The Ai family also has a grudge against her

968
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:11,000
But the Ai family has no right to interfere in the water laid.

969
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,960
What the Empress said is

970
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:16,673
So not

971
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:20,343
It's up to you, Queen Mother
How about the craftsmanship of that ghost girl in person?

972
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:21,886
Take her test?

973
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,847
This is a good idea

974
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:29,060
If you get the exam, that ghost girl
I found that she was really as skillful as rumored

975
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:31,396
It can block the court officials' leisurely mouths

976
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:35,108
If the name is not worthy of it, you can take the opportunity to expel her from the palace

977
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,071
Ai's family has heard of it a long time ago

978
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:43,700
That ghost girl's cooking skills are extraordinary

979
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,452
Just want to see how great she is

980
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:51,582
Please order the Queen and Queen Mother.

981
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:57,422
I'll prepare the necessary things now

982
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,139
You'll live here in the future

983
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,359
Miss

984
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,361
There is a wall

985
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,780
Oh my God, this is a serious wall

986
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,660
Jang Geum is warm

987
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:32,832
Is that one over there our bedding?

988
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,083
oops!

989
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:36,669
-I'll take a look
-Oh My God

990
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:39,839
It's our bedding!

991
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:43,259
Thank you for your hard work

992
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:47,638
Although a lot of things have happened
But you ended up being a skilled person

993
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,140
It's like a dream

994
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:52,477
Anyway, I finally have a decent place to live

995
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,061
It's so awesome!

996
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:58,483
Can we actually enjoy this kind of blessing?

997
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,402
Miss!

998
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:07,909
To be honest, I really couldn't hold on just now

999
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,745
Me too

1000
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:13,539
Why did we meet that damn tyrant?

1001
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:15,541
Miss

1002
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,336
Didn’t you promise me to be cautious in your words and actions?

1003
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:20,046
It doesn't matter

1004
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,632
There is a wall, no one can hear it

1005
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:23,883
Inaudible

1006
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,761
Right, there is a wall

1007
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:31,307
-Oh My God
-Proficiency hands

1008
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,642
Come out

1009
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:39,565
Hello

1010
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,276
May you be well

1011
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,863
Congratulations on becoming a skilled person

1012
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:51,244
Please put on this dress and go to the Shuila room from tomorrow.

1013
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,411
clothes?

1014
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,247
Let me see

1015
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,545
Oh, this is silk

1016
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:03,714
It's so beautiful and gorgeous

1017
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:06,968
This is the uniform of a mature woman, right?

1018
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:09,053
When did you customize this?

1019
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:11,514
Then see you tomorrow

1020
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:13,975
Thank you, sir

1021
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:15,226
Thank you too, Nei Guan Yin

1022
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,562
Thank you very much

1023
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,772
Miss, let me get it

1024
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,691
-let's go
-It's really suitable for you

1025
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:23,776
-Is this how you wear it?
-Yes

1026
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,365
She doesn't look so mentally

1027
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:30,825
Is it really okay?

1028
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,285
Be careful when speaking

1029
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,453
How many years have you been an internal official?

1030
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,164
-Don't talk nonsense
-Yes

1031
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:42,086
There are so many palaces and people in the water lazuli

1032
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:45,089
-How can a woman be treated as a familiar person?
- Enough

1033
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:47,717
Haven't you heard that it's Your Highness

1034
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,802
Do you want a woman to be a familiar one?

1035
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,220
Having said that

1036
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:55,641
But I can't watch
The rules between our water latrines are messy

1037
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,560
Then what do you want to do?

1038
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,063
Since she can't be driven away

1039
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:05,484
Then she has to let herself retreat if she meets the difficulties

1040
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:26,088
I can be an insider in the water la

1041
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,007
Really got what I wish

1042
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:31,093
Yes, it's always the most exciting thing to be a part of the first day

1043
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:35,473
Can work in the kitchen in the palace
It doesn't seem that bad either

1044
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:37,725
Is it really okay, Miss?

1045
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:40,937
If it's those bad-minded skilled people
Are you bullying or excluding you again?

1046
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,772
What should we do?

1047
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:45,191
Not my territory before

1048
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:48,069
don’t worry

1049
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:50,279
Now I won't let them mercy

1050
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,204
Are the salt and flour mixed?

1051
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,957
I'm doing it now

1052
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:06,671
Meng Shushou Where is the knife?

1053
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:09,131
I used a whetstone to sharpen the blades all the time

1054
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,592
Now I can't even cut the tofu

1055
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,219
here you go

1056
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,389
Hide all the aged sauce in the back

1057
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,431
Yes, a master of Yan!

1058
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:21,435
Put all the best meat!

1059
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:22,937
-Yes Yan’s mature hands!
-Yes Yan’s mature hands!

1060
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:35,533
Have met Lord Cheng and Lord Yin Neiguan

1061
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,661
I guess you all heard about it

1062
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:41,455
This is the new one who is waiting for the right to be acquainted

1063
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,958
Your Highness personally ordered

1064
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:47,920
Hello everyone

1065
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,048
Although I've seen it before, I want to introduce myself formally

1066
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:52,758
My name is Yan Zhiyong

1067
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:58,806
This is Xu Changjin, who is responsible for assisting me

1068
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:01,392
Please give me some advice in the future

1069
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:06,188
Then I won't bother you

1070
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,607
Diet must be prepared on time

1071
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,192
Yes, adults

1072
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,487
-Go slow
-Go slow

1073
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:28,502
I don't know a woman like you

1074
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:31,589
Why is it that you should become a skilled person?

1075
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:34,592
But do you know how important the responsibility for this position is?

1076
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:36,677
There are 195 people in the water lane rotation in one time

1077
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:39,889
Two shifts fell down, and there were 390 people in total

1078
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:43,059
You have to lead them without any mistakes

1079
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,936
This is the responsibility of a sixth-grade expert

1080
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:49,273
In other words, it is the responsibility of waiting for the skilled person

1081
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:53,402
Very good eloquence, I heard it

1082
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,573
Having said that, three hundred and ninety people?

1083
01:07:57,656 --> 01:08:01,660
This is more than the back kitchens in top hotels

1084
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,746
It's really amazing

1085
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,748
"Wine point"?

1086
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:06,791
What is that?

1087
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:10,836
Anyway, novices like you

1088
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,047
Can't take on this heavy responsibility

1089
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:16,175
Before you make a big disaster and get humiliated...

1090
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,219
-Right leave quickly...
-Wait a moment

1091
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:24,558
Who is the highest position here?

1092
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:26,310
Who could it be?

1093
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:32,066
In addition to me, I'm a skilled person

1094
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:35,694
It's me

1095
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,572
I am Chief Yan's expert

1096
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:42,701
Before you came, I was always in charge of Your Highness’s meal

1097
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,329
Oh, it turns out he is a master Yan

1098
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:48,999
So…

1099
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:53,420
I am Meng Shushou, mainly responsible for side dishes

1100
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:58,676
I'm Shen Shushou

1101
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:01,887
Responsible for managing the heat and seasoning

1102
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:05,766
I'm responsible for preparing

1103
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,017
-rice…
-alright!

1104
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:08,853
Since all the introductions have been completed

1105
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:11,647
Then let's start preparing royal meals

1106
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,694
What was she saying?

1107
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:22,449
If the meal is delayed, Your Highness will be furious

1108
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:23,826
You all know your highness’s temper, right?

1109
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,745
What?

1110
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,664
Then what are you going to do?

1111
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:33,294
You are a skilled person
Please do your duty and give us instructions!

1112
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:35,546
How many dishes do you need to prepare? What are you preparing for?

1113
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:37,047
What meat should be put in the soup

1114
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,758
-What should I use for five-sided color ingredients...
-Oh, really

1115
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,886
How can I understand the matter between water latrines?

1116
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,220
I'm just

1117
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:47,057
His Highness came here

1118
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,475
What the hell is she talking about?

1119
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:49,685
Just do it normally

1120
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:53,564
Can’t both Yan Shushou and Meng Shushou handle it well?

1121
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:59,195
Of course, the responsibility is also borne by both of you

1122
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:00,279
I won't interfere

1123
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:03,199
What ridiculous words are this?

1124
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:06,493
We're not going to be familiar
Why do we have to be responsible?

1125
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:10,456
I've told Your Highness a long time ago

1126
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:12,666
Say I can't do anything for the time being

1127
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:15,502
Just watch from the side

1128
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,724
If all she said is true

1129
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:30,392
Then I'll be dead today

1130
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,978
Your Highness can't allow this to happen

1131
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,439
But she doesn't look like she is lying

1132
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:43,280
-Min Shushou Sharpen the knife quickly!
-Yes Here comes!

1133
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:45,074
Go and get the meat for soup!

1134
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:47,576
-Try the best meat!
-I'll go now!

1135
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:48,494
hurry up

1136
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:52,998
quick! Where is the sauce we hide?

1137
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,417
Miss is so awesome! Very awesome!

1138
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:58,087
here you go

1139
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,674
I've seen a lot of tricks like this

1140
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,050
It's useless to me

1141
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,762
Jin Palace Why are you here?

1142
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,225
-Get out of the way!
-yes

1143
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:13,811
Promiscuous hands

1144
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:17,982
What's up?

1145
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:20,442
The Queen Princess wants to see you

1146
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,528
The Great Queen's daughter?

1147
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,156
Why did she meet me?

1148
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:38,377
What's going on with this terrible sense of oppression?

1149
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:43,424
You are the one who brought him into the palace and was appointed as a skilled person.

1150
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:44,967
That ghost girl?

1151
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:52,266
I'm not a ghost girl

1152
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:54,977
Just from a very far place

1153
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:56,687
The Ai family said straight to the point

1154
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:58,647
As His Highness's grandmother

1155
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,984
Ai's family calls you to come
I want to confirm whether your skills are true

1156
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,278
Confirm the craft?

1157
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:07,948
If you use some tricks to confuse Your Highness's taste

1158
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:10,659
You have to pay the price

1159
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:14,872
Really, what's the price this time?

1160
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,124
grandmother

1161
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,170
I mean...

1162
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:23,172
The Great Queen's Daughter

1163
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:25,674
What price should we pay?

1164
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:29,595
Use words to deceive the king, and you should pull out your tongue

1165
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,597
Deceiving the King with food

1166
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:33,057
He wants to cut off one arm

1167
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:34,725
What?

1168
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,811
that

1169
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,813
So how do you test my skills?

1170
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:44,568
Ai Family will let you compete with the chief expert

1171
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:45,486
You can do it yourself

1172
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:50,032
You mean you want me to bet on this one
As a chef's fundamental arm...

1173
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:53,160
Just for this competition?

1174
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:56,288
It seems you understand

1175
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,624
If you want to keep your arm

1176
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,918
Just use your cooking skills to convince the Ai family

1177
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:03,629
That's right, just do it

1178
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:07,383
Why do I do this?

1179
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:09,343
Why?

1180
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:15,224
If you have the ability, you can get out

1181
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:17,559
It's you

1182
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:19,269
It's the plan you set, right?

1183
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,688
Anyway, I broke one of my arms
It's nothing to you, right?

1184
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:24,358
I'm not satisfied with just one arm

1185
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:27,528
Jiang Mozhu

1186
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:30,447
I'm really finished now

1187
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:34,410
You received the Hongwenguan School

1188
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:35,744
What is the news from Li Zangjun?

1189
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:37,162
Yes, Your Highness

1190
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:45,379
I have obtained the Shicao

1191
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:47,131
Come to see you at the hour of Hai tonight

1192
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:49,758
He found Shi Cao

1193
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:53,720
I can finally find out the truth about my mother's death

1194
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:57,808
Your Highness, everyone is responsible for the order

1195
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,272
Come in

1196
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:15,242
What's the matter?

1197
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:17,995
The Queen of the King and the Queen Mother summoned the Master of Marry

1198
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:18,954
Why?

1199
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:23,500
The Empress wants to try the craftsmanship of the ghost girl

1200
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:27,254
The Empress has always had a bad appetite and is picky in her diet

1201
01:14:27,337 --> 01:14:30,674
But want to try her skills?

1202
01:14:30,757 --> 01:14:32,759
She will compete with the chief expert

1203
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:35,137
The Queen and the Queen Mother also ordered that if she loses the competition

1204
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,431
Then he would cut off his arm for the crime of deceiving the king

1205
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:38,599
What? Broken arm?

1206
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:43,520
What the hell is going on?

1207
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:46,106
I heard that Empress Jiang Shuyuan was also present at that time

1208
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:48,233
Jiang Shuyuan?

1209
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:09,296
- Everything should be ready
-Yes

1210
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:22,309
Even if you give it a try, it's just in vain

1211
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,355
The princess doesn't like food at all

1212
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:29,441
The only thing the Empress likes is...

1213
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:39,409
Your Highness is here!

1214
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:35,424
How are my grandmother doing now?

1215
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:36,883
Lord

1216
01:16:38,051 --> 01:16:40,095
Haven't seen each other for a long time

1217
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:42,472
The Ai family heard that the ghost girl became a familiar player.

1218
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:44,558
Prepare this competition

1219
01:16:45,058 --> 01:16:46,435
Do Your Highness want to watch it together?

1220
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:47,644
OK

1221
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,480
I heard that my grandmother held this competition

1222
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:52,608
It's to take away the ghost girl's arm

1223
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:57,404
It seems that your highness cherishes her very much

1224
01:16:58,905 --> 01:17:03,118
For her, she came to confront the Ai family...

1225
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:05,912
It was my grandmother who crossed the line first

1226
01:17:06,496 --> 01:17:07,831
She is a familiar person

1227
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:09,374
That is, my people

1228
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:13,128
As long as she wins the competition, wouldn't it be fine

1229
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:15,964
Then everything will end successfully

1230
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:19,176
The Ai family heard that all the ministers opposed it

1231
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:21,887
Your Highness appointed her as a skilled worker

1232
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:25,891
Your Highness must also know if he doesn't take some action

1233
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:28,018
Their dissatisfaction will not calm down

1234
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:29,811
Since that's the case

1235
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:33,273
Then if other experienced players lose
Do you have to hand over your arms?

1236
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:38,070
Other skilled players have long been recognized by the palace

1237
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:40,030
How can we compare

1238
01:17:40,113 --> 01:17:43,450
How boring that is grandma?

1239
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:46,912
As you said, as long as you win, it's good

1240
01:17:47,537 --> 01:17:49,956
The rules should be fair

1241
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:54,753
All for me

1242
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:58,006
In addition to the winning expert today

1243
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,008
The rest of the people have to offer an arm

1244
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:03,845
Do you understand?

1245
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:05,138
-Yes Your Highness
-Yes Your Highness

1246
01:18:09,142 --> 01:18:10,268
Take the guillotine up

1247
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,585
I really want to go home

1248
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,212
dad

1249
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:39,589
I want to go back!

1250
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:41,675
All right

1251
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,761
Let's start the competition

1252
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:58,775
No choice

1253
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:01,069
All I can do now is prove myself

1254
01:19:02,779 --> 01:19:04,030
Demon woman

1255
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:06,366
If you really come from the future

1256
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:08,285
Let them see

1257
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:12,330
A new dish that only you can make

1258
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:38,774
"The Tyrant's Chef"

1259
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:41,943
The theme of the competition is...

1260
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:43,737
It's cursive

1261
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:45,906
filial piety?

1262
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:48,992
I'll never lose

1263
01:19:49,075 --> 01:19:50,035
Let go!

1264
01:19:52,537 --> 01:19:54,664
I heard that this competition was proposed by you

1265
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:55,957
I'll get something and come back soon!

1266
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:59,377
Now is not the time for you to protect that ghost girl

1267
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,505
The residence!

1268
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:04,132
There is no personal relationship between you and Your Highness

1269
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:07,010
-Open your mouth
-I hope your Highness will like it

1270
01:20:07,093 --> 01:20:08,011
Your "smile"

1271
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:16,812
Subtitle translation: Learn
