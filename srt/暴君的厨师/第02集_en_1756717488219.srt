00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,966
"The Tyrant's Chef"

2
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:51,968
Hey someone there

3
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,722
here! We are here!

4
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,015
Who is below?

5
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,516
-We are here...
-Miss!

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,684
how…

7
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,480
Why stop me? Jang Geum?

8
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,439
Picking red

9
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,316
What?

10
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,109
Picking red!

11
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,611
(Caihong: I collected beauties and horses for Yan Xijun)

12
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:16,451
Wait. Is that just Caihong?

13
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,452
Yes

14
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,704
We might be caught, too

15
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,206
So come with me quickly

16
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,000
Too irritating

17
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,461
I finally avoided it

18
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,505
Never be caught just like that

19
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,715
Where do you want to run?

20
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,887
(Xu Changjin, a girl with an extraordinary sense of smell)

21
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,722
This is a kidnapping!

22
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,352
This is a crime! Let us out quickly!

23
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,062
-Miss!
-Be quiet!

24
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:48,066
-Uncle!
-Stop calling, no use, it's useless

25
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,235
Do you want me to stay like this?

26
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,445
What exactly is this?

27
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,947
The prison of the camp

28
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,199
We were caught because of Caihong

29
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,661
It's really outrageous!

30
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,955
You guys, be quiet

31
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,916
Can't you see where this is?

32
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,752
Who would be arrested in such a place

33
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,295
-That's it
-yes

34
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,755
If you quarrel again

35
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,174
I'll sew your mouth up

36
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,635
After all, it was caught for Caihong

37
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,264
No

38
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,392
This is too irritating

39
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:23,977
It's so irritating

40
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,272
Why do you keep saying it’s too irritating?

41
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:34,320
This prison looks the same as that in the folk village...

42
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,992
And everyone is wearing Korean clothes

43
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,078
Too strange

44
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,539
Everything is so weird

45
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,916
What's going on...

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,628
I won't really travel to North Korea, right?

47
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,838
How is that possible?

48
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,298
Miss

49
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:57,552
Even if the sky falls, there is a way to escape

50
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,555
We have to cheer up

51
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,308
So here...

52
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,561
It's North Korea, right?

53
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,813
How many more times do you want me to say it?

54
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,319
-Open the door quickly!
-Miss!

55
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,321
-Uncle!
-What's the quarrel?

56
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,197
Quiet!

57
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,575
I'm not a person here please let me go!

58
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,120
oops! What do you want to do to her?

59
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,872
what to do? Help!

60
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,626
Let me go! don't want!

61
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,295
Hello!

62
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,546
Hello!

63
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,423
Hello!

64
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,803
-Yes, you guys...
-Help!

65
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,647
It seems to be true, I've really traveled through time

66
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,234
Is this a fantasy novel?
How could this happen

67
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,526
Too amazing!

68
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,820
Ms. Yeon Jiyong from South Korea!

69
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,573
congratulations! Please come up!

70
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:04,452
I'm going to be a chef at a Michelin three-star restaurant!

71
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,746
Good job, Dad is so proud of you

72
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,207
(dad…)

73
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:14,295
(I just got the opportunity to be a chef...)

74
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,508
(How could this happen?)

75
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,718
(Why?)

76
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,221
Ah, so hot! "Looking at the Clouds"?

77
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,472
What?

78
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,809
I'm right here!

79
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,394
Who are you? Are you a human or a ghost?

80
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,187
A traitor?

81
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,983
If this is really the Korean era

82
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,527
And what he said is true...

83
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,820
It seems you finally understand

84
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,154
I am the king of this country

85
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,239
Is this a dragon?

86
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,365
OK

87
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,034
When we return to the palace

88
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,037
I will give my grace

89
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,082
What kind of grace is brought down?

90
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,042
He is really the king?

91
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,377
Everything on this land is owned by me

92
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,837
The royal family members do not know each other

93
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,755
Who is Yan Xijun?

94
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,258
Could it be that he is Yan Xijun?

95
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,562
Anyway, I have to go out here first

96
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,064
Find a way to go back after you go out

97
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,733
What happened?

98
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,484
go out

99
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,694
-What?
-What did you say?

100
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,282
Where are you going?

101
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,993
Where are you going?

102
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,370
Adult What do you think?

103
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,123
-left
-Go to the left

104
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,958
Come here and stand in front of us

105
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,296
-High your head How old are you?
-Twenty years old

106
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,674
-Jang Geum What are they doing?
-left

107
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:46,345
It seems they want to divide the women into two teams

108
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,639
It seems that Caihong envoy is coming

109
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,266
Picking red messenger?

110
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,727
You mean I want to be the king's woman?

111
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,187
That's not sure

112
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,690
It's not just selected to be a part of it

113
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,568
It's going crazy

114
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,487
A disaster comes

115
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,990
Miss This is a disaster for all of us

116
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,992
I did not mean that

117
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,620
I'm not a person here!

118
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,247
Do you think that if you are not here, you can avoid Caihong?

119
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,707
That's not what it means

120
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,666
Next

121
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,588
Why are you standing there? Come forward

122
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,256
Come here soon

123
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,884
How old are you?

124
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,220
I'm twenty-seven

125
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,682
left

126
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,977
- Too old
-Why?

127
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,397
-He said you're too old
-Next

128
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,067
Come forward

129
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,155
What are you doing when you are stunned?

130
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,700
I'm thirty years old this year

131
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,081
What a courage! Dare to lie

132
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,834
Looks like he is only seventeen years old

133
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,213
Then...what is the age of twenty-eight?

134
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,214
left

135
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:05,925
Next

136
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,009
Go to the left

137
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,137
hurry up

138
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,267
Jang Geum

139
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,686
Although I breathed a sigh of relief, I always felt...

140
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,313
I feel a little uncomfortable

141
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,610
The person on the right goes to the Bietang to dress up

142
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,987
The person on the left

143
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,573
Things to go to the kitchen to prepare for guests

144
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,657
-yes
-yes

145
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,200
“Zenbo”?

146
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,422
Your Highness discovered this by the stream

147
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,387
Ouch, my whole body hurts

148
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,183
What an inexplicable day

149
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,434
(Lee Xian, the King of Korea)

150
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,685
Are there any other clues?

151
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,978
Judging from the footprints of the guard

152
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,730
It seems to have been taken to the Gyeonggi Supervisory Camp

153
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,442
Got into the trap

154
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,359
Let's go

155
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,819
yes

156
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,446
Go to Jingji Supervisory Camp!

157
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,989
-yes!
-yes!

158
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:17,413
Chapter 2: Fertilizer Treatment

159
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,165
Move quickly

160
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,797
This is exactly the same as what I saw in a TV series

161
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,094
This is a real bronze ware

162
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,973
-This is soy sauce
-"Jiangyou"?

163
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,392
Very rich in taste

164
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,769
Is this vinegar?

165
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,063
-It seems to be jealous
-Oh my God

166
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,400
This is called "Tuanji"

167
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,528
It is a basket for cereals or vegetables

168
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,862
"Tuanji"

169
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,450
Cast iron brazier

170
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,078
Used for barbecue or fish

171
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,496
This is quite rare

172
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,039
There is also a grill

173
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,542
-We call this "roasted iron"
-"Roiled iron"

174
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,459
(Roil iron: a tool for making fish and meat)

175
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,586
That's a sharp knife

176
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,712
(Stock-tip knife: a knife that looks like the tip of a foot sock)

177
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,340
The tip of the knife is really upturned and very sharp

178
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,677
Oh my God, do you still want to cook if you haven't seen anything?

179
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,138
What are you two girls doing?

180
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,265
What are you touching?

181
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,892
- "Touch and rub"?
- Work quickly!

182
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,144
OK Sorry

183
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,813
Miss, let's work soon

184
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,483
-We should...
-Jang Geum

185
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,237
It's useless to dry quickly

186
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,239
What does this mean?

187
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,664
What dish are you cooking?

188
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,708
Is this still necessary to ask?

189
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,627
Look at this slippery, I'm cooking kelp soup

190
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,136
How are you cutting carrots?

191
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,054
-Cooking carrot soup
-What?

192
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,599
But she was cooking kelp soup over there

193
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,268
-What?
-It's really nonsense

194
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,939
Who made you do whatever you want?

195
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,358
If we knew this would still happen?

196
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,278
The servants in the kitchen fled last night

197
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,405
Why did they escape?

198
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,324
How could I know

199
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,701
Is that important?

200
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,370
Are you planning to just stand and be lazy?

201
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,583
We have to know at least who we are cooking for.

202
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,002
Does anyone know something?

203
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,795
Do you know?

204
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,963
And you?

205
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,173
have no idea

206
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,354
-The buds are quite fresh
-yes

207
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,230
Miss

208
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,359
There are not many ingredients left

209
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,654
But the rest is quite fresh

210
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,532
You're right, don't look like you're not ready

211
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,410
Ingredients disappeared

212
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,704
It seems like someone has run away

213
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,622
What?

214
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,211
Everyone comes here

215
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,841
It seems that everyone is working very hard

216
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,053
A noble man has come to Hanyang

217
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,723
If I couldn't prepare the nine-vegetarian rice bed for the meal

218
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,933
You're going to be in trouble

219
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,936
So I can do my best to prepare my meal

220
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,439
This is simply crazy

221
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,525
I only know how to make soy soup

222
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,318
But now I have to make a nine-catered rice bed?

223
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,362
Wait, uncle

224
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:37,863
What to do?

225
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,742
Take the liberty to ask why we need to prepare?

226
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,536
You were not selected when you were picking red

227
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,330
Then we should be letting us home

228
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,250
You were arrested here

229
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,335
No permission is allowed to leave without permission

230
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,170
But we did not commit any crime

231
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,922
How dare you, a girl, talk back to me?

232
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,966
Do you have to try the board before you are willing to be obedient?

233
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,970
Miss, stop talking

234
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,684
Then if we do it well

235
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,436
Will you let us go?

236
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,063
If you can prepare decent meals, maybe

237
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:12,982
All right

238
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,276
How old is the visiting noble person this year?

239
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,820
What? How old is it?

240
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,823
What foods do they like? meat? Or seafood?

241
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:21,782
allergy…

242
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,827
-Are you avoiding any food?
-Where do I know?

243
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,413
Stop talking, go to work quickly!

244
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,415
etc.

245
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:33,335
Cooking food is different from cooking something

246
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,087
Not something that can be done casually

247
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,799
Do you want me to ask all the details clearly?

248
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,384
Didn't you say you were a distinguished guest

249
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,719
Do you have to deal with it casually?

250
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,347
The essence of cooking is to integrate your heart

251
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,725
Really

252
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,226
Who are you?

253
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,027
I'm not the one here

254
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,195
I'm a chef...

255
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,780
No, I'm a chef

256
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,116
If you know nothing about diners

257
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,160
I can't make decent dishes

258
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,828
You're really unrestrained

259
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,456
How dare you find such an excuse?

260
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,624
This is not an excuse

261
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,628
This is the first time people here enter this kitchen

262
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,505
There is not much left in the ingredients

263
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,465
What happens if you cook the wrong dish?

264
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,759
You don't want to see that, do you?

265
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,350
What you said...

266
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,186
That's right

267
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,939
-Oh my God
-Transpare your life

268
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,649
Then what do you think should be done?

269
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,901
I need to know what the diners taste

270
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,694
Age and identity

271
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,820
Just know these

272
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,239
You can do it within the specified time

273
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,783
Make a dish that satisfies them?

274
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,702
Whether the dish matches the appetite or not depends on the diners

275
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,079
But I have confidence

276
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,540
Is it the same even if the ingredients are insufficient?

277
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,668
Even so, as long as the dishes match the taste of diners

278
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,003
With sincerity, it's OK

279
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,548
The best ingredients

280
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,926
Not sure to make the best dishes

281
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,388
Ouch Miss

282
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,350
All right

283
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:15,020
But you have to be responsible for what you say

284
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,023
You may lose your life by taking a wrong step

285
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,401
My life?

286
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,196
Then I have a condition, too

287
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,614
condition?

288
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,909
If diners are satisfied with my dishes

289
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,411
I hope you

290
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,247
Let us all go tonight

291
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,915
All right

292
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,001
Come with me

293
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,465
Listen well

294
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,050
Today's guest

295
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,178
It is the Ren father and son who are powerful in the court and the country

296
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,848
The father is the judge of the worker Cao Shen, Ren Ruihong

297
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,850
He has been an official for a long time since the time of the former kings

298
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,560
He held many important positions

299
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,520
His son is the Lord of the Imperial Respect

300
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,565
He is the Lord of the present
The half-sister Huishu's ritual

301
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,109
(Yibin: The husband of the husband)

302
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,235
No outsourcing is allowed!

303
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,778
Ren Songzai was once the prince's child

304
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:08,157
He and the Lord are close friends who grew up together.

305
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,241
Stop, Ren Songzai!

306
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,492
Come up!

307
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,912
Get out of the way idiot

308
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,914
They ruined countless families

309
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,166
The excuse is called picking red

310
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,421
Tap!

311
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,090
They are particularly picky about "receiving guests".

312
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,092
That is, the so-called hospitality banquet

313
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,220
Even if you serve the delicacies

314
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,431
They can always pick their own secrets in the eggs, too

315
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,599
What's this?

316
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,145
Once they are targeted

317
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,022
You have to pay a huge bribe

318
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,316
If you can't afford it

319
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,443
It's very likely to be tortured

320
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,406
Is this answer enough?

321
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,785
What? They dare to pick on the food they receive?

322
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,912
What a bunch of bastards, right?

323
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,749
I want them to know

324
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,835
The end of joking about food

325
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,629
Prepare the amount of four servings

326
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,172
Go quickly

327
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,173
yes

328
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,051
Don't forget our agreement

329
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,112
OK, everyone comes here

330
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,072
-What's wrong?
-What happened again?

331
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,449
Thank you for speaking for us

332
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,702
-It's so awesome
-well done

333
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,496
Nothing we have to go out alive

334
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,875
We want to cook for very picky guests

335
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,419
And make four

336
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,172
There is not much time, we have to decide what to do first

337
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,174
Are you willing to obey my command?

338
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,469
Of course, it's a fight

339
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,763
Don't worry

340
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,974
Before you come back

341
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,393
We collected all the ingredients we could find

342
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,145
Yeah? Where is it?

343
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,647
-Here
-It's all here

344
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,024
Very good

345
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,289
Everyone has different tastes

346
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,499
But today's guests are two nobles.

347
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,334
And a powerful official

348
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,129
Ordinary dishes can't satisfy them

349
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,299
Nothing

350
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,886
There is no ingredient for serving as a main course

351
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,477
It's meat

352
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,315
-Oh my God
- Very big

353
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,903
Very fresh

354
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:54,490
I found it in the jar and it's so hidden

355
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,326
Your nose is so good

356
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,495
well done

357
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,081
OK, just use this to decide the outcome

358
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,958
French steak

359
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,376
What we have to do is...

360
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,129
steak!

361
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,506
"Niu Brand"?

362
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,550
-"Niu Brand"? What is that?
-"Niu Brand"

363
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,137
Can't you see this? It's a dish made of meat

364
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,056
Let's do it quickly!

365
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,265
Just do what she said

366
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,059
-Get that one
-OK

367
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,936
- Here
-Go there

368
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,063
Adult, is it really okay?

369
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,690
She doesn't look like she's lying

370
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,026
I can tell she is sincere to the food

371
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,196
I'm still not relieved

372
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,823
It doesn't matter

373
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,783
If something goes wrong

374
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,119
They'll pay the price

375
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,162
Oh, right

376
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,414
How is Mika?

377
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,208
Oh yes

378
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,963
She just left the village with the wet nurse

379
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,342
If only you could say apart to her

380
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,178
She's dead to me

381
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,140
Yes, adults

382
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,815
The aroma is very strong

383
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:10,899
Of course

384
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,319
It's on Laogu Mountain in our village

385
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,237
I like

386
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,410
No, wait, let's fry this first

387
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,830
This is anchovies produced in the western Tokiji Island and...

388
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:25,998
no

389
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,167
Must stir-fry before removing the fishy smell

390
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,335
Go around in a circle

391
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,590
-Travel over and tighten
-Like this

392
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,549
alright

393
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,009
Is this OK?

394
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,181
Very fresh, right?

395
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,558
This is the shrimp sauce from Mapo Port

396
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,893
Taste is great

397
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,353
Please fry it into powder

398
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,870
This meat is too tough

399
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,999
There are too many fascia, almost no snowflakes, so it's tough

400
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,676
Oh my God, what kind of meat is this? It can't be cut even if the knife is

401
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,888
This thing is as strong as a rope

402
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:26,183
Is this a bull used to plow the fields?

403
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,352
what to do?

404
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,772
No, think of a way Yan Zhiyong

405
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,320
Yes, that's it

406
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,657
The ancient recipe "Shanjia Yaolu" that my father showed me

407
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,911
To cook tough beef that cannot be cut even with a knife

408
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,580
Can use the method of decoction

409
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,001
(Three-point mature)

410
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:53,919
(Cook at 55 degrees for 30 minutes)

411
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,003
That's it!

412
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,838
There are also corresponding cooking in French cuisine

413
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,967
A method of suffocating fat to soften the flesh

414
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,885
That is, slow cooking at low temperature

415
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,016
Not bad, oily

416
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,435
-Jang Geum help me get some Korean paper
-Um?

417
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,271
Paper? It's so expensive Korean paper...

418
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,480
Very urgent Go quickly

419
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,441
- Must bring it
-I'll be back soon

420
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,028
good

421
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:20,946
(From the Red Court)

422
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,115
Is Your Highness still missing?

423
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,533
Yes, ladies

424
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:29,037
With the guards of the Yulin, I guess I will be safe and sound

425
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,789
If there is any emergency news, please report it to me first

426
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,165
(Jiang Mozhu Shuyuan Li Xianzhi's concubine)

427
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,794
Yes, Empress, don't worry too much

428
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,839
Have the Ren family and his son gone to the Jingji Supervisory Camp?

429
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,216
It should have arrived now

430
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,426
I'm quite curious

431
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:46,805
The arrogant Hong Jingda
How will the expression on your face become

432
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,392
Watching his granddaughter be taken away because of Caihong

433
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,858
Come forward!

434
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,862
Liar Hong Yanxu

435
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,114
Meet the Master Cao Shen and Master Chengzhi

436
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,785
OK, can Lingzun still be healthy?

437
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:12,456
Thank you for your blessings, everything is fine

438
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,957
Please follow me

439
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,771
But Miss

440
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:21,858
Why do you wrap the meat with kelp?

441
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,443
This meat is too tough

442
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,612
Making kelp can make it soft

443
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,364
It's amazing

444
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,789
Jang Geum, we have to add cool water here

445
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,791
But it took a lot of effort to cook

446
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,167
But you want to cool down...

447
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,128
All right

448
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,091
I'll pour it in now

449
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,811
But Miss

450
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:02,482
Can't the meat be roasted directly on fire or boiled in water?

451
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,733
-yes
-That's it

452
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:08,155
Only this method can soften the tough flesh

453
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,038
-Oh, Miss! What are you doing?
-Oh my God

454
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,790
The water is still hot!

455
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,750
Are you testing the water temperature?

456
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:25,130
The optimal temperature to make the meat tender is between 49 and 55 degrees

457
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,840
But…

458
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,217
Another gouache

459
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,642
Stop it's OK

460
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,528
If you heat it in warm water for a long time

461
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,448
A protein called myosin in the meat reacts

462
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,450
So that the meat becomes fresh

463
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,785
This is how to relieve fat

464
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,414
- Another gouache
-yes

465
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,501
The temperature of boiling water is one hundred degrees

466
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,962
The room temperature water is about twenty degrees

467
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,422
If you mix them

468
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,216
The temperature will be around fifty-five degrees

469
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,551
This way you can use Shrimp Cooking

470
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,598
Miss, your hands are really...

471
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,185
I don't have a thermometer

472
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,020
So I can only believe in the feeling of my fingertips

473
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,148
But your hands are red

474
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:26,691
don’t worry

475
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,945
I've made this cooking method countless times

476
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:36,534
Come and let me see

477
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:42,374
Let me take a look at your face

478
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,626
Why are you so shy

479
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:45,919
Are you angry?

480
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,337
All right

481
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,172
how…

482
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,173
Why!

483
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,385
Too big This mole is too big

484
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,720
The eyes are too big

485
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,972
The mouth is too big

486
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,557
Too tall

487
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,060
Is it too urgent to go out and forget your neck at home?

488
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,145
Really!

489
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,897
Take this old woman for me!

490
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:11,403
What should I do? How to explain to the king?

491
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,280
Yes Father

492
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,908
Everyone says there is a peerless beauty in the village

493
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,495
I thought you would
Bring her out of loyalty to the king

494
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:28,628
Who are you talking about, why don't I know

495
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,090
What's the name?

496
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,466
yes…

497
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,802
Lord Hong

498
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:37,929
granddaughter?

499
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:41,683
adult

500
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,978
What are you saying?

501
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,063
Mika is just a child

502
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,357
You know too

503
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,068
This is the red picking for the Lord Your Highness

504
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,631
-Oh my God
-Oh My God

505
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,885
- Looks delicious
-Oh my God

506
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,055
Oh my God

507
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,309
Thank goodness it succeeded

508
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,813
It smells so good!

509
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,523
Can I see, too?

510
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,859
Looks unfamiliar

511
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,194
I have to taste it

512
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,657
So delicious!

513
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,535
Too awesome!

514
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,954
Miss What is this?

515
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:49,334
This is called supple cooking

516
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:55,048
In this way, boiling the meat in water is called "Shufei".

517
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,425
Not finished yet now I need to smoke

518
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,426
- "Smoke and Fat"?
-What?

519
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,095
Please give me some straw

520
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,515
-It seems to be used to dress up
- Then let's get it

521
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,308
So

522
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,477
How old are you this year?

523
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,523
Adult The banquet is ready

524
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,401
Dinner is ready

525
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,778
As the saying goes, public first, then private

526
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,655
Why don’t we eat first?

527
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,534
Do you want to eat?

528
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,622
OK

529
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,959
Welcome everyone

530
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,212
Come from afar, thank you all the way

531
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,257
So

532
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,843
Is Your Highness healthy?

533
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:43,346
Did Hong Observer ask clearly?

534
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,681
Those memorials you wrote

535
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:48,810
Ask Your Highness to depose Shuyuan and Jiang

536
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,021
A big uproar in the palace

537
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,232
Ouch Father

538
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:57,318
Why are you talking about this here?

539
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,695
Isn't this embarrassing him?

540
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,406
It's okay, but it's okay

541
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:06,119
However, those memorials did make Your Highness unhappy

542
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,537
It's because of this

543
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,915
Have you sent Caihong envoy here from afar?

544
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,792
You misunderstood

545
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,628
That's two things

546
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:19,966
Oh, I've been so far away and starved to death

547
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,803
Why do you give us some refreshments?

548
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,473
Please forgive me.

549
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,183
Dinner is coming soon...

550
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,352
You two are really straightforward

551
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,938
OK, let's serve

552
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,732
Yes, adults

553
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,151
Start meals now

554
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,544
Really

555
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,297
This is simply...

556
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,842
It seems that this area is the only one that has suffered famine

557
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,433
I'm afraid we can't enjoy this meal

558
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,519
The so-called reception of guests

559
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,230
It should reflect the customs and culture of the place

560
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,190
From this we can see geography and people's hearts

561
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,901
You can even see the quality of the crops from the meal alone

562
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:24,864
But I only saw a few slices of meat on the plate

563
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,535
What is the difference between this and the food of barbarians

564
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,954
It's so disappointing

565
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:35,750
You are not qualified to be a herdsman officer who cares about the people.

566
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,002
It seems you look down on me

567
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,381
We are those who come by the king's order

568
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,801
What explanation do you give?

569
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:49,681
To be honest, something went wrong with the dining room last night

570
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,392
It seems to be a mistake made by a new experienced person

571
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,143
Please forgive this rude behavior

572
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,605
I am not strict in managing my family and don't know the inside story

573
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,440
Such a serious misconduct

574
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,025
I sincerely apologize

575
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,694
What a concise thing about this!

576
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:06,072
How could you humiliate us so blatantly?

577
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,702
So

578
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,830
Do you want to change into something else?

579
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,417
Something else? What does this mean?

580
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:22,130
No matter what it is, it will be useless

581
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,382
I will call out the experienced guys who are preparing for this banquet

582
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,718
I'll punish it myself

583
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,469
Please calm down

584
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,682
Lord Hong What do you mean?

585
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:36,561
Bring all the skilled hands in the kitchen!

586
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,271
Yes, adults

587
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:51,409
What should I do after I go out

588
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,120
Although I don't know how I got here

589
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,624
But you can't just waste your time like this

590
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,755
Jang Geum What are you doing?

591
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:09,510
When you have free food, take as much as you can

592
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,763
alright

593
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,724
- Pull it all out for me!
-yes!

594
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,477
-No!
-Why is it coming again!

595
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,811
What's wrong with this?

596
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,689
What happened?

597
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,650
-don't want!
-Let me go!

598
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,985
What's wrong with this? Miss! oops!

599
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,158
-Oh my God
-Give us aside!

600
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,452
Food presented to noble people

601
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,914
Use all natural ingredients in the area to make!

602
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:41,250
But there are only a few slices of meat on this table!

603
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,503
-What is this to accept guests?
-What's going on?

604
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,297
I want to punish you and others severely

605
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,717
Please spare your life!

606
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,678
The food hasn't moved yet

607
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,721
Is this trying to find fault on purpose?

608
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:58,101
IMHO
Are you going to be punished if you haven’t even tasted it?

609
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,145
If so, it would be too unfair

610
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,607
These meals on the dining table
But it contains the essence of nature here

611
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,401
You girl is very brave

612
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,238
Are you saying that this meal contains the essence of nature here?

613
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,782
It's exactly

614
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,450
Then you can listen

615
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,662
If you talk nonsense, you have to pay the price for it

616
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:22,000
The food is not delicious when it is cold. Let them taste it first

617
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,378
adult

618
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,506
You have to taste the food in person before you can know how it tastes

619
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,092
I'll explain it after you taste it

620
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,345
Bold, you rude!

621
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,889
Oh my God

622
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,436
Observation makes this play you prepared is really interesting

623
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,523
Then I'll let you see what I've prepared

624
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,734
Bring people up!

625
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:48,860
-Yes
-Yes

626
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,821
Miss!

627
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,698
Oh, Miss!

628
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,242
Mika!

629
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,702
-grandfather…
-Miss

630
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,038
Mika

631
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,290
Mika

632
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,667
Mika...

633
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,254
How dare you!

634
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,298
What does Hong Observation feel?

635
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,842
Do you still like the surprise I prepared?

636
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,305
If that girl said true

637
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,767
We accepted the guests and left.

638
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,809
But if not...

639
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,481
I'll take your granddaughter away

640
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,818
(red)

641
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,070
This is a red card

642
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,614
That is the king's fate

643
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,950
That guy is the Red Envoy

644
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,328
The world's number one treacherous minister Ren Songzai

645
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,333
You're rude

646
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,170
Even if you are deeply favored by Your Highness, you will be obliged.

647
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,297
But you can't threaten me like this

648
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,550
I can't take my granddaughter away on the grounds of Caihong!

649
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,805
How can a person be so shameless!

650
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,015
Observation please calm down

651
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,268
Otherwise, your family's three generations might be dead here

652
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,814
You are the respected Hong Jingda Observer

653
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:12,235
Adults should know that they shouldn't act so impulsively

654
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,153
Hong Jingda?

655
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,239
I've never heard of this sentence

656
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,074
I've said it just now

657
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,285
If the food made by that girl could impress me

658
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,871
I assume that this thing has never happened

659
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,040
So please calm down

660
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,093
Please try it now

661
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,637
Ah before this

662
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,892
I have to punish the girl who made this dish first

663
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,144
No

664
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,312
I just made the dish!

665
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,772
Tell me, let me see

666
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,567
If this dish does not have the so-called essence of nature

667
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,693
So what if?

668
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,904
Are you willing to lose your life?

669
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,366
Anyway, I can't go back, what else can I be afraid of

670
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,578
The effect of suppleness is perfect

671
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,747
OK I'm willing

672
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,332
So please taste it

673
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,709
good

674
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,794
Miss!

675
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,662
What's this?

676
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,670
This taste

677
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,922
This taste

678
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,299
It's a taste I've never tasted before

679
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,511
This meat has almost no chewing

680
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,013
It melted in the mouth

681
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,015
Gravy fills the entire mouth

682
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,226
And this sauce

683
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,810
What exactly is this?

684
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,029
Guanyinic acid in shiitake mushrooms

685
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,282
Inosine acid in anchovies

686
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:26,077
And glutamic acid in shrimp paste

687
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:47,139
When amino acids of different ethnic groups are combined in a specific proportion

688
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,225
The umami taste will be greatly improved

689
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,353
That is what we call umami bomb

690
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,938
Magnesium glutamate

691
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,316
This is no different from the modern synthetic MSG

692
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,624
This is just

693
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,252
Just a plate of ordinary white cut meat

694
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,605
How about it?

695
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,942
I'm from this dish
Can't feel the natural taste you said

696
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:45,156
People can't stop lying

697
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,699
Do you have anything else to say?

698
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,535
This dish looks like

699
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,038
I just served you meat

700
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,958
But I actually used food from all over the country

701
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,045
-Yeah?
-Salt for your meat dipped

702
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,714
There is shrimp paste from Mapo Port in it

703
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,299
Anchovies on the West Coast

704
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,968
There are also mushrooms from Laogushan

705
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,596
If this is not natural

706
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,057
So what other food can be counted?

707
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,516
This is really strange

708
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,935
What you say is full of nature

709
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,480
But I didn't feel it in your food

710
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,899
You are lying!

711
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,860
What does it mean to observe and make adults?

712
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:26,530
I've never eaten anything so delicious in my life

713
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:31,535
But you actually lie like this in order to take my granddaughter away!

714
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,581
You treacherous minister will be struck by lightning!

715
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,796
I'll know

716
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,382
Because of Caihong, he will never tell the truth.

717
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,008
A treacherous official like you

718
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,177
I want to kill you with my own hands!

719
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,428
father!

720
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:51,972
father!

721
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,892
It's all because my son is incompetent

722
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,560
Please calm down

723
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,270
Let me go

724
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,647
father!

725
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,899
You can't do this

726
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,695
Really

727
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,240
It's really a scene that makes people cry

728
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,700
Still "dad"

729
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,462
What are you still standing there

730
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,507
Why don't you take down that sinner!

731
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,552
- Sorry, please forgive us
-What? I?

732
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,097
Am I really going to die here unjustly?

733
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,598
Just in North Korea?

734
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:38,352
God, Buddha, everyone is good! Please save me

735
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,729
don't want!

736
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,566
Don't please! Wait a moment!

737
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,067
If you want to blame, blame your cooking skills

738
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,319
I have no problem with the cooking!

739
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,280
It's your tongue that is lying!

740
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,408
What are you doing? Don't stop

741
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,414
don't want! Help! Let me go, please!

742
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,540
father

743
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,215
don't want!

744
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,303
Please spare my life

745
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,471
stop!

746
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,532
Your Highness is here!

747
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,497
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

748
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,250
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

749
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,020
If what you said is true...

750
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,189
Wait for this sound...

751
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,108
Then let me taste it myself

752
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,527
No

753
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,612
It's impossible that idiot

754
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,372
How is that possible!

755
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,332
"Your Highness"?

756
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,424
Look up, ghost girl

757
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,385
It's finished

758
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,762
He is really Yan Xijun!

759
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,014
Who are you?

760
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,016
Who are you?

761
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:42,851
Are you crazy?

762
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,728
You crazy man!

763
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,230
Hello, haven't you figured out the situation yet?

764
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,565
I will order you in the name of the King of Korea!

765
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,149
I am the king of this country

766
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,361
I am the king of this country

767
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,533
Why are you still kneeling on the ground?

768
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,659
dad

769
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,870
Sorry, leave you alone

770
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,166
I would rather…

771
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,421
would you rather

772
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,300
I was beaten to death by the wooden board

773
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,912
What a simple and shabby meal

774
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,623
You come here to try it first

775
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,374
What? I?

776
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,252
Yes

777
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,383
All right

778
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,163
That's right

779
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:29,041
You are a famous foodie in the Joseon era

780
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,459
Have an absolute taste

781
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,003
Then he will definitely comment fairly, right?

782
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,383
Don't have too much hope

783
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,718
If the taste is not as good as that bowl of rice...

784
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,327
How could the meat be so soft and tender?

785
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,834
The more you chew it in your mouth

786
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,961
The more the gravy is, the more it is

787
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,422
This light and refreshing taste

788
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,842
After reaching the extreme, it quietly transforms

789
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,386
etc.

790
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,388
This seasoning...

791
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,029
I really can't

792
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,365
Believe in this taste

793
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,868
This is the essence of umami flavor

794
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,124
What exactly did you do?

795
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,919
His taste is indeed extraordinary

796
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,755
It's amazing to taste the MSG like this

797
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,215
Sure enough, a foodie

798
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,511
Simply put

799
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,806
It's something I use to enrich the flavor of food

800
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,310
Can improve freshness and reduce saltiness

801
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:12,978
Is it "item"?

802
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,273
I see

803
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:17,733
So that's it

804
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,675
This pickled Schisandra chinensis

805
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,969
It's so appetizing with the roasted green onions on the side

806
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,055
The combination with meat is even more icing on the cake

807
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,641
This dish is really...

808
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,560
The best delicacy in the world

809
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:55,771
I can live

810
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,606
I can survive!

811
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,527
The taste is nostalgic

812
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,028
For the first time in a long time

813
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,781
Eat so satisfactory

814
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:12,663
Then why are you so harsh about the dishes just now?

815
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:18,418
This meal deserves the highest honor of the king of a country

816
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,878
That's natural

817
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:22,798
My insignificant tongue cannot taste its taste

818
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,717
I am worthy of being called a treacherous minister

819
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,887
Didn’t you say you couldn’t taste it?

820
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,433
You surprised me twice today

821
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:38,939
I am a chef!

822
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,816
Chef Yan Zhiyong!

823
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:43,318
I am a chef! It's a chef!

824
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,445
So put

825
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,657
You said you are the chef from Zhu Chulai?

826
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,451
I am the chef, that is, the chef

827
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,122
It doesn't seem like lying when you look at your craft

828
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,624
- He is indeed a skilled expert
-Yes

829
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,588
A skilled job has always been a man's business

830
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,507
As a woman, how did you become a familiar player?

831
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:06,633
What's going on?

832
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,136
Is this an interview?

833
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,807
My father likes cooking very much

834
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:17,436
So taste and make delicious food

835
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,854
It became my job

836
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,772
A mission?

837
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:24,693
Then have you ever regretted becoming a chef?

838
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:29,406
This is what a natural vocation is accompanied by suffering

839
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:35,370
Just like the king, although he has supreme power

840
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,998
But you have to face the test and hardship

841
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,085
I see

842
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,504
Anyway

843
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,756
My craft

844
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,508
Can be recognized by someone with excellent taste like His Highness

845
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,678
It's the most gratifying moment for me as a chef

846
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,352
May I have your name?

847
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,270
My name is Yan Zhiyong

848
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,439
Yen, what about age?

849
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,482
Twenty-seven years old

850
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,399
What?

851
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,443
Twenty-seven years old?

852
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,571
Much more mature than it seems

853
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,239
Do you have a husband?

854
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,533
Husband...

855
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,118
Ah, it means husband

856
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,995
I'm not married yet

857
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:20,040
oh? At this age, I'm not married yet?

858
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,625
What a pity

859
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,753
Ah, it's not that you misunderstood

860
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,296
I'm not the one here

861
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,341
So the situation is different from what you think.

862
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,970
Then who are you?

863
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,723
Do I want to tell the truth?

864
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:37,808
Or not to say it?

865
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,229
He probably won't believe me

866
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:44,648
Although it may be hard for you to believe

867
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,942
But I...

868
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:54,866
From the future five hundred years later

869
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,041
Yes

870
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,293
Does he really believe me?

871
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,256
Today I will spare your life

872
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,633
Do you believe me?

873
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,469
You are unconscious, although it's a pity

874
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,723
But today it is your craft that saved you

875
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,018
After a long time, I turned out to be a crazy person?

876
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,813
Yes, I don't even believe it myself

877
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,066
I know it's hard to believe

878
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,026
But I...

879
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,280
I'm from a later generation called "Korea"

880
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,991
How dare you be arrogant in front of the palace! Enough!

881
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:38,702
All right

882
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:41,955
Of course you don't believe me

883
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,833
I'm not crazy again

884
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,419
This is all true What can I do

885
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,342
Enough, step aside

886
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:06,354
Believe it or not

887
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,106
Let me go

888
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,066
Didn’t this say this is the best delicacy in the world?

889
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,281
You will let me go, right?

890
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,329
Should I let me go?

891
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,914
It's going crazy

892
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,290
All are in charge

893
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:26,958
Yes Your Highness

894
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,044
Will you let me go?

895
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,337
Please

896
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,422
Please, please...

897
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,299
That skillful...

898
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:38,678
Closed first and enter the palace with me tomorrow

899
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,097
Yes Your Highness

900
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,225
What a joke

901
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,393
I didn't let me go

902
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:49,272
How should Hong Observer’s granddaughter deal with it?

903
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:55,779
I want to take her into the palace, prepare for it

904
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,698
Yes Your Highness

905
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,659
Obey orders

906
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,705
Want to take that little girl away?

907
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,999
Really what is this

908
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:13,255
Wait, Hong Jingda's granddaughter?

909
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,632
Isn't this arousal

910
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:18,009
Is the fuse of Jiashenshi's disaster?

911
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,636
(Yan Xijun is for revenge
Kill an official related to his mother's death)

912
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,222
All go back

913
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,140
I'm tired

914
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,309
-Yes Your Highness
-Yes Your Highness

915
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,781
Retreat quickly

916
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:41,741
I said quit!

917
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,414
Go quickly

918
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,958
As the saying goes, you will get beans.

919
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,793
The old saying is indeed correct

920
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,629
It's no wonder that his virtue will cause trouble

921
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,631
It's so bad

922
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,133
You girl!

923
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,051
Come with me

924
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:12,355
Why is Your Highness still here?

925
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:17,527
Don’t you feel ashamed before the former kings?

926
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:22,991
Receive the knife

927
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,621
Indulge in women's sex and ignore the government

928
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,373
Don't take the lives of court officials seriously

929
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,626
He also despises the lives of the people!

930
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,878
Don't you know that this is why

931
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:40,592
Only the officials in the court will disrespect you
Will the people abandon you?

932
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,219
You say it again

933
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,556
Your Highness

934
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:51,728
Please regain your wise and wise

935
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:55,857
Your Highness must punish the treacherous ministers

936
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:59,694
And those women who rely on His Highness’s power

937
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,572
Only in this way can the country stand firm!

938
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,832
You say it again

939
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,000
Your Highness

940
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,545
Your Highness

941
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,173
It's about your granddaughter's life

942
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,509
Are you worried about state affairs?

943
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,596
How can you understand my mood?

944
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,014
Your Highness

945
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:34,104
Please take the life of the empress directly!

946
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:39,985
Watching my family suffer, but I can't do anything

947
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,570
Have you felt it?

948
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:46,116
Your Highness

949
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:51,121
You have to live to suffer for many years

950
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:55,000
This is the punishment I give you

951
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,670
Punish you for killing my mother

952
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:02,674
Come!

953
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,175
Put this

954
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,803
Those who have committed disrespectful crimes will be dragged out by me!

955
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,098
Your Highness

956
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:11,891
Your Highness

957
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,436
Tomorrow morning

958
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:17,522
Exiled him to the extreme edge of Hamgyong North

959
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:18,815
Yes Your Highness

960
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,359
Your Highness

961
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:22,402
Your Highness!

962
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,820
Your Highness!

963
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,031
Your Highness!

964
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,832
What's going on?

965
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:41,838
Miss, does Your Highness really think the food is delicious?

966
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:46,051
I clearly heard him say that it was the best delicacy in the world

967
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:50,722
Then why are everyone else released
Just lock us up?

968
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:51,723
How do I know?

969
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:56,686
I really want to pry open that bastard's head
See what he is thinking!

970
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:57,854
Oh my god

971
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:01,483
Anyway, they said they would bring us into the palace tomorrow

972
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,443
This is bad

973
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,320
It's really insulting

974
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:06,696
What did you say?

975
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,989
Entering the palace?

976
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,700
I have to go back before entering the palace

977
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,078
It's so crazy

978
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,080
Where are you going?

979
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,793
Of course it's where I came. Where else can it be?

980
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,629
But where is that?

981
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:25,465
Jang Geum

982
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,926
I know you may not believe it

983
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:31,971
But I come from a very distant future

984
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,017
Oh my God, what am I doing?

985
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,352
never mind

986
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:42,232
No, Miss, I believe you

987
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:45,276
When I first met you

988
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,737
I smelled a smell I had never smelled before

989
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,365
The dishes you make are also something I've never smelled before

990
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:51,991
So I believe you

991
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,327
-Jang Geum, do you really believe it?
-Yes

992
00:56:56,121 --> 00:57:00,208
Actually, when I was flying back to South Korea in Paris

993
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,251
Sitting on a "fat chicken"?

994
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:05,380
Anyway, I'm taking a plane from France to South Korea

995
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:06,422
Someone spilled my coffee

996
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,967
I went to the bathroom and opened a book...

997
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,886
By the way, "Looking at Clouds"

998
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,683
I read the first page like a magic book…

999
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,144
Where did that book go?

1000
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,729
By the way, my shoulder bag!

1001
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,486
My shoulder bag

1002
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,196
-Jewelvet
-What's wrong?

1003
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,366
I suddenly thought of something very important

1004
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,160
What's up?

1005
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:38,496
There is a very important book called "Wangyun Lu"

1006
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,790
But I lost it

1007
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,042
"Looking at the Clouds"?

1008
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,378
I have to find the bag to load the book

1009
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,588
That way I can go back

1010
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:51,009
Remember when I was at your house
The cliff that you asked me to take me to?

1011
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:51,926
Remember

1012
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,344
I'm just losing it there

1013
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,388
What should I do?

1014
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,933
How do we leave here?

1015
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,448
oops!

1016
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,074
Your Highness, fear

1017
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,911
Why do you approach me so quietly?

1018
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,329
It's cold outside

1019
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:21,414
It's time for you to go in

1020
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,582
Songzai

1021
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,375
Yes, Your Highness

1022
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,544
We are the only one here, so you might as well be more comfortable

1023
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,297
-No Your Highness
-So what's wrong?

1024
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:32,258
You're too slow

1025
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,016
Be fast

1026
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,090
Look at you

1027
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,565
Songzai

1028
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:29,691
Yes, Your Highness

1029
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:34,112
Except for the expert named Yan Zhiyong
And the girl she was with

1030
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:39,158
All the women who were caught for Caihong today were released

1031
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,118
What did you say?

1032
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:44,122
Did Lian Hong's granddaughter not take away?

1033
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,291
No more

1034
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:50,712
Anyway, once Hong Jingda is exiled

1035
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,630
His granddaughter will also become an official slave

1036
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:53,840
Your Highness

1037
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,884
Could it be that Caihong makes you unhappy?

1038
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,138
no

1039
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:03,641
It's crazy. Any excuse to continue the heirs

1040
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:06,060
He's a lustful person, a good excuse

1041
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:11,649
Caihong is just an excuse to avenge my mother

1042
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,192
Don't you know, too?

1043
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:17,697
That girl gave me an excuse to exile her grandfather

1044
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:19,824
That's enough

1045
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:22,577
But your Highness, if you cancel the red color now

1046
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,662
I'm afraid it will cause

1047
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,040
The Princess Renzhu suspects that you are avenging your mother

1048
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,917
This little thing is not enough to make her suspicious

1049
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,211
And for some reason...

1050
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:37,258
I always feel a little tired today

1051
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,971
So…

1052
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,141
How about the ministers who come to bed tonight?

1053
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,147
Your joke is too much

1054
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:57,612
Who are you?

1055
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:05,328
Don't be afraid I'm here to abide by the agreement

1056
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:07,455
You are the person just now...

1057
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,290
Ah, isn't it an adult?

1058
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:12,293
You have successfully completed picking up the guests, so I'll let you go

1059
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:16,172
Are you saying true?

1060
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,341
Hold this

1061
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,343
And this one

1062
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,638
You're walking from there

1063
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:25,473
You can see the back door of the government office

1064
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,183
Go quickly

1065
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,769
-So…
-good

1066
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,647
-let's go
-Yes

1067
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,940
that

1068
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:38,194
I don't know if I'm listening to this

1069
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:40,905
But that tyrant will be punished one day

1070
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,365
Thank you

1071
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,033
Thank you so much

1072
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:46,744
Let's go

1073
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,013
Your Highness, I am the minister.

1074
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:09,976
What's the matter?

1075
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:13,896
The skilled man who was serving His Highness escaped from prison

1076
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:15,898
What?

1077
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:20,611
By the way, where is your family?

1078
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:23,740
I'm the only one

1079
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:25,658
What?

1080
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:30,747
My father was a military officer in Zuoshui Camp in Jeolla

1081
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:34,459
But he was falsely accused and taken away.

1082
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:35,376
As for my mother

1083
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,921
She brought me to Hanyang to find my father

1084
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:41,758
But she met a bandit on the way, and she passed away because of this

1085
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,593
Sorry

1086
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:46,846
-I don't know I shouldn't ask
-It doesn't matter

1087
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,890
How could you know?

1088
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:50,516
It really doesn't matter

1089
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:53,978
-Jewelvet
-Um?

1090
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:57,356
Do you want to go with me?

1091
01:02:58,566 --> 01:02:59,567
Where to go?

1092
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,444
Going to the future five hundred years later

1093
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,821
Back to the era in which I lived

1094
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,200
Can I?

1095
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,243
Can I really go with you?

1096
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:11,496
What is your dream?

1097
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,498
"Dreamside"?

1098
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:14,582
Who do you want to be?

1099
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,418
There, just work hard and you can be anyone

1100
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:20,046
If I could be anyone

1101
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,758
I want to be the highest palace among the water la

1102
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:26,052
good

1103
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,513
While I'm still here

1104
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,473
I'll teach you how to cook

1105
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:34,143
Really? You can't regret it

1106
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:37,814
Are you the highest palace between Shuila where you are?

1107
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:41,067
No, I am Michelin three-star chef

1108
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,368
Miss, this is the only cliff nearby

1109
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:53,079
Oh my God, it's so hard to climb up

1110
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:56,749
It's really troublesome today

1111
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:00,670
Too dark, nothing can be seen

1112
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:01,838
-Jewelvet
-What's wrong?

1113
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,130
-It's here
-Yeah?

1114
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,090
Um

1115
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,050
Oh My God

1116
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,343
Miss!

1117
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:12,098
Didn't I lose it here?

1118
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,933
-See here
-Is this here?

1119
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,726
Can't see anything

1120
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:19,772
- Can't see it
-Yeah my god

1121
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,607
It's too dark to see

1122
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,776
-Not here
-Isn't it?

1123
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,028
So…

1124
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,446
It seems to be going there

1125
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,199
-Flying over there
-OK

1126
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:33,119
It seems to have fallen nearby

1127
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,036
Miss

1128
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,747
-See here
-OK

1129
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:39,166
Where did it fall?

1130
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,710
None here, either

1131
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,753
Can't see anything

1132
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:45,756
How could it not be? It's obviously flying here

1133
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:49,093
Miss, look there

1134
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,219
Have you seen anything?

1135
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,554
Um

1136
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,860
Your Highness

1137
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,532
that…

1138
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,713
No Wait! I will explain!

1139
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:29,425
Please listen to my explanation

1140
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:31,761
Please...

1141
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:46,192
Say it

1142
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:49,153
I'm sorry

1143
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:51,989
I'm here to find the bag I threw away

1144
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:54,325
- "Card bag"?
-Yes

1145
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:58,120
It's the bag you shot with your arrows

1146
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,248
Oh, that one?

1147
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:04,919
There is a book called "Wangyun Lu" in that bag

1148
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:09,840
I guess it was that book that brought me to the Joseon era

1149
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,510
"Looking at the Clouds"?

1150
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:17,139
A nonsense

1151
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:22,228
I know it's hard to believe, but I'm not talking nonsense

1152
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:25,022
Your Highness, I really need that book

1153
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,650
Is it that important?

1154
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:31,696
Is it worth your crime of rebellion for Ye Yuedao?

1155
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:34,156
Yes, that book is as important to me as life

1156
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:12,111
It's so good

1157
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,531
Is this the case?

1158
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:18,409
Yes, that's it! Thank you!

1159
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:23,873
You crazy man!

1160
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,210
Now you have no reason to escape

1161
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:30,337
What the hell are you doing?

1162
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:33,340
Look at you

1163
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,384
So disrespectful to me again

1164
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:39,013
Your Highness

1165
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:42,433
I was disrespectful tone, I was wrong

1166
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,144
You let me do whatever you want

1167
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:47,605
Please give me that bag

1168
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:49,940
You will...

1169
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:53,402
Do anything?

1170
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,487
yes

1171
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:56,655
Why?

1172
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:07,583
Is this too much, right?

1173
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:12,546
Why did he have to torture us like this?

1174
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,799
If I have to enter the palace

1175
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:17,468
Let me go to Shuilajian to be a palace maid

1176
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:23,265
Now that we offended the king, what should we do?

1177
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:28,562
I'll protect you no matter what. Don't worry

1178
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,689
Be more energetic and stronger, okay?

1179
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:35,444
Yes, I will protect you, no matter what happens

1180
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,530
We all have to be strong

1181
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:38,572
-Um
-good

1182
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:44,245
I must find that book "Wangyun Lu" and go back

1183
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:45,454
No matter what method

1184
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:51,210
Your Highness, why do you want to bring that woman with you?

1185
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,088
because

1186
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,715
I don't want her to die too peacefully

1187
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:11,063
If I had a gun, I really wanted to shoot him.

1188
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,342
There is news

1189
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:45,890
Something happened to your Highness

1190
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:48,893
Is it an assassin?

1191
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:52,646
Fortunately, the dragon is fine

1192
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:54,815
Who did it?

1193
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:58,402
It should be someone from us

1194
01:09:58,485 --> 01:10:01,947
Are you saying someone has acted without permission?

1195
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:09,663
Maybe I can't hold it back

1196
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:12,958
I've clearly said how many times I have to wait until the time is right

1197
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:17,713
If we were implicated before the incident

1198
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,799
It must be removed

1199
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,636
Should I send someone to investigate secretly?

1200
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,680
No need

1201
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:29,808
I know what I've already sent someone to stare at me

1202
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,813
You have to be extra careful, too

1203
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,024
Yes, Maharaja

1204
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:40,611
Just greet the Lord as usual

1205
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:42,655
So that he can forget the worries of state affairs

1206
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:45,157
And the anger towards the courtiers

1207
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:49,119
Then he was crazy about his mother's death

1208
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:52,957
Make him fascinated by you and can't help but

1209
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:56,460
Yes I understand

1210
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:04,551
By the way, Mozhu

1211
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:07,054
Yes, Maharaja

1212
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:09,598
I heard

1213
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:14,561
The Lord brought back a woman from the Gyeonggi Supervisory Camp

1214
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:16,480
It must be Hong Jingda's granddaughter

1215
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:22,653
I want to know

1216
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,103
You all retreat

1217
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:57,771
-Yes
-Yes

1218
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:04,361
Is Qiuyue here?

1219
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:05,779
In the lady

1220
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:12,328
How long will it take for His Highness to arrive?

1221
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,997
Just set out from Gyeonggi Supervisory Camp

1222
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:18,417
It will probably be around the corner of the day

1223
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,086
I heard that I would also take Hong Jingda's granddaughter with me

1224
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,422
I heard he is a great beauty

1225
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:26,258
Who can match you?

1226
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:30,596
I want her to see clearly
It's enough to have me by your highness

1227
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:31,805
You wait and see

1228
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:35,351
How did I torture that little girl to the point of withering

1229
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:38,228
-Looking Demon Woman!
-Go away quickly!

1230
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:40,898
-Get out quickly!
-Get out quickly!

1231
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:43,192
Hello! What are you doing?

1232
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:47,279
how? Want to see the skills of the ghost girl?

1233
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:51,200
-You little kids!
-A bunch of idiots!

1234
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:54,912
-I remember your faces!
- These little bastards

1235
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:57,831
-Miss, are you okay?
-Stop it all!

1236
01:12:58,749 --> 01:12:59,583
never mind

1237
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:02,753
These kids are at least five hundred years older than me

1238
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:03,921
Yes, forget it

1239
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:11,553
No matter how I look at it

1240
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,180
This is North Korea, right

1241
01:13:13,263 --> 01:13:14,598
I have to cheer up

1242
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:21,897
Oh my God!

1243
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,358
How dare you touch my things?

1244
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:27,152
It seems like a lesson is not learned

1245
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,612
Your Highness

1246
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,448
You just said "stuff"

1247
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:33,617
Are you talking about me?

1248
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:34,993
That's right

1249
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,538
From now on, you can't see anyone without my permission

1250
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:40,749
Can't go anywhere, and can't talk to anyone

1251
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:44,086
Then I can't do anything

1252
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:46,547
From a thief to a ghost girl

1253
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:48,340
Now it's someone else's thing

1254
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:51,009
I really have nothing to say

1255
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,261
yes

1256
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:54,763
It is said that you have to pretend to be dumb for three years and pretend to be deaf for three years

1257
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:56,181
Pretend to be blind for another three years

1258
01:13:57,266 --> 01:14:00,352
Just treat it as the basic way of survival to survive in the palace

1259
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,980
I'll prepare a special residence for you

1260
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:08,819
What…

1261
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:16,994
Your Highness is here!

1262
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,627
I'm really going to Fengde Palace

1263
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,421
I've really come to the palace

1264
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:31,508
I want to replace Hong Jingda's granddaughter as a scapegoat

1265
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:34,136
Did I say that I stopped the Jiashenshi disaster?

1266
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:36,638
What should I do now?

1267
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,934
This is really hell North Korea

1268
01:15:02,789 --> 01:15:05,250
Shuyuan, have you been waiting for a long time?

1269
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:11,715
Your Highness, I am almost ready to pass through the autumn water and turn into ashes

1270
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:15,219
Very happy that you can come

1271
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:17,346
Something I want you to see

1272
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,223
Follow me

1273
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,227
What is he going to do?

1274
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:25,687
Stop getting closer

1275
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:28,273
Stay away from me!

1276
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:33,153
It's her

1277
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:34,488
Demon woman

1278
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:35,531
What?

1279
01:15:36,448 --> 01:15:37,282
Demon woman?

1280
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:43,497
Was it arrested as a sinner?

1281
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,707
She is indeed a sinner

1282
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:50,963
But she has a talent, and it would be a pity to kill it directly

1283
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,470
Your Highness himself
It was a surprise to bring a woman into the palace

1284
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:01,306
This is the first time since my concubine Jiang Mozhu entered the palace

1285
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:03,600
"woman"?

1286
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:05,435
She's a ghost

1287
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,064
Jiang Mozhu?

1288
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:11,608
The most vicious woman in North Korean history

1289
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:15,696
Playing with Yan Xijun in his palm
A witch who carries out all kinds of tyranny?

1290
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:19,491
It's really crazy

1291
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:26,081
She is not Mr. Hong's granddaughter

1292
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:27,416
Who is she?

1293
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:28,625
Oh My God

1294
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:30,294
Look at those cat eyes

1295
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:32,212
It's about to shoot a laser

1296
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:34,673
I feel like my face is about to be stared out by her

1297
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:39,428
Very pretty

1298
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:42,556
Your Highness must like this face

1299
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:49,229
As long as you dress up, you'll be pretty decent

1300
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:52,733
Should I take her to Zihongyuan for some good teaching?

1301
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:56,361
- That won't work
-What?

1302
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:59,615
She's not that kind of woman

1303
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:02,117
Shouldn't be staying in Zihongyuan

1304
01:17:03,243 --> 01:17:05,579
Then what are you going to do with her?

1305
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:09,458
Oh my God, this is really harsh!

1306
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:10,834
That look was about to kill me

1307
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:14,630
You will know it

1308
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:27,517
No, don't do this

1309
01:17:29,561 --> 01:17:32,064
No, can't be here

1310
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,524
She is watching!

1311
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:37,694
Then you will pester me...

1312
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:41,865
Beg me to spare your life

1313
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:48,205
Oh, I'm all goosebumps. Isn't it necessary to be torture?

1314
01:17:49,122 --> 01:17:51,792
I've got goosebumps all over my body

1315
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,620
"The Tyrant's Chef"

1316
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,832
I'm sure your Highness is interested in that girl

1317
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:34,876
Starting today

1318
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,462
You have to prepare meals for me every day. No mistakes are allowed

1319
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:40,048
If the food is not in line with my wishes

1320
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:41,925
I will give you a death

1321
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:45,011
Before you make a big disaster and get humiliated...

1322
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:48,432
-I have to set up a trap between the water strait
-There are snakes!

1323
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:50,267
Is this the plan you set up?

1324
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:52,686
I…

1325
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,355
-Empress, no
-Get out of the way!

1326
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:56,940
...I selected you

1327
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,442
What should I choose?

1328
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:06,658
