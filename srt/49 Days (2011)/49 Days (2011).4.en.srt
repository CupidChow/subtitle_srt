00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,430
Mother, please go inside for now.

4
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,090
What do I do?

5
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,510
He can't find it. He can't!

6
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,289
Min Ho,

7
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,229
Why did you come up here?

8
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,980
That...

9
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,140
Make sure you take that.

10
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,769
She'll like it.

11
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,889
I was planning on taking it anyway.

12
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,890
If you're done, go downstairs. If you
stay here too long, it'll only depress you.

13
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,100
Mother?

14
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,129
Who are you?

15
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,230
Who do you think? It's In Jung.

16
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,530
I heard that you didn't eat lunch again.

17
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,320
I thought that might happen
so I brought you rice cakes.

18
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,169
The rice cakes that mother likes,
bean cakes, honey cakes,

19
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,166
and so that you can share with friends
I bought rainbow cakes, sesame rice cakes...

20
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:41,450
Huh? Sesame rice cakes?

21
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,990
How many should I get you?

22
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,710
This rice cake is 3 for 1,000 won.

23
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:58,179
But I don't want to leave you disappointed,
so... alright!

24
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,230
I'll give you 10 for 3,000 won!

25
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,240
Yes, please give me
3,000 won worth of rice cakes please.

26
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,060
Hey, listen to me.

27
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,049
It's a waste to go next door.

28
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:19,430
When it comes to fish,
ours is the freshest and the best.

29
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,179
You bitch!

30
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,169
After selling rotten fish heads,

31
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,919
is your eyesight rotten now too?

32
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,530
Why are you trying to take
someone else's customer?

33
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,839
Are you going to move this hand or not?

34
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,020
Huh! You're going to rip it.

35
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,780
Did he find it or not?

36
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,520
Why is he taking my dolls?

37
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,250
So he didn't find it.

38
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,930
Of course he can't find it.
Even I can't find it.

39
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,180
But where did I put it...

40
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,000
Shin Ji Hyun, you trusted a man like that.

41
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,190
You thought a person like that loved you.

42
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,680
I'm sorry mother.

43
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,320
Father, forgive me.

44
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:27,020
Mother, I want to see you.
I want to see you.

45
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,440
<i>The last time I used that seal was that day...</i>

46
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,029
<i>After I settled the real estate deal,</i>

47
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,330
<i>did I not take it out of my bag?
Is it in my pocket?</i>

48
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,400
What do I do if I can't find it?

49
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,370
You empty headed idiot!

50
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,710
<i>Why are you hitting Song Yi Kyung?</i>

51
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,460
Hey!

52
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,549
Who gave you permission to hit that lady?

53
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,269
How did you know to come here?

54
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,049
What is this highway robbery?

55
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,820
After messing up her ankle,
you're bashing in her head?

56
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,580
I told you not to let
Song Yi Kyung get hurt!

57
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,689
Okay. I'll buy some Tiger balm later...

58
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,249
Whether you buy tiger balm or panties,
that's up to you.

59
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,110
But I warned you.

60
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,520
Go.

61
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,959
But I don't have anyone but you.

62
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,379
What is this...

63
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,669
Hey, we don't have that sort of relationship.

64
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,030
It's because I'm so lost.

65
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,579
I can't remember for the life of me
where I put that seal.

66
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,390
What are those two plotting?

67
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,390
Is finding the seal more important or
is thinking of myself more important?

68
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,559
How long do I have to spend my time
finding that seal?

69
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,769
What do I do if I can't find that seal...

70
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:25,249
I'm so scared,
but I don't have anyone to talk to.

71
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,590
Stop!

72
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,439
Look here.

73
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,449
I'm not a person.

74
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,720
And I didn't come here
because I was worried about you.

75
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,229
Beep boop beep boop buzz!

76
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,959
Rule broken by Shin Ji Hyun.

77
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,050
First rule broken by Shin Ji Hyun.

78
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,960
Is that why you came?

79
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,379
My time is as precious as yours.

80
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,320
Do I have to spend my days
chasing around after you?

81
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,389
But last time you gave me a hint.

82
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,109
When did I?!

83
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,329
You asked if I knew my house's passcode
and gave me a hint.

84
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,529
Beep beep beep beep beep beep

85
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:08,090
Whoa, this lady is a Scheduler predator!

86
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,060
I'm leaving.

87
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,225
It was a hint.

88
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,740
She is so slow.

89
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,880
That's why she's always getting hurt.

90
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,719
I heard you stopped by home.

91
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,960
Yes.

92
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,420
You're better than I am.

93
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,460
On the way here,
Dr. Jo said he wanted to see you.

94
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,309
<i>Is there something going on?</i>

95
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,580
You're going to the office right?

96
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,559
Let's go together.

97
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,400
You're planning on going back to work?

98
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,010
Ji Hyun, you brat.

99
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,240
Look closely, it's all your things.

100
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,989
It's your memories, your life.

101
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,730
Don't ever lose these precious things.

102
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,280
Your father... is waiting for you.

103
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,400
Seo Woo...

104
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,300
I miss you so much.

105
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,760
Friends are so great... so needed...

106
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,660
I'm so scared and lonely,

107
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,860
but I don't have anyone to talk to.

108
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:36,999
But Seo Woo, do you... love me?

109
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,930
Hello?

110
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,360
Oh my, I'm sorry.

111
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,979
I saw you over at the Kang store...

112
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,320
Ah yes. That's right. That's right!

113
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,580
You remember me?

114
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,040
You left quite an impression...

115
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,270
Did you come to buy bread?

116
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,720
Ah that...

117
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,899
I should have come to buy bread
a long time ago.

118
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,040
Even like this,
being able to talk to Seo Woo is great.

119
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,889
Ah Sun Jung,

120
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,699
are the bathrooms clean?

121
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,580
That's Song Yi Kyung's responsibility.

122
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,299
But Song Yi Kyung is not here yet.

123
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,390
That's what I'm saying.
She said she'd be here by five.

124
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,209
But really, what's wrong with our boss?

125
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,119
<i>Why does he keep
giving this weird lady chances?</i>

126
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,750
I concur with that question.

127
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,719
Do you guys think you know Kang?

128
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,689
He's haggard, arrogant,
and haughty with a hot temper...

129
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,795
<i>...and in his spare time,
he flies off the handle?</i>

130
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,690
What you see isn't everything.

131
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,019
You guys don't know everything.

132
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,999
Manager, sometime you speak in a way
I don't understand.

133
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,349
Don't stress my Hae Won.

134
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,449
Can't you see I'm working instead?
Even without pay.

135
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,239
Unni is a person
I think we should keep with pay.

136
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,069
Hey you, you didn't leave yet?

137
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,429
You have to go now!

138
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,510
But I don't want to.

139
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,899
- Go!
- Honey! I want to go with you!

140
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,889
Ahjumma. Why are you still here?

141
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,599
She can't leave because
Song Yi Kyung hasn't arrived yet!

142
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,390
She's not here yet?

143
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,729
Is she really not here yet?

144
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,019
It's not that she's not here...
it could be that she couldn't come here.

145
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,560
Unni!

146
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,959
Ahjussi, I'm heading out.

147
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,070
Hey Kang, take this person home.

148
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:35,071
It's not along the way.

149
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,419
If you eat bread like that, you'll choke.

150
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,100
You should chew well before swallowing.

151
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,020
I'm so sorry I'm late again.

152
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,180
You finished two pieces of bread
on the way here?

153
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,339
Song, what do you take me for?

154
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,129
Did you think I'm a benevolent person?

155
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,720
Do I look like a fool?

156
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,659
Ah, you think I'm an idiot, right?

157
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,869
The more I take care of you,
the more idiotic I get.

158
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,280
I seem like an idiot, right?

159
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,319
Then what are you?

160
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,099
You're a free person who
comes and goes as you please?

161
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,800
Did you sign the contract with me
as a free person?

162
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,920
It's not like that.

163
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,359
If you agreed to three hours,
then you should comply with the agreement.

164
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,080
Even if it's just this once!

165
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,330
What's wrong? Did you choke?

166
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,890
Did you choke?

167
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,979
- Ahjussi! Ahjumma!
- Okay, okay!

168
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,109
<i>Water! Water!</i>

169
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,020
<i>Honey! Honey!</i>

170
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,660
Ahjussi!

171
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,159
What to do? What to do?

172
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,540
<i>Quickly!</i>

173
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,869
<i>Drink a little bit at a time.</i>

174
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,140
You can choke on water too.

175
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,030
Ah, she's revived.

176
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,749
Go throw up.

177
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,869
If we don't deal with it, in time,
it'll create further complications.

178
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,520
I'm okay.

179
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,519
Come with me.

180
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,999
W... Why?

181
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,949
You really know how to annoy someone.

182
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,230
Because I have something
to give you and tell you.

183
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,739
<i>What should I do?
I'll be done for, once I leave here.</i>

184
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,200
<i>Han Kang obviously called me here
to fire me. Why isn't he coming yet?</i>

185
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,570
It's in here.

186
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,590
Go ahead.

187
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,180
Didn't you twist your ankle?

188
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,970
I'm sorry about earlier.

189
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,950
I shouldn't have disturbed you
when you were eating.

190
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,580
<i>He now knows how to apologize?</i>

191
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,940
Why are you still sitting there?
The ice is melting.

192
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,180
I bought some rheumatism ointment.

193
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,610
It's cold! It's cold! It's cold!

194
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,790
You have to use ice water
to compress twisted ankles.

195
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,800
I know.

196
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,900
<i>Because I taught you that.</i>

197
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,490
What's this?

198
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,640
You don't even recognize your own purse?

199
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,769
Ah, I left it here.

200
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,050
I thought I lost it.

201
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,539
<i>This is used for mountain climbing.</i>

202
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,490
Spray it on your ankle frequently.

203
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,350
<i>Are you really Han Kang?</i>

204
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,420
Why are you always looking at me like that?

205
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,080
Because you're always giving me things.

206
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,230
You don't have anything else to give me?

207
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,200
You don't trust me?

208
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,189
You're not a child either,

209
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,639
so why do you carry around a whistle
like a child?

210
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,019
Whistle?

211
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,948
After a person who worked here ran away,

212
00:20:26,949 --> 00:20:28,489
how could I not flip through your purse?

213
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,290
You didn't even say anything.

214
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,139
This?

215
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,760
Someone could've bought this for me
to use in times of danger.

216
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,019
<i>Hey! Transfer student.</i>

217
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,150
<i>Help me retrieve my bike.</i>

218
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,790
<i>We're almost there! We're almost there!</i>

219
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,019
- Be careful! Be careful! Be careful!
- Hey, be careful of yourself.

220
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,969
If you fall again, you're dead for sure.

221
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,189
I got it.

222
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,150
Hey, let go. Don't hold onto it.

223
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,100
We didn't die right?

224
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,600
Transfer Student, what's wrong?

225
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,920
Move.

226
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,180
What's wrong? Did you get hurt?

227
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,459
You twisted your ankle.
Why weren't you more careful?

228
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,100
Get out of the way.

229
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,809
Here, let me do it.

230
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,180
Let go.

231
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,510
My dad bought this for me to use
when I'm in an emergency.

232
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,579
It's all better.

233
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,149
Thank you.

234
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,580
Sit down.

235
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,649
I have to get back to work.

236
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,709
It's completely fine now.

237
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,890
I have something to tell you, so sit down.

238
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,380
What do you want to say?

239
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,249
I have a bad temper.

240
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,250
Being tired, complex and nerve-racking...

241
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,989
I can't tolerate these.

242
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:15,969
I know.

243
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,490
You know?

244
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,519
Being tired, complex and nerve-racking,

245
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,130
what kind of person likes those?

246
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,160
So...

247
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,969
<i>For you.</i>

248
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,519
The first day you came here,

249
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,889
I remember you saying that you want the job
for one week at least and 48 days at most.

250
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:40,670
I calculated the money for or 50 days,
at 4 dollars an hour, then multiplied by 12.

251
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,720
What do you mean?

252
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,479
Are you firing me now?

253
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,969
Not firing.

254
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,709
I never needed to hire you
in the first place,

255
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,459
So just see it as me helping you
through a difficult time.

256
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,348
Since I've already started helping,
I might as well help thoroughly.

257
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:56,060
So you're telling me
to take this money and leave.

258
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,220
You can put it that way.

259
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,659
So you were kind to me because of this.

260
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,960
You let me compress my ankle
and then you gave me that.

261
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:11,320
To be honest, I don't even have anything
to say about being fired.

262
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:15,239
If you wanted to fire me,
then you should've fired me before.

263
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,820
Why did you have to make someone feel
at ease, then stab a knife behind her back?

264
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,350
Stab a knife behind her back?

265
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,849
Why would I ever do that?

266
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,779
Song, after you came,

267
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,549
there wasn't one day that went smoothly.

268
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,360
Why must I be angry and annoyed
because of you?

269
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:38,189
I was just saying...
But I am not a beggar.

270
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,169
What about me?

271
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,299
Do you think that I have more money
than I could ever spend?

272
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,120
Even without this money, I wouldn't starve.
So that's why I gave it to you.

273
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:45,489
Same with me.

274
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,830
I would fire me too so I can't ask you
to go easy on me again but...

275
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:57,140
I must earn the money I spend.

276
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,020
<i>Kang.</i>

277
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,350
<i>If even you turn me away,
I'll really be alone.</i>

278
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,150
No. No. Definitely not.

279
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,619
Seeing that you said you need
to be home before 12,

280
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,859
it seems like someone's sick.

281
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,795
Also because of issues
with my closest friend and the fiance,

282
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:24,049
I don't have time to deal with this.

283
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,059
Plus you're distressed
to the state of starvation.

284
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,270
Could I bear to let you go with nothing?

285
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,100
That's okay.

286
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,820
Because during this period of time,
I received a lot of care from you.

287
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,429
You seriously...

288
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,660
What exactly do you want me to do?

289
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,110
I just want...

290
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,990
you to allow me to stay here.

291
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,720
Go eat upstairs.

292
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,579
I will calculate your pay accurately
to every minute and second.

293
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,949
Otherwise the other workers might complain.

294
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,870
In the future, go get it at the bar counter.

295
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,250
Why are you crying?

296
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,500
I have tears so I'm crying.

297
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,189
Why do you have tears?

298
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,639
I already said I'm not firing you.

299
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,289
Because I'm grateful.

300
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:40,050
I'm honestly very grateful,
that's why I'm tearful.

301
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,840
You're grateful?

302
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,809
Ji Hyun's wedding tomorrow
has already been cancelled.

303
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,750
Help me make calls to inform everyone.

304
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,269
Yes, sir.

305
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,459
<i>Also,</i>

306
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,769
I'll have to ask you to stay with Ji Hyun
at the hospital room for tonight.

307
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:03,730
Today I have to stay
by Ji Hyun's mother's side.

308
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,409
Is that okay?

309
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,599
Of course.

310
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,650
It's alright father.

311
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,370
Seal?

312
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,620
I haven't seen it.

313
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,830
Okay then.

314
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,839
Tomorrow we have a major cleaning.

315
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,359
If you find it,
do you need me to contact you?

316
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,390
Can you contact me?

317
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,480
It's here.

318
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,600
Miss Shin In Jung?

319
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,699
Ah, you're that Miss Shin In Jung.

320
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,489
What?

321
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,439
Ji Hyun always said to make Miss In Jung
look beautiful.

322
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,979
You don't know how picky she was
about the bridesmaid dresses.

323
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,659
<i>She said among the groom's group of friends,
there's a major hottie.</i>

324
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,590
<i>She already arranged him
to be Miss In Jung's partner.</i>

325
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,899
<i>She also said she wanted to show
Miss In Jung the bridesmaid dresses,</i>

326
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,980
<i>so she left wearing it.</i>

327
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,168
If we can't find the seal,

328
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:15,259
We'll still continue
directly from our position.

329
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,779
We can't do that. Let's wait awhile.

330
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,219
If you continue to wait pointlessly
like this,

331
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,079
all the money you've invested will be lost.

332
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,589
As long as Ji Hyun's land is still there,

333
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,539
the Shin family
won't be bankrupt that easily.

334
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,329
How much is Ji Hyun's land worth?

335
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,380
Plus, what are we going to do if President Shin
sells his managerial authority of Hyunmido?

336
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,249
Leader Kang.

337
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,970
The problem with President Shin's daughter
is your responsibility.

338
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,169
How could I not know that?

339
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:42,020
If you knew that, then how come
you still haven't found the seal yet?

340
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,629
She's already in that state.

341
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,150
Why do you insist on fussing
over one or two days?

342
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,569
Didn't I tell you
to stay at the main counter?

343
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,610
I'm okay.

344
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,029
Isn't there a customer?

345
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,910
You're not taking his order?

346
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,649
Unni should go.

347
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,470
Why should I?

348
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,160
Please make your order.

349
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,990
You have to give me the menu
before I can order.

350
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,920
I saw it. You can just leave.

351
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,699
What?

352
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,470
I understand pretty well how people feel.

353
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,140
Please stop bothering me.

354
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,990
Help me call over the Manager.
I want my usual.

355
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,870
The Manager isn't here.

356
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,839
Do you want something strong?

357
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,480
It's very strong.

358
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,190
[Secretary Shin]

359
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,110
Oh, Secretary Shin, what's the matter?

360
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,400
Wait a minute.

361
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,980
<i>Secretary Shin?</i>

362
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,169
What's wrong now?

363
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,480
Don't cry. What's the matter?

364
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,760
What?

365
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,279
In Jung. It's been 2 years.

366
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,780
This plan took 2 years of our efforts.

367
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,630
<i>But now you're...</i>

368
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,719
<i>You should go to the hospital first.</i>

369
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,250
I'll go to the hospital.
We'll talk when I get there.

370
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,470
2 years ago?

371
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,460
2 years of effort?

372
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:35,489
<i>I met Min Ho oppa in December of 2009.</i>

373
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:37,280
<i>That's about 2 years ago.</i>

374
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,260
<i>Spending effort...</i>

375
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,960
<i>Then... then...</i>

376
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,940
Miss Song Yi Kyung.

377
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,779
You're called Song Yi Kyung right?

378
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,169
You seem to memorize people's names quickly.

379
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,030
Yes, Miss Song Yi Kyung,

380
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,359
I have a request.

381
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,489
Please stop doing meaningless things.

382
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,459
I'm very clear about women like you.

383
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,729
You completely see men
as single cellular organisms.

384
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,539
Because you've watched too many dramas.

385
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,340
You're the type of woman to keep him distant
at first then move in to steal his heart.

386
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,120
I think that's
the most boring type of women.

387
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,519
What did you say?

388
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,450
So, please stop doing
such meaningless things.

389
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,959
You think that I'm doing this now
because I have feelings for you?

390
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,889
That's the next step.

391
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,850
Denying it to catch their attention.

392
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,949
I thought you're only at
memorizing people's names,

393
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,009
You must be good at being delusional too.

394
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,689
No matter how good I am at acting,

395
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,730
would I be anywhere near as good as you?

396
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,179
You said acting.

397
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,190
Even though you have manners,
you have no sincerity.

398
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,260
Your face also isn't your real one.

399
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,169
Since you understand psychology very well,

400
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,689
you must use people and trick them often.

401
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,740
It's hot! It's hot!

402
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,390
<i>Shin Ji Hyun.</i>

403
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,380
Do you underestimate my warning?

404
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,469
Even if it's your heart,

405
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,480
You can't overly express your true identity.

406
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,909
Remember.

407
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:31,330
If the necklace breaks,
the 49 days are over.

408
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,190
What are you doing?

409
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,250
Didn't you say
you're the Manager's friend's fiance?

410
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,679
I misunderstood your attempt to seduce me.

411
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,970
So I'm just angry.

412
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,180
<i>What are you doing?</i>

413
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:34,229
That's the first time
I've seen you look in a mirror.

414
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,679
Stop caring about me.

415
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,759
I'd like to, but I can't.

416
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,030
We already know each other, you see.

417
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,160
Try to remember me.

418
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,650
We've even shared many conversations...

419
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,939
about why
you went to the accident site that day.

420
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,410
What that mark on your wrist is...

421
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,450
I'm a person who knows a lot about you.

422
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,130
Do you remember now?

423
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,120
Long time no see.

424
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,670
Stop it.

425
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,660
I don't want to remember.

426
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:35,170
Go to my mother, you say?
You went to see my mother?

427
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:39,030
She stands waiting for you every day.

428
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,120
Not yet.

429
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,140
Then it could be too late.

430
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,979
Mother keeps getting worse.

431
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:53,590
It's okay. You don't know my mother.

432
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,500
Until I go to her, she won't leave.

433
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,250
But we have enough money now.

434
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:08,570
Let's take it and go live with mother
overseas.

435
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,840
You brought up mother so you could say that?

436
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:20,450
Both your mother and Ji Hyun's dad
nags my conscience.

437
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:27,440
Ji Hyun's already like that... taking her
father's company on top of that is too cruel.

438
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:35,370
This... this isn't what I wanted.

439
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,700
No, this is it.

440
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:47,180
To get here...
do you remember what you and I had to go through?

441
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,040
In Jung, hurry up!

442
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,019
In Jung.

443
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,249
Huh?

444
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,590
<i>Let's go!</i>

445
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,170
In Jung!

446
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,210
In Jung!

447
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,390
I remember everything even without
you telling it all again, so stop!

448
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,410
No, I think I have to.

449
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,820
For your sake, I need to.

450
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,990
<i>You can't come? I thought you already left.</i>

451
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:09,740
<i>I did. But my senior called me.</i>

452
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,129
I told you right? That I have a blind date.

453
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,490
I forgot that it was today.

454
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,989
<i>You are the one that organized this to
apologize for what happened in the mountains.</i>

455
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,309
I know.

456
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,949
<i>I will tell senior I can't go.</i>

457
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,939
Which is more important,
coming to the movies or your blind date?

458
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,710
- Hey, are you joking with me?
- Are you joking with me?

459
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,099
How can a man watch a movie by himself?!

460
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,539
<i>Ji Hyun.</i>

461
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,110
Ji Hyun?

462
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,199
Have a good blind date.

463
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,369
- Bye.
- Gosh, really?

464
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,620
If you intended to make up,
why did you cry and ask for comfort?

465
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,640
<i>It's fine, kiddo.</i>

466
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,990
Excuse me!

467
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,119
Do you remember me?

468
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,890
<i>Last week in the Ohon Mountains.</i>

469
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:08,290
That's how we got here.
And tomorrow is our marriage.

470
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:14,459
If Ji Hyun didn't turn out like this,
our plan would be completed...

471
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:20,010
and President Shin and I
would be strangers again.

472
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:25,880
Father also knows that Ji Hyun's recovery
is practically impossible.

473
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,720
Do you think President Shin
will simply watch by his daughter's side?

474
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,719
He'll have to think about his business
and decide what to do about Kang Min Ho.

475
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,320
That's why...

476
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,589
I apologize,
could you come back in a little while?

477
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,200
Yes, sir.

478
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,800
His daughter isn't here.

479
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,579
Would he entrust the business to me now?

480
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,739
That's why we should leave...

481
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:06,930
Does your heart hurt because you know Ji Hyun made
you her maid of honor to set you up with a suitable man?

482
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,710
You started all this because of Ji Hyun.

483
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,550
Isn't that what made you so angry at her?

484
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,780
Is that all you wanted?

485
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:25,250
You wanted to see her healthy
and watch her fall to ruin,

486
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,489
but now that she's like this
it doesn't mean anything to you anymore?

487
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:33,649
Is that why you're telling me to take our
stolen goods and escape into the night!?

488
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:36,760
Enough! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

489
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,314
I'm sorry.

490
00:41:42,778 --> 00:41:44,482
I couldn't see you through the end.

491
00:41:44,517 --> 00:41:45,910
No,

492
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,440
I'm sorry.

493
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:56,780
I'm sorry for all of it.

494
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:43,620
So it was all planned?

495
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:53,270
Saving my life and meeting again...

496
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,540
I had thought Min-ho oppa was my destiny.

497
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,820
The one to make me think that...

498
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:07,260
it was all planned?

499
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,940
<i>Ji Hyun, forgive me.</i>

500
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,890
<i>Don't forgive me.</i>

501
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,140
<i>I won't ask for it either.</i>

502
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:23,420
You played around with my life and my heart.

503
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:28,679
For money? Just for money?

504
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,960
<i>It's your fault too.</i>

505
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:38,019
<i>Please know that you made me like this.</i>

506
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,759
Then I got into an accident
because of you two.

507
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,570
I died!

508
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,380
Do you know? Do you know it all?

509
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:53,590
You're quite relaxed to the end, aren't you?

510
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,360
What?

511
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:02,700
Even though it turns out like this,
you aren't hurt.

512
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:13,150
It might be better that you don't know.

513
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:20,390
Better that I don't know?
I know it all, you bitch!

514
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:05,210
Right, it's there. I put it in there.

515
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,380
What can I do?

516
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:27,139
<i>A Scheduler does not get involved
in human affairs.</i>

517
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,759
Then, just go and get my seal out for me,

518
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,709
- Yeah?
- Repeat.

519
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:35,190
A Scheduler does not get involved
in human affairs.

520
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:12,979
<i>56...</i>

521
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,790
57...

522
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,890
58...

523
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,970
<i>59...</i>

524
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:53,630
<i>42 days, 3 hours, 29 minutes left</i>

525
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:44,739
<i>Yo, wait wait wait wait.</i>

526
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,529
<i>I'm not a messenger from the nether world,
I'm a scheduler.</i>

527
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:51,009
<i>When I don't pick up the phone,
please hang up.</i>

528
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:55,110
<i>I'll call you back later,
I'm in the middle of a schedule.</i>

529
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,890
Just a moment.

530
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,769
Why aren't you hanging up?

531
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:10,520
Where are you?

532
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:14,000
I won't tell you to come here,
so just tell me where you are.

533
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:18,050
Where!?

534
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:21,950
<i>Hold this out and swim.</i>

535
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:27,089
<i>After you stretch out,
then you push forward...</i>

536
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:29,470
What is he doing here?

537
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:32,139
Where is he?

538
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:35,100
Good job, just like that.

539
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,729
Can he do that with a human?

540
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,950
Oh, you're here!

541
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,800
See you.

542
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,670
Where are we?

543
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:57,570
We're still in your neighborhood.

544
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:06,080
But, how can you...

545
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,409
Is that girl also a Scheduler?

546
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:13,380
Without this kind of skill,
how would I become a Scheduler?

547
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,080
But enough, what do you have to say?

548
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,740
No matter what it takes, I'm going
to get my seal out of the hospital room.

549
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,139
And then, I'll tell dad what
Kang Min Ho and Shin In Jung are doing.

550
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:32,400
So in the three rules,
you'll break 1 and 3 at the same time?

551
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,019
Then, what happens?

552
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,669
Is it straight to the elevator?

553
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:39,009
Of course. And a special express, at that.

554
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,609
As soon as you break the rules,
without even a chance to turn around,

555
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,249
game over!!

556
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,530
Goodbye, world. Sayonara. Zai jian.

557
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:51,489
I won't run away,
so delay it for just one hour.

558
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:57,010
After you discovered your fiancee's with your best friend,
you didn't even bother living like a real person...

559
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,119
And now you'll go full speed
to auto-destruction?

560
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:04,309
Of the three people I trusted,
two of them were Min Ho oppa and In Jung.

561
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:10,729
But I need to stop them
from hurting mom and dad.

562
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:14,569
Losing me and the company,
I can't let it happen.

563
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:17,200
Yes, you can�t do that.

564
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,009
<i>5 minutes left!</i>

565
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:22,770
Hey! Wait here!

566
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,340
Hey!

567
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,350
When did he change?

568
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:50,050
Sweetheart, wake up. Sweetheart?

569
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,820
Sweetheart.

570
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:17,259
Oh Mi Young, you have died.

571
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,459
What?

572
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,729
What? Did that scare you?

573
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:26,149
You must have worked hard to
waste away your time.

574
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,019
I died?

575
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:33,200
Instead of your love, the married man.

576
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:39,719
I don't know this woman. We just met.

577
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,169
Why do I have to wait until the police come?

578
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,629
You don't know me?!

579
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:45,189
Hey, Kang Tae Song,

580
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:47,459
you're the one who seduced me
and said you'd divorce your wife!

581
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,440
And then you pretend not to know me
when I'm dead!?

582
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:54,749
So, why date this kind of man?

583
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,250
Okay.

584
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,919
Let's get on.

585
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,820
Are you crazy? Why would I go? I won't go!

586
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,330
Let's go.

587
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:26,919
No, no, I won't go.

588
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,139
I won't go. Let go of me.

589
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,189
I won't go!

590
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:32,690
Let go! Let go!

591
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:38,490
That woman...
why is she being taken like that?

592
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:42,770
Last time with the man, it wasn't like that.

593
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:46,020
We treat you as well
as you lived in this neighborhood.

594
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,400
Isn't it obvious?

595
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:09,559
Shall we have a cup of coffee while we chat?

596
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,729
I don't have time. I have an appointment.

597
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,030
Just promise me,
just one hour! I won't run away.

598
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,919
I know, you won't run away
and get on without a fuss.

599
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,050
Be sure to get permission from upstairs.

600
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:23,199
I can't trust you, right?

601
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,800
Lies are for humans!

602
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:28,670
Okay.

603
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:31,099
Thank you for everything,

604
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:36,620
but when I go to your neighborhood,
can we still see each other?

605
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,900
Why would you want to?

606
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:41,589
It'd be sad if I couldn't.

607
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:43,480
I've gotten quite used to you.

608
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:45,369
Why are you like this?

609
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:49,959
Not sobbing, and acting cool.
It's not like you.

610
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,409
I won't sob and look pathetic.

611
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:55,130
Why should I, after being conned.

612
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:58,569
You get angry after being conned.

613
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,959
You'll entrust yourself
to your vengeance, then?

614
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:06,700
Fine, it's your decision.
I'll just ferry you over.

615
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:11,589
I wouldn't be dragged off like that,
would I?

616
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:14,210
We'll have to wait and see.

617
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:19,140
You'll be there
when I get on the elevator, right?

618
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:22,620
What exactly do you use your brain for?

619
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:25,499
When people become a spirit, their
IQ usually increases.

620
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,910
I've given it as much thought as I should.

621
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,010
I have to go!

622
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,130
She doesn't even ask for a ride.

623
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:43,360
The women in this neighborhood
are so fierce.

624
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,940
Let's go.

625
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:28,899
I've called Driver Cha, so go to
the department store to buy beef bones and abalone.

626
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,910
But the madam barely eats any seaweed soup.

627
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:34,179
I came on Manager Kang's request.

628
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,959
I'll be cleaning Ji Hyun's room.

629
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,549
I clean Ji Hyun's room every day.

630
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:41,059
On top of the closet, under the bed
and the sofa... You don't clean though.

631
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:45,750
Does Ji Hyun's mother know
how much dust has gathered there?

632
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,140
Shop closing day?

633
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,220
What?

634
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:53,540
Why didn't they tell me?

635
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:20,880
Of all a woman's days,
this is the most beautiful.

636
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:32,170
Today is your wedding day, do you know?

637
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:40,280
Do you know and still won't come back
or won't come back because you don't know?

638
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:49,159
I'd rather I could take your place.

639
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,630
You promised not to cry in front of Ji Hyun.

640
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:57,800
Mother.

641
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,480
Excuse me.

642
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:34,210
The dolls... the ones with fur
aren't good for the patients.

643
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:07,659
Hey, Han Kang. If the shop's closed today,
you should've told me!

644
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:09,810
I'm so short on time!

645
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,819
Song Yi Kyung, what are you doing here?

646
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:20,120
What could I be doing at a hospital?

647
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,900
What...

648
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:28,640
There's nothing definitive,
but I'm taking tests...

649
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:35,469
<i>Did you come here for me?</i>

650
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,879
Do you go to this hospital?

651
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,070
I can't say that I do, but I have to go!

652
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:45,930
Is she really ill?

653
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:59,980
Father, we're leaving.

654
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:01,710
Go ahead.

655
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,190
Mother.

656
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,670
- Father.
- Go.

657
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:42,460
Where could she have put it!

658
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:57,300
Where's Kang?

659
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:00,510
Maybe he's in the car?

660
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:13,430
Why haven't you called?

661
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,939
I couldn't find it.
No matter how much I search.

662
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:21,139
What could've happened?

663
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:23,369
Not there?
Are you sure you checked everywhere?

664
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:27,800
I tore this room apart.
Even looked at every piece of clothing.

665
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:31,419
Oppa, Oppa!

666
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:35,150
Clean up and come out.
They just left for home.

667
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:18,570
Isn't he so cute?

668
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,379
And this one, even cuter.

669
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:23,429
The first present that your significant other
gave you was a stuffed Kangaroo?

670
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:28,469
What do you take Min Ho for?
And a necklace.

671
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:29,619
Anything else in there?

672
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,009
Just this for today.

673
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:32,869
From now on you're my treasure chest.

674
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:36,549
<i>I'll put the necklace in here.
Also the seal goes in here.</i>

675
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:38,200
It's there.

676
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,900
Driver, Minseng Hospital, please. Hurry!

677
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,139
<i>The guardian...</i>

678
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:09,480
What happened to the stuffed animals here?

679
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:12,450
They took them back to the house.

680
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:22,300
Oppa, answer the phone!

681
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:37,660
Why won't he answer?

682
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:55,070
Driver, please hurry. Hurry.

683
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:58,060
I'm in a rush, step on it.

684
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,950
<i>Who is it?</i>

685
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:03,730

695

Legally incompetent?

<i>You can only live for 40 days?
