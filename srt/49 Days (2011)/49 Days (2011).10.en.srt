Episode 10

4
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,778
Who are you?

5
00:00:46,268 --> 00:00:48,002
You...

6
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:50,521
Are you Ji Hyun?

7
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:10,128
You're Ji Hyun?
Aren't you?

8
00:01:11,264 --> 00:01:14,100
Now... what are you talking about?

9
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:16,027
In Jinan. In the music hall.

10
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:18,000
The song you switched and
sang in minor key.

11
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:20,508
I saw you playing the piano
while singing.

12
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,021
<i>You say you saw me?
When did you see me?</i>

13
00:01:26,895 --> 00:01:29,403
The piano... That song...

14
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:32,344
Your gestures, mannerisms,
facial expressions.

15
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,300
All that is Shin Ji Hyun.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,900
Switching to a minor key

17
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,903
and singing it like trot,

18
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,110
anyone who plays the piano
can do that.

19
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:47,189
Besides, this is a very famous song.
C'est Si Bon (trot group) even played it.

20
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:49,752
It's not just the singing
in minor key!

21
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:52,814
It's the feeling I get.

22
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:54,968
That's ridiculous!

23
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:56,900
I graduated from
Chuncheon Girls High School.

24
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,415
<i>I lived there after graduating,</i>

25
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:01,511
<i>and didn't move to Seoul until
I started university.</i>

26
00:02:01,762 --> 00:02:02,771
Jinan?

27
00:02:02,912 --> 00:02:05,078
I don't even know where Jinan is.

28
00:02:05,322 --> 00:02:07,150
But why do you say
I'm someone else?

29
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,125
- Does that even make sense?
- It doesn't.

30
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:11,204
It doesn't make sense.

31
00:02:11,687 --> 00:02:12,700
It's a feeling I get.

32
00:02:12,785 --> 00:02:14,261
I'm telling you
it's the feeling I get!!

33
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,700
If you're not Shin Ji Hyun, then
why do you seem like her?!

34
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:18,700
Why do I feel this way?!

35
00:02:19,563 --> 00:02:21,118
Why are you asking me that?

36
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:24,586
<i>Kang, please don't be this way.</i>

37
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,200
Hey, isn't the spring sun
is great. Yeah?

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,929
Yi Kyung...

39
00:02:35,092 --> 00:02:37,419
did you forget
we're closed today again?

40
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,400
Yes. Did you go somewhere?

41
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:43,600
We ran out of piano cleaning supplies.

42
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:55,500
This... isn't something
just anyone can touch.

43
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,289
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:57,496 --> 00:03:00,000
I didn't know.
I just played this piano.

45
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:02,212
So it's no surprise he
lost his temper.

46
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:05,488
It was the only thing Kang's mother
left for him, after she died.

47
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh...

48
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,007
<i>Han Kang...
how did you know?</i>

49
00:03:32,702 --> 00:03:34,927
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

50
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,100
<i>What do I do if Kang continues
to suspect me?</i>

51
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,300
<i>I must've looked like a madman.</i>

52
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,938
- About that...
- It seems that...

53
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:04,479
I resemble your friend?

54
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,198
Yes, you seem like her.

55
00:04:08,506 --> 00:04:11,884
But now that I think about it,
you're not that similar.

56
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:14,649
Then I'll leave now.

57
00:04:15,226 --> 00:04:17,502
Before you go,
give me your number

58
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,686
Tell me your
cell phone number.

59
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:31,500
If you make others worry,
you should at least call.

60
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,427
You're so inconsiderate.

61
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:37,408
Why were you
like that yesterday?

62
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:39,870
Did something happen
at home?

63
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:43,651
I wasn't feeling well so
I wanted to rest.

64
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:45,931
But you weren't at home?

65
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:49,287
Did you come to my house?

66
00:04:54,374 --> 00:04:55,914
Who is it?

67
00:05:00,232 --> 00:05:04,832
You ran out like a crazy person...
how could I not be worried?

68
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,711
<i>Does he care that much about
Song Yi Kyung? But...</i>

69
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:11,447
<i>was the reason he lost his temper
because he can sense</i> 

70
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:13,379
<i>my presence in Song Yi Kyung?</i> 

71
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,802
Here you go.

72
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:23,358
- If you ever need help...
- I'm leaving.

73
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,699
<i>The tears flow with the pain
penetrating my heart</i>

74
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:50,825
<i>The person who can cry alongside you</i>

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,628
<i>Even if the world turns its back on you</i>

76
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:05,600
<i>The person who will still be first
to grasp your hand</i>

77
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,657
<i>No matter when you call out</i>

78
00:06:09,922 --> 00:06:13,230
<i>This person will rush to your side</i>

79
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:20,303
<i>Why don't you know, that person is me?</i>

80
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:24,031
<i>Can I not be?</i>

81
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:27,758
<i>Can I really not be?</i>

82
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:31,100
<i>I'll bring a smile to your face...</i>

83
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:33,690
<i>Han Kang likes
Song Yi Kyung too.</i>

84
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:37,244
<i>I don't have any friends
who love me.</i>

85
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:43,449
<i>The only ones who truly love me...
are Dad and Mom.</i>

86
00:06:45,101 --> 00:06:51,587
<i>That person, can't that person be me?</i>

87
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,600
You choosing different
pastries today.

88
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:56,967
My Dad...

89
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:58,900
I'm giving them to someone.

90
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:02,334
That's right. Kang's shop is
closed today.

91
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:04,600
Do you have some
time right now?

92
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:06,752
I do have time. Why?

93
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:08,976
Since you like pastries,

94
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:11,200
please help us taste test
some dessert pastries.

95
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,530
<i>It was in this very spot</i>

96
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,770
<i>that Seo Woo and I would often sit
eating pastries and chatting.</i>

97
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,368
- Is this your first time here?
- Huh?

98
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,500
Yes... it's my first time.

99
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:36,451
This place is decorated
very nicely.

100
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:40,168
My friend really liked
that seat too.

101
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:42,624
Really?

102
00:07:52,824 --> 00:07:57,420
Wow, it's soft and tasty.
Just like a cake.

103
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,107
Why is your reaction
so similar to Ji Hyun's?

104
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,371
Really?

105
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:09,779
It seems that your friend and I
have very similar tastes.

106
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:13,275
- That friend...
<i>- But that thermos,</i>

107
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:15,897
how did you end up with it?

108
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:17,024
What?

109
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:21,030
In Jung, is she in a relationship
with your brother?

110
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:22,349
My brother?

111
00:08:22,398 --> 00:08:25,312
Did she use that thermos to
bring your brother some soup,

112
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:27,659
porridge or something like that?

113
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,073
I don't have an older brother
or a younger brother.

114
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:35,868
Then how did you end up with
the thermos that In Jung took out?

115
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:41,885
That... You should go ask
Shin In Jung.

116
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,751
I can't say.

117
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:46,700
Is it In Jung
who won't let you tell?

118
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,673
Why are you being like this?
You're putting me in a tough position.

119
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:53,200
Just who is he to make you
act like this?

120
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,047
Could it be that person?

121
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,200
<i>Seo Woo, you're gradually starting
to forget me too.</i>

122
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,300
Here.

123
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:24,546
What are you doing?

124
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:30,413
We've been married so long and
you still can't take a joke?

125
00:09:30,793 --> 00:09:33,408
Is this your idea of a joke?

126
00:09:34,263 --> 00:09:37,400
This is a really childish joke.

127
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,811
Honey!

128
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:43,969
What's wrong with you? Huh?

129
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:46,000
Ji Hyun's dad!

130
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:52,667
Oppa, do you remember...?

131
00:09:52,868 --> 00:09:55,894
This is the last place we ate before
you left to go study abroad.

132
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,688
Because you cried so hard,
we decided never to come here again.

133
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,966
The owner seems to still
remember us.

134
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:03,656
Really?

135
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:06,653
Then we better hurry up
and leave.

136
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:11,069
Let's eat quickly and
go for a drive.

137
00:10:11,164 --> 00:10:12,852
I really want to go to Yangsuri.

138
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:14,386
Didn't I mention that

139
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:16,100
after visiting the hospital,
I've a meeting?

140
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:19,002
Oh, you did say that.

141
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:21,051
<i>Oppa...</i>

142
00:10:21,238 --> 00:10:24,279
don't mention the hospital or
Ji Hyun in front of me.

143
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:26,407
I want to forget about all that.

144
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:28,634
Ok, I'll do as you wish.

145
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:30,087
Also...

146
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:32,400
I'm quitting tomorrow.

147
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:33,726
Tomorrow?

148
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:36,234
After that ghost incident with
the seal for the will,

149
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,241
I no longer want to stay
at the company.

150
00:10:38,454 --> 00:10:40,253
What will and ghost incident?

151
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,818
There are rumors

152
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:44,760
circulating at the company
that a ghost interfered with the will.

153
00:10:44,814 --> 00:10:46,747
Everyone keeps asking
me about it.

154
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:49,020
They even bother me
when I go to the restroom.

155
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,907
Those people are really something.

156
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,899
The seal just fell off
the table accidentally.

157
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,720
The circulating rumor is that

158
00:10:56,801 --> 00:11:00,300
the seal fell down to prevent you from
inheriting the company.

159
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:01,646
What?

160
00:11:02,407 --> 00:11:05,847
The company isn't even going to
remain until he dies.

161
00:11:06,141 --> 00:11:08,787
Why did he have to
make out a will?

162
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,419
Hello.

163
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:27,147
Ah... Father.
I'm Ji Hyun's friend.

164
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:28,557
I heard from Ji Hyun

165
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:32,421
that you like these pastries,
so I brought you some.

166
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:34,000
That's good.

167
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,880
Dad!

168
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:52,756
<i>Why is Dad like this?</i>

169
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:57,106
<i>Dad, are you ill?</i>

170
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,326
<i>Did you overwork yourself
because of me?</i>

171
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,625
<i>Kang Min Ho...</i>

172
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,779
<i>you're not ashamed to keep
coming here?</i>

173
00:12:35,966 --> 00:12:37,659
What are you doing here?

174
00:12:37,727 --> 00:12:40,226
<i>You won't give up until
you get your hands on that will?!</i>

175
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,741
Are you ill?

176
00:12:41,874 --> 00:12:43,874
Did something happen?

354
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,618
President Shin won't live
for much longer.

355
00:26:00,846 --> 00:26:03,297
In a few month's time, Shin Ga
will be in my hands.

356
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:05,600
There's no need to force bankruptcy
and make the stock values crash.

357
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:07,987
You need not concern
yourself with that.

358
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:09,438
<i>All you need to do is take your portion,</i>

359
00:26:09,449 --> 00:26:11,064
and we'll take Shin Ga Industries.

360
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:13,000
I was about to sell something worth
10,000 won for 3,000. 

361
00:26:13,055 --> 00:26:14,912
And now, it turns out I can
sell it for 10,000.

362
00:26:15,002 --> 00:26:16,635
Why should I suffer
a 7,000 loss?

363
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:21,401
Why does it seem to me that you don't
want to let go of Shin Ga?

364
00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:24,200
We had a contract first.
Why would I do that?

365
00:26:24,255 --> 00:26:26,100
Then do as the contract states.
Why are you saying all this?

366
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:29,267
My relationship with Hyuk San
isn't as as simple as a contract.

367
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,250
Two years ago, when
Hyuk San's President Oh

368
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,628
bought Shin's stock under
an assumed name,

369
00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:36,054
<i>I have proof that
illicit funds were used.</i>

370
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,700
You think I decided to collaborate with
you just because... you have evidence?

371
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:45,400
I know we're collaborating because
our objectives align.

372
00:26:45,491 --> 00:26:48,090
However, I wouldn't have contacted
you if I had no evidence?

373
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,000
Hurry, get in the car.
Let's hurry to the hospital.

374
00:26:59,197 --> 00:27:02,000
You go first.
I have an appointment.

375
00:27:02,736 --> 00:27:03,965
What?

376
00:27:04,077 --> 00:27:07,000
What kind of appointment is it?
We have to go to the hospital first!

377
00:27:07,144 --> 00:27:08,943
I'll go later.

378
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,800
Hey! Shin In Jung!

379
00:27:22,318 --> 00:27:23,218
Hey, In Jung?

380
00:27:23,415 --> 00:27:24,853
Where are you right now?

381
00:27:25,181 --> 00:27:26,700
I want to see you now.

382
00:27:26,773 --> 00:27:29,310
I forgot some important documents.
I was just about to run home.

383
00:27:29,526 --> 00:27:30,517
I see.

384
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,725
Then I'll go to your house.

385
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,700
<i>The password is probably a significant
date of someone around him.</i>

386
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,000
In Jung's birthday. 0909

387
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,800
Kang Min Ho's mom's birthdate. 1107

388
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,500
[ Kang Min Ho's birthday: 1005 ]

389
00:28:31,672 --> 00:28:33,472
Ah! You scared me!

390
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,838
So Yi Kyung.
Why are you...?

391
00:28:38,663 --> 00:28:40,200
What are you doing here?

392
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:42,200
I was trying to play mud snail bride*.
(*story where housework gets done mysteriously)

393
00:28:42,341 --> 00:28:43,700
But it's no fun
now I've been caught.

394
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:44,817
Mud snail bride?

395
00:28:44,926 --> 00:28:46,800
I was planning to
return your house key.

396
00:28:46,924 --> 00:28:49,299
But, I felt guilty about leaving the laundry
half done and running out that day.

397
00:28:49,337 --> 00:28:51,300
Do you actually think
that makes sense?

398
00:28:51,373 --> 00:28:53,472
Why doesn't it make sense?

399
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,541
Don't come out, stay here.
Don't move.

400
00:29:04,764 --> 00:29:06,300
<i>Oppa!</i>

401
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,900
I'm in a hurry right now,
let's talk in the car.

402
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:24,500
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

403
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,737
Ji Hyun's father has a brain tumor.
Why didn't you tell me?!

404
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,495
In Jung, wait a second.

405
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:34,945
I heard you already knew about it.

406
00:29:35,001 --> 00:29:38,464
<i>That's why Ji Hyun's father went
and made out a will today.</i>

407
00:29:38,537 --> 00:29:41,336
<i>But why didn't you tell me?</i>

408
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,200
Because I was worried
it would be too hard on you.

409
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:44,900
What?

410
00:29:44,937 --> 00:29:48,830
I knew how you would feel if you found
out that President Shin has a brain tumor.

411
00:29:49,011 --> 00:29:52,510
Are you sure it wasn't because it would
be a bother to comfort me?

412
00:29:53,267 --> 00:29:55,767
Let's leave first.
Director Jung is waiting.

413
00:29:57,772 --> 00:30:00,072
Hurry and declare bankruptcy.

414
00:30:01,836 --> 00:30:03,661
Shin In Jung!

415
00:30:04,362 --> 00:30:06,629
Why are you getting angry?

416
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:09,355
<i>That was the original plan.</i>

417
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:12,540
Don't just think of yourself,
you should consider my opinion too!

418
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,290
In Jung, calm down.

419
00:30:16,918 --> 00:30:18,677
As soon as Ji Hyun became like that,

420
00:30:18,978 --> 00:30:21,900
the plan had already become
meaningless to me.

421
00:30:23,264 --> 00:30:24,448
I know.

422
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:27,236
I know, I know that.
Please stop being this way!

423
00:30:27,287 --> 00:30:30,299
So hurry, declare bankruptcy and hand
Shin Ga over to Hyuk San.

424
00:30:30,444 --> 00:30:32,666
<i>You just take Hae Mi Do.</i>

425
00:30:33,637 --> 00:30:35,758
Resolve this as soon as possible.

426
00:30:36,344 --> 00:30:39,036
Watching from the sidelines,
unable to leave...

427
00:30:39,257 --> 00:30:41,000
feels like hell.

428
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:01,272
I understand. Let's go.

429
00:31:01,521 --> 00:31:03,700
Let's talk about the rest
on the way out.

430
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,187
I have an appointment with President Oh
and need to change my clothes.

431
00:31:08,926 --> 00:31:10,500

433
00:32:49,714 --> 00:32:51,914

to you later.

Dad... What do I do?!

438
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:17,308
Until Shin Ga Industries is in my hands,
I won't declare bankruptcy.

00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,100
<i>Kang Min Ho is calling.</i>

440
00:34:28,183 --> 00:34:29,981
<i>I said Kang Min Ho is calling.</i>

Why are you looking for

455
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:49,500
She didn't come today.

456
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:50,933
Then give me
her home address.

457
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:53,191
I'm in a rush to contact her
about a job opening.

458
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,801
I don't know
where she lives either.

459
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:58,204
Alright, I got it. Bye.

460
00:36:17,045 --> 00:36:18,655
She came about 20 minutes ago.

461
00:36:18,768 --> 00:36:20,920
She looked really tired
so I told her to rest.

462
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:23,746
Hey. Tell her to drink this
while it's hot.

463
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,113
Drink it.

00:36:45,535 --> 00:36:47,538
Did you not eat again?

What have you been doing
that you didn't even eat?

I want to meet him and see how
impressive he is.

502
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,900

going to see him?

<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

504

You weren't like this before

00:38:41,394 --> 00:38:43,393
Isn't it because of that man?

<i>You little brat.</i>

How can you treat

You even lived with Ji Hyun's family
and are obliged to them.

509

I'm obliged to her...

510

so I have to like her?

511
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,000
What?

512
00:38:58,226 --> 00:38:59,451
That's right.

00:38:59,668 --> 00:39:01,492
I don't like Ji Hyun...

514
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,400
I've come to dislike her.

Do I not have that right?

516
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,200
Hey, In Jung.
Why are you like this?

Do you always like Ji Hyun?

00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:11,240
Of course I do!

be separated from us,</i>

That was so long ago,
why bring it up?

522

Why do you dislike Ji Hyun?

523
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,762
Jin Hyun...

524
00:39:27,213 --> 00:39:31,281
is someone who thinks that
the world revolves around her.

00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,121
That when she's asleep,

526
00:39:34,612 --> 00:39:36,400
she thinks that the world stops.

527
00:39:36,454 --> 00:39:39,173
So what? Did she do
something to hurt you?

528
00:39:39,201 --> 00:39:41,300

Find out the address for
this cell phone number.

531
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:52,226
How much time do I have?

532
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,319
Find out by tomorrow morning.

533
00:40:01,513 --> 00:40:04,387
<i>I guess I'm just a creep...</i>

534
00:40:04,511 --> 00:40:08,600
<i>When there's trouble between us...</i>

535
00:40:10,513 --> 00:40:14,013
Ah... an uninvited guest arrives.

536
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,000
The tear you mentioned,
what is it exactly?

537
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:18,213
You don't know what a tear is?

538
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:20,600
I'm searching for people who
truly love me.

539
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,385
Why do I need tears as proof?!

540
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,400
Why are you venting your anger on
the Scheduler after seeing your friends?

541
00:40:29,454 --> 00:40:31,100
They could just be feeling it.

542
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:32,846
It's possible they could
truly love me,

543
00:40:33,028 --> 00:40:34,300
but just aren't able to cry.

544
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:39,035
Tears... are the best indicator
of a person's feelings.

545
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:40,450
<i>Humans only cry...</i>

546
00:40:40,558 --> 00:40:42,807

<i>Overcome with happiness,
overcome with sadness,</i>

548
00:40:44,707 --> 00:40:47,400
Overcome with loneliness,
overcome with grievances.

And so on and so forth.

550
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,500
There are also tears of deception,
and also tears of malice,

551
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:55,189
But we can distinguish
between those.

552
00:40:55,443 --> 00:40:57,100
So, what's the problem?

553
00:40:57,219 --> 00:40:58,973
Because I don't believe it.

554
00:40:59,054 --> 00:41:00,983
Each and every one of
my friends...

555
00:41:01,221 --> 00:41:03,331
It just can't possibly be!

556
00:41:04,033 --> 00:41:06,414
You always blame others.

557
00:41:06,601 --> 00:41:09,600
Can you shed tears of
100 percent purity for another person?

558
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,379
What?

559
00:41:10,408 --> 00:41:11,724
Shin Ji Hyun...

560
00:41:11,899 --> 00:41:14,800
can you really shed tears of
100 percent purity for another person?

561
00:41:14,841 --> 00:41:16,700
Yes, yes, yes!
Of course I can!

562
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:19,711
Ah, that's exactly why
I don't like humans.

563
00:41:19,851 --> 00:41:22,182
<i>You all think you're so great.</i>

564
00:41:22,443 --> 00:41:25,160
If you haven't done it before,
then don't boast.

565
00:41:25,254 --> 00:41:27,339
Tell me the truth.

566
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:30,700
Is there anyone who...
truly loves me?

567
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:32,447
How would I know that?

568
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:34,287
I'm not in charge of that.

569
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,079
This is just so hard.

570
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,834
The human heart...

571
00:41:39,947 --> 00:41:41,528
is fickle by nature.

572
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:45,491
Forever... there's no such thing.

573
00:41:46,813 --> 00:41:51,349
<i>Love... turns into hatred.</i>

574
00:41:51,982 --> 00:41:55,913
Passion... turns into cold indifference.

575
00:41:56,616 --> 00:42:00,907
<i>Disappointment... turns into gratitude.</i>

576
00:42:01,492 --> 00:42:06,835
Resentment... turns into understanding.

577
00:42:07,501 --> 00:42:11,266
And so on... and so forth.

578
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,178
So ultimately...

579
00:42:15,612 --> 00:42:18,217
you're saying
it has to be tears.

580
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,333
If she doesn't have a sister,
then who was that woman I saw?

581
00:42:32,401 --> 00:42:34,450
Maybe it was a relative?

582
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:36,082
I told you she looked
exactly like her!

583
00:42:36,202 --> 00:42:37,700
But she acted like
she didn't know me!

584
00:42:37,767 --> 00:42:39,466
Then go confirm it!

585
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,267
You want me to go
confirm it?

586
00:42:41,282 --> 00:42:44,144
Are you curious about whether

<i>Or are you curious</i>

00:42:48,573 --> 00:42:49,439
<i>Or perhaps,</i>

590
00:42:49,502 --> 00:42:53,191
are you worried because Song Yi Kyung
seems to be having a hard time?

591
00:42:54,819 --> 00:42:57,872
Go, then you'll be able to
understand your heart.

592
00:42:59,954 --> 00:43:02,054
I think it's all three.

She clearly said there's someone,
so why isn't the light on?

596
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,100
She came right on time.

Who is she going to meet?

602
00:44:45,096 --> 00:44:46,191
What?

603
00:44:46,465 --> 00:44:48,144
She's working two jobs?

Yesterday too, you ...
That was you, wasn't it?

Do you... know me?

615
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,502
So you're saying...

616
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,828
it was definitely Song Yi Kyung.

617
00:46:45,901 --> 00:46:49,067
But it wasn't the Song Yi Kyung
that we know?

618
00:46:49,301 --> 00:46:54,800
Hae Won, if you say that again,
it'll be 30 times.

619
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,200
Is she playing two different people because
of some situation we don't know about?

620

Han Kang! If you say that
twice more, that will be 20 times.

621
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,800
The more I think about it,
the more suspicious it is.

622
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,964
It's odd to start at 48 days
and count backwards day by day.

623
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:11,239
She's been counting the
days backwards?

624
00:47:11,473 --> 00:47:13,809
I've heard of a story
about 49 days,

625
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:15,228
but not one of 48 days.

626
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:17,300
Someone with 49 days left to live
was in that story?

627
00:47:17,409 --> 00:47:19,273
When I was a young monk,

628
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:23,239
there was a man who recently entered
and just meditated in his quarters.

629
00:47:23,401 --> 00:47:25,375
He once said to someone,

630
00:47:25,562 --> 00:47:28,028
"That person...
will not come back to life."

631
00:47:28,173 --> 00:47:30,864
<i>It's a living person, so what
does he mean by come back to life?</i>

632
00:47:30,972 --> 00:47:34,292
He said he was a soul wandering
and searching for something for 49 days,

633
00:47:34,545 --> 00:47:36,280
but that he couldn't return because
his heart was murky or something...

634
00:47:36,301 --> 00:47:38,982
Don't talk about such obscure things.
Is there anything else?

635
00:47:39,001 --> 00:47:43,214

obscure right now too.

She was so kind
that it was annoying.

642

She pretended to be better than us.

643

00:53:39,287 --> 00:53:42,340
<i>I'm afraid I can't be
by your side. I'm sorry, Dad.</i>

699
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:44,914
<i>I'm sorry, Mom.</i>

700
00:53:45,307 --> 00:53:52,094
<i>{\a6}After a few days, it will be okay.</i>

701
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,481
<i>{\a6}I fell asleep after crying and laughing for so long</i>

702
00:53:56,538 --> 00:54:00,674
<i>{\a6}I lift the phone up, then put it down</i>

703
00:54:00,768 --> 00:54:03,690
<i>{\a6}I'm like a fool... just like a fool</i>

704
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:08,111
<i>{\a6}I don't know why I do this for several days</i>

705
00:54:08,149 --> 00:54:11,382
<i>{\a6}I miss you so much that it's driving me crazy</i>

706
00:54:11,401 --> 00:54:15,470
<i>{\a6}I just want to forget about you.
I must be really crazy</i>

707
00:54:15,547 --> 00:54:16,815
<i>{\a6}It's hard...</i>

708
00:54:16,881 --> 00:54:21,960
Thanks, for everything
up until now.

709
00:54:22,245 --> 00:54:31,437
<i>{\a6}When I can't even ask you
to come back....</i>

710
00:54:40,593 --> 00:54:43,356
It's truly a beautiful morning,
Han Kang!

711
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,700
Why are you so surprised?

712
00:54:46,817 --> 00:54:48,908
First time anyone's spoken
informally to you?

713
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,593
- Song Yi Kyung...
- Yes, it's Song Yi Kyung.

714
00:54:53,664 --> 00:54:55,952
Song Yi Kyung
is a year older than you.

715
00:54:56,301 --> 00:54:59,000
Maybe you don't know this because
you lived in America for 10 years,

716
00:54:59,001 --> 00:55:02,600
but in our country now, you don't need
to speak formally to your noona.

717
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:05,839
<i>This woman really has
multiple personalities.</i>

718
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,800
- What is your meaning?!
- Wait a second, wait a second.

719
00:55:08,964 --> 00:55:10,176
Just 3 minutes.

720
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,300
Just listen to me for 3 minutes.
Just 3 minutes.

721
00:55:13,464 --> 00:55:16,257
No, 2 minutes, 1 minute?

722
00:55:20,292 --> 00:55:22,300
I remember someone said,

723
00:55:22,417 --> 00:55:24,710
to let someone continue to misunderstand
her because she loved him.

724
00:55:24,877 --> 00:55:28,447
Because, that would cause
him less pain.

725
00:55:28,801 --> 00:55:31,737
It must be like that when you love
someone so much.

726
00:55:31,901 --> 00:55:34,642
Even if you're misunderstood,
you don't explain.

727
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,040
You'd rather continue to
be misunderstood

728
00:55:37,146 --> 00:55:39,407
than allow that person
to get hurt.

729
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:43,324
Do you realize you're repeating
the same thing using different wording?

730
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,268
- Am I?
- Are you?

731
00:55:45,311 --> 00:55:47,341
I can understand now,

732
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:50,270
how heartbreaking it was...

733
00:55:50,882 --> 00:55:53,510
for that person to do that.

734
00:55:55,641 --> 00:55:58,024
Hiding the feelings
in your heart,

735
00:55:58,201 --> 00:56:00,293
Is more painful than

736
00:56:00,533 --> 00:56:02,762
not knowing how you feel.

737
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,000
One minute is up.

738
00:56:07,146 --> 00:56:09,846
Then I should finish up.

739
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,500
[ Resignation Letter ]

740
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,187
Thanks for watching out for me
during this time.

741
00:56:22,701 --> 00:56:25,000
<i>Take care, Han Kang.</i>

742
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:27,113
What is this?

743
00:56:27,401 --> 00:56:28,949
A final resignation letter.

744
00:56:29,122 --> 00:56:31,406
I'm planning to leave here.

745
00:56:31,593 --> 00:56:33,600
Leave? Where are you going?

746
00:56:33,741 --> 00:56:35,436
Umm...

747
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,700
To a great place.
It's very far.

748
00:56:39,817 --> 00:56:41,800
A great place?

749
00:56:41,894 --> 00:56:45,224
<i>I'm in a rush to contact her
about a job opening.</i>

750
00:56:46,346 --> 00:56:47,875
I'm really speechless.

751
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:51,226
Your so called great place
is over there with Kang Min Ho?

752
00:56:51,723 --> 00:56:53,029
- What?
- What?

753
00:56:53,171 --> 00:56:55,125
You think I don't know?

754
00:56:55,271 --> 00:56:56,752
I'm not going to Kang Min Ho.

755
00:56:56,848 --> 00:56:59,100
To you, lying is as common
as eating rice!

756
00:56:59,217 --> 00:57:02,312
I'm not going to work
at Kang Min Ho's house!

757
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:05,000
Then, are you
going there to live?

758
00:57:06,693 --> 00:57:09,473
If you like Kang Min Ho,
you should've said so from the start.

759
00:57:09,556 --> 00:57:12,046
Why are you
confusing people?!

760
00:57:13,171 --> 00:57:15,300
What exactly is your intention?

761
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:18,890
I heard you and Shin Ji Hyun
weren't that close.

762
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:20,200
Why are you concerned
about her fiance?

763
00:57:20,242 --> 00:57:21,900
I'm not talking about my friend's
fiance right now.

764
00:57:22,023 --> 00:57:24,036
I'm talking about you!

765
00:57:24,201 --> 00:57:27,136
<i>Do you dislike the thought of Unni going to
Kang Min Ho this much?</i>

766
00:57:27,301 --> 00:57:29,601
What kind of person
are you?

767
00:57:30,038 --> 00:57:31,990
Do you live for money?

768
00:57:32,211 --> 00:57:33,400
How many faces do
you live with?

769
00:57:33,524 --> 00:57:34,727
How many truths
are there?

770
00:57:34,831 --> 00:57:37,600
Do you toy with people
with this and that face?!

771
00:57:38,482 --> 00:57:39,988
What did you do last night?

772
00:57:40,219 --> 00:57:41,700
Who was that woman
I saw last night?!

773
00:57:41,728 --> 00:57:43,420
Stop it!

774
00:57:44,896 --> 00:57:46,900
What do you want to know?

775
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:49,990
Do you want to know about
Song Yi Kyung that badly?

776
00:57:50,183 --> 00:57:52,220
<i>Song Yi Kyung is
an orphan.</i>

777
00:57:52,524 --> 00:57:55,889
She has no one to talk to
and no one to rely on.

778
00:57:56,438 --> 00:57:59,059
There isn't a single person
who loves her.

779
00:57:59,101 --> 00:58:01,300
Is that enough?

780
00:58:02,741 --> 00:58:05,616
Enjoy your life, you petty jerk!

781
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,372
Fine! Leave!

782
00:58:09,428 --> 00:58:10,760
Don't come back again!

783
00:58:10,857 --> 00:58:12,641
Don't you dare come back!

784
00:58:24,498 --> 00:58:26,589
Couldn't you...

785
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,499
have just wished me well?

786
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:33,586
This is the last time.

787
00:58:33,962 --> 00:58:36,252
You should have...

788
00:58:36,537 --> 00:58:40,381
sent me off with a smile.

789
00:58:41,812 --> 00:58:45,413
<i>You were the one that left</i>

790
00:58:45,664 --> 00:58:52,500
<i>I really wish it wasn't true</i>

791
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:57,900
<i>Nothing has happened</i>

792
00:58:57,969 --> 00:59:01,734
<i>After tonight passes</i>

793
00:59:01,802 --> 00:59:14,200
<i>If I can awaken again,
I'll start over again with you</i>

794
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,700
Did the people tending the paitent
go somewhere?

795
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:26,865
They both went home.

796
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:28,400
Oh.

797
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:34,800
<i>Shin Ji Hyun, has it been
very hard during this time?</i>

798
00:59:34,869 --> 00:59:39,579
Just wait a little longer.
I'll return to you.

799
00:59:39,962 --> 00:59:43,846
<i>We'll... leave together.</i>

800
01:00:00,197 --> 01:00:03,497
<i>I let you do what you want and
you made out a will in favour of Min Ho.</i>

801
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:07,400
- Now you listen to what I say.
- If it's reasonable, I'll listen to you.

802
01:00:07,476 --> 01:00:10,675
<i>Besides surgery,
what else can you do?</i>

803
01:00:10,801 --> 01:00:13,748
<i>What can you do for me if you
die without the surgery?!</i>

804
01:00:13,851 --> 01:00:16,579
<i>What are they saying?
It's a brain tumor.</i>

805
01:00:16,773 --> 01:00:19,350
<i>He'll die if he doesn't have surgery?</i>

806
01:00:20,625 --> 01:00:23,500
Have you... thought about
my feelings?!

807
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:27,500
I already said I won't die!
Before Ji Hyun wakes up, I won't die.

808
01:00:27,575 --> 01:00:31,324
5 months? 3 years?

809
01:00:31,401 --> 01:00:35,499
<i>It could be 10 years and
Ji Hyun still may not wake up.</i>

810
01:00:35,551 --> 01:00:39,350
<i>Dad, are you refusing
surgery because of me?</i>

811
01:00:39,401 --> 01:00:42,998
<i>Just go along with my wishes.</i>

812
01:00:43,151 --> 01:00:48,350
I... cannot allow my daughter
to lie there alone,

813
01:00:48,401 --> 01:00:50,474
<i>and go have surgery myself.</i>

814
01:00:50,501 --> 01:00:52,100
<i>Dad...</i>

815
01:00:52,201 --> 01:00:55,658
Ji Hyun is lying
in the hospital all alone.

816
01:00:56,273 --> 01:00:58,402
How can I?

817
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,198
I didn't get to make a promise.
and I didn't get to say goodbye.

818
01:01:03,401 --> 01:01:04,794
<i>Even if...</i>

819
01:01:04,931 --> 01:01:07,800
she has to leave,
I want to send her off myself.

820
01:01:07,801 --> 01:01:09,192
If she returns,

821
01:01:09,569 --> 01:01:12,100
<i>I want to be the
first one to hug her.</i>

822
01:01:13,075 --> 01:01:16,032
How can I go and have surgery...

823
01:01:17,631 --> 01:01:21,275
just so I alone can live?

824
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,745
I don't want to have surgery!

825
01:01:26,392 --> 01:01:28,925
I won't have surgery.

826
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,800
Aigoo.

827
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,009
<i>Hey, Kang.</i>

828
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,335
What is this? Huh?

829
01:01:48,481 --> 01:01:50,547
Why did you hide
something in here?

830
01:01:50,626 --> 01:01:53,025
Our Kang is
a little bit clever.

831
01:01:53,575 --> 01:01:54,575
What is that?

832
01:01:54,626 --> 01:01:56,225
It's a seal.

833
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:02,023
A seal? I never put a
seal in there.

834
01:02:02,201 --> 01:02:04,580
<i>Shin Ji Hyun?</i>

835
01:02:05,517 --> 01:02:07,811
This is Shin Ji Hyun's seal.

836
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,500
Shin Ji Hyun?

837
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,140
<i>Someone...</i>

838
01:02:56,116 --> 01:02:59,095
<i>Someone, please save me!</i>

839
01:02:59,927 --> 01:03:03,803
<i>God... save me.</i>

840
01:03:05,187 --> 01:03:07,900
<i>I need to live.</i>

841
01:03:08,849 --> 01:03:11,802
<i>I want to live.</i>
