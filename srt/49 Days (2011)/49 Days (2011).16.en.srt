00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,960
Why do you keep denying it?

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,040
Take a look at this.

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,150
It's still not true?

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,150
It's ridiculous, how could I
with this woman?

7
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,430
There's nothing between me
and this woman!

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,920
Even though you say there's nothing
between you two,

9
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,170
there can't possibly be
nothing going on.

10
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,720
Even though you say there's nothing
between you two,

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,600
there can't possibly be
nothing going on.

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,860
No, I said no!

13
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,210
It's nothing, Yi Kyung!

14
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,210
Song Yi Kyung,
I already told you it's nothing!

15
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,950
Why won't you believe what I say?

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,660
Yi Kyung...

17
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,490
Hey...

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,730
Song Yi Kyung.

19
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,570
You...

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,610
Your looks...

21
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,390
Your looks...

22
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,890
Why have your looks changed?

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,780
Yi Kyung.

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,070
Hey, hey, hey.

25
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,860
No, no, no!

26
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,310
I am Shin Ji Hyun,

27
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,860
not Song Yi Kyung!

28
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,470
Don't you know?

29
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,040
I'm Shin Ji Hyun.

30
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,760
Do you remember?

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,970
Do you remember Unni?

32
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,310
But...

33
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,550
This photograph...

34
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,890
What is this?

35
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,010
You don't recognize this photograph?

36
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,670
This was in Yi Kyung Unni's boxes.

37
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,870
Didn't you break up because of this?

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,510
This is the first time
I've seen this photograph.

39
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,180
<i>Even though you say there's nothing
between you two,</i>

40
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,950
there can't possibly be
nothing going on.

41
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,760
That's why Yi Kyung, she...

42
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,570
That's why, to me...

43
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,550
Yi Kyung...

44
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,410
Haven't I already said
I understand you playing music?

45
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,790
That's not understanding.

46
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,150
It's because I moved out, and
you can't do anything about it, isn't it?

47
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,820
Because of the promise you
made with me...

48
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,010
to attend university together...

49
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,870
for the two of us to work
at the same place...

50
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,990
We made a deal... to work
where the two of us could be together.

51
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,290
Till the completion of our
"February" pension,

52
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,900
wasn't that our dream?

53
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,110
Are you still on about that?

54
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,650
In order to reassure you,

55
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,480
I have to give up doing what I love?

56
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,760
Is that love?!

57
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,250
Then, you...

58
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,870
really want to go into music?

59
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,940
And it's not because you want
to play around with women?

60
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,480
Wow... Yes,

61
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,240
I knew it was going to be like this.

62
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,580
How many times
do you want me to say

63
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,510
that nothing goes on between me
and the women here?

64
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,960
You say it's nothing?

65
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,050
They're only noonas and dongsengs,

66
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:02,980
that hang out with the band members.

67
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,590
How many times
do you want me to say it?!

68
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,500
Even though you say there's nothing
between you two,

69
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,030
there can't possibly be
nothing going on.

70
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,860
What are you talking about?

71
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,460
Stop talking in circles,
and tell me directly.

72
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,540
I want to hear you say it.

73
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,660
I want to know how you truly feel.

74
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,260
What kind of...

75
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,890
person I am to you?

76
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,220
Please, let's just stop this here.

77
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,290
I'm so frustrated already.

78
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,680
You are a really frustrating woman,
all right?

79
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,710
<i>When I think about having to marry you,
I can't breathe.</i>

80
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,660
Just like the last 18 years,

81
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,000
having to live for the next
30 to 40 years just looking at you...

82
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,350
it's too scary.

83
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,680
Yi Soo.

84
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,540
<i>Song Yi Kyung!</i>

85
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,300
Why won't you change?

86
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:53,984
Whether you're 5, 10, 19 or 23,
how can you be exactly the same?!

87
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,530
Hey.

88
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,600
Yi Kyung is out.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,180
Look at her face.

90
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,700
Hurry and go make things right,

91
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,960
we're about to start our 2 week show.

92
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,870
It's not something that can be solved
with a few sentences.

93
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,450
You leave first.

94
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,700
Guys, let's go!

95
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:49,146
<i>{\a6}Even when I try to send your voice away</i>

96
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,179
<i>{\a6}It lingers in my ears...</i>

97
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,700
Song Yi Kyung.

98
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,460
Try living without me for 2 weeks.

99
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:15,929
<i>{\a6}I'm a scarecrow standing on one foot</i>

100
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:23,617
<i>{\a6}I'm a sad scarecrow,
my heart aching without you</i>

101
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:28,344
<i>{\a6}In the harsh wind, I keep swaying</i>

102
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:32,194
<i>{\a6}Even if my body scatters apart</i>

103
00:06:32,244 --> 00:06:37,457
<i>{\a6}If you'd come to me some day...</i>

104
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:45,070
<i>{\a6}I want to embrace you
with my arms wide open</i>

105
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:47,999
<i>{\a6}I'll wait for you</i>

106
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,960
<i>During the two week duration
where we played shows,</i>

107
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,520
<i>I worked at construction sites
during the day.</i>

108
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:05,979
<i>{\a6}In the harsh wind, I keep swaying</i>

109
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,730
<i>{\a6}Even if my body scatters apart</i>

110
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:12,267
<i>{\a6}If you'd come to me some day</i>

111
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,480
This,

112
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,430
I can engrave words on this right?

113
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,370
Of course.

114
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,460
What would you like to engrave?

115
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,580
Mmm...

116
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,520
"S Love K."

117
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:28,626
<i>{\a6}I still love you</i>

118
00:07:53,398 --> 00:08:04,825
<i>{\a6}You are breathing, you are living,
inside my heart</i>

119
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:18,467
<i>{\a6}My heart is pounding, you are walking,
inside my heart</i>

120
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:28,366
<i>{\a6}Starting from the first day you came to me,
it became a longing</i>

121
00:08:28,485 --> 00:08:32,914
<i>{\a6}and you out to called me...</i>

122
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:54,829
<i>{\a6}Tears keep flowing.
Cold tears are flowing</i>

123
00:08:55,553 --> 00:09:02,340
<i>{\a6}My heart hurts,
and it hurts because of you</i>

124
00:09:02,494 --> 00:09:08,507
<i>{\a6}I long for you in the day,
Oh how I long for you</i>

125
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:15,938
<i>{\a6}I miss you so much,
tears fall again</i>

126
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:23,569
<i>{\a6}They keep flowing down,
you flow down</i>

127
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:30,632
<i>{\a6}Because my heart is full,
you overflow in my heart</i>

128
00:09:30,742 --> 00:09:36,841
<i>{\a6}They become tears of pain,
they become tears of longing</i>

129
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:44,364
<i>{\a6}In my heart, you live like that</i>

130
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:51,751
<i>{\a6}Tears keep flowing,
cold tears are flowing</i>

131
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:58,773
<i>{\a6}Because I love you,
because tears are love</i>

132
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:05,058
<i>{\a6}Even after having you by my side,
with you beside me like this</i>

133
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:12,177
<i>{\a6}The words that I couldn't finish,
is that "I love you".</i>

134
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,370
What to do?

135
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,680
Why did you take such a photograph?

136
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,140
I might be wild,
but I'm not a wastrel.

137
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,850
This girl...

138
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,880
took it secretly when I was sleeping.

139
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,690
Hey, Shin Ji Hyun.

140
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,530
Hurry, go back and return
this body to Yi Kyung.

141
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,000
I want to tell Yi Kyung.

142
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,490
This isn't right.

143
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,500
This is strange.

144
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,340
This can't be.

145
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,480
What's wrong?

146
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,660
Why can I recall this?

147
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,030
This can't be.

148
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,110
Sunbae, how can you be like this?

149
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,790
How could you let her live like
this for 5 years, 5 years?!

150
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,790
Ah!

151
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,340
What's wrong with you?

152
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,880
I've been called.

153
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,360
Go ahead and leave first.

154
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,590
Be careful with her body!

155
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:05,250
<i>Does sincerity... that won't be misunderstood
and can't be misunderstood, really exist?</i>

156
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,660
<i>The kindness that I really never thought of
from my point of view...</i>

157
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,780
<i>the kindness that I never saw...</i>

158
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:16,430
<i>made me become this pathetic.</i>

159
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,450
I was the one who first proposed this
to Kang Min Ho.

160
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:26,250
To bring Shin Ji Hyun...
down to the same situation that I was in.

161
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,500
<i>Sincerity...</i>

162
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,790
<i>Does it mean I have to see it
from my point of view,</i>

163
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,630
<i>or from the other person's
point of view?</i>

164
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,840
<i>What I see as true love,</i>

165
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,630
<i>In Jung thinks is fake.</i>

166
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,350
<i>Yi Soo really loves Yi Kyung,</i>

167
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,410
<i>but she thought his heart changed.</i>

168
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,540
<i>The love that no one can see,</i>

169
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,950
<i>how should I go about
taking care of it?</i>

170
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,110
Something big has happened,
something big!

171
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,472
This really isn't a small bump
in the road.

172
00:13:17,603 --> 00:13:20,543
It's not... something trivial?

173
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,600
You should be thankful that
she's still alive!

174
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,140
If not, it would've followed you around for life,
and give you a lot of trouble.

175
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,740
Does she have a problem with me...

176
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,050
that's why she can't go back
to her own body?

177
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,340
She should still be here,

<i>Did Ji Hyun really do that?</i>

182

For wild spirits that are
floating around aimlessly,

186
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,680
you have to exorcise it from
the host body.

187
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,940
How do I do that?

00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,020
It was clearly in a shape of a teardrop.

222
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,190
Teardrop?

223
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,430

That's right!

were resolved.

- Ahjumma, you're the best.

to take care of this?

246

<i>What is that?</i>

<i>It wasn't there before.</i>

249

Where do you...

250
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,070
keep looking?

251
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,030
Your necklace is really pretty.

252
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,050
You don't really see that often.

253
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,580
Where did you buy it from?

254
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,940
I didn't buy it,

255
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,240
I got it from somewhere else.

256
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,420
But before,

257
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,510
it seemed to be empty inside.

258
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,100
How come there seems to be
something inside?

259
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,200
Like...

260
00:17:55,311 --> 00:17:57,741
It looks like a teardrop.

261
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,790
That necklace,

262
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,970
when did you change it?

263
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,360
Why do you keep asking?

264
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,430
So I can't even ask when you
changed your necklace?

265
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,560
That's because the other
necklace before,

266
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,130
is different from the
one right now.

267
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,940
This is just...

268
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,520
something anyone could ask.

269
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,900
When did you change it?

270
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,650
This...

271
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,290
The day I turned in
my resignation letter.

272
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,519
The day you turned in
your resignation?

273
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,380
Why?

274
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,630
<i>Is that...</i>

275
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,790
<i>my tears?</i>

276
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,560
What's wrong with you?

277
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,200
That day, I...

278
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,690
I was really upset because
you had resigned...

279
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,970
so I went to my friend
Ji Hyun's bedside and cried.

280
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,330
You said you cried?

281
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,290
<i>Kang...</i>

282

<i>That was you?</i>

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,540
<i>They are tears, I see!</i>

284
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,130
Why are you crying?

285
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,580
Because I'm thankful.

286
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,490
I'm thankful to someone.

287
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,250
<i>Song Yi Kyung.</i>

288
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,450
Stop crying,
and go do some work.

289
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,240
We need staff right now,
we're very busy.

290
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,310
All right.

291
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,790
Kang.

292
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,670
- Seo Woo.
- Yi Kyung, it's been a while.

293
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,625
Kang...

294
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:48,970
I came here because
I have something to tell you.

295
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,960
I was about to head out.

296
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,180
What is it?

297
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,080
Do you know about the relationship
between Min Ho and In Jung?

298
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,420
It was Kang.

299
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,980
It was Han Kang.

300
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,860
I've already introduced myself
at the Jinan factory.

301
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,160
We can now go ahead with the plan.

302
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,870
So now you want this expedited

303
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:42,030
because the Will became useless
when President Shin woke up?

304
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,760
Now, in this kind of situation,

305
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,230
isn't that what Hyuk San
wants as well?

306
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,950
It'd be better if you could
make a quick decision.

307
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,740
In the future, don't say anything
about stopping or giving up.

308
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,190
It won't happen again.

309
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,150
Oh, I understand.

310
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,810
Hey, since President Shin
has woken up,

311
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,330
shouldn't we tell him?

312
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,730
He's still in the
Intensive Care Unit.

313
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,270
Jay mentioned that it was a
company based in America.

314
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,420
It looks like I'll have to ask
my dad to look into it.

315
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,840
Are you going to contact
your father?

316
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,840
Is now the time to let my
pride get in the way?

317
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,720
Then what should I do?

318
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,062
While you're investigating Manager Kang,
will I be out looking for tears?

319
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,240
You and Ahjumma found out
the most important thing.

320
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,560
The truth,

321
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,040
the method in which Ji Hyun
can come back to life.

322
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,140
That's true, Hwa Jun accomplished
something huge.

323
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,130
Hey!

324
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,290
Then, the two of us,

325
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,320
should we try and find out a way
to get tears of sincerity?

326
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,010
Can you do it without telling her
about Ji Hyun?

327
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,170
Hey, hey, don't worry.
She said she'll trust me and just wait.

328
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,180
Ahjussi,

329
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,570
you really did meet
a good woman.

330
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,810
Didn't you meet
a good woman, too?

331
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,080
Ji Hyun is a very pure person.

332
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,060
I don't understand why Manager Kang
acted the way he did.

333
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,420
Recalling how Min Ho grew up,

334
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,360
I can understand his anger.

335
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,650
<i>How difficult it must have been.</i>

336
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,800
Listening to it, even I
would be angry for him.

337
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:32,690
Even so, this isn't it.

338
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,530
There are people like me who
were abandoned in front of a temple.

339
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,830
And there are also people like Jun Hee
who take care of their family members.

340
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,830
He lives by taking time off from school
earning tuition money.

341
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,170
At least Min Ho hyung wasn't this way
when he was in America.

342
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,870
<i>Thinking of the mother who enabled him
to attain an MBA degree,</i>

343
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,870
he had to live seriously.

344
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,000
That's why I like Hyung!

345
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,130
But Manager Kang's mother,
where is she now?

346
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,860
I don't know.

347
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,330
I heard she was sick,

348
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,020
I asked him a few times after
he came back,

349
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,110
but he wouldn't say.

350
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,350
Ahjussi, I'm going to take
Ji Hyun home.

351
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Kang, the real Song Yi Kyung
is OK, right?

352
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,580
From what I can see,
she's doing all right.

353
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,110
Why?

354
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,790
It's been more than a couple of days,

355
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,780
people will definitely notice something.
That's why I was worried.

356
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,780
I was worried about that too,

357
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,460
but we can't say anything yet.

358
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,320
There are possible circumstances
where something could be said.

359
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,870
How about setting up a
meeting with her?

360
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,730
Hello.

361
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,730
<i>Hey, Song Yi Kyung.</i>

362
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,790
<i>Where are you?</i>

363
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,060
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

364
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,430
What is it?

365
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,090
<i>You're at Kang's, right?</i>

366
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,780
<i>Come here right now.</i>

367
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,180
Kang Min Ho...

368
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,268
Where are you going?

369
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,460
Kang Min Ho said he was
at the parking lot.

370
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,460
Hold on.

371
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,460
<i>You should stop now.</i>

372
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,300
I don't know what happened,

373
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,060
but Song, what can you do?

374
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,250
<i>What can you do even after
meeting with him?</i>

375
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,770
You're Song Yi Kyung!

376
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,100
It's because I'm Song Yi Kyung,

377
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,290
that I can do it.

378
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,970
Even so, stop.

379
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,430
I can't continue watching.

380
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,950
How about trusting in me?

381
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,710
I won't...

382
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,190
just stand by and watch.

383
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,980
I'll ask him to leave,

384
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,260
and I'll come back.

385
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,500
What is it?

386
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,500
Song Yi Kyung.

387
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,840
Why are you
still working here?

388
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,366
I already told you to quit.

389
00:25:06,386 --> 00:25:09,221
I didn't want to quit,
didn't I say that too?

390
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,140
Why don't you want to quit.
Why, why?!

391
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,060
Because there's
someone I like here.

392
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:14,870
What?

393
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,576
So in the future,

394
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:18,190
please don't contact me anymore.

395
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,060
Kang Min Ho, I don't want to
see you again.

396
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,890
Kang...

397
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,190
you like him?

398
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,990
Leave.

399
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,160
Then what am I to you?

400
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,400
Didn't you like me?

401
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,590
- You said you liked me!
- No.

402
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,710
I've never liked you.

403
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,140
There might've been a time when I had
the illusion that I liked you,

404
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,530
just like how you're under
the wrong impression right now.

405
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,510
Why did you have to appear?

406
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,360
Enough!

407
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,750
Hyung, don't ever
meet this woman again.

408
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,150
<i>Also...</i>

409
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,460
don't ever come here again.

410
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,490
Let's go.

411
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,110
Is it Ji Hyun?

412
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,320
You said before, in America.

413
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,520
That there was a woman you wanted to find
once you returned to Korea.

414
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,980
Was it Ji Hyun?

415
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,120
There was a time when we would
talk about everything under the sun.

416
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,430
Are you angry?

417
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,390
Why don't you understand what
normal human beings say?

418
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,060
I really wanted to just
send him away.

419
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,040
I did tell him that I never wanted
to see him again.

420
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,080
Really?

421
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,620
Why don't you understand what
normal human beings say?

422
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,150
I already said, I told him
never to come bother me again.

423
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,790
Good job.

424
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,030
It'd have been so much better
if you did it earlier.

425
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,280
That's true.

426
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,490
Don't walk alone at night
in the future.

427
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,240
- I'll send you home.
- It's fine.

428
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,460
Again...?

429
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,000
All right then.

430
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,910
Actually, I'm really happy that
you're sending me home.

431
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,770
There are not many days left
where we can meet. 

432
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,690
<i>During the day, we're both busy.</i>

433
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,940
I don't have that much time left.

434
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:34,000
<i>Why do I... only understand
you now?</i>

435
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,620
Unni!

436
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,880
The Scheduler remembers everything.

437
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,330
He remembers you.

438
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,890
What about you, Unni?

439
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:20,011
Is it okay for me to say this?

440
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,830
Why Unni lived that way,

441
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,990
Song Yi Soo explained it all.

442
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,950
What's wrong, Unni?

443
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,150
Can she hear my voice?

444
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,730
Unni.

445
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,620
Unni.

446
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,550
I can't speak about the
situation in detail,

447
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:53,904
but Unni,

448
00:28:54,146 --> 00:28:57,480
you're really someone who is loved.

449
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,550
<i>To Song Yi Soo,</i>

450
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,110
you're a very,

451
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,590
very important person.

452
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,778
<i>How does she know
about Yi Soo?</i>

453
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:12,085
<i>{\a6}I try to feel you
at the tip of my fingers</i>

454
00:29:12,307 --> 00:29:19,768
<i>{\a6}I forget. I always forget
that I can't touch you</i>

455
00:29:20,243 --> 00:29:26,956
<i>{\a6}Do you know? Because you live in
the one room of my heart</i>

456
00:29:27,191 --> 00:29:34,782
<i>{\a6}No one else will do</i>

457
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:45,619
<i>{\a6}Even the memories are lost,
even the warmth is gone... now</i>

458
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:53,497
<i>{\a6}I'm a scarecrow standing on one foot</i>

459
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,930
<i>Since I was abandoned by Yi Soo,</i>

460
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,110
<i>I can't trust anyone anymore.</i>

461
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,310
<i>That's because,</i>

462
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,820
<i>I'm not someone
who is needed by anyone else.</i>

463
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,750
I'm sorry.

464
00:30:16,462 --> 00:30:22,613
<i>{\a6}I want to embrace you
with my arms wide open</i>

465
00:30:22,764 --> 00:30:25,002
<i>{\a6}I wait for you</i>

466
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:28,545
<i>{\a6}Don't wanna let you go
(let you go)</i>

467
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:32,381
<i>{\a6}Don't wanna let you go
(let you go)</i>

468
00:30:32,468 --> 00:30:38,471
<i>{\a6}If you'd come to me some day</i>

469
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:42,685
<i>{\a6}I want to embrace you...</i>

470
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,640
Are you feeling unwell?

471
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,171
I'm fine.

472
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,840
Do you want to order something?

473
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,940
Please give me an Americano.

474
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,150
Thank you.

475
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,630
I will enjoy it.

476
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,660
<i>She really doesn't remember anything.</i>

477
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,080
What happened?

478
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,500
What did Sunbae say?

479
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,950
What happened with your situation?

480
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,140
Go as myself...

481
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,700
to meet with Yi Kyung.

482
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,370
So that's what it was.

483
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,160
Then, can you meet with
Unni now?

484
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,390
No.

485
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,120
I can't even pretend
to know her.

486
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:30,380
<i>Before my period ends,
I can't even tell Yi Kyung who I am,</i>

487
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:33,490
and I can't interfere
in her business either.

488
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,440
Since that's the case,
why did your memories come back?

489
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,860
Because of you!

490
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,699
Things turned out this way because you're always
using Yi Kyung's face when we meet.

491
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,730
I'm sorry.

492
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,230
The problem was with me again.

493
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,920
There are some things
that I have to tell Yi Kyung.

494
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,640
So, in the remaining days,

495
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:55,689
watch out for your body, what you do,
and don't get into trouble.

496
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:59,670
If you endanger my Yi Kyung
in any way...

497
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,660
you're dead.

498
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,520
I understand.

499
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,620
I've always been trying hard.

500
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,100
You have to hurry and solve this
misunderstanding with Unni.

501
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,860
What is it at this hour?

502
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,830
Just in case, I made some
hangover soup.

503
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,690
Looks like you did indeed drink.

504
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,195
You probably don't have
rice either.

505
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,360
Oh, the smell of alcohol...

506
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,430
What are you doing?

507
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,840
In Kang Min Ho's house, there's a smell
that doesn't fit with Kang Min Ho's demeanor.

508
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,660
Go shower,
I'll prepare some food.

509
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,880
What's wrong with you?

510
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,500
It seems if you want things done,

511
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,880
there's only me left.

512
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,740
Even if Oppa knows that she's Ji Hyun,

513
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,140
you feel that you can't feel Ji Hyun's
spirit from Ji Hyun's body.

514
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,680
I won't leave Oppa's side either.

515
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,200
Oppa,

516
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,970
even if she isn't Ji Hyun but
Song Yi Kyung,

517
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,060
you can't go to her side,

518
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,800
because I'm still here.

519
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:52,660
In Jung.

520
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,098
Even so, don't even try and defend yourself
by saying it isn't Ji Hyun.

521
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,970
That's because I've already
confirmed it.

522
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,000
- How did you do that?
- How is that important?

523
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:06,330
Ji Hyun transformed herself
into Song Yi Kyung, came to our side,

524
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,940
and intentionally got closer to Oppa,
that's what is important.

525
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,680
Also, Kang Oppa

526
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:16,580
knew beforehand that
Song Yi Kyung was Ji Hyun.

527
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,580
You said Kang knew?

528
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:22,070
Ji Hyun used those methods to
enter someone else's body,

529
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,650
which means she can live by
our sides like that forever.

530
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,680
You're awake.

531
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:37,080
- I made soup, have something to eat.
- Let's live separately.

532
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,210
What?

533
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,030
I don't want to live
with you anymore.

534
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,730
You move out.

535
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,140
Just go and live with
Kang Min Ho.

536
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,270
Seo Woo...

537
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,050
Wanting to be room mates
was a lie because

538
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,860
you just wanted to move out of
Ji Hyun's place, right?

539
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,430
Seo Woo,

540
00:35:58,565 --> 00:36:00,729
why I wanted to do that,

541
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,599
I've already explained.

542
00:36:01,616 --> 00:36:04,220
Didn't you say you guys
started dating 5 years ago?

543
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,250
<i>How could you do that?</i>

544
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,710
Hey.

545
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,790
After Ji Hyun's accident, do you know
how I feel when I see you?

546
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,320
I think I'm a joke.

547
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,630
Even though I'm hurt and
in a lot of pain,

548
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,730
<i>I won't be like you and
self-destruct.</i>

549
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,840
Then, I felt like Ji Hyun
wouldn't just leave us and go,

550
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,510
and I was so afraid I wouldn't cry.

551
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,110
<i>But when I saw the way you were crying
to the point of throwing up blood,</i>

552
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,880
<i>I thought that you were
Ji Hyun's true friend,</i>

553
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,140
and I was a fake friend.

554
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,950
I actually felt that in my bones.

555
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,330
But then, was that all a show?

556
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,680
That's not it.

557
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,390
The price of a conscience.

558
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,910
Stop kidding.

559
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,600
If you had a conscience, you wouldn't lie to
your friends, especially one of 10 years!

560
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,300
It's reasonable that you're angry,

561
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,060
but there's only the
two of us now, Seo Woo.

562
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,940
Even if you're angry,

563
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,820
just listen to me, all right?

564
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,620
Hey.

565
00:36:55,930 --> 00:37:01,610
People say that both seafood and customers
start to smell after just 3 days.

566
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,720
<i>If you thought living in
Ji Hyun's place was difficult,</i>

567
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:07,940
how could it be easy for Ji Hyun's
family to take care of you?

568
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,060
That's right.

569
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,690
I'm acting this way because
I was jealous of Ji Hyun.

570
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,480
<i>But Ji Hyun,</i>

571
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,130
even when she's dead,
can still have everything.

572
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,600
What do you mean?

573
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,380
You...

574
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,990
don't know that Kang likes
Ji Hyun, right?

575
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:31,400
From America, he came back to Korea
to look for Ji Hyun.

576
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,090
What?

577
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,480
Song Yi Kyung,

578
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,720
is Ji Hyun's friend.

579
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,740
That's why on behalf of Ji Hyun,

580
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,750
he's taking such good care
of Song Yi Kyung.

581
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,820
<i>How do you feel?</i>

582
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,610
Even now,

583
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,320
do you feel only Ji Hyun is good.

584
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,880
Hey, Shin In Jung.

585
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,360
Don't lie!

586
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,790
<i>Write thank you notes!</i>

587
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:13,920
If I had thirteen days left,

588
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,060
I would tell my wife,

589
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,350
"I'm really grateful to you
during this period",

590
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,680
and send her a bouquet
of flowers.

591
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,860
I'd go see my mother's face
one last time.

592
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,102
And to my children,

593
00:38:26,381 --> 00:38:28,112
I would've at least left a letter.

594
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,390
Can't you just do it now?

595
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,070
There's no time.

596
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,190
<i>Dad. Mom. Han Kang. Shin In Jung.</i>

597
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,770
If this was Kang,

598
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,070
then Seo Woo
hasn't cried yet.

599
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,150
Seo Woo,
have you been well?

600
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,820
I heard that you and Ji Hyun
were friends.

601
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,210
What?

602
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,140
Ah, this...

603
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,100
Then why didn't you say anything and
made me feel like I was being lied to?

604
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,260
It upsets me.

605
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,400
Who said that?

606
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,640
Was it In Jung?

607
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:48,030
Why tell when she clearly
doesn't believe it?

608
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,410
As long as we treat the
swelling in the brain,

609
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,340
he can be discharged
within the week.

610
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,990
Thank you!

611
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,030
Dear,

612
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,520
being able to see you again,
makes me happy.

613
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,800
Me too.

614
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,500
Being able to meet
you again,

615
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,260
I'm really thankful.

616
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,260
Thank you.

617
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,370
Ji Hyun...

618
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,120
I met her.

619
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,880
Ji Hyun,

620
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,840
she came to save
her father.

621
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,990
Ji Hyun!

622
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:42,940
Dad is next door,
and his condition is really good.

623
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:43,760
This girl,

624
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:46,070
she's been asleep for so long,
her skin has improved.

625
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,720
Her skin is better?

626
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,060
Looking at Ji Hyun,

627
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,660
I can't help but
joke around.

628
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,360
Ji Hyun's father is
like that too.

629
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,800
But, Mother...

630
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,870
How should I go about cooking
seaweed soup?

631
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,210
Why do you want to make it?

632
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,240
I suddenly feel like eating
seaweed soup,

633
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,330
but I've never cooked it before.

634
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,340
Oh, my!

635
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,940
Today is our Ji Hyun's birthday,

636
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,620
I even made seaweed soup
and brought it over.

637
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:12,920
Then, can I have a bowl...

638
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:15,040
no, two bowls?

639
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,990
I'm here.

640
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,180
Come in, come in.

641
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,370
You should just tell me
what happened at the hospital.

642
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,650
If you come in, I'll tell you,
if not, I won't say a thing.

643
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,070
Sit down.

644
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,630
I cooked too much
seaweed soup,

645
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:46,030
just take it that you're
helping me clear leftovers.

646
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,200
Why did you suddenly cook
seaweed soup?

647
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:50,200
Isn't today Children's Day?

648
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:53,540
In America on Children's Day,
they make seaweed soup.

649
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,980
Ah, you've never lived in America,
so you're not sure.

650
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,840
You didn't make it because
it's Children's Day...

651
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,160
Didn't you make it because it's
Shin Ji Hyun's birthday?

652
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,160
This...

653
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,210
It tastes the same as if
Shin Ji Hyun's mother made it.

654
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,000
<i>Happy birthday,</i>

655
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,370
<i>Ji Hyun.</i>

656
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,420
<i>Thanks, Kang.</i>

657
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,910
If Shin Ji Hyun knew about this,
she'd be really grateful to you.

658
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,260
Hey, Song Yi Kyung,

659
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,260
let's drop the formalities.

660
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,510
Song Yi Kyung,
you're older than me by a year.

661
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,010
It's just a year,
so I can't call you Noona,

662
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,470
we'll just be more casual
like in America.

663
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,680
All right.

664
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,220
Since it's only a year,
I won't be picky.

665
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,080
How's Shin Ji Hyun's
father's condition?

666
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,860
He's lucid,

667
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,860
and the doctors only need a few more days
to treat the swelling in his brain.

668
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:57,470
Is that so?

669
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,910
- Then, I'll go take a look at night.
- Then I can't send you.

670
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,580
I have to sleep at night.

671
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,640
When Ji Hyun wakes up,

672
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:09,140
I'll definitely tell her, you really have
to be nicer to Han Kang.

673
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,320
Shin Ji Hyun...

674
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,120
I really hope she wakes up.

675
00:43:30,697 --> 00:43:32,342
<i>It's this person.</i>

676
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,670
There's still someone living here,

677
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,310
how could you ask me to rent it out
unconditionally?

678
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,090
I need this room immediately.

679
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,970
I heard she's staying here without
a signed contract.

680
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,420
Even then...

681
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,720
If you want a monthly rent, or a
yearly rent, do whatever you see fit.

682
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,278
<i>If you want us to pay
full rent, we can,</i>

683
00:43:49,279 --> 00:43:51,690
or we can pay you three times
the monthly rent.

684
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:52,700
Really?

685
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,070
If you can make 
the room available now,

686
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,070
I'll pay you
compensation as well.

687
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,180
Hey, Kang Min Ho.

688
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,300
Didn't I tell you never to
contact me again?

689
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,960
You don't want to come?

690
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:04,390
Then should I go to
your place, Yi Kyung?

691
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,670
My place?

692
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,810
I'm at the entrance
right now, Yi Kyung.

693
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,140
Maleedong.

694
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,870
Kang, why did you come
all of a sudden, what's up?

695
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,130
Oh, today is Ji Hyun's birthday.

696
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,810
It's Ji Hyun's birthday?

697
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,890
- How do you know her birthday?
- After I came back home,

698
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:27,180
Min Ho said it was
his girlfriend's birthday,

699
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,650
and brought her to
the restaurant,

700
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,600
that's how I was reunited
with you guys.

701
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:32,520
You can still remember
the date?

702
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,940
That's because it's only
a few days difference

703
00:44:33,987 --> 00:44:35,306
from my mother's
death anniversary.

704
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,510
But it's Ji Hyun's birthday,
why did you come look for me?

705
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,510
That girl is in this state,

706
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,060
I thought it would be good to
leave her with some good memories.

707
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,000
After hearing what happened
with In Jung and Min Ho,

708
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,750
you should be most hurt by that.

709
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,310
Since when did you start taking such
good care of Ji Hyun?

710
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,050
You came really fast.

711
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:01,400
Here...

712
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,890
How did you know about
this place?

713
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,040
You actually thought I wouldn't know
where the girl I like stayed,

714
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,560
that's quite disappointing.

715
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,290
You followed me?

716
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:11,210
Get in the car,
let's go for dinner.

717
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,270
Right now,

718
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:14,340
didn't I tell you that I
would never meet you again?

719
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:16,630
Then it seems we have to go back to
acting like children.

720
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,000
What are you talking about?

721
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:20,040
Just like what Song Yi Kyung
did before.

722
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,840
The other time, you used the excuse of
returning the keys to come to my place,

723
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:24,810
you don't remember?

724
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,600
I don't have the keys
to Song Yi Kyung's place,

725
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,600
but you think I can't enter?

726
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,170
Let's talk and eat at
the same time.

727
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,840
Eat.

728
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:48,650
<i>What should I do if he comes looking
for me at my place every day?</i>

729
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:51,490
You're not eating?

730
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,490
What's with your expression?

731
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,500
I never thought we would
come back here.

732
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,580
This restaurant has extraordinary meaning
to me, don't you know?

733
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,390
I don't casually bring people here.

734
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,850
In Jung and you,

735
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,270
just the two of you,

736
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:08,480
are the women
I've brought to this place.

737
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,440
But originally,

738
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,560
didn't you hate eating sujebi*,
(* soup)

739
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,560
Ji Hyun?

740
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:20,870
But you're happily eating it
right now.

741
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:22,050
You...

742
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,520
What are you saying?

743
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:25,950
First, I have to congratulate you
on being fine.

744
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:28,040
But, what in the world
is going on?

745
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:29,920
Why did you become
this way?

746
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:34,300
You should hurry and find a way
to return to your body.

747
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,450
- Kang Min Ho.
- Oppa.

748
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:39,350
That's how you should
address me, Ji Hyun.

749
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,800
What's wrong with you?

750
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,120
I'm Song Yi Kyung.

751
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:45,060
You're Shin Ji Hyun borrowing
Song Yi Kyung's skin.

752
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,185
Are you meeting me as
Song Yi Kyung...

753
00:46:49,457 --> 00:46:51,431
or Shin Ji Hyun?

754
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,900
Because I'm Song Yi Kyung,

755
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:57,110
so I'm definitely meeting you
as Song Yi Kyung.

756
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,570
What are you doing?

757
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:00,990
Did you have your own difficulties,

758
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,460
so that you had to live under
Song Yi Kyung's identity?

759
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,080
I'm Song Yi Kyung.

760
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:08,172
Then for the rest of your life,
you should assume her identity.

761
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,010
If you wanted to escape
under that pretense,

762
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,340
then it's a little too obvious
that you are Shin Ji Hyun.

763
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:14,170
That's really ridiculous.

764
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:17,710
Looking at you makes me sick,
and I don't want to sit facing you.

765
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:19,440
You've confirmed that.

766
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,140
And now you know
what kind of person I am.

767
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:24,167
I said it's not true, so why do you
keep saying all these weird things?

768
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:25,820
You.

769
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:30,320
You should have reasons as to why you
can't say you're Shin Ji Hyun, right?

770
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:41,030
What are the reasons
that you got close to me?!

771
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,480
Kang.

772
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,550
<i>Even so, you can't fool around
with Han Kang!</i>

773
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,850
<i>Before the 49 days,
you can't reveal who you are.</i>

774
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:21,450
[ President Han Kang ]

775
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,070
Kang Min Ho knows!

776
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:27,640
The fact that I'm Shin Ji Hyun...

777
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,100
Kang Min Ho knows!

778
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,290
Where did your smart brain go?

779
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,011
Just like with Han Kang,
things will be all right

780
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:33,770
if you pretend you're not.

781
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,620
Han Kang and Kang Min Ho
are not the same.

782
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:36,970
Both the person
and the circumstances.

783
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:39,570
So who asked you to go around
creating trouble?!

784
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,600
Didn't I ask you to stop interfering
with what happened after you died?

785
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:44,240
I'm so afraid I could die,

786
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:45,710
why are you getting
angry at me too?

787
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,270
Because...

788
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,520
I really wished to the fullest extent
that I didn't have to see you.

789
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,090
Because in my eyes,
you're Yi Kyung.

790
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,210
<i>But you're not Yi Kyung.</i>

791
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:58,070
But you using those eyes to look at me,
what do you want me to do?

792
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,660
What do you want me to do?!

793
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:01,350
Why are you getting
angry at me?

794
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,200
I'm a maligned person too!

795
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,730
You think I wish to borrow
this unni's body?

796
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:07,680
<i>I'm not supposed to be dead yet,</i>

797
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,240
but things turned out this way because
of someone's attempted suicide.

798
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,980
Time is getting shorter each day,
and I'm getting increasingly uneasy.

799
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:20,020
Who is that person?

800
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,160
Who?

801
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:24,760
The person who tried to commit suicide and
caused things to turn out this way.

802
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,230
You're responsible too.

803
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,420
You weren't concentrating while driving
and caused the accident.

804
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,230
If nothing had happened ahead,
the motorbike wouldn't have fallen.

805
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:32,856
<i>And if that was the case,</i>

806
00:49:32,982 --> 00:49:35,130
then I wouldn't have died either.

807
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,120
Who was it?

808
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,400
What do you want to do
with that information?

809
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,530
Making someone live like that,

810
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,700
what punishment
did that person get?

811
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,880
He should have been punished.

812
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:44,370
Should have been?

813
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:45,790
I'm afraid so.

814
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:47,600
Afraid so?

815
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,370
You're really strange.

816
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,370
Why are you speaking this way?

817
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,310
<i>I investigated thoroughly.</i>

818
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,090
It was this person,

819
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,840
who put me in a vegetative state.

820
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,160
It can't be...

821
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:13,730
This unni?

822
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:15,650
Hey, hey, Shin Ji Hyun.

823
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,580
It was this unni...

824
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,840
It was her?!

825
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,400
She caused my death,
and I'm made to live in her body?!

826
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:31,240
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't do that!
Don't hit Yi Kyung!

827
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,410
Hey, this isn't your head!

828
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:35,580
This is my woman's head!

829
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,010
Ah...

830
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,130
I'm sorry.

831
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:46,260
You know...

832
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:48,020
what I'm feeling right now.

833
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:49,460
Then...

834
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,460
 do you know what
I'm feeling right now?

835
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:53,249
<i>In Jung said....</i>

836
00:50:53,476 --> 00:50:56,130
that she betrayed me
because I was at fault.

837
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:59,010
My heart is about to shrivel up
because Kang Min Ho...

838
00:50:59,129 --> 00:51:01,300
found out my identity.

839
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:04,020
<i>There're only 10 days left.</i>

840
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:05,870
Whether I die or I live,

841
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:08,377
I'm about to go crazy with
each passing day.

842
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:12,680
The only person whom I can talk to,
the Scheduler,

843
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:18,530
is saying that I'm mistreating his woman
and doesn't want to meet me.

844
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:21,630
But,

845
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:24,940
this woman is the person
who caused my death.

846
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,160
I didn't even know this...

847
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,800
and got closer with this unni.

848
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,350
You wouldn't know how it feels
to be in front of the woman

849
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:38,040
you loved like crazy, and not being
allowed to express your emotions.

850
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:39,650
How would I not know?

851
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,340
Are you the only person
who can love?

852
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,070
I can love, too!

853
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,380
I can't tell Kang how I feel,

854
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:48,410
because my feelings belong
to Shin Ji Hyun.

855
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:51,490
And if I reveal how
Shin Ji Hyun feels...

856
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,490
I could die.

857
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:59,170
Hey.

858
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:01,890
Are you crying?

859
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:07,400
Don't cry.

860
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,240
Don't cry.

861
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:15,530
I'm Shin Ji Hyun.

862
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,910
You...

863
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,020
Unless I call you, you can't ever,

864
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:23,330
enter this unni's room.

865
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,720
No matter what I do
to Song Yi Kyung unni...

866
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:29,540
don't try coming in.

867
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,890
<i>Even though I want to, I won't.</i>

868
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,830
Why did you have to borrow
Yi Kyung's body?

869
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:43,850
<i>Why did it have to be you, Unni?</i>

870
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,720
Why did it have to be you?

871
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:55,110
That wasn't the first time
you attempted suicide, was it?

872
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:02,120
How you must have suffered, and how lonely
you must have been... to think of dying.

873
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:05,382
<i>What should I do if you die?</i>

874
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,280
I'm so sad...

875
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,440

876

<i>Am I begging the person who
made me like this right now?</i>

877
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:21,820
Please save me, is that it?!

878
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,960
To the person who put me
into a vegetative state?!

879
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:36,310
Because of you
I had an accident.

880
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:39,510
It was Unni who made me
into the way I am!

881
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,300
I want to live so badly.

882

<i>Do you know how afraid
I am each day?</i>

883
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,440
Why did you do that?

What is Song Yi Soo?

885
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:10,650
What are you doing?

886
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,000
<i>Ahgassi!</i>

888
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,000
<i>Ahgassi!</i>

889
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:25,780
Ahgassi, I rented the room out,
you have to leave.

890
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:26,960
You rented the room?

891
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:28,790
<i>You found this place in
the newspapers,</i>

892
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:32,110
we don't have a contract,
and you took the deposit too.

893
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:35,720
- If you do this all of a sudden...
- Vacate the room in a week.

894
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,560
What is Unni going to do?

895
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,050
Unni, I'm sorry.

896
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:49,750
Unni!

897
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,440
What to do?

898
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,930
Song Yi Kyung.

899
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:11,020
You still remember me,
don't you?

900
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:13,740
<i>I've received permission
from the President,</i>

901
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,100
let's have a chat.

902
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:36,380
I apologize for scaring you
the other time.

903
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,360
<i>Song Yi Kyung,</i>

904
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:42,732
my name... is Kang Min Ho.

905
00:55:52,189 --> 00:55:53,753
[ Kang Min Ho ]

906
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,495
Please get to the point.

907
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:05,140
You used to work in
a hotel, right?

908
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:07,760
There's a new pension resort
opening up in Busan.

909
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,320
I've already arranged
a position for you,

910
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:10,380
please go there.

911
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:11,340
Why should I?

912
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:13,240
Because if you don't go,
you'll be in danger.

913
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,120
I'm a person who's
not afraid of anything.

914
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:18,030
I'm a person who's afraid
of a lot of things.

915
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,820
If Song Yi Kyung continues
lending out her body,

916
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:24,150
I'll feel very uncomfortable,
and in danger.

917
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:26,700
If that's the case,
I'll be afraid,

918
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:31,240
and put you in a position that
is very dangerous to you.

919
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:40,940
The pension address is in there,

920
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,880
as well as a way to contact
the person in charge.

921
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:49,560
To go or not to go,

922
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:51,070
I'll make the decision.

923
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,680
Then please decide quickly.

924
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,200
<i>If you choose not to go,</i>

925
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:58,720
I'll have to prepare
a reasonable counterplan.

926
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,090
Why isn't Unni back yet?

927
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:19,340
She knew I was angry.

928
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,150
She spoke to me.

929
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:27,120
Is she not coming back
because she's afraid?

930
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,500
If those are the conditions,

931
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:33,710
then it's best to go.

932
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:35,510
It's not the best decision.

933
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:37,170
Just like you said,

934
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,580
since it's a condition
not requiring treatment,

935
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:41,070
then all the more
you should go.

936
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:43,700
What does that mean?

937
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:46,800
At first I didn't really believe it.

938
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,250
But I heard the other people,

939
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:52,190
went looking for you
one by one.

940
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:57,150
<i>Even if you feel that the spirit
is to be pitied,</i>

941
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,440
one body can't have
two souls.

942
00:58:00,872 --> 00:58:01,923
<i>If that soul</i>

943
00:58:01,948 --> 00:58:04,150
wants to share your
body for the rest of your life,

944
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:06,445
what would you do?

945
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,130
Song Yi Kyung.

946
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:19,120
Are you feeling unwell?

947
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:20,290
An Americano.

948
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:54,050
Please get out.

949
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:56,750
Unni.

950
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:58,530
Leave.

951
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:01,080
Unni, what's wrong?

952
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:03,780
I was wrong.

953
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:05,850
Please.

954
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,560
Ahgassi, are you really
leaving now?

955
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:06,100
Yes.

956
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:07,810
How about everything else?

957
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:10,240
Is someone coming to
clean it up?

958
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,710
You take care of it.

959
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:24,140
Unni seems to be leaving.

960
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:26,430
What should I do?

961
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:29,010
There's no other way.

962
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,250
All this was your karma.

963
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:33,960
What?

964
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:36,710
Just as if she was in front of me,

965
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:41,850
I clearly know Yi Kyung
is going to run away,

966
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:45,320
yet I can't do anything,

967
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,320
that is my karma.

968
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,430
What are you saying?

969
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:50,830
I...

970
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,730
can never help you.

971
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,662
<i>If something goes even the
slightest bit wrong here,</i>

972
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,420
I might never be able to solve the
misunderstanding Yi Kyung and I have.

973
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,930
I'll not be able to appear
in front of Yi Kyung,

974
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:05,340
and may have to take
the elevator.

975
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,120
Don't act this way,

976
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:08,710
help me.

977
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:10,800
Help me, all right?

978
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:14,502
I can't make a mistake now and
have to leave, wasting my 5 years.

979
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:18,133
As long as Yi Kyung doesn't die,

980
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:22,780
I will never do anything
that breaks the rules.
