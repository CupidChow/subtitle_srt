00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,340
<i>Who is it?</i>

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,070
I'm...

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,059
Hello, I'm Ji Hyun's friend, Park Jung Eun.

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,650
<i>Who?</i>

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,790
I've come to collect something
I lent to Ji Hyun.

8
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,899
<i>What did you come to find?</i>

9
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,210
It is magic tricks on a CD,
that I need now.

10
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,799
Are you a friend from college?

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,609
No, from an internet cafe...
where people meet and gather and such.

12
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:06,089
I know all of Ji Hyun's friends,
and I don't remember her mentioning you.

13
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,659
Your wedding anniversary last year...
in April or May,

14
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,829
Ji Hyun showed you some magic
with tissue flying,

15
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,550
mom's necklace in one hand
and dad's cufflinks in the other.

16
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,860
Yes.

17
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,299
<i>Shin Ji Hyun, don't be obvious.</i>

18
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,810
<i>You're Ji Hyun's friend, not her.</i>

19
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,589
She had practiced that with me a lot.

20
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,819
Did she?

21
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,079
I apologize for coming
when Ji Hyun's like this.

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,079
You knew about Ji Hyun?
Who did you hear it from?

23
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,340
From a college friend of Ji Hyun's.

24
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:53,919
Oh, this is Shin Ji Hyun's doll.
The one she got from Minho.

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,629
Our Ji Hyun told you that as well?

26
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,270
Of course. It was her first birthday present
when they started dating.

27
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:12,699
How could she not have mentioned you once
when she confided so many things to you?

28
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:19,140
Probably because we met online...
I was more like a shadow friend.

29
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,840
Shin Ji Hyun has so many friends.

30
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,019
But, what were you looking for?

31
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,980
I'll look for it.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,530
There will be too many CDs to look through.

33
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,580
If that's all right with you.

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,070
You look like you're hurting.

35
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,259
Will you do that?

36
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,070
Yes. Shall I take these up as well?

37
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,830
Sure.

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,870
<i>Why aren't you answering the phone!</i>

39
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,230
<i>The kangaroo doll... you're positive
Ji Hyun's mother took it home with her?</i>

40
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,150
<i>Ji Hyun's seal is in it!</i>

41
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,440
I'm borrowing it. Not stealing it.

42
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,420
This is it.

43
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,850
Okay. Take it with you.

44
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:51,780
Please eat something. You're so thin...
Shin Ji Hyun would be so sad.

45
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,600
Shin Ji Hyun loved you so much.

46
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,530
Ji Hyun said that?

47
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,829
Of course. She always said that...

48
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,910
...she wanted to be as loving and beautiful
a mother as you.

49
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,520
A mother like me?

50
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,339
I thought she loved her dad
and just tolerated me.

51
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,950
Oh not at all.
"My dad is blessed" is what she'd say.

52
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:48,680
I see...
Silly girl, she said all sorts of things.

53
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,020
Is... is there anything else you know?

54
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,820
What is that smell?

55
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,410
I thought you couldn't eat beef leg?

56
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,739
Ahjumma!

57
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,920
<i>Yes, ma'am?</i>

58
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,589
It's In Jung?

59
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,049
She's back?

60
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,349
<i>Yes, I thought she had left.</i>

61
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,410
I'll be off. Goodbye.

62
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,679
May I come again?

63
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,970
Huh?

64
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,930
Yes, please come again.

65
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,370
I'm sorry. I left my cell phone
when I cleaned earlier.

66
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:27,160
There's no way. It has to be here.
This is the only place it could be.

67
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,440
Why is this out?

68
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,390
<i>Did Ahjumma dig through it?</i>

69
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:02,950
<i>Mother? Did she know and take it out?</i>

70
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,230
You didn't know I'd use these methods,
did you?

71
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,670
What are you doing with that head of yours!

72
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,039
They say you get smarter after you die.

73
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,470
I've given it enough thought.

74
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,319
I have to go.

75
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,490
Taxi! Taxi!

76
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,540
You get smarter after you die?

77
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,690
That doesn't sound like just a saying.

78
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,389
It's just a nonsense saying.

79
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:46,290
How did you know what I'd ask?

80
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,290
If I say it, it just is.

81
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:57,340
Use my head?

82
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:05,640
What... is inside... my head?

83
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,490
What is it?

84
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,559
Song Yi Kyung?

85
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,479
Song Yi Kyung!

86
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,389
You're Song Yi Kyung, right?

87
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,909
Right!

88
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,820
To other people, I'm not Shin Ji-Hyun.

89
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,380
Why didn't I think of that?

90
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,789
<i>Why didn't you just fib about it?</i>

91
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,980
You forgot something in Ji Hyun's room
or you lent her something that you need.

92
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,290
I almost died for no reason.

93
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,110
Taxi!

94
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,970
Search for 100 days,
you still won't find it.

95
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,350
Did you find your cell phone?

96
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,450
Yes.

97
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:09,039
But... the stuffed animals from
Ji-Hyun's hospital room are back.

98
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,659
They said the fur wasn't good for her.

99
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,370
Did you take them up to Ji Hyun's room?

100
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,739
Why did you do that?

101
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,379
What?

102
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,939
Leaving the house empty
after sending me off on an errand.

103
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,939
What if a robber had come by the house?

104
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,719
The house has an alarm system.

105
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,749
A few days ago
there was a weird box in the yard.

106
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,849
And didn't you know
that I don't eat beef leg bone?

107
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,950
You've lived with us for so long.

108
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:46,020
I forgot.
I thought you needed something hearty.

109
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:53,050
I should've fed Ji Hyun's friend
before she left. She looked so thin.

110
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,359
Ji Hyun's friend? Did someone come by?

111
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,340
Didn't you see her as you came in?

112
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,469
No.

113
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,989
That's strange.
She opened the door for you as she left.

114
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,280
What?

115
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,580
That friend, who was she?

116
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:35,120
<i>Lady, it's me, the landlady.
I'm here to collect your rent.</i>

117
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,070
Lady, open the door.

118
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,879
<i>I know you're home.</i>

119
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,150
<i>Open the door!</i>

120
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,980
<i>I'll use the key and come in!</i>

121
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,889
I'm sorry, I'll pay tomorrow.

122
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,409
I know you leave money at home,
why tomorrow?

123
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,919
Hand it over immediately!

124
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,269
I don't have money at home.

125
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,129
Who are you kidding?

126
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,919
Should I come in and get it myself?

127
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,130
What?

128
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,229
<i>But I can't take that out myself.</i>

129
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,239
You never pay on time! Just move out!

130
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,570
I don't have money right now.
Please come back tomorrow. Please?

131
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,169
This girl really doesn't have a care.

132
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,929
Do you broadcast it? "I don't like banks.
I pile up money at home."

133
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,170
What'd happen if a robber gets in?

134
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,850
So it wasn't in the kangaroo either.

135
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,579
She's going to trap me like this?

136
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:06,610
Oppa, that friend is really weighing on me.

137
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:13,340
Park... I've never heard that name
from Ji Hyun.

138
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,360
And she was the one who put
the kangaroo upstairs.

139
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,720
Why?

140
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,590
There should be a motive, but there isn't.

141
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,859
Why, for what purpose
would she take the seal?

142
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,820
Unless she knew about our plan, there
would be no reason to take away the seal.

143
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,209
Not even Ji Hyun knew.

144
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:39,490
Why would her friend have an interest?
It doesn't make sense.

145
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,199
And if someone did know, it would be
simple enough to tell Ji Hyun's parents.

146
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,020
That's all true,

147
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,079
but there's no reason for me not to know
someone who would drop by her house.

148
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,660
Everyone has their secrets.

149
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,299
You spent the night in the hospital,
and everything today...

150
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,289
you must be tired. Go in and sleep.

151
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,410
How can I sleep right now?

152
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,529
Ji Hyun's father thinks
the contract is all finished.

153
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:13,340
We can't find the seal, and there isn't much
time before the contract is off the table.

154
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,790
Do you think I could have forgotten
any of that?

155
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,599
I'm afraid.

156
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,970
Don't worry too much. I'll take care of it.

157
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,140
How?

158
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:32,500
If you gave me some more time,
I could answer that question.

159
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,010
I'll call you a taxi.

160
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,670
I need to think some more.

161
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,839
You met Song Yi Kyung at the hospital?

162
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,169
She said she'd only live some 40 days...
that must've been true.

163
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,019
She must be terminal.

164
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,929
It must be true.

165
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,350
Why am I always surrounded by these people?

166
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:59,430
That first day, I should have given her
some more money and just sent her off.

167
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,749
Then why didn't you?

168
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,600
Why didn't you stop me?
Why'd you let me keep her?

169
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:05,849
Does it worry your heart?

170
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,590
Not my heart, it worries me.

171
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,529
If it bothers you, let it bother you.

172
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,560
It's not my heart.

173
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,759
Stop using lines from scripts.

174
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,200
You can't hide from yourself.

175
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,060
Then there is nothing in the world
that couldn�t be hidden.

176
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,540
There are so many things
she does like Shin Ji Hyun.

177
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,190
It frustrates me.

178
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,340
Then watch her a while longer.

179
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,680
Stop thinking about what you can't do,
but about what you can.

180
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,350
Don't do something you know you'll regret.

181
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,480
I should've brought a trowel.

182
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,440
What should I do?

183
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,220
Kang?

184
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:18,200
<i>I do love you</i>

185
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,490
<i>- In this world there is only you.
- That kid.</i>

186
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,709
<i>I shout it to the sky</i>

187
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:31,480
<i>there is no answer in that
burning yellow sky</i>

188
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,220
<i>I do love you</i>

189
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,459
<i>In this world there is only you</i>

190
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,839
I thought you came to my hospital
bedside as my friend,

191
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,539
and now you're even
dancing to my favorite song?

192
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,689
You don't even care if
I live or die, do you?

193
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,170
<i>In this world there is only you</i>

194
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,059
<i>I shout it to the sky</i>

195
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:06,160
<i>There is no answer in that
burning yellow sky</i>

196
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,820
<i>I do love you</i>

197
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,430
<i>In this world there is only you.</i>

198
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,439
<i>I shout it to the sky</i>

199
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,580
<i>There is no answer in that
burning yellow sky</i>

200
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,980
What are you doing here?

201
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,569
I'm cleaning.

202
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,199
How did you know it was cleaning day?

203
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,470
You didn't know it was a vacation day.

204
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,939
I came to yell at you about
not telling me it was a vacation day,

205
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,719
but you were all cleaning. I owe you a lot.

206
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,179
It's fine. Go home.

207
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,950
No.

208
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,710
Go, I said.

209
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,230
I'm fine.

210
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,059
Dear, did you see it?

211
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,040
Oh my, what to do?

212
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,600
Why are you like that?

213
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:24,449
I like this so much.
Han Kang is so handsome, isn't he?

214
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,190
He's cooler than Kim Joo Eun.

215
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,809
Oh, geez. Dramas these days
really mess with women's minds.

216
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,759
Are you upset?

217
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,550
Upset? Come here.

218
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,179
What's wrong?

219
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,549
You're not needed here.

220
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:50,029
I'm helping because I want to.
And I'm not taking pay for today.

221
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,000
Who was giving it?

222
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,599
Why so stubborn
when you're not even healthy?

223
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,799
Not healthy? Ah.

224
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,940
Don't collapse here again, and go rest.

225
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,859
You must've felt sorry
for treating me so badly.

226
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,429
What?

227
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,569
Be patient for just a little while more.

228
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,140
It won't have to deal with
my impertinence much longer.

229
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,759
So that... that's true?

230
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,420
That... 48 days something or other.

231
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,630
That's not really your expected death is it?

232
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,880
From today it's 42 days.

233
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:45,489
How can you say that down to the day?

234
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,180
It's like a deadly type of disease.

235
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:58,460
What I can promise you is that 42 days
after today you won't see me again.

236
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:07,030
I can make sure you'll never see
this face again. I can promise.

237
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,470
You're quite horrible.

238
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,599
How can you use your life...

239
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,920
Clean if you want!

240
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,760
<i>You're so open and honest
with Song Yi Kyung...</i>

241
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,640
<i>...while you were so cold and distant to me.</i>

242
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,780
Ah, it hurts.

243
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,029
Why'd you shower
if you were going to help clean?

244
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,879
You came back?

245
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,700
Yeah, I wanted to ask you
about getting the piano tuned.

246
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,320
<i>Can I?</i>

247
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,100
I lost. I can't play anymore.

248
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,879
Won't you get with it?

249
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,730
Don't you think I want to?
I can't keep up with you.

250
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,620
No, I mean...

251
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,550
That's right.
I'm that kind of bastard, aren't I?

252
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,250
Let's go.

253
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,110
[Oppa, what are you doing?]

254
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,940
As you can see there is no doubt.

255
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:04,719
<i>There is no difference in his brain scan
compared to an unhealthy one.</i>

256
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,089
So there really is no hope?

257
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:13,280
Until the guardians realize
there is nothing to wait for...

258
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,889
My Ji Hyun... Won't you shut up?

259
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:51,520
Why are you doing this?
Can't you hear yourself?

260
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,839
Why are you being so stubborn? Listen to me!

261
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,900
It's my life! Why should I listen to you?

262
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,120
Shut your mouth!

263
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,780
<i>Hey, Il Shik.</i>

264
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,219
Hey, Il Shik.

265
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,220
Go, go, go.

266
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,989
Why did you come?

267
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,770
Father, let's go have dinner.

268
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,020
What do you have to say?

269
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,149
After you eat.

270
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,480
We can eat after we talk.
I don't have an appetite.

271
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,030
Is there an issue at work?

272
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,430
That day, the contract didn't happen.

273
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,480
What are you saying?

274
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,980
That day, Ji Hyun brought us the wrong seal.

275
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,370
She brought you this?

276
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,480
Ji Hyun didn't realize until later.

277
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,750
She was bringing the seal
when she got in the accident.

278
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,729
And we haven't seen the seal since.

279
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,970
What?

280
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,979
Why did you wait so long to tell me?

281
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,430
So why did you not say anything,
all this time?

282
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:21,079
You told me it was all settled well!

283
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,369
With you like this, I couldn't tell you.

284
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,639
I wanted to try everything else first...

285
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,260
Even so! This is so unlike you.

286
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:38,830
Yes, I am like this right now.

287
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:47,230
They are still waiting on the contract
but to sell the land without the seal...

288
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:53,620
we must... declare Ji Hyun dead.

289
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,340
Declare her dead?

290
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,440
I can't do it, Father.

291
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,459
I can't do it.

292
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,590
I have no confidence to do that,
I do not have the self-confidence to do it.

293
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:13,400
Since it is Father's company...
please take care of it.

294
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:20,930
I would just like to be by Ji Hyun's side.

295
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,950
[Letter of Resignation]

296
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,609
Is today your wedding anniversary?

297
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:53,699
My husband wouldn't make me clean
on our wedding anniversary.

298
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,189
Once a month, they make a special day.

299
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,019
My Hwa Jun usually devours pasta,
bread, and things,

300
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,789
but for my health
we've only eaten Korean food.

301
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:08,690
So once a month,
on cleaning day he cooks me pasta.

302
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:13,309
I see... but can we butt in and eat too?

303
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:16,679
Not a chance. You two please eat over there.

304
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,279
The pasta will be overcooked, please eat.

305
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,670
Your food is in the kitchen.

306
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,380
Kang, would you turn off the lights?

307
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,990
Here, let�s toast.

00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:29,199
Ahjussi and ahjumma
must really love each other.

311
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,839
Who fakes love?

312
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,580
I'm jealous.

313
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,200
I wanted to live like that.

314
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,379
Women are so simple.

315
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,989
He just wanted her to clean all day.

316
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,910
To call that comforting...
men are so stupid.

317
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,959
You just said that to comfort me.

318
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,879
What? Why would I?

319
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,090
You're saying he's manipulating her?

320
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,959
I better ask him.

321
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,239
Why are you doing this?

322
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,190
I didn't know.
You're quite a coward, aren't you?

323
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,900
Are you making fun of me?

324
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,940
Hey, stop.

325
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,820
Take this...
it includes up to yesterday's pay.

326
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,259
It's money!

327
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,079
Good, I had spent everything.

328
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,780
I'm saved.

329
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,400
I put in cab fare as well,
so take a taxi home.

330
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,320
Because you helped clean.

331
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,899
If I help out even when I'm not asked,
will you give me more money?

332
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,190
What?

333
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,740
Thank you, Han Kang.

334
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,010
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,709
Are these words fit for 2010?

Those are words from Old Korea...

Is that really what you should be
worrying about?

00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,080
Is it time right now to be
looking for one person?

347
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,240

519
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,090
Even meeting one a day,
how long will it take?

520
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:58,750
But I work from 11 to 11,
when can I meet them?

521
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:05,079
He just took the elevator.
He should be there soon.

522
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,110
Good, okay

523
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,970
Did you make an investment?

524
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:14,220
I'm an employee of Shin Ga San Up,

525
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:20,820
and the president is working, why would you
bring up his daughter's accident?!

526
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,850
I apologize, I'll call back soon.

527
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,230
Father.

528
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:37,480
Who is it?

529
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:45,769
What is it all of a sudden?

530
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:51,740
- What brings you here all of a sudden?
- All of a sudden? You are a ruthless boy.

531
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,080
You saw me as a meaningless father.

532
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,779
Ji Hyun... you can't declare her dead?

533
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,259
Then what about me?

534
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:04,620
Do you think I can declare
my own daughter dead!?

535
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:06,650
I'm sorry.

536
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,760
But the company...

537
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:15,749
As you know, without Ji Hyun�s land,
there's no way we can get the money.

538
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,740
Find another way.

539
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,890
You find it.

540
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:26,600
I didn't make the choice that easily.

541
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,339
I can't concentrate on the company.

542
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:31,870
Don't you care what happens to the company?

543
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,159
What will you do not working here?

544
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,809
This company belongs to you.

545
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:40,119
I will take care of Ji Hyun,
so you can take care of the company.

546
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,780
Quit the company and watch over Ji Hyun!?

547
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:45,230
You call yourself a man?

548
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:49,960
If you're like this and my daughter wakes
up, you think I'd still give her to you?

549
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,959
To a weak-willed bum who quit his job?

550
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,579
Even if it isn't your company,
I can still support Ji Hyun.

551
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:00,840
Immature, thick-headed...

552
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:03,499
That's what I'm saying, you fool!

553
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,139
I scouted you to this company.

554
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,600
Did you come to this company
because of Ji Hyun?

555
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,870
Yes, I came for Ji Hyun.

556
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:16,079
If not for Ji Hyun
why would I have come to Shin Ga San Up?

557
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,319
Because your offer was too good to refuse?

558
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,200
Because of the perks?

559
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:25,700
Because I might succeed you?

560
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,770
You merciless boy. You think I don't know
you're a good catch.

561
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:34,909
You and I both know that there's a chance
Ji Hyun could be like that forever.

562
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:38,630
So why can you and not I be by her side!

563
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,810
Because you're the only person I can trust.

564
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:52,139
After just a little time, you'll know why.

565
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:56,870
You'll be able to understand me.

566
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,789
Why are you doing this to me?

567
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:02,750
You're still here.

568
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,010
Isn't this request enough?

569
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,680
Father.

570
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:27,209
<i>It's been handled well.</i>

571
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:31,840
<i>Don't worry.
I'll call after meeting with Dr. Jung.</i>

572
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:43,849
He chose you, Manager Kang,
who is quite skillful.

573
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:48,740
It's not a praiseworthy task
since losing the seal was my fault.

574
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:54,010
Then, how shall we proceed?

575
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:58,849
So as we planned, Mr. Jung, you will support
us on the Singapore and Haemido land.

576
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:01,350
It is like a guarantee for the contract.

577
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:02,809
A guarantee?

578
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:09,020
If the money is not paid back in time,
the land in Haemido becomes yours.

579
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:15,060
If you can't pay back, Haemido is ours...

580
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:20,860
and if you find the daughter's seal
then our plan goes back to the original.

581
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,499
Contact me once you've
ironed out your terms.

582
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,210
We still need the okay from President Shin.

583
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:30,940
[Kang]

584
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,910
Hello, Kang.

585
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:39,729
You want to meet today?

586
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:41,019
What's this about?

587
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,450
If it were something I could say
over the phone, would I ask you over?

588
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:48,090
Okay, I'll wait.

589
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,930
Why do you keep doing that?

590
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,690
<i>You're meeting Kang before coming here?</i>

591
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:07,000
You know how much
I've been worrying since yesterday.

592
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:10,010
I'm out of my mind with curiosity.

593
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,610
I'll call after hearing
what Kang has to say. Go home.

594
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:18,080
<i>Not my house, yours.</i>

595
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:23,640
We should still be careful. See you later.

596
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,399
You called?

597
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,059
The shop is really busy right now.

598
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,749
Why do you make me call you
when we're really busy?

599
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:44,489
What?

600
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:49,780
Why do you keep poking your head in?

601
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,739
You saw?

602
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,040
You made me see, and now, you saw?

603
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:59,449
What do you need now? I'm curious.

604
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:04,519
Well, there's something
I'd like to negotiate with you.

605
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,129
I know I have no right to but...

606
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:06,999
Negotiate?

607
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,519
You remember what you said?

608
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,019
That day I almost choked and died.

609
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,019
Your words, really.

610
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:17,070
Anyway, you said, how could I come and go
as I please as if this were a freelance job?

611
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:19,929
Can't I do that?

612
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:21,159
Freelance job?

613
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,479
I don't have much time in this body anyway,

614
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:29,089
and there's so much to take care of but
I don't have time outside of working here.

615
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:31,719
Instead, I'll just take 30,000 won an hour.

616
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,609
30,000?

617
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:35,829
Honestly, 40,000 an hour
wasn't that much to start with!

618
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:40,569
When I looked up minimum wage,
it's actually 43,200 per hour.

619
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:43,930
Less than that, it's like slavery!

620
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:46,319
You might as well report me.

621
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:51,059
Oh no, of course not.

622
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,239
It's not my place.

623
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:56,040
Does someone who knows her place borrow my
computer to look up minimum wage standards?

624
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:59,279
I didn�t borrow your computer
for that reason.

625
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,149
Then how did you find out the
minimum wage?

626
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:08,679
That was to figure out how to calculate
the freelance job rate.

627
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,030
So you did do a search here.

628
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:16,650
I did, but I really did it
for the job rate...

629
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:23,689
Do you think someone who stiffed you 320 won
will really pay a freelance rate of 30,000?

630
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:27,520
$2.50. Would that be enough?

631
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,510
Try a little harder.

632
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,599
Thank you for everything.

633
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,410
I'll try to find another freelance job.

634
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,270
Just a minute.

635
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,850
That was a joke.

636
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,419
You know my circumstances
and that was a joke?

637
00:58:55,420 --> 00:59:00,419
That... Do it, the freelance job.
Let's make the contract.

638
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:04,120
For how much? 30,000? 40,000?
50,000? 100,000?

639
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:11,579
What you get now.
No, 45,000 sounds good, right?

640
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:15,410
<i>That way we have met
the minimum wage standards...</i>

641
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,849
What's this? Are you making fun of me?

642
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:26,019
No, just a joke.

643
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,129
Surprised?

644
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,280
You really thought I was angry, didn't you?

645
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,020
<i>Did you come to drink
because you couldn't find my seal?</i>

646
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:14,299
Gi Jun, call Song Yi Kyung over.

647
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,580
Okay.

648
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:17,290
Noonim.

649
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:39,760
Song Yi Kyung, if you don't want to be
misunderstood, don't act so you could be.

650
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,910
Like just now, why act in such a way
to be misunderstood?

651
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:47,069
Just now, I was just standing here, sir.

652
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:50,530
Showing no response
when a customer is speaking.

653
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,889
<i>Ignoring someone after seeing them.</i>

654
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:57,990
At first being overly friendly,
then not at all.

655
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,600
This isn't right.

656
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:03,810
I understand.

657
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:07,240
And not apologizing
after receiving criticism?

658
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,710
Won't you apologize?

659
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:18,460
<i>Remember, if your necklace breaks,
your 49 days are over.</i>

660
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:27,740
I'll strive to correct my behavior.

661
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:32,350
Where did you hear I had a fiancee?

662
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:38,420
You don't have a fiancee?

663
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:41,729
I do, but...

664
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:49,570
Sir, I'm at work,
I have no interest in your personal life.

665
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,160
Just a moment.

666
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,250
Hyung, you're here.

667
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:03,489
You should have come to my office,
why are you here?

668
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:04,599
<i>Let's go.</i>

669
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,590
Okay.

670
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,670
Go ahead.

671
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,950
What did Song Yi Kyung do before this?

672
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:22,440
Why?

673
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:25,180
Are you in a relationship with her?

674
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:30,700
No, she's just a part-timer.

675
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:34,190
Then fire her.

676
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:35,249
What?

677
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:40,410
Why use someone who makes
customers uncomfortable?

678
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,580
I'll have to train her again.

679
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:44,670
Here.

680
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:47,209
You said she's someone whose
circumstances you're trying to improve.

681
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:48,329
What are her circumstances?

682
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:50,540
That's her private life.

683
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,550
You're quite strange.

684
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:55,680
Is she your friend, a lover?

685
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,489
Why not tell me if she's just a part-timer?

686
01:02:57,490 --> 01:03:01,400
Even a part-timer
has a personal life and pride.

687
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:06,840
You're being so unlike yourself, why?

688
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:07,819
What about me?

689
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:11,060
You're usually such a cold person.

690
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:14,100
But you're not to her... why?

691
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:26,339
Ji Hyun being in the state she's in,
I feel bad to her and you for saying this,

692
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,709
but if you take Ji Hyun out of the equation,

693
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:32,500
you acting this way...
it means you're attracted to her.

694
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:33,739
What?

695
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:40,030
You're interested, but you can't say
you like her, and bother her instead.

696
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:43,759
You know, the kind of things
immature cowardly men do.

697
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,480
Say something plausible.

698
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,419
So why do something so unlike you?

699
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:54,120
Going overboard and being overly sensitive.

700
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,610
I'm not saying you really...

701
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:04,139
Did you call me here to say this?

702
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,109
- No, but...
- Then let's talk later.

703
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:07,950
My mood is wretched.

704
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,300
<i>Hyung, you acting this way...
it means you're attracted to her.</i>

705
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:30,920
<i>Me?</i>

706
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:36,029
<i>You're interested, but you can't say
you like her, and bother her instead.</i>

707
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:39,870
<i>You know, the kind of things
immature cowardly men do.</i>

708
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:42,990
<i>I... that woman?</i>

709
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:48,210
You startled me.

710
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:02,060
You offend me.

711
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,369
Song Yi Kyung,
why do you look at me like that?

712
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:09,210
What is "like that"?

713
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:11,180
That look of contempt.

714
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:16,650
No one's ever looked at me like that.

715
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:26,460
Could it be that you see my eyes that way
because you think you ought to see it?

716
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:29,980
- What?
- If not, then good.

717
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:37,800
You... you're very interesting.

It�s better than being a scheduler like me,

726
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,040
you're a hundred times better off.

727
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,369
<i>How did you become a scheduler?</i>

728
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:12,559
<i>You came by yesterday?</i>

729
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:14,079
<i>I think she knows.</i>

730
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,619
<i>When I see that girl, she reminds me
of Shin Ji Hyun.</i>

731
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:17,789
<i>I don�t like you.</i>

732
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:18,959
<i>Why don�t you like me?</i>

733
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,069
I said I do not like you.

734
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:23,910
Let�s just end it here.
You're fired, don�t ever show up here again.
