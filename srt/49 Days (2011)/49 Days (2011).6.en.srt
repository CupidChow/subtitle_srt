00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,200
You... are really quite intriguing.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,960
Episode 6

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,720
You don't merely flirt with me for me to fall for you,

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,978
You pretend to be familiar with me,
and you pretend that you're scared.

7
00:00:27,097 --> 00:00:30,651
And now you ignorantly laugh at me.
Your tricks are very clever.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,040
Customer, you seem to have something you're unhappy about.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,830
You've succeeded in catching my attention.
But stop before you go far.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,410
I'm not someone who can casually
have a relation with you.

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,750
What I mean is, don't look at me like that anymore.

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,100
<i>President Kang, what's the matter?</i>

13
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,860
I've made a mistake.
I'm sorry customer.

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,880
Secretary Shin, is something wrong?

15
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,180
I wanted to eat here before going home.

16
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,850
Kang.

17
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,150
You came just in time.
Hyung, come on in.

18
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,190
How could you leave without finishing our talk?

19
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,050
I only wanted to step out to make a call.

20
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,930
Let's go inside.

21
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,840
Those guys, seriously.

22
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,000
How could those two come here together?

23
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,410
Probably because they're annoyed
that they can't sell my land.

24
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,380
<i>Even though you're Shin Ji Hyun,
you can't expose Shin Ji Hyun's identity.</i>

25
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,950
Not just through your words,
even your heart.

26
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,900
What does not even my heart mean?

27
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,990
No matter who, whether it's your father, mother, friend or lover.

28
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,560
You can't even drop a hint that
you're Shin Ji Hyun.

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,470
<i>Of course stealing is out of the question.</i>

30
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,730
I have to be more careful.

31
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,050
You said you won't design it anymore,
what do you mean by that?

32
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,240
I know myself. If I don't like it,
I definitely won't do it.

33
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,140
- Hey, punk.
- Well, aren't there other design companies?

34
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,320
You can get them to do it.

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,170
Do you think I asked you because I
couldn't entrust this job to anyone else?

36
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,730
Kang, why did you suddenly
decide to not do it?

37
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,050
I'm just a little annoyed.

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,960
Do you do things according to your interest?

39
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,440
Is this a toy you can just throw
away once you get bored of it?

40
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,930
Haven't I always been like this?

41
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,080
- Hyung, you know what kind of person I am?
- Hey, no matter what you say...

42
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,650
I'll give you all the sketches up
to this point as a reference.

43
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,860
Hey.

44
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,400
Come with me.

45
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,510
What happened between you
and the waiter just now?

46
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,920
Didn't you hear?
She made a mistake.

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,940
What mistake did she make?

48
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,100
What exactly did she do to
make you go to that extent?

49
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,140
<i>Hyung, aren't you always kind to everybody?</i>

50
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,300
<i>But why do you treat that
woman the opposite?</i>

51
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,780
Is it serious?

52
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,020
It's nothing.

53
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,570
When you took a training course
at the hotel,

54
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,760
didn't you learn that you
must lead the customers in?

55
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,510
Why do you always make the customers angry?

56
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,080
Only because you said that
was your friend's fianc�.

57
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,090
So I did that because I didn't
have to be too formal.

58
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,050
When did I ever tell you to not be formal?

59
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,820
- I only told you to not flirt.
- When was I flirting?

60
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,890
It didn't look like you were
flirting with him?

61
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,680
<i>The first time...</i>

62
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,470
Please!

63
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,790
Seriously, why did you do that last time?

64
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,210
That time, I didn't quite understand.

65
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,470
Because at that time, I thought of someone.

66
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,920
But this definitely won't happen
in the future.

67
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,920
How could you let your emotions...

68
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,060
Do you think taking action is everything?

69
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,230
I'm just saying.

70
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,450
I hope that this won't happen
again in the future.

71
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,590
Min Ho hyung is my customer.

72
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,640
He's also my friend's fianc�.

73
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,710
This clearly annoys me,
but he still takes care of the fianc�.

74
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,350
What? Why are you looking at
me like that again?

75
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,310
Is your relationship with that
friend really great?

76
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,120
Why are you asking?

77
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,120
Go, get back to work.

78
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,370
Why isn't Kang back yet?

79
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,650
So you were saying you couldn't resist
coming here in such a short time span?

80
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,650
Could I resist?

81
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,860
Because I was too curious,
I wanted to see your face at least.

82
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,930
Be careful of what you say.

83
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,880
I'm leaving first.

84
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,820
Why did you get up?

85
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,210
Didn't you say it's really busy today?
Let's talk tomorrow.

86
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,550
You don't have to come again
tomorrow. Take it.

87
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,350
We're not done discussing yet.

88
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,870
In Jung, I'm leaving.

89
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,640
Then give me a ride.

90
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,660
I feel a bit sick.

91
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,640
I can't even walk for five minutes.

92
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,610
Kang, I'm leaving.

93
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,920
Okay, go.

94
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,640
This design must be completed by you.
Please take care.

95
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,020
Have a good day.

96
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,750
Why are you doing something
you don't normally do?

97
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,080
What's there to worry about?

98
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,290
No one would be suspicious
of me riding in your car.

99
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,140
It's only a five minute walking distance.

100
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,210
Also, you've never asked before.

101
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,570
Didn't I say that I feel a bit sick?

102
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,770
Tell me.

103
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,480
How did the conversation with
Ji Hyun's father go?

104
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,140
What was the decision?

105
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,930
I'll tell you on the way.

106
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,240
So there was a method like that.

107
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,470
Father won't admit Ji Hyun is incompetent.

108
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,430
Because that means he admits that
his daughter won't ever recover.

109
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,730
We've endured many hardships,
but you don't seem very happy.

110
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,450
I don't know if it'll be a month
or two months.

111
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,140
Aren't we always putting it off?

112
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,600
You've already waited for two years.
You can't wait another one or two months?

113
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,720
Do you know how tired I've
been these past two years?

114
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,770
If not a place like this, it's a hotel room.

115
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,930
I've had enough.

116
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,170
What's so important about the location?

117
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,920
What's important is chatting comfortably and
not meeting other people's glances.

118
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:09,020
I really don't know when will be the day
when I can live at your house comfortably.

119
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,220
We'll be together for our whole lives.

120
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,030
President Shin still needs some
time to give up on Ji Hyun.

121
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,420
Do you really hope that the Shin family
will go bankrupt like Director Jung wants?

122
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,650
If we went as planned, this would've
ended on the day of the wedding ceremony.

123
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,790
I would also have quit my job
at the company.

124
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,360
When it's almost time, you should quit.

125
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,280
You want me to quit?

126
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,480
Just follow the previous plan.

127
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,520
As for the rest, I'll settle
everything well.

128
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,840
<i>Let's go. There are still many
things to inspect.</i>

129
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,750
<i>There's also a lot of material that
needs to be prepared.</i>

130
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,350
Our closeness before;

131
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,990
Was it all fake?

132
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,730
In Jung.

133
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,380
Exactly when did you stop being my friend?

134
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:38,790
I never thought that you weren't my friend.

135
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,720
That's right! It's this!

136
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,620
Why didn't I think of this before?

137
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,620
Wow, Shin Ji Hyun,

138
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,290
Even if your IQ level was this
low when you were alive...

139
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,960
Wow.

140
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,433
I'm really busy. What do you want?

141
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:19,280
This phone is a cell phone you gave me.

142
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,250
Can this be used to talk to living people?

143
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,570
You've never used it?
Wow, I'm speechless. I'm hanging up.

144
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,160
So this isn't used especially
for the Scheduler.

145
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes.

146
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,080
I'm Shin Ji Hyun's friend.

147
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,460
Have you heard of Ji Hyun's car accident?

148
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,140
Because of that I want to meet.

149
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,020
Then I'll go to the gallery tomorrow.

150
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,020
Okay.

151
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,290
<i>Miss!</i>

152
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,400
<i>I was right. Miss, your rent!</i>

153
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,775
What's wrong with her?

154
00:11:04,776 --> 00:11:07,990
- Miss! Miss!
- Why does that ahjumma always find me?

155
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,590
Miss!

156
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,770
<i>Miss!</i>

157
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,420
<i>I say, Miss!</i>

158
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,780
<i>Miss!</i>

159
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,650
What should I do?

160
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,650
What should I do? What should I do?

161
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,980
<i>Miss!</i>

162
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,320
Is there something wrong?

163
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,870
Is something wrong?

164
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,360
You told me to collect the rent
from you today.

165
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,370
Why are you hiding from me?

166
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,340
I did?

167
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,340
Just now you ran away when you saw me!

168
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,800
I... I've been sleeping this whole time.

169
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,970
Then was I wrong?

170
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,420
Anyway, you told me to come
today so hand it over quickly.

171
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,180
When did I tell you to collect it today?

172
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,230
You told me yesterday.
When I came to collect rent yesterday.

173
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,910
You came here yesterday?

174
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,240
You live nocturnally, but did you
develop a mental problem?

175
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,050
<i>Miss...</i>

176
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,050
Whatever. Give me the rent.

177
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,530
It's four days late.

178
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,980
Please wait a moment.

179
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,040
Unni is noticing a difference.

180
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,460
The 49 days notification center
is telling you

181
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,130
right now isn't an emergency.

182
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,540
I hope that you'll stop pressing
the emergency button immediately.

183
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,620
<i>What?</i>

184
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,500
If this isn't an emergency situation,
then what is?

185
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,190
Ah, seriously!

186
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,230
Oh?

187
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,890
Unni didn't notice.

188
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,050
Thank god.

189
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,200
<i>How arrogant must that person be,
for someone like oppa to do that?</i>

190
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,080
<i>Hyung, right now you seem interested in her.</i>

191
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:44,930
That's outrageous. That's impossible.

192
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,900
Good morning!

193
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,800
Is 11:00 considered morning?

194
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,870
Because the weather's really nice.

195
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,300
The spot that says start work
at 11:00, please sign.

196
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,770
What's this?

197
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,140
Time I start work, time I'm on my break,
time I come back and time I get off.

198
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,800
If it's all recorded, it'll be easier
to calculate my pay.

199
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,550
Okay then.

200
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,610
Thank you president.

201
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,050
Remove the president part.

202
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,230
If I don't call the president, president,
then what should I call him?

203
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,143
Mr. Han Kang?

204
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:43,290
Like that? Or, Han Kang?

205
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,800
Han Kang?

206
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,728
Seriously, can't I call you Han Kang?

207
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:50,370
If you've really lived in America before,
doesn't everybody go by their names?

208
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,790
Jenny, John, Brad, Kang. Hey Kang!

209
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,310
Because the weather's really nice.

210
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,250
I've slightly lost a little bit
of integrity.

211
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,080
I'm going to work.

212
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,440
Yi Kyung, that notebook, what is it?

213
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,450
This?  Because I'm going to
be a freelance worker.

214
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,520
A freelance worker?

215
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,160
Because there's many times I have to leave.

216
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,210
Shin Ji Hyun really likes her mother.

217
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,170
She said that she wanted to become the most
beautiful and kindest person in the world.

218
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,460
And become a mother like her own mother.

219
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,330
<i>Honey! Honey!</i>

220
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,260
Honey!

221
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,250
I knew this would happen. Seriously.

222
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,110
Once you said you're bringing the pork bone
soup, I knew this would happen.

223
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,250
Bone soup?

224
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,710
I said I wanted to lose weight, so I lied
about making pork bone soup.

225
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,710
Because I don't eat pork bone soup.

226
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,080
But with something this heavy,

227
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,290
What if you hurt your hand?

228
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,640
Oh no. If today's menu is pork bone soup...

229
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:42,250
That means you have to eat bone
soup every day of this week.

230
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,050
Well you're supposed to eat
it every spring and fall.

231
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,050
This guy doesn't eat much seafood.

232
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,150
He doesn't eat meat either.

233
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,680
Oh, isn't this the smell of bone soup?

234
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,860
Yi Kyung, you don't like bone soup?

235
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,610
I could eat this everyday for a month.

236
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,970
Really?

237
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:07,060
Once I ate too much and I couldn't
sleep for the entire night.

238
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,210
Oh my!

239
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,060
You and I must be fated! Oh my!

240
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,560
Ji Hyun, mother is here.

241
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,150
Husband, you haven't eaten yet right?

242
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,390
<i>Ji Hyun, let your dad eat first.</i>

243
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,980
The soup will smell like seafood
once it cools.

244
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,190
Ji Hyun's mom.

245
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,330
What soup is it?

246
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,560
Don't you and Ji Hyun love bone soup?

247
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,160
Wife, come let me see.

248
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,040
I'm not crazy.

249
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,480
Ji Hyun's friend dropped by the house.

250
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,040
She said that Ji Hyun told her that

251
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,870
she wants to become a mother like me.

252
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,460
Ji Hyun's friend said that?

253
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,290
Yes she said that.

254
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:09,040
The daughter and her father are inseparable.

255
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,770
And I'm just ignored on the side.

256
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,410
How are we ignoring you?

257
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,590
Maybe, but she said no.

258
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:27,910
She said Ji Hyun wants to become
a mother like me.

259
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,280
Ji Hyun said that.

260
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,900
You didn't know, right?

261
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,570
The image, Ji Hyun has of me in her heart.

262
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,500
So you came here to show off?

263
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,500
You felt embarrassed to show off directly,

264
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,820
so you brought bone soup as an excuse?

265
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,580
Honey.

266
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,920
I...

267
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,710
have lived over half my life.

268
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:03,010
This is the first time I heard someone say
that they want to become a person like me.

269
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,420
That's great.

270
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:12,520
So far, I haven't even heard that once.

271
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,020
I'm like that in her heart.

272
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,920
How can I collapse?

273
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,730
What would she do if she thought
I've given up on her?

274
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,430
Where is there a mother who'd
give up on her child?

275
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,990
So, I want to take care of her more.

276
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,630
<i>And pray for her.</i>

277
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,150
If there really is a God,

278
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,600
he wouldn't be so cold-hearted.

279
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,170
We only have one child left;

280
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,880
Would he still steal her away?

281
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,500
<i>- It's delicious.
- Delicious.</i>

282
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,980
Do you want another bowl?

283
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,150
Yes, is there still rice left?

284
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,170
There's only rice left for Sujin and Joon.

285
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,830
I didn't touch it.

286
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,950
You're not eating anymore?

287
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,250
I'm finished. Ki Jun, a cup of coffee.

288
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,510
Yes, sir.

289
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,360
It's not very nice of me if I eat
all the rice Ahjussi made.

290
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,860
Everybody eating well is the same as
eating well myself. Right?

291
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,250
Of course.

292
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,310
But, your appetite is great.

293
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,550
I've always been a big eater.

294
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,900
I must've been a beggar in my previous life.

295
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,590
I hate that kind of Ahjumma the most.

296
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,130
<i>They can either not bring their kid or
look after them if they do.</i>

297
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,030
Be careful.

298
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,440
You're still eating?

299
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,440
I'm done.

300
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,890
Look at that!

301
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,890
I knew an accident was bound to happen.

302
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,430
I'll go take a look.

303
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,360
<i>Did you get hurt?</i>

304
00:22:34,442 --> 00:22:36,280
Don't cry!

305
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,510
<i>I told you to stop running around.</i>

306
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,100
<i>Seriously.</i>

307
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,860
Unni, do you have any tissues?

308
00:22:45,111 --> 00:22:46,720
Yes.

309
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,440
Here you go.

310
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,310
Seriously! Cry! Cry!

311
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,210
Oh, the tissue got hurt when it fell. Look.

312
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,650
We have to let it get better.

313
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:14,379
Press on it hard.

314
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,900
Open your hand.

315
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,900
<i>Here, hold it.</i>

316
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,540
Noona will sprinkle some magic dust on it.

317
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,630
Okay, open your hand and see.

318
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,140
A beautiful child needs to use
a beautiful tissue. Got it?

319
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,260
Which hand?

320
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,360
Wow, it's candy.

321
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:05,280
Wow, amazing.

322
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,670
Look carefully.

323
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,010
This looks like this.

324
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,910
Then it's like this. Now you got it?

325
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,960
Try it.

326
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,690
Start over.

327
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,210
How many times have I done it?
It's your turn to try.

328
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,230
Why do I have to?

329
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,770
If you don't learn this, then
why did you come to our club?

330
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,290
I came because I had to choose a club.

331
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,900
Every year our club holds a celebration where
we organize a magic show to earn our funds.

332
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,780
It's very important.

333
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,290
You can earn a living from learning this?

334
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,030
Then learn how to do the magic trick.

335
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,360
Why should I?

336
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,180
I'm leaving! You're like ripped paper!

337
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,820
Here, have a cup of coffee.

338
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,060
Okay.

339
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,410
You know magic tricks?

340
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,260
I saw you showed that kid a magic trick.

341
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,130
Oh that.
I learned from a friend.

342
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,800
When you see Yi Kyung, doesn't she
remind you of someone?

343
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,300
Other than Hwa Jun, what other
woman do I have?

344
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,910
Why do I always think of Shin Ji Hyun
when I see her?

345
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,620
Their personalities are similar.

346
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,070
Careless, optimistic,

347
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,784
have a good appetite.

348
00:26:15,785 --> 00:26:17,010
Bright, has a good appetite.

349
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,170
Wrap pasta around the chopsticks
three times.

350
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,800
Don't like bay leaves, and have a bad habit
of scratching her hands.

351
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,550
She even knows magic tricks.

352
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,170
- Oh really?
- And her tone.

353
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,480
Her tone's the same too.

354
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,330
The same feeling as well.

355
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,000
Even the feelings are the same right?

356
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,460
<i>I heard that seeing things you liked before
can possibly affect your brain.</i>

357
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,790
That's why I'm recording messages
of her friends.

358
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,880
So it is possible.

359
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:03,580
I heard that Ji Hyun met you soon
after she moved to Seoul.

360
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,060
When she transferred schools,
she and I were the closest friends.

361
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,710
We were in the same class for grade 12.

362
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,320
Then that means you've agreed
to do the message?

363
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,430
Then you have a lot of memories right?

364
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,960
For example, what you're most
thankful of Ji Hyun for.

365
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:19,020
That means, what is the most touching thing?

366
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,480
Can't I just say something that
will encourage Ji Hyun?

367
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,260
If I let her know how much
her friends love her,

368
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,690
Maybe her desire to return
to life will be stronger.

369
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,670
The best will be something that can
create tears of gratitude.

370
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,810
Create tears of gratitude?

371
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,860
Hey, isn't there that one?

372
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,880
That time when I carried you while
running in grade 12.

373
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,980
In grade 12, one time I fainted.

374
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,450
At that time my parents went to the countryside
to pay respect to our ancestors.

375
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,310
That's right! It's this one.

376
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,860
Ji Hyun stayed with me for the entire
night in the hospital room.

377
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,150
Think about the gratefulness you felt
and say something to Ji Hyun.

378
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,200
Ji Hyun,

379
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,140
thank you very much for that.

380
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,330
I should be taking care of
you in the hospital too.

381
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,960
I'm sorry I can't be by your side.

382
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,160
Cry! Myung Shin. Cry. Cry.

383
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,160
But if you can wake up,

384
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,670
I'll buy you whatever you want to
eat for the rest of your life.

385
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,180
You don't need you to buy anything. Quickly cry.

386
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,770
You must wake up soon.

387
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,660
I'm finished.

388
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,830
That fast?

389
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,030
Do I have to say more?

390
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,270
No.

391
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:48,850
But, it doesn't appear to move you to tears.

392
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,450
I usually don't have many tears.

393
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,450
It's not like Ji Hyun's dead.

394
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,340
Will you only cry when I die?

395
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,570
Then we're done right?

396
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:05,040
Being in grade 12 and doing that
for a friend definitely isn't easy.

397
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,690
That's true.

398
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,560
But for Ji Hyun, she wasn't
pressured to study hard.

399
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,600
<i>She didn't do very well in school.</i>

400
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:17,160
By the way, how's Ji Hyun's fianc�?

401
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,640
<i>In Ji Hyun's condition, is he going to
break off the engagement?</i>

402
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,930
<i>He should've automatically done that.</i>

403
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,920
<i>She was talking about some destined
love in her life and showing off all the time.</i>

404
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,500
Did Min Ho go to the hospital?

405
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,800
She's someone who can cry watching
cartoons. What? Have no tears?

406
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,410
Stupid girl.

407
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,540
I'm in that state and you're only curious
about breaking the engagement?

408
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,640
Is it really because I'm not dead yet?

409
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,160
Now you're gaining some weight.

410
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,510
The legs need to be massaged too.

411
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,020
They say if you lay for too long,
they'll be paralyzed.

412
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,450
You should go home.

413
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,710
Don't force yourself here.

414
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,050
I know.

415
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,270
Ji Hyun,

416
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,990
Wait until mother goes home to
eat and regain energy.

417
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,830
I'll come see you again tomorrow.

418
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,270
Don't come anymore.

419
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:50,240
You should go take a look at the company.

420
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,890
Even if Min Ho is there,

421
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,310
It's not a good idea for the head
to be at Ji Hyun's side.

422
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,700
What are you, a woman, intervening in company matters?

423
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,160
I'll decide what to do. Go.

424
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,790
- What I mean is...
- Go, quickly go.

425
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,650
Are you here to see our Ji Hyun?

426
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,320
Yes.

427
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,480
You can go see her.

428
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,740
<i>Let's go.</i>

429
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,630
Hey, Shin Ji Hyun. Are you still doing okay?

430
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,010
I brought this.

431
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:47,340
Your favorite, these greyish colored roses.

432
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,010
That's right, you're here.

433
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,970
<i>You're here.</i>

434
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,520
But I don't know why I keep
seeing you elsewhere.

435
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,320
I must be crazy.

436
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,980
<i>You're here, lying here exhaustingly.</i>

437
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,360
But I thought of someone else as you,
that's really inconsiderate of me.

438
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,060
Of course I'm inconsiderate, I'm crazy.

439
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,900
That's what you have to say.

440
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,450
Seo Woo, I came.

441
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,380
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

442
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,510
Hello.

443
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,670
Hello.

444
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,230
You like to eat that pastry?  I saw you
bought that pastry last time as well.

445
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,240
Yes because it's super delicious.

446
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,610
I have a friend who'd buy a big
bag full of pastries every week.

447
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:42,000
She'd hand them out to the cleaning ahjummas
and the security ahjussis at the company.

448
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,870
She'd also eat them herself.

449
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,180
She loved eating pastries.
Especially that one.

450
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,750
Really? Is she a really good friend?

451
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,170
I was just thinking about that friend.

452
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,570
Exactly what kind of friend is she?

453
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,900
<i>You were so lost in thought and it
wasn't even about a man.</i>

454
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,180
She's not that kind of friend.

455
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,180
What?

456
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,120
That wasn't what I meant either.

457
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:14,010
It's just, friends must be really close
to be lost in thought about them.

458
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,040
I was envious.

459
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,470
Please enjoy your purchase.

460
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,470
Okay.

461
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,040
Han Kang!

462
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,040
Mr. Han Kang!

463
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,020
You didn't answer when I called,
and just left.

464
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,210
Why were you calling me?

465
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:55,200
It seemed like you saw me but
you left without saying a word.

466
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,320
You didn't see me?

467
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,710
I didn't.

468
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,060
Where were you coming back from?

469
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:17,590
What's with him? Did I come too late?

470
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,280
That's not it.

471
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,340
What are you doing here?

472
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,390
I bought pastries.

473
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,670
No thanks.

474
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,790
Then eat it later when you're hungry...

475
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,340
There's no need, take it away.

476
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,701
Everyone in the restaurant gets one.

477
00:36:49,702 --> 00:36:52,080
Manager, Sujin unni, Joon, manager's wife.

478
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,970
Stop talking! I already said no!

479
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,810
If there isn't anything else, then leave.

480
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,070
Then this...

481
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:09,120
Is it because I didn't ask for permission
when I came back?

482
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,590
You're a freelance worker. So I don't care
whether or not you come to work.

483
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,440
I don't care when you leave or
when you return. It doesn't matter.

484
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:20,030
And this, just get the manager to sign it.

485
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,380
Leave.

486
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,160
What's the matter with you all of a sudden?

487
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,200
Did I make a mistake that I'm not aware of?

488
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,690
If it's like that, then tell me.

489
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:32,620
Miss Song Yi Kyung, am I your friend?

490
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,120
You're an employee, I'm the president.

491
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,880
You don't leave when I tell you and
you still have so much to say.

492
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,900
Also in the future,

493
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,330
Don't come in here whenever
you please, understand?

494
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,410
Miss Song Yi Kyung, you don't have a mouth?
Or are you a mute?

495
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,040
<i>The president said something,
why aren't you replying?</i>

496
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,180
It's just because you're so clueless,
it causes the customers to get angry.

497
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,600
I understand.

498
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:18,120
What's with him? He's so heartless.

499
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,960
He was fine a while ago.

500
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,240
Is it because of Kang Min Ho?

501
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,310
<i>He clearly likes to eat this.</i>

502
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,430
What's the matter with him all of a sudden?

503
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,990
[What are you doing? Have you eaten supper?]

504
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,290
[I'm in the middle of work.
Be happier when you eat.]

506
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,660
Hello?

00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,370
I'm Chauffeur Cha.

508
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:18,210
The President's wife told me to go to your
house and I'm on my way now.

509
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,370
Ji Hyun's mother?

510
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,580
Well then, I'll get going.

511
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,510
Mr. Jin Young.

512
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,390
Leader Kang...

513
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,550
Where is oppa right now?

514
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,550
He's at home.

515
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,730
I've already called Chauffeur Cha.

516
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,940
You should go to the supermarket
to buy some beef bones.

518
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,850
<i>Oh, In Jung, what is it?</i>

519
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,020
You haven't eaten supper yet right?

520
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,020
Let's go out for supper.

521
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,500
Why am I always yawning?

522
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,160
Welcome.

523
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,990
We meet again.

524
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,500
Please go inside.

525
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,000
Yi Kyung.

526
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,340
You look extremely tired.
You can get off work.

527
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,220
There's not many customers tomorrow,
Go home and rest.

528
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,220
You don't look very well.

529
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,000
Is it that bad?

530
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,520
- Then I'll be going.
- Okay

531
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,000
Seems like Han Kang didn't come
to the shop today.

532
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,230
Isn't he in the office? Go take a look.

533
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,620
Forget it.
He's probably working.

534
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,310
What should we eat?

535
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:49,500
Han Kang probably hasn't eaten supper yet.
Call him over to eat with us.

536
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,250
Is that okay?

537
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,230
Is that worker just now, a
really good worker?

538
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,040
I saw that the manager treats her well.

539
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,040
It's all because of the president.

540
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:10,100
Because of Kang?

541
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:13,030
Our president likes Song Yi Kyung.

542
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,230
Kang?

543
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:18,690
He'll let her do anything regardless if it's an
unexplained absence, going out or being late.

544
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,280
And now she's even some free worker.

545
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,720
He says as along as she's willing, she can
come work whenever she wants.

546
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,160
Han Kang isn't that type of person.

547
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,290
Also, doesn't Ji Hyun have a fianc�?

548
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,980
You don't even know how arrogant
she is towards him.

549
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,060
Towards leader Kang?

550
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,480
It's because I wasn't feeling well.

551
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,220
So you can just pick it up here.

552
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,230
Pick up what?

553
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:50,500
Money. 49,000 won.

554
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,670
The emergency money you lent me.

555
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,080
<i>Didn't you tell me to return it before the 49 days are over?</i>

556
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,660
You can come take it.

557
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,790
You bring it to me!

558
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:02,890
Of course the person who borrowed money has come return it.
How is it reasonable for the lender to pick it up?

559
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,360
I have a lot of inspiration right now.
I must finish writing this song.

560
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,360
You come over here.

561
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:14,220
If I return this body to unni,
Then I can't hold money anymore.

562
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,730
You can hold the money that's
intended for me.

563
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,460
Okay now?

564
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,390
Unni, I'm leaving now.

565
00:43:31,867 --> 00:43:38,825
<i>I try to feel you at the tip of my fingers</i>

566
00:43:39,015 --> 00:43:46,669
<i>But I forget. I always forget that I can't touch you.</i>

567
00:43:47,173 --> 00:43:49,854
<i>Do you know?</i>

568
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:55,823
<i>Because you live in the one room of my heart,</i>

569
00:43:55,824 --> 00:44:01,632
<i>No one else will do.</i>

570
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:12,531
<i>Even the memories are lost, even the warmth is gone... now.</i>

571
00:44:12,728 --> 00:44:20,324
<i>I'm a scarecrow standing on one foot</i>

572
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:28,088
<i>I'm a sad scarecrow, my heart aching without you.</i>

573
00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:32,832
<i>In the harsh wind, I keep swaying</i>

574
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:36,649
<i>Even if my body scatters apart</i>

575
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:42,619
<i>If you'd come to me some day</i>

576
00:44:42,966 --> 00:44:47,479
<i>I'll wait for you.</i>

577
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,720
Oh yeah. Not bad.

578
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,760
That wasn't much.

579
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,760
You're really a scheduler
talented in many areas.

580
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:08,722
Nightclubs, coffee shops,
motorcycle, guitar.

581
00:45:08,723 --> 00:45:11,710
You're so ignorant.  You only saw the guitar?
It's the song that's most important.

582
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,370
I was originally a singer songwriter.

583
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,730
Even I could do something at this level.

584
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,030
Before, there was a period of time
when I dreamed to become a singer.

585
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,190
Then dogs or cats can even become singers.

586
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,920
You...

587
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:43,480
Here, the syllable and the beat is off.

588
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,080
<i>I'm a single legged scarecrow,
standing all alone.</i>

589
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,610
You should sing it like that.

590
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,730
Wow, you weren't bluffing.

591
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,510
Why didn't you go become a singer?

592
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:58,510
My dad wouldn't let me.

593
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,930
Wanting me to find a nice man to marry

594
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,970
Is my dad's greatest mission in life.

595
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,680
Then that's Kang Min Ho?

596
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,770
I was just saying.

597
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:10,420
You picked and chose and you still
chose a defective one?

598
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:17,700
How come you're like this too?

599
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:20,730
Today I was originally going to try
my best to collect tears.

600
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:22,670
Do you know how miserably bad fate is?

601
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,230
Misery.
It's a necessary course for a 49 dayer.

602
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,160
You say it's a necessary course?

603
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,160
Didn't I already tell you at the
funeral last time?

604
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:35,700
Humans are very complicated.

605
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:38,280
People who die according to their set path;

606
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:44,070
And don't personally attend funerals, have
collected good fortune from their past life.

607
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,650
It's getting scarier and scarier.
Why are you like this?

608
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,560
But compared to me who can
only be a scheduler;

609
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,420
You're hundreds of times better off.

610
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,040
Because you still have hope
for a chance to live.

611
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:04,470
Why did you become a scheduler?

612
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,250
I volunteered.

613
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,990
Is the messenger of the nether
world voluntary too?

614
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,540
Why did you volunteer?

615
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,150
I don't know what it is.

616
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,740
I think when I died, I had something
sincerely important left to do.

617
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,550
So that's why I volunteered.

618
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,070
As long as I complete my five year
term without incident,

619
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,370
I can go back to do that thing.

620
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,080
That's the reason why I became a scheduler.

621
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,280
Something sincerely important?

622
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,260
What is it?

623
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:43,950
If I knew, then why would I be
a scheduler devoted to my job?

624
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:45,940
Of course I must complete my job as a
scheduler and quickly go back to finish it.

625
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,850
That's true.

626
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,280
You're quite pitiful too.

627
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:52,410
You're also pretty young.

628
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,360
You still have the nerve to
talk about others?

629
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,330
Just quickly return the money!

630
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,260
Excuse me,

631
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,050
The Miss Song Yi Kyung who works
here at night,

632
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,960
Why isn't she coming?

633
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,220
I don't know.

634
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:17,530
You don't know?

635
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,680
She didn't say anything about not coming.

636
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,970
Why isn't unni coming down yet?

637
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:39,210
Right now is seriously an
emergency situation.

638
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:43,630
Ay, how long ago were we separated? You're starting
to yell about an emergency situation again.

639
00:48:43,863 --> 00:48:46,660
Song Yi Kyung unni still hasn't
come home yet.

640
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,460
What?

641
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,600
Unni doesn't look well.

642
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,920
Quickly go to the hospital.

643
00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:00,210
Of course you'll have to take her.
How am I supposed to take her?

644
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,280
Why can't you? Can't you just
go into her body?

645
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:04,280
Me?

646
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:11,520
Quickly come out.

647
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:13,690
My stomach hurts.

648
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,330
My head feels dizzy, I am nauseated.

649
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,930
Since you're sick, then you have to be
completely responsible for it.

650
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,950
I already said it wasn't me who felt sick.

651
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,480
After we get to the hospital and see the
doctor, then hopefully you can still say that.

652
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,880
You're letting me to go the
hospital by myself?

653
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,470
I'm a scheduler, not your guardian.

654
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,240
There's a case this morning where
the scheduler is needed.

655
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,710
Take a taxi.

656
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,790
Was I too harsh yesterday?

657
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,950
Kang, you don't know Song Yi Kyung's
cell phone number right?

658
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,210
She didn't call?

659
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,960
She doesn't seem to be the type to not
come to work without a reason.

660
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:04,270
Could something have happened?

661
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,700
What did you eat yesterday?

662
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,750
During the day I ate two big plates
of beef bones and a bowl of rice.

663
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:18,490
Plus another half bowl of rice.

664
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,650
Also pastries. At night I ate pasta.

665
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,080
At midnight I ate a big bowl of cup noodles.

666
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,952
You didn't throw up?

667
00:50:26,953 --> 00:50:27,830
What?

668
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,880
Did I throw up?

669
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:39,340
About the remaining balance
of the borrowed money and the land,

670
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:42,730
We have to give out 20% in shares.

671
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,440
This is to remove Haemido from
the management authorities.

672
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,940
Because they know about it, the fund's
situation on our side is urgent.

673
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,290
But it is better than getting a loan.

674
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,340
What should we do?

675
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,040
Father.

676
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,860
Wait a moment.

677
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:23,960
Dad should be in the hospital room right?

678
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,090
The shop!

679
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,670
You're a freelance worker. I don't care
whether or not you come to work.

680
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:35,400
I don't care when you leave or when
you return.  It doesn't matter.

681
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,660
He's probably angry.

682
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,920
I have an appointment at three too.

683
00:51:54,503 --> 00:51:57,040
I have to eat medicine first.

684
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,410
<i>Get in the car.</i>

685
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,390
You look like you're in pain.
Get in the car.

686
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,250
I'll give you a ride.

687
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,980
No thanks.

688
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,130
I asked you because I'm heading
that way anyway.

689
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:49,460
I'm going to see Kang.
Aren't you going there?

690
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:50,760
I said no thanks.

691
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,570
Why don't you want a ride?

692
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,570
- Because I don't like it.
- Don't like it?

693
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:58,010
Why don't you like it?

694
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,420
Because I got angry at you several times?

695
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,030
Misunderstood you?

696
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,220
Or did you get scolded by Kang?

697
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:08,050
No, I don't like you.

698
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:11,690
This isn't a workplace, we can
say anything right?

699
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,650
I don't like you.

700
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,650
Why don't you like me?

701
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:18,610
Can't I dislike someone for no reason?

702
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:21,230
<i>Loving someone without a reason,</i>

703
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:23,620
Disliking someone without a reason,

704
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:25,990
You didn't know that right?

705
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,990
<i>Having a reason to love someone,</i>

706
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:31,760
Having a reason to dislike someone,

707
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,760
Are you a person like that?

708
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,270
If you're unhappy, then the feeling
is mutual. Get in the car.

709
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:41,908
Didn't you hear what I said?
I don't like you.

710
00:54:41,909 --> 00:54:45,830
Even if it's not Song Yi Kyung, if I saw a
sick person, I wouldn't leave them alone.

711
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:48,730
Just because you said you don't like me,
I wouldn't get angry and leave without you.

712
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,870
You're not an important woman to me,
don't think of it in the wrong way.

713
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,920
That's my fianc�e.

714
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,300
fianc�e?

715
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,080
Didn't you know about my engagement
a long time ago?

716
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:22,690
The fianc�e... really looks stupid.

717
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:25,000
What?

718
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:30,140
I mean when you love someone,
you're trusting and gullible.

719
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:35,430
You always say things that
make others unhappy.

720
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:39,950
She's a naive and kind woman.
She's also very open and sincere.

721
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,240
Naive and kind?

722
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,950
So that's why you deceived me.

723
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,580
Because it was easy.

724
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,311
[Director Jung]

725
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:58,230
Yes Director Jung.

726
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,030
I received the account documents.

727
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,790
Let's discuss the details at the company.

728
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,500
Thank you.

729
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,410
You're not even going to say
a word of thanks?

730
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,210
Thank you. Why do I have to say it?

731
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,800
I was forcefully dragged into the car.

732
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:54,060
Forcefully dragged into the car?

733
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,230
What happened? Why did Song Yi Kyung
get out from hyung's car?

734
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,230
Why are you acting like something
major happened?

735
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:19,710
Song Yi Kyung can't ride in my car?

736
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:22,180
Where did you meet?
Why do you have to meet with that woman?

737
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,030
Why do you have to ask me that?

738
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,690
Hyung, you're Ji Hyun's fianc�.

739
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,910
Ji Hyun's just lying there, in pain.

740
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:29,770
Hyung, what are you doing right now?

741
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:32,970
Then what about you?
Are you Ji Hyun's oppa?

742
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,420
Aren't you're acting like because of Song Yi Kyung?

743
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,930
- What are you saying?
- Then why?

744
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,180
Don't you dislike Ji Hyun?
Don't you hate her?

745
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,070
Even so, don't you love her?

746
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:45,870
Don't use Ji Hyun as an excuse.

747
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:48,760
You were the one who got annoyed
and quit on Ji Hyun's family's design.

748
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:50,760
- That...
- It's because of that woman right?

749
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,190
I was talking about hyung's issue,

750
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,380
Why does hyung always ask about my feelings?

751
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:01,310
Has hyung really given up on Ji Hyun?

752
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,120
You always put two unrelated
things together!

753
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,770
How could I be with that woman?

754
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,490
It's not that woman! It's not!

755
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,490
I have no feelings for her, okay?

756
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,470
Ki Jun.

757
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:26,704
<i>Yes sir.</i>

758
00:58:26,705 --> 00:58:27,912
Tell Song Yi Kyung to come downstairs.

759
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,800
<i>Yes sir.</i>

760
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,590
I was late without any notification.

761
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,910
I keep on doing things I'm apologetic for.
I'm very sorry.

762
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:46,680
Let's not always repeat this conversation.

763
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,310
Let's end it here.
You're fired.

764
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:54,980
I let you be a freelance worker,
But you use that time go see Min Ho hyung?

765
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:57,090
I said before that he's my friend's fianc�.

766
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,070
That... It's not like that. We ran
into each other by accident.

767
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,790
It doesn't matter if that's the truth. I can't let
you remain at Min Ho hyung's side.

768
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,450
Min Ho hyung is my friend's fianc�.

769
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:08,450
I have the obligation to
protect that friend.

770
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:10,740
Friend?

771
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:12,860
Are you doing this because of me?

772
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,290
I can't take care of you anymore.

773
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,010
I won't do it anymore.

774
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,620
I really don't care about Kang Min Ho.
Seriously.

775
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:25,670
You can decide to take it or not.

776
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,060
Don't ever appear here again.

777
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:57,620
I... won't accept this money, you know that.

778
00:59:57,690 --> 00:59:59,620
You dare to threaten me?

779
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:04,460
I'm saying, even though I won't
accept this money;

780
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,460
Please don't take it to heart.

781
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:11,640
You definitely, definitely must
not take it to heart.

782
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:14,520
I'm really okay.

783
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,620
Is that enough?

784
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,940
Having a heart to be considerate
of a friend,

785
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:27,190
Is already enough.

786
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:54,290
<i>Tell Song Yi Kyung to come.</i>

787
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,760
Song Yi Kyung got fired. Got fired!

788
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,190
<i>Got fired?</i>

789
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:04,520
<i>Fired.</i>

790
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:12,280
For this period of time, thank you.

791
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,240
Goodbye.

792
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,310
I heard you got fired.

793
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,860
I think it's because of me.

794
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,690
Are you going to say it's not?

795
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,640
That's enough.

796
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:35,550
So what do you plan to do?
You're going to find a new job?

797
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:38,550
You don't need to worry about it.

798
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:40,610
How about at my house?

799
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,630
Don't you urgently need money?

800
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:48,690
Come work at my house. I'll give you money.

801
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:57,710
You know how to clean right?
Can you cook?

802
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:02,290
How much is the pay every day?

803
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,500
Can you pay in advance?

804
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:10,320
Are you agreeing to work at my house?

805
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,320
Didn't you ask me?

806
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:15,750
I'll do it.

Song Yi Kyung unni.
Why is unni living in this manner?

815
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:37,260
Unni, how could you not sleep now because
you sleep during the night?

816
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,680
Is that side in the middle of
planning preparations?

817
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:42,500
Why are you always like this?
Let oppa decide what to do.

818
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:46,040
Please do something about this unni.

819
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:48,040
I've already been locked in
here for four days.

820
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:50,720
Hey Shin Ji Hyun, you're just
a person borrowing her place.

821
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:53,320
There's only 34 days left now.

822
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:54,920
Yes sunbae. In this situation...

823
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:57,710
Can I use plan number 3?
