<i>Shin Ji Hyun,
you shouldn't have died today.</i>

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,090
<i>When you die before it's your time,
as a result of someone else's mistake,</i>

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,950
<i>within 49 days, you must
find three people who love you.</i>

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,080
<i>Then you can live again.</i>

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,630
<i>But how can it be proved?</i>

8
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,150
<i>The tears of the person who
loves you and cries over you is the proof.</i>

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,300
Three drops of a hundred percent genuine tears.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,400
<i>Shin Ji Hyun, you can use
Song Yi Kyung's body when she's sleeping.</i>

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,030
I am Shin Ji Hyun.

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,850
<i>I wish Ji Hyun was just dreaming.</i>

13
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,580
<i>But why isn't he crying?</i>

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,020
<i>Who would have thought
Ji Hyun would end up like that?</i>

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,210
<i>Around us, nothing happens
by coincidence, everything's connected.</i>

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,260
Episode 3

17
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,770
Eat something first.

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,240
You have the stomach to eat right now?

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,520
Ji Hyun is in that condition.

20
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,200
You haven't ate these past few days.

21
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,440
We shouldn't do this.

22
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,410
We shouldn't do this.

23
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,510
No.

24
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,800
You didn't sleep much, right?

25
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,320
Before the room service waiter comes,
let's rest for awhile.

26
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,980
Oppa, what should we do?

27
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,740
<i>That's right. That's what
caused the accident to occur.</i>

28
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,220
What's the matter, guest?

29
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,000
Are you hurt anywhere?

30
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,270
Are you okay?

31
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,650
Are you staying in this room?

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,420
No.

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,990
Then why are you here?

34
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,520
What are you doing here?

35
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,050
<i>Why are you standing
in front of someone else's door?</i>

36
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,460
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

37
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,160
When you came, did you
see anyone you know?

38
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,680
I didn't.

39
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,180
What's the matter?

40
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,920
I'm the room service waiter.

41
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,280
No, I thought I heard noise outside.

42
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,980
Well...

43
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,470
There was a woman sprawled here.

44
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:36,160
A woman sprawled? Here?

45
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,720
It's not a big deal, sir.

46
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,230
She wasn't in her right mind.

47
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,760
She ran away.

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,230
Wait here.

49
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,690
- You've worked hard.
- Thank you.

50
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,480
Oppa, how could you tell me this?

51
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,700
Now you're telling me this?

52
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,600
You made me look for Ji Hyun's seal,
how could you do this?

53
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,670
Luckily, President Shin doesn't have the spare time
to consider the problem of Ji Hyun's land.

54
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,770
We must find it before then.

55
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,140
Do you think that's something
I have the ability to do right now?

56
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,010
Ji Hyun's like that,
she's already in that state!

57
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,070
This is something that should be done.

58
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:29,850
Oppa, I feel like my heart
is tearing into a thousand pieces!

59
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,990
It won't tear.

60
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,670
In Jung.

61
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,310
We're not the ones
who turned Ji Hyun into that.

62
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,040
It's possible that it's because of us.

63
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,720
I'll get off work immediately
when I'm outside.

64
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,170
Secretary Shin, you should get off work too.

65
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,150
Yes, President.

66
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,770
You've worked hard.

67
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,670
Why is the color of your face off?
Does it hurt somewhere?

68
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,200
You're really tired, right?

69
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,810
What about you, Oppa?
You're not nervous?

70
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,940
Are you afraid?

71
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,180
I'm scared.
I'm afraid.

72
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,480
You regret it?

73
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:12,730
Can't we just call it quits now?

74
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,480
Let's stop.

75
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,720
I feel very apologetic to you.

76
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,720
I don't want to take it to this extent.
I really don't want to.

77
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,540
I'm still preparing for the wedding with Ji Hyun...

78
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,940
Let's run away immediately.

79
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,550
Of course you're in fear
and you're afraid. It's normal.

80
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,560
But don't have regret.

81
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,980
This isn't something you can regret.

82
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,730
Shameful things are regretful.

83
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,790
Answer it.

84
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,820
Hey, Ji Hyun.

85
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,150
<i>Are you busy?</i>

86
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,220
Why? Is everything finished?

87
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,950
<i>I'm asking you if you're busy or not.</i>

88
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,710
You're already finished. Are you
coming to the company?

89
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,000
Or is there anything else I can help with?

90
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,970
Oh, okay.

91
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,400
I think Ji Hyun is bored by herself.

92
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,120
Oppa.

93
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,770
Just bear it for a couple of days.

94
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,990
<i>The place of Ji Hyun's car
accident was close to us.</i>

95
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,490
Maybe she followed us.

96
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,370
She was bored by herself so she called you.

97
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,840
She was going to find you at work, but she
changed her mind and was on her way to find me.

98
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,530
I told Ji Hyun that we'll go together.

99
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,810
Didn't I specify the meeting time and place?

100
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,440
I know how tired you are.

101
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,480
I understand completely.

102
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,970
You knew but you still did this?

103
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:55,820
But In Jung, if we end it here,
what kind of guy does that make me?

104
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:04,310
I can't just stop
because of what happened to Ji Hyun.

105
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,700
I don't care if you do it or not, but I will.

106
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,530
I won't do it. I can't do it.

107
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,360
Think about the beginning of this.

108
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,790
Why did we become like this?

109
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,030
If we run away now, will we be happy?

110
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,490
If we stop, will that bring Ji Hyun back?

111
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,820
You really freak out and misuse that button.

112
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,490
You know, right?

113
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,790
How could I... Why did that accident
happen to me? You know, right?

114
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,700
Why didn't you tell me?

115
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,590
I got into that accident
because of Min Ho oppa and In Jung.

116
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:41,080
That... that's because I was afraid
of revealing the heaven's secret.

117
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,000
- Revealing the secret?
- Yes. Revealing. The. Heaven's. Secret.

118
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,760
You probably don't understand what
revealing the heaven's secret means, right?

119
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,280
You don't know?

120
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,370
Revealing the heaven's secret,
it's heaven meaning sky, secret meaning...

121
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:09,030
What? What's the matter?

122
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,730
Why are you...?

123
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:18,150
Women creatures have tears
like a never-ending stream.

124
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,800
So you knew but didn't tell me?

125
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,350
I also have to follow the rules for five years
before I get the chance to live again.

126
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,440
Those two had something all along!

127
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,230
Okay, okay.

128
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,980
In regards to the origin your accident,
your romance, your love triangle,

129
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,300
I have no interest in these types of things.

130
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,480
When did it all start?
I couldn't tell at all.

131
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,030
How could they be in a relationship?

132
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,930
Then why was he going to marry me?

133
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,620
Why are you asking me?

134
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,060
If you knocked on the door,
the two people involved could've told you.

135
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,260
Didn't you say that I can't
reveal that I'm Shin Ji Hyun?

136
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:01,180
That's right, you did a good job.

137
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,780
The rest is your problem.
Settle them yourself.

138
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,580
What can be done about her stupidity?

139
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,450
What am I going to do now?

140
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,510
Is now the time to cry over your own death?

141
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,580
Be worried about the present.

142
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,510
49 days.

143
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,180
No.

144
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,450
You should think about how
you're going to pass the next 46 days.

145
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,770
49 days, it's not a very long time.

146
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,690
<i>Our special couple home is going to be built here.</i>

147
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,520
<i>Please help us.</i>

148
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,060
Song Yi Kyung has not arrived yet?

149
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,250
Can she come?

150
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,330
Why don't you try calling her?

151
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,070
Would a liar put her
phone number on her resume?

152
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,680
Seriously Hyung, you think Yi Kyung was lying?

153
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,480
Hand over the 10,000 won.

154
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,720
We made a bet.

155
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,690
A bet?

156
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,480
Is your brain swelling acting up again?
You dare to make a bet on people?

157
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,310
Miss Ma Sung Jung, do you
think this restaurant is a joke?

158
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,730
You guys, what are you doing?

159
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,820
Shut up! Punks.
Get out, get out.

160
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,940
Oh! Sister-in-law!

161
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,270
Chun!

162
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,310
Honey!

163
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,010
It's so cold outside,
I told you to not come out.

164
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,910
I told you clearly not to
come here when it's cold.

165
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:10,720
Didn't I tell you that?

166
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,250
I originally didn't want to come.

167
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,390
So?

168
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,210
I was by myself in the warm and cozy house
and I was doing what you told me.

169
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,060
Doing what I told you.

170
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,780
Then suddenly, I heard that sound.

171
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,340
That sound? What sound?

172
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,520
The sound of a loudspeaker.

173
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,530
Sound of a loudspeaker?

174
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,190
What loudspeaker's sound?

175
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,060
I can't take it anymore!

176
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,070
Sister-in-law, exactly what
loudspeaker sound is it?

177
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,040
The fish is here, and the seaweed too.

178
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,660
Seaweed came, too.

179
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,410
They were scurrying to get here,
and I ran into them on my way.

180
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,470
That's what happened.

181
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,480
Is it our story?

182
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:51,910
So what?

183
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,780
What is so this and so that?

184
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,770
- Because you missed your husband...
- You still won't shut up?

185
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,760
So what?

186
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,230
So I prepared some fish slices for you.

187
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,000
What's wrong with the atmosphere here?

188
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,700
Atmosphere? Why? What?

189
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,930
Is it because of that young lady outside?

190
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,240
What are you doing here?

191
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,460
<i>Kang.</i>

192
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,220
Ki Joon, bring over the bag.

193
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,940
I brought my employment certification.

194
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,890
You brought it?

195
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,910
I clearly said that you
must bring it within an hour.

196
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,030
I even gave you money for a taxi.

197
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,210
The time right now is 2:27.

198
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,430
Take your bag and leave.

199
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,030
I met a friend at the hotel.

200
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,970
Are you making up excuses?

201
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,520
I also met my fiance.

202
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,180
I'm just saying...

203
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,990
That...

204
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,120
The two of them were together.

205
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,010
I saw the two of them together.

206
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,290
This...

207
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,540
Okay, okay.

208
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,550
Forget it, get off work for today.

209
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,480
Come back tomorrow.

210
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,120
- What happened?
- What's wrong?

211
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,880
- Song Yi Kyung!
- Song Yi Kyung, wake up!

212
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,360
- Miss.
- Hey.

213
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,750
Hey. What to do?

214
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,220
Ahjussi, what should we do?
What should we do?

215
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,590
Lay her down inside.

216
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,170
Come on.

217
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,530
- Don't be like this.
- Why?

218
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,250
She isn't a person you love,
she's not someone who you can carry.

219
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,700
The young man should carry her.

220
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,690
Fiance?

221
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,280
Even though you have a fiance,
you still treat Min Ho hyung like that?

222
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,970
Even though you have a fiance,
you still act like an assistant.

223
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,760
Did you really see
your fiance and your friend?

224
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,810
Look, Song Yi Kyung.

225
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,740
She definitely worked at Seoul Hotel before.

226
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,350
This Song Yi Kyung,
who says it's that Song Yi Kyung?

227
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,810
We haven't confirmed her identity yet.

228
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,220
Why do you have such
a hard time trusting people?

229
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,630
You're dismissed.

230
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,120
Sister-in-law.

231
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,970
What soup do we have today?

232
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,210
I thought you weren't having any.

233
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,520
It's what our Hae Won likes.

234
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,980
It improves digestion and absorption.

235
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,590
It's a daikon soup with added amylase*.
(*enzyme that breaks down starches)

236
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,110
Why?

237
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,100
Deliver a bowl to the room.

238
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,030
Deliver to who?

239
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,500
Deliver the meal as well.

240
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,650
Oh, bring extra rice.
Pile it really high.

241
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,730
Was it Han Kang who covered me?

242
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,740
He didn't use cold water to wake me up.

243
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,900
That's good.

244
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,940
He didn't fire me.

245
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,570
I was lying in the hospital
from the car accident,

246
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,040
and they actually had a
secret meeting in a hotel room.

247
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:02,370
Then have the two of them met
behind my back in a hotel room all along?

248
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,760
Miss!

249
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,750
You didn't lose anything, right?

250
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,570
Go take a look upstairs.

251
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,250
Didn't she leave without telling us?

252
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,680
She left this behind.

253
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,880
Is she hiding any money in here?

254
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,830
She's probably hiding 100,000 won.

255
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,350
Go back.

256
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,260
I told you to stop.

257
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,390
Look at this.

258
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:07,860
<i>I can feel it, feel it inside of me.</i>

259
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,960
<i>It keeps taking space in my heart.</i>

260
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:19,780
<i>Even your breathing,
I feel like it is talking to me.</i>

261
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:25,300
<i>Love is coming,
love has stolen my heart.</i>

262
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,810
<i>Even if I lose everything,
I am fine.</i>

263
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:37,150
<i>So I can love, because I can love,
I am happy.</i>

264
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,440
<i>If we stop, will that bring Ji Hyun back?</i>

265
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,630
<i>Think about the origins of this matter.</i>

266
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,000
<i>Think about why we have to do this.</i>

267
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:07,710
<i>No matter what you think, I will do it.</i>

268
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,750
<i>I will.</i>

269
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,940
<i>Today it's my treat.
How about chicken and beer?</i>

270
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,330
I'm trying to lose weight.

271
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,050
Lose what weight?

272
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,440
Everybody's getting off work.
Why isn't In Jung coming down?

273
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:20,010
Hey! How could you be with Min Ho oppa?

274
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,710
Did you start liking Min Ho oppa first?

275
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,530
Impossible.

276
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,940
Or did Min Ho oppa seduce you?

277
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,430
That's also impossible.

278
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:38,450
How exactly did your relationship develop?

279
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,510
Why did you walk to my house?
What are you going to do here?

280
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,020
In Jung, you're not...

281
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,510
You and oppa just had something
to discuss. It's not anything else, right?

282
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,230
So that's why you met at the hotel?

283
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,740
Who is it?

284
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,280
Ahjumma, it's In Jung.

285
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:16,770
Yeah, it's okay to have a meeting
at the hotel to discuss something.

286
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,770
Bitch, then what was that?
What was that?

287
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,950
Shin In Jung, you're not even
letting me enter my own home?

288
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,190
I knew it'd turn out like this.

289
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,120
<i>Has mother been well?</i>

290
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,730
She just took sleep medication and
is having a lie down.

291
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,100
Okay.

292
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,180
But why did you come here?

293
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,830
I thought of coming
to see her when I got off work.

294
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:28,440
Don't mind me, carry on
with what you're doing.

295
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,190
What are you doing?

296
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,190
Mother.

297
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,970
I thought you were sleeping.

298
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:20,540
I was going to sleep
but I heard the door bell.

299
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:25,440
I asked you what you're doing.

300
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,880
It's nothing. I just thought
of Ji Hyun and wanted to drop by.

301
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,260
If you want to see her,
why don't you go to the hospital?

302
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,800
Why did you come here?

303
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,690
Isn't Ji Hyun at the hospital?

304
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:42,050
- Her condition isn't very good.
- So?

305
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,270
Has my Ji Hyun died?

306
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,110
She didn't die.

307
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:52,160
Why do you come and go as
you please without Ji Hyun's permission?

308
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,650
Come out.

309
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:05,740
I don't want you guys
to see my daughter as dead.

310
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,660
I know.

311
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,670
How long?

312
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,660
A month? A year? 10 years?

313
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,960
Just say how long.

314
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:23,260
How can you not even determine
that when you're a doctor?

315
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,500
I'm sorry.

316
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:32,770
Then do we have to keep waiting?

317
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,050
What do you plan to do?

318
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,720
Why did you come again?

319
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,370
Dad, if you're going somewhere,
inform me ahead of time.

320
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,070
How could you leave Ji Hyun here by herself?

321
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,000
I went to see Doctor Cho.

322
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,390
Doctor Cho?

323
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,980
- Why? Is Ji Hyun...?
- No.

324
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,260
Oh yeah, has Ji Hyun's
land been decided yet?

325
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,860
Yes.

326
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:15,370
Then I'll leave the remaining
matters for you to handle.

327
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,990
Dad, you should handle them.

328
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:21,210
You can help me.

329
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:25,220
I have to keep watch on her.

330
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,730
I know that you're very sad.

331
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,920
But it can't be worse than what we feel.

332
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,460
I didn't find it, oppa.

333
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,430
Mother won't let me enter Ji Hyun's room.

334
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,220
What's she talking about?

335
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,990
She just doesn't like my presence.
Ji Hyun still hasn't...

336
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,630
Taxi.

337
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,700
Oppa?

338
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,960
In Jung's oppa isn't in Seoul.

339
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,450
I got it. Let's do that.

340
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,220
Shin Young, it's me.

341
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,690
Min Ho, what were you doing
when I was telling you?

342
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,850
Listen to me today.

343
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:52,330
Mother's in weak health.
You should go see her.

344
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:56,240
You go back and sleep.
Leave this to me.

345
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,800
Oh really? Ji Hyun might
want to be alone with you.

346
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,110
Good thing I didn't go to the hospital.

347
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,230
Otherwise, I would've missed him.

348
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,550
You still don't understand?

349
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,750
Oppa, everyday you send
over ten text messages to me.

350
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,610
You'd also come see me
whenever you're free.

351
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,900
You told me your
mailbox ID and MSN password.

352
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,930
Right? Isn't it like that?

353
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:07,000
No matter how stupid I am,
I knew that you loved me.

354
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,230
0505.

355
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,890
Oppa, that's my birthday.

356
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,990
You told me the pass code and said
I could come whenever I wanted.

357
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,850
Was it In Jung who fell
for you, so you wavered?

358
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,320
What exactly is the matter?
Explain in detail.

359
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,650
Oppa.

360
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,660
You can see me?

361
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,200
There's not much to explain.

362
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,480
I already told you everything.

363
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,480
Your relationship is on this level?

364
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,370
You didn't find anything odd?

365
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:00,040
She didn't seem to suspect me.

366
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,990
She just can't get over Ji Hyun.

367
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,300
You're positive?

368
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,250
You think I don't understand Ji Hyun's mother?

369
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,220
That's good.

370
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,460
Then why didn't you
come up with a random excuse?

371
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,950
Say that you left
something behind in her room.

372
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,170
Or say that you lent her something.

373
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,950
When I saw her mother like that,

374
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,830
my mind went blank and
I couldn't think of anything.

375
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,370
What are you guys talking about?

376
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:30,440
You're sure that Ji Hyun's seal
is in the drawer of her vanity?

377
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,470
Her seal and things such
as her bank card...

378
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,960
She'd always put them
in the left vanity drawer.

379
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:40,680
My seal?

380
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,690
Here's the copy of my registry
and the certificate of my seal.

381
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,790
There's also my seal.
I didn't leave out anything right?

382
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,670
You're careless, but don't worry this time.

383
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,640
I gave him my seal that time.

384
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,760
Why is he still looking for it?

385
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,910
I should've checked it then.

386
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,320
Please don't ask me to work
at least three days before my wedding.

387
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,670
Don't worry.

388
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:05,200
How could we postpone group leader
Kang's wedding because of work?

389
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,670
This...

390
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,220
What is this?

391
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,480
Why isn't there a seal, but this instead?

392
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,870
That careless girl.

393
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,180
Please wait a moment.

394
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,490
<i>Hello?</i>

395
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,450
Hello, isn't this Miss Shin
Ji Hyun's cell phone?

396
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,670
What? Accident?

397
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,840
No matter how careless,

398
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,190
I never thought that she'd hand it over
before even checking to make sure it's her seal.

399
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,850
So that's why oppa
rushed to the emergency room?

400
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:46,220
Oppa, you can't go to
Ji Hyun's mother's place right now.

401
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,970
I even talked it over with President Shin.
Everything was signed smoothly.

402
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,830
Really?

403
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,180
Then what should we do?

404
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,960
Before it gets discovered,
we have to find the seal.

405
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,330
If Ji Hyun still has land,
our plan will fail.

406
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,940
I put in so much effort in trying
to get my hands on that land.

407
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,430
What are you going to do?

408
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,260
Don't worry, we'll figure something out.

409
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,650
Go home and get some rest.

410
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,230
I still have to drop by the hospital.

411
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,230
Don't be discovered by anyone
when you're leaving. Be careful.

412
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:30,380
What are the two of them doing?

413
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:35,200
What exactly are they doing to my dad?

414
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,880
What are you doing?

415
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,210
I'm preparing some extra clothes
for going to the hospital.

416
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,680
Didn't you say you didn't sleep well
even after taking the sleep medication?

417
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,930
Don't think about going to the hospital.

418
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:57,620
Can't I just sleep there?

419
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,670
Ahjumma! Pack my toothbrush and toothpaste.

420
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:08,730
Also pack shampoo and conditioner.

421
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,420
I'm begging you, stop.

422
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:20,840
Do you not know why I'm doing this?

423
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,540
Husband, I'm okay.

424
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,260
Not okay.

425
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,210
You're not okay.

426
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,380
Ji Hyun's not okay either.

427
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,990
I know that Ji Hyun's not ready to see you yet.

428
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:47,970
Is she still like that now?

429
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,220
I still can't recognize her, right?

430
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,770
I haven't seen her in a long time.

431
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,450
Don't always wear me down.

432
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,400
Quickly get my extra clothes ready.

433
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,450
Then get some water from the bathroom.

434
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:14,050
Sor... Sorry.

435
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:21,010
Husband, I want to die.

436
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,490
I want to die before Ji Hyun does.

437
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,800
Then what am I supposed to do?

438
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,330
I said I love you.

439
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:59,980
I'm saying I love you sincerely.
Why are you laughing?

440
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:10,270
<i>Within 49 days, find three people
who can cry sincere tears for you.</i>

441
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,350
<i>Then you can go back.</i>

442
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,290
<i>If there's a person who cries
a hundred percent genuine tears,</i>

443
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,180
<i>collect them in here.</i>

444
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,750
Dad.

445
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,170
Mom.

446
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,830
What should I do?

447
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:51,920
<i>But thinking of my life without you,
tears form.</i>

448
00:37:51,960 --> 00:38:07,120
<i>You didn't say anything, you were the one that left.
I wish it wasn't true.</i>

449
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:14,780
<i>It is okay for you to come back.
It is okay for you to come back.</i>

450
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:22,440
<i>Just for a moment, we were separated,
that is what I will believe.</i>

451
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:29,690
<i>Nothing has happened,
Nothing has happened.</i>

452
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:37,600
<i>When I wake up tonight...</i>

453
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:45,260
<i>It is okay for you to come back.
Nothing has happened.</i>

454
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:57,220
<i>When I wake up tonight,
I will be with you again.</i>

455
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,420
How much do I have to give you?

456
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:03,120
Oh, you remember me now?

457
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,210
Please give the receipts.

458
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,730
What about the health insurance money?

459
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:10,940
I still haven't received the hospital bill yet.

460
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:14,200
How much did the taxi cost?

461
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:18,270
Because it was a private taxi,
the cost was pretty high.

462
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:25,670
You're not curious of who I am?

463
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,470
Nope.

464
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,830
You're also not curious as to why
I showed up at the scene of your car accident?

465
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,600
It doesn't matter.

466
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,690
What if I told you
the reason why you went there?

467
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,400
If you're curious, then ask.

468
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,940
Please take care.

469
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,160
See you tomorrow.

470
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:32,230
<i>There's still 45 days,
3 hours and 29 minutes left.</i>

471
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:52,270
<i>My insides are scarred,
my insides are burnt.</i>

472
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:59,660
<i>I tell myself I won't be able to love.</i>

473
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:07,510
<i>Let's forget now, please forget now.
Even though I decided to,</i>

474
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:14,460
<i>The picture of you in my heart
faces me.</i>

475
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:22,310
<i>Nothing will happen to you,
even if you forget me.</i>

476
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:26,730
Has Unni been faced
with this kind of problem before?

477
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,950
And that's why you're living this way?

478
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:38,270
<i>I cry for awhile, then laugh, then fall asleep.
I pick up the phone, then put it down.</i>

479
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:45,650
<i>Like I am stupid, so stupid.
I have been like this for days.</i>

480
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:53,040
<i>I am going to go crazy because I miss you.
I am going to go crazy because I want to forget you.</i>

481
00:41:53,060 --> 00:42:02,210
<i>Like I am stupid, so stupid.
I cannot forget you or tell you to come back to me.</i>

482
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:07,130
<i>There's still 44 days,
3 hours and 29 minutes left.</i>

483
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,690
Hey, now you want to destroy this?

484
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,250
You're confident that you can compensate for it?

485
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:31,310
I didn't call for you.

486
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:36,040
When you call for me
isn't the only time I appear.

487
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,530
When I call you, you don't come.

488
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:42,720
I'm irritated, leave.

489
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,670
Why are you being like this?

490
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,390
Don't you know?

491
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:52,810
Ah, you've wasted
your entire life in this world?

492
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,310
Is that what you mean?

493
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,870
I... can't live on.

494
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,470
That's why I came.

495
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,920
I came to call the elevator.

496
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,480
Elevator?

497
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,070
When's the best time
to call it down for you?

498
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,620
Right now it's 10:35.

499
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,470
I'll call it for you at 12:00, okay?

500
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,800
I have to give you some time
to tidy everything up here for the last time.

501
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,710
What do you mean?

502
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,950
You're saying... that...

503
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,370
You're going to call down
the elevator to heaven?

504
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:26,740
Hasn't it been two days since
you last used this woman's body?

505
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,880
Then does that mean you're
not planning on leaving this world?

506
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,910
When did I? When did I ever
say that I was going to leave?

507
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:35,420
The three people who truly love you...

508
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,470
Aren't there any?

509
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:40,520
Hey Scheduler, wait.

510
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,230
Even if there aren't,
you can't be this unreasonable.

511
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,850
There's still 45 days left.

512
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:46,000
It's 44.

513
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,240
There's only 44 days left?

514
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,530
Let's go.

515
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:53,400
Don't look at this miserable sight anymore.

516
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,950
Let's go directly to your next life.

517
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,540
Then it's set for 11:00.

518
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,390
No!

519
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:09,010
I didn't give you 49 days
just for you to waste them away.

520
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,520
I won't do that anymore.

521
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,390
I didn't come to work yesterday
without saying anything.

522
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,510
With my little ability, I'm even late today.

523
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:30,270
Maybe I'm crazy.

524
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:32,570
Then you didn't plan on quitting that day?

525
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:33,650
No, of course not.

526
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,270
I promise it's not like that.

527
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,060
I was a little...

528
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,940
It's a problem in my private life
that I can't tell.

529
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,720
Because it's caused a very difficult
problem, it turned out like that.

530
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,150
What about your meals?

531
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,500
What?

532
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,740
I asked you if you ate.

533
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:53,650
I haven't.

534
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:58,200
I didn't eat anything in two days.

535
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:01,000
Then, what is this?

536
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,320
I didn't eat that.

537
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,930
Isn't that a noodle?

538
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,190
Ahjussi, help prepare some food.

539
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:18,480
<i>Han Kang, thank you.</i>

540
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,200
<i>Thank you very, very much.</i>

541
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,170
Please enjoy your meal.

542
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,820
Ahjussi, she's not too bad.

543
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,020
Yeah, that wasn't bad.

544
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,790
How could this be?

545
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,620
Two days ago, she was clumsy.

546
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,210
Now two days later, she's become an expert.

547
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,420
There's also people like me.

548
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,410
She should be no problem.

549
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,210
That woman's getting more and more confusing.

550
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,680
[Incoming call, Park Seo Woo]

551
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,300
<i>What should I do now?</i>

552
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,040
<i>What should I do?</i>

553
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,930
<i>What do I have to start doing?</i>

554
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,770
<i>Seo Woo.</i>

555
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,260
Oh, Kang's here.

556
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,920
<i>Hey, Ki Joon.</i>

557
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,440
<i>- Take the garbage out.
- Okay.</i>

558
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:18,710
I'll do it.

559
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:38,710
Thank you for that day.

560
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:44,150
You said that you're a new worker here, right?

561
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:46,510
You're called Miss Song Yi Kyung?

562
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,190
You don't remember me?

563
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,240
Am I supposed to remember you?

564
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,330
Seo Woo, you said that
you're going to look after Ji Hyun?

565
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:19,740
In Jung and I. Just at night.

566
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:23,510
I went to the hospital during the day.

567
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,030
Ji Hyun's dad is in a terrible state...

568
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:27,920
<i>What exactly is she saying?</i>

569
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,640
He's busy with company matters,

570
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,840
I can't disappoint Ji Hyun.
It's the least I can do.

571
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,730
The problem right now isn't the company.

572
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,990
If we don't take care,
maybe Ji Hyun's dad will also collapse.

573
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,970
Let me do it.

574
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:51,270
So in order to urge Ji Hyun's dad,
we decided to meet you, Min Ho.

575
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:55,380
I got it. I'll talk to father about it.

576
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,500
There should be no problem
if you leave it to us.

577
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,210
But Ji Hyun's mother has
always been in that condition, right?

578
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:14,220
Yes. She's not doing anything at home.

579
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,970
She's not eating, drinking or sleeping.

580
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,810
Be more careful.

581
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:32,440
I... I'm sorry.

582
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,510
You'll get hurt.

583
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:42,780
She probably got scared.

584
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,780
Take her away.
Let Joon clean it up.

585
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,520
Okay.

586
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:57,280
Who is that? I don't think
I've ever seen that worker before.

587
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,920
Just a part-timer.

588
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,170
Kang, since you're already standing,
let's go to the office.

589
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:07,470
See you two later.

590
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,920
Mom, I'm sorry.

591
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:19,200
Mom.

592
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,800
Mom, I'm sorry.

593
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,010
<i>On behalf of the management of the 49 days,</i>

594
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:37,450
<i>I'm notifying you the time
remaining to return home is ticking.</i>

595
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:51,760
Did I say that I'd work until 12?

596
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,770
Do you really not remember?

597
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:57,260
From 12 noon to 12 midnight,
for four dollars an hour.

598
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:02,260
Will there be a day
when you can work properly?

599
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:04,880
You need permission before you can go.

600
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,460
Okay.

601
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,690
I'm going to get scolded again.

602
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,500
Hyung, you don't have any spare time now.

603
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,470
After Hyunmido expands,
can you continue to manage it?

604
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:22,700
This is something Ji Hyun's
father instructed me to do.

605
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:25,720
Ji Hyun's father?

606
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,220
I'm sorry again.

607
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:37,410
What's the matter?

608
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,390
I have something to say.

609
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,340
Can you step out for awhile?

610
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,090
I think she came not knowing I was here.

611
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,680
Do you want me to leave?

612
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,440
Say it, what is it?

613
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:51,970
I can only work until 11:30.

614
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:53,840
Your shift ends at 12:00.

615
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,730
I made that clear.

616
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:59,650
I was too hungry that day,
I didn't hear you correctly.

617
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:02,410
Because you didn't hear correctly,
you can only work until 11:30?

618
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,450
- Is that what you're saying?
- It's not that!

619
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:08,100
No matter what happens,
I must be home before 12:00.

620
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,910
There's someone waiting for me.

621
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:13,250
She can't move until I get back.

622
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,570
Okay, you can go.

623
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:18,710
I can really go?

624
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:23,210
But letting me go now doesn't mean that
you want me to disappear forever, right?

625
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,870
Get off work at 11:00pm.

626
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,700
Come to work at 11:00am.

627
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,450
Thank you!

628
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,220
Why are you so lenient with that woman?

629
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,270
How am I lenient?
What do you mean?

630
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:47,420
Even though you seem rash, you're
extremely dedicated to your business.

631
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,920
You can't handle your own matters well.

632
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,930
You hate the type of people
who fool around carelessly.

633
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:55,890
With her personality, aren't you
being too tolerant?

634
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,450
I took her in especially to look after her.

635
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:59,110
To look after her?

636
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,920
Look after her what?

637
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:03,510
There's something.

638
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,190
So this is the type of woman you like?

639
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:08,060
What?

640
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,760
I see that you're
completely uninterested in girls.

641
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,310
Exactly what kind of girl
are you looking for?

642
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:15,330
I've always been curious about that.

643
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:16,180
Turns out it's that type.

644
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,420
It's not that!

645
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:22,620
But, Hyung,

646
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,830
regardless of the time,
you never lose your humor.

647
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,200
What?

648
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:32,930
I'm just trying.

649
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:37,500
I think that this is what
Ji Hyun would've wanted.

650
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:38,660
<i>Me?</i>

651
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:44,250
Kang, Ji Hyun would do the same.

652
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,410
She would hope that I'd be like before,

653
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:50,600
and continue to persevere. Ji Hyun...

654
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,970
<i>No!</i>

655
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:53,630
That's right.

656
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,810
It should be like that.

657
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:57,520
Shin Ji Hyun...

658
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,820
<i>I said no!</i>

659
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:01,460
<i>Definitely, definitely not!</i>

660
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:16,990
<i>She would hope that I'd be like before,</i>

661
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:20,520
<i>and continue to persevere. Ji Hyun...</i>

662
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:24,990
Is oppa that kind of person?

663
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:31,300
If Ji Hyun still has land
under her name, our plan will fail.

664
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:34,290
Before it gets discovered,
we have to find the seal.

665
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:36,010
That's right.

666
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,170
My seal...

667
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:42,590
First of all, I just need
to keep your hands off it.

668
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,470
I'm going to be late!

669
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,570
Just let me be able to move things.

670
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,500
When I enter my room and retrieve my seal,

671
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,540
I'll come out immediately!

672
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,190
What kind of nonsense
are you talking now?

673
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:17,160
Only for a day!
No, only an hour!

674
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,250
By just relying on Song Yi Kyung's body,
I can't enter my house.

675
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,850
Seems like you need a voice recorder.

676
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:27,770
Beep! The scheduler stays
out of human matters.

677
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,730
Those people have their eye on my land!

678
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:36,800
No, no, it's much more than land.

679
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,300
I don't know how much they're planning,

680
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,900
but I think they might even have
their eyes on my dad's entire company.

681
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,470
That's not something I should know.

682
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:46,100
Then can you help me retrieve my seal?

683
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:50,880
Repeat. The scheduler stays
out of human matters.

684
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,140
Then what am I going to do?

685
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,940
- What exactly should I do?
- Don't call me into this room next time.

686
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,330
Every time I'm here, my mood is strange.

687
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:03,690
- You don't make any exceptions?
- Nope, I'm leaving.

688
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:11,890
I know that, if you repeat a phrase,
the door might open.

689
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:16,980
Oh yeah, recently everyone
uses pass codes, right?

690
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:25,340
How could he be like that?

691
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:28,710
He didn't help at all and
he always makes people angry.

692
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:35,410
From three to five in the afternoon,

693
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,970
the restaurant isn't very busy.

694
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:39,280
It doesn't need many workers.

695
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,020
So?

696
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,260
Also, if I'm not here, the
working environment would be better, right?

697
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,460
It's because we have you that
this job became more unpleasant. Probably.

698
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,180
What exactly do you want to say?

699
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:54,450
You definitely can't decide to fire me
because of what I'm about to say.

700
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:56,200
Because,

701
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,050
the 52 dollar salary you gave me that day,
after deducting the borrowed money and the taxi fee,

702
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:06,270
there's still 36 dollars left.

703
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,280
That's everything I have.

704
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,730
If you fire me when I'm in such poverty,

705
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,830
before I find another job, I'd have to starve.

706
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:18,370
Even if it's like that,
there's something I must attend to.

707
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:19,800
Are you threatening me?

708
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:21,550
I'll be away for only three hours.

709
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:22,920
Skipping work without a reason, plus being late,

710
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,230
and now you want to go out.

711
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,410
You're getting more and more troublesome.

712
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:27,440
I won't take the three hours' pay.

713
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:28,980
And you're still making assumptions.

714
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,970
Who said they're going to give it to you?

715
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,420
Then does that I mean I can go?

716
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,480
You'll be blessed in the future!

717
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,520
She's similar to a certain person.
She sure can run.

718
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,580
<i>Of course, I have to follow the plan.</i>

719
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:14,220
<i>Even your breathing,
I feel like it is talking to me.</i>

720
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:23,210
<i>Love is coming,
love has stolen my heart.</i>

721
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:31,600
<i>So I can love, because I can love,
I am happy.</i>

722
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:41,190
<i>I can feel it, feel it inside of me.
It keeps taking space in my heart.</i>

723
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:49,140
<i>Even your breathing,
I feel like it is talking to me.</i>

724
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:58,130
<i>Love is coming, Love has stolen my heart,
even if I lose everything I am fine.</i>

725
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:07,190
<i>So I can love, because I can love,
I am happy.</i>

726
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:46,200
I never thought the things here
are actually this great.

727
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,720
If I continue doing this,
it'll be bad if I get caught.

728
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,920
This isn't it. Where did I put it?

729
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,200
This is my money.

730
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,550
Can't I use a little bit?

731
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:45,500
You have to earn the money you need.

732
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:54,110
Who is it?

733
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,790
There shouldn't be anyone coming at this time.

734
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:28,390
How come mother came out?
Where's Ahjumma?

735
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:30,410
She's grocery shopping.

736
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:32,670
Is something wrong?

737
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:34,970
I came when Ahjumma isn't here.

738
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:36,950
Please go inside, Mother.

739
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:42,100
You came to take a
few things that Ji Hyun likes?

740
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:46,210
I want to take the things that
Ji Hyun likes to the hospital room.

741
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:50,280
Things such as presents I
gave her, or pictures of her parents.

742
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:53,180
I want Ji Hyun to see them and cheer up.

743
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:57,770
How did you even think of that?

744
01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:00,840
I'll pick a few and take them over.
Is that okay?

745
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,630
Of course.

746
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:07,990
You know best about
the things our Ji Hyun likes.

747
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,210
Why isn't it here?

<i>I reached to where I stand today, but have you
already forgotten all the things you've done with me?</i>

756
01:04:04,785 --> 01:04:06,290
Stop talking! Stop talking! Stop talking!

757
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:09,670
<i>I don't care what means we use,
we must retrieve my seal from the hospital room.</i>

758
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:11,270
<i>This time you have to conceal yourself.</i>

759
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:14,590
Remember, if the necklace shatters,
the 49 days are over.

760
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:16,210
I advise you to just leave it.

761
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:17,010
What?

762
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,440
I'm telling you to stop being in the way.

763
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:21,200
<i>Are you treating me like this
because you've developed feelings for me?</i>

764
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:22,300
<i>What do you take me for?</i>

765
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,320
<i>Do you think I'm a benevolent person or a fool?</i>

766
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,960
What's this? Are you firing me?
