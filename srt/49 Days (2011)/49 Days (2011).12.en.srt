00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,010
What's wrong with you?

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,280
I feel a little dizzy.

5
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,019
Yi Kyung.

6
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,460
<i>- I'm going crazy because of you.
- What did I do?</i>

7
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:43,910
Yi Kyung.

8
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,920
Yi Kyung.

9
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,210
Yi Kyung.

10
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,250
Are you okay?

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,300
Who are you?

12
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,490
Yi Kyung, what's wrong with you?

13
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,140
Are you unwell?

14
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,070
What do I do?

15
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,760
What do I do? What do I do?

16
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,050
<i>- Yi Kyung, it's me, Kang Min Ho.
- Oppa!</i>

17
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,940
Wait a second.

18
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,159
Oppa, what's going on here?

19
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,190
In Jung.

20
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,880
Why are you with that woman?

21
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,900
Did you and that woman come together?

22
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,950
Let's go over there and talk.

23
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,160
Please calm down, Yi Kyung.
Do you recognize me?

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,520
You troublemaker!

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,940
It doesn't matter. It's nothing.

26
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,430
Let me explain.

27
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,290
You are...?

28
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,610
I'm going crazy, Yi Soo.

29
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,820
Why?

30
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,060
Because this place is too beautiful.

31
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,550
I'm going crazy too.

32
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,600
Because I'm so pretty?

33
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,130
You're as scary as a ghost.

34
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,530
When we build a pension,
I want to plant some cherry blossoms.

35
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,460
Alright.

36
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,770
What is going on here?

37
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,620
I should be asking you what's going on.

38
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,889
Aren't you supposed to be
on a business trip?

39
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,569
But, did you come here with Song Yi Kyung
on vacation instead?

40
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,589
Where did she go?

41
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,880
Oppa!

42
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,170
In Jung, wait here for a second.

43
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,299
What are you doing right now?

44
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,989
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry,

45
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,450
but the person I came here with
fainted over there.

46
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,270
I'm going to make sure she's okay.

47
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,069
I just knew it would be like this.
I knew it would end up like this.

48
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,929
I knew there would be trouble!

49
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,650
Yell at me later.

50
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,020
What should I do?

51
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,959
What should I do?

52
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,949
What do you mean what should you do?

53
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,049
She woke up,
so there's nothing we can do about it.

54
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,920
Then what do I do?

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,680
If I'm not back at Unni's place by midnight,

56
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,160
won't I lose a day?

57
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,029
Will I just die like this?

58
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,419
You can't die.

59
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,890
It wasn't your fault,
since Song Yi Kyung woke up on her own.

60
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,200
Why did she wake up at this place?

61
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,640
Is there something about this place?

62
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,390
That's a relief.

63
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,480
Then what do I do now?

64
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,009
What do I do if she finds out I came here
with Kang Min Ho?

65
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,999
Those two aren't the problem,
it's that girl.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,729
She was sleeping at home,
but woke up to find herself here.

67
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,550
Is she just going to let that slide?

68
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,120
Have you ever heard about
how a Taoist priest casts out demons?

69
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,730
In this situation, when the host body
wakes up unexpectedly outside the home,

70
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,900
we can transform the host's memory
into a dream.

71
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,640
That would erase one day from Song Yi Kyung.

72
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,419
In doing that, you will also lose
one of your 49 days.

73
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,030
Last time, one day was deducted
because of Dad's will.

74
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,450
Now I lose another day?

75
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,389
Didn't you say it's not my fault?

76
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,050
Even though we don't know what it was,

77
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,160
you triggered something important
in that woman's memory.

78
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,360
Or, you can abandon Song Yi Kyung
and just enjoy the flowers here.

79
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,100
Where did Unni go?

80
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,109
Over there... with Han Kang.

81
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,309
That's not important right now.

82
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,110
Hurry and catch up with them.

83
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,089
<i>Come and have your fortunes told!</i>

84
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,399
Come and have your daily fortune told.

85
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,569
<i>Have your daily fortune told.</i>

86
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,489
Please come and have a look.

87
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,469
I can read you your love horoscope.

88
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,449
That... Unni, Unni. Have your fortune told.

89
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,050
I'm a professional. Come and have a look.

90
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,619
I'm really accurate.

91
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,670
Unni!

92
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,759
Let me read your tarot cards.

93
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,679
Have your tarot cards read.

94
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,030
5,000* won. 5,000 won.
(approximately USD $5)

95
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,870
Hey, Han Kang.

96
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,699
Stop staring at me.
Go over there and pull in customers.

97
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,619
We need to make a lot of money to make a
substantial contribution to the orphanage.

98
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,630
Those kids there are so sweet!

99
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,950
It doesn't matter.

100
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,769
<i>Watching the sunset dyed in red.</i>

101
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,249
<i>Suddenly, your sorrowful face comes to mind.</i>

102
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,489
<i>I slowly lower my head.</i>

103
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,419
- Hey! You're embarrassing me.
- My eyes fill with tears.

104
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,799
<i>I'm unable to say a single word.</i>

105
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,050
<i>I love you.</i>

106
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,310
<i>There's only you in this world.</i>

107
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,840
Do you want your tarot card read?

108
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,060
This stuff is all fake.

109
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,160
It isn't fake.

110
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,890
How does this work?

111
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,549
Please pay 5,000 won first.

112
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,610
Pick a tarot card,
and then I'll read it for you.

113
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,830
[Song Yi Kyung]

114
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,160
<i>Okay, let's begin.</i>

115
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,379
Please select a card.

116
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,370
You may pick one card or you can pick it.

117
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,849
I'll pick one.

118
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,150
No, I'll do it.

119
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,830
What's that?

120
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,950
Should minors be carrying around
these inappropriate cards?

121
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,120
Is this card bad?

122
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,460
This...

123
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:49,220
This card symbolizes unconditional love.

124
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,730
Really?

125
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,290
The bread in the lover's hand represents
a perfect union, marriage,

126
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,939
and an unbreakable love.

127
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,810
In other words, the two of you
are a perfect pair of lovers.

128
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,450
I picked that card.

129
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,120
This...

130
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,649
Is a special gift for lovers
who are fated to be together.

131
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,560
Tada!

132
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,520
Wow, it's a pink rose. It's so pretty.

133
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,380
This is my favorite flower.

134
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,130
Thanks.

135
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,030
- Isn't it pretty?
- Yes.

136
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,880
You're not hungry?

137
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,860
I'm going crazy, Song Yi Soo.

138
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,300
Now what's wrong?

139
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,600
How could I not be hungry?

140
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,720
But this single rose filled my stomach.

141
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,579
Give it to me, it's mine.

142
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,060
Hey!

143
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,240
The name of our pension will be "February".

144
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,260
February as in the month of February,

145
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,290
plus love...

146
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,880
So it's February Love.

147
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,820
I came up with the name February.

148
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,230
Yi Soo.

149
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,660
I'll plant cherry blossom trees

150
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,450
all around the fence
surrounding the pension.

151
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:45,939
<i>"I love you" ~
words I keep shouting in my heart</i>

152
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:53,219
<i>"I love you" ~
words I can only whisper behind your back</i>

153
00:12:53,220 --> 00:13:01,339
<i>"I love you" ~ words that
I can't speak for fear they will disappear</i>

154
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:08,590
<i>I love you so much it scares me</i>

155
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:20,991
<i>I have to confess my love for you today</i>

156
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:37,720
<i>Even if I can only live for one day</i>

157
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:47,820
<i>Now I'm going to confess,
I'm going to say "I love you"~</i>

158
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,279
Why am I a liar?

159
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,449
Do you know how to read tarot cards?

160
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,770
You think I wouldn't know even that
just by watching from the sidelines?

161
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,350
They're not fated lovers or whatever.

162
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,649
<i>He picked this card.</i>

163
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,999
From where they stood,
it was facing the opposite direction.

164
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,319
A profound separation,
likely an eternal separation.

165
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,149
Why did you interpret it
from your direction instead?

166
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,720
Why did you lie?

167
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,130
They looked so happy together,

168
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,339
how could I tell them
they'll be separated forever?

169
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,230
You have to. Why didn't you say it?

170
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,529
Why did I have to?

171
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,669
Because it's a lie.

172
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,900
Don't you know what a lie of kindness is?

173
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,910
A white lie, do you know what that is?

174
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,749
Why should you make that decision?

175
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,889
Who do you think you are?

176
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,809
How do you know
whether they wanted to hear lies,

177
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,629
or the truth? Did you know?
I'm asking you.

178
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,850
They came all the way from Cheon Chuan...

179
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,660
And you wanted to be the nice guy?

180
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,070
Brat, you need to understand
what you should and shouldn't do.

181
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,409
Didn't they leave here happily?
So everything is fine.

182
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,889
Because they were lied to!

183
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,300
Aren't you the fool who pretended to hate
your mom's seaweed soup and ran off to Nanshan?

184
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
What?

185
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,000
Nothing. Nothing at all.

186
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,579
I said wrong.

187
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,010
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

188
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,299
Just consider it my fault.

189
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,940
Let's play this. Come on.

190
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,020
Get rid of all this stuff.

191
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,830
Don't do that!

192
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,550
Hey!

193
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,480
Leave! Leave!

194
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,810
Leave!

195
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,000
Leave!

196
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,460
<i>Slowly my tears fall down,</i>

197
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,410
<i>unintentionally fall.</i>

198
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,539
<i>you might wipe them,</i>

199
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,470
<i>so I hide them.</i>

200
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,780
<i>I can erase it all.</i>

201
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,230
<i>I can forget it.</i>

202
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:03,480
<i>But thinking my life without you,
tears form.</i>

203
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,400
<i>You didn't say anything,</i>

204
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,080
<i>{\a6}You were the one that left</i>

205
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,350
Hey, Shin Ji Hyun!

206
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,080
Hurry and get back in here.

207
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:18,120
<i>{\a6}I wish it wasn't true</i>

208
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,640
Oh, I got it.

209
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,330
<i>Shin Ji Hyun!</i>

210
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,300
<i>It is okay for you to come back.</i>

211
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,190
<i>It is okay for you to come back.</i>

212
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:36,439
<i>I love you, I still do. Please,</i>

213
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,480
<i>Please. Nothing has happened.</i>

214
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,290
<i>Nothing has happened.</i>

215
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,819
<i>When I wake up tonight,</i>

216
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:54,459
<i>I will be with you again.</i>

217
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,080
Children, look over here.

218
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:01,820
Ji Hyun is transferring
to a school in Seoul today.

219
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,160
We won't see her anymore.

220
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,979
Don't do it.

221
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,420
What's wrong, Child?

222
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,529
Ji Hyun! Ji Hyun?

223
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,159
- What's wrong.
- No, Dad. No!

224
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,700
Get in the car quickly.

225
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,240
- Ji Hyun.
- Ahjussi, stop the car. Ahjussi!

226
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,680
Father.

227
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,780
Go to America with your father.

228
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,980
Everyday, it was the same old song, you
asking me to send you to your father.

229
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,060
I'll deduct a day then. I'm leaving.

230
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,850
What about Unni's part-time job?

231
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,900
What are you doing here?

232
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,360
<i>So it's Ji Hyun.</i>

233
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,450
Oh, right.

234
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,370
We came over there together just now, right?

235
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,009
I fainted just now.

236
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,540
Let's go eat.

237
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,209
What?

238
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:46,520
A super-eater who misses a meal,
will faint from hunger.

239
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,000
<i>Did he notice anything?</i>

240
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,420
Let's go.

241
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,550
Yi Kyung! Song Yi Kyung!

242
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,529
<i>Park Seo Woo.</i>

243
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,640
I'm leaving.

244
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,920
<i>- Yi Kyung, it's me, Kang Min Ho.
- Oppa!</i>

245
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,090
This is your first time
coming to Jinan, right?

246
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,470
The meat here gets rave reviews.

247
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,680
Ahjumma, please bring two more servings.

248
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:13,979
This is enough.

249
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,100
This isn't enough. I know you can eat a lot.

250
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,609
- What are you doing?
- What?

251
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,470
You just started acting this way.

252
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,789
Even though I came with Kang Min Ho,
you didn't get mad.

253
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,280
You keep being nice to me.

254
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,970
[Kang Min Ho]

255
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,580
I'm going to answer this call.

256
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,690
Don't answer it.

257
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,470
We're in the middle of eating.
Who keeps calling?!

258
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,030
Don't think about going to see Min Ho hyung.

259
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,700
Come back to Seoul with me.

260
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,509
<i>You might as well just admit,</i>

261
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,330
<i>you don't like
Song Yi Kyung meeting Kang Min Ho.</i>

262
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,639
<i>The number you dialed cannot be connected.</i>

263
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,250
<i>After the beep,
you'll be connected to voicemail.</i>

264
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,510
She turned off her phone?

265
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,270
She must be fine then.

266
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,130
<i>In Jung, wait here for a second.</i>

267
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,950
<i>What kind of man is he,
that you can't bring him home?</i>

268
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,340
<i>The man you're dating isn't married, is he?</i>

269
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,870
[Seo Woo]

270
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,089
I couldn't wake her up
no matter what I did, so I called you.

271
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,969
She was crying and shouting
and being impossible.

272
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,630
Did you leave her here all alone?

273
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,520
Help me get Seo Woo into the car.

274
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,460
Isn't there someone
waiting in the hotel room for you?

275
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,860
Seo Woo. Seo Woo.

276
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,909
Please call a driver for us.

277
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:01,989
Yes.

278
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,660
Seo Woo. Get up, ok?

279
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,340
It's me.

280
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:11,280
Cancel the business trip.
I'm returning to Seoul.

281
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,750
<i>Kang Min Ho and Shin In Jung,
what happened with them?</i>

282
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,800
<i>The three of us were supposed to meet.</i>

283
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,360
<i>Why did Unni have to wake up
at that very moment?</i>

284
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,280
<i>That's the shop Dad always goes to.</i>

285
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,279
What? Is there something
you need to do at that restaurant?

286
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,020
What? There isn't.

287
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,440
Oh, suckling pig soup.

288
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,690
That's Ahjussi Hae Won's favorite food.

289
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,660
Let's go and buy some.

290
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:02,950
Get out of the car.

291
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,060
Yi Kyung, are you okay?

292
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,520
Who are you?

293
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,780
<i>Why is Kang in Jinan?</i>

294
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,890
Aren't you hungry?

295
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,739
Yi Kyung, you're here.

296
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,180
It's time for me to be here, so I came.

297
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,430
Starting tomorrow, it would be great
if you could come ten minutes early.

298
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,860
Stop being so demanding.

299
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:49,010
First, start with a sweet caramel macchiato.

300
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,079
Noona, I have a favor to ask.

301
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,990
I absolutely will not help an
underage guy sneakily buy cigarettes.

302
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:08,140
You're still a little kid,
why are you thinking about smoking?

303
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,539
And also, high school students
should act like high school students.

304
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,790
You should go home by midnight.

305
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,810
Kids these days are a problem, a problem.

306
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,289
Does this guy never sleep?

307
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,320
It's the middle of the night,
is he going to work?

308
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,169
Song Yi Kyung didn't come to work today?

309
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,800
Song Yi Kyung is on maternity leave.

310
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,869
Oh, really?

311
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,710
Yes, really.

312
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,420
Customer, if you're not ordering coffee...

313
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,140
Could you stop blocking my field of vision?

314
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,710
Oh, sorry.

315
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,669
Look at that. Look at that.

316
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,719
Men are the type of creatures,

317
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,670
that won't spend money
if there isn't a woman nearby.

318
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,179
Come out so we can talk.

319
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:54,140
Min Ho oppa, so this is how
you end up coming to my house.

320
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,280
This is the first time
you've been to my house.

321
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,430
It's the first time
you've been in my bedroom as well.

322
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:05,549
You've never seen the way I live, have you?

323
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,410
That's true. That's the truth.

324
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,460
When I was living with Ji Hyun,
it was because it was Ji Hyun's house.

325
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,520
In front of Seo Woo,

326
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,880
because you were Ji Hyun's boyfriend,

327
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,030
forget about coming inside,

328
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,800
you never even came near the front door.

329
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,560
And we've never gone on a trip together.

330
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,810
That woman...

331
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:34,480
It hasn't even been a month and
you took her with you on a business trip.

332
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,180
The Kang Min Ho who cleanly separated
work and personal life.

333
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,790
I know you're in a bad mood right now.

334
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:41,910
You know?

335
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,980
Yet you did it anyway?

336
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,180
Why did you do it?

337
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,110
I'm attracted to her.

338
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,890
It's not that I didn't try to avoid
being attracted to her,

339
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,400
but it still turned out this way.

340
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,060
I have no idea how it became this way.

341
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,170
I feel apologetic towards you,

342
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,690
but my heart keeps
being drawn to her subconsciously.

343
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,810
Your heart is... drawn to her?

344
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,999
Does that mean you like her for real?

345
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,599
I'm telling you
because I can't keep lying to you.

346
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,239
It's not because you got caught?

347
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,490
Even if I didn't see you in Jinan,

348
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,660
I would have told you after I got back.

349
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,780
Nothing will happen
between that woman and me.

350
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,990
Wait for me.

351
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,710
Wait for you for what?

352
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,690
I've waited five years for you already!
You want me to keep waiting for what?

353
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,449
<i>We've been together for five years already!</i>

354
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,969
<i>It's been five years already!</i>

355
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,629
Lower your voice. Seo Woo is here.

356
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,780
It doesn't matter. Let her hear.

357
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,550
You're being so cautious because you think
we can end things calmly and peacefully.

358
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:56,169
Then you can pretend I don't exist
and do whatever you want?

359
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,420
I told you I'm trying.

360
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,389
I hate myself for being like this too.

361
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:03,129
My heart doesn't do as I tell it to.
It's scary and I hate it a lot too.

362
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,590
So now you want me to keep my mouth shut,

363
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,870
because you started this thing.

364
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,790
Now, I...

365
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,690
I'm not afraid of being caught by anyone.

366
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,019
Even if I wanted to,
Ji Hyun is already that way.

367
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,850
I have nothing to be afraid of now!

368
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,540
Let's talk later.

369
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,580
Go take care of Seo Woo.

370
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,090
We're here. Hand that to me.

371
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,869
I'll leave after I watch you go in.

372
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,089
I already said it's fine.

373
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,920
It's not fine.

374
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,200
Do you like Min Ho hyung so much
that you went with him to Jinan?

375
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,770
Of course I have my reasons
for following him there.

376
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,560
I said it's fine, why do you keep asking?

377
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,530
Tell me if you need help at home.

378
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,370
<i>Idiot! Idiot!</i>

379
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,790
You saw Min Ho hyung
and In Jung at the hotel,

380
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,630
do you still like him after that?

381
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,240
Why am I not bouncing out?

382
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,700
Is it because we had to erase
one day from Unni's memory?

383
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,120
The feeling of physical exhaustion...

384
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,550
is great.

385
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:45,640
Kang, what's going on?
Why were you in Jinan?

386
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,610
Is Song Yi Kyung okay?
She seemed a little strange to me.

387
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,970
What's wrong with you?

388
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,050
Are you acting like this now
because of Song Yi Kyung?

389
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,829
When did it start?

390
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,740
When did you and In Jung start?

391
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,860
Bastard!

392
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,160
This is for Ji Hyun!

393
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,400
This is for Ji Hyun too!

394
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,990
This is...

395
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,430
You're not hitting me?

396
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,850
Use that.

397
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,360
Are you trying to sweet me up
after hitting me?

398
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,199
You hit me like you wanted to kill me.

399
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,630
Explain to me clearly...
what exactly is going on?

400
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,579
When did you and In Jung start?

401
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,030
When did we start?

402
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,040
Of course it was after Ji Hyun's accident.

403
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,460
<i>I saw my friend at the hotel.</i>

404
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,650
And I saw my fianc� too.

405
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,420
Do you think I'm stupid?

406
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,950
Your relationship with her
started before the accident.

407
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,139
Did Song Yi Kyung tell you anything?

408
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,290
Tell me what?

409
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,399
How did you know to come over last time?

410
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,529
In Jung called you oppa.

411
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,799
Length of time
doesn't matter in a relationship.

412
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,420
Then what is Song Yi Kyung?

413
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,590
Do you like both In Jung
and Song Yi Kyung at the same time?

414
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,989
If you're in a relationship with In Jung,

415
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,559
then you should focus on her,

416
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,260
and not flirt with Song Yi Kyung.

417
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,170
I won't stand by and do nothing.

418
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,550
Do you like Song Yi Kyung that much?

419
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,970
Ji Hyun is just an excuse?

420
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,780
You're the one who should stop interfering.

421
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,040
This isn't your decision.
It's up to Song Yi Kyung.

422
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,020
Are you this type of person?

423
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,689
The Kang Min Ho that I like,
is he such a shameless person?

424
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:54,890
Thinking back,

425
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,070
I really don't know why you stuck around me.

426
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,399
I know your circumstances were difficult,

427
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,079
but you were always strong and disciplined.

428
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,239
You never tried to curry favor
or manipulate to your advantage.

429
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,069
No matter how people looked down on you,

430
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,000
you never once responded.

431
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,639
You never wasted any time.

432
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,410
Even so, you did everything
you needed to do.

433
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,040
You defied your circumstances

434
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,200
and earned my respect.

435
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:25,329
You could never know
how difficult my life was.

436
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,369
Why wouldn't I know? You told me before.

437
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:30,070
There are different types of poverty.

438
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,280
The type of poverty that you understand

439
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,820
is not being able to afford a car,

440
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,669
your parents can't pay tuition fees,

441
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,120
and no money to eat at restaurants.

442
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,490
That's all you understand.

443
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,770
What do you mean by that?

444
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,810
Put some medicated cream on your hand.

445
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,860
You'll suffer for a few days
if you go straight to sleep.

446
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,850
Didn't you say you were able

447
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,310
to pick and choose to love
when you could or wanted to love?

448
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,970
I'm warning you...
drop your interest in Song Yi Kyung.

449
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,750
Why did she keep this hidden?

450
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,639
During the 49 days, she has to be
attached to a host body?

451
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,389
The day Ji Hyun came to see me,

452
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,730
she asked me to let her work for 48 days.

453
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,089
The day before that was Ji Hyun's accident.

454
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,550
49 days is right.

455
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,409
She can't reveal that it's her.

456
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,640
That's why whenever I noticed something,

457
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:23,260
Ji Hyun would get scared and timid.

458
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:27,139
She hasn't told anyone all this time.
That's that situation.

459
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,909
Then we just need to find out
how to bring her back.

460
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,850
Gaining someone's true feelings,
what does that mean?

461
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,690
I just can't figure that out.

462
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:39,710
She said she had things to do,
so I let her be a freelance part-timer.

463
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,529
It might be because of that too.

464
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,490
Proof of true feelings, is that it?

465
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:47,710
Ahjussi, you can't tell anyone about this.

466
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,809
If we make a wrong move,
something bad might happen to Ji Hyun.

467
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,870
It's a matter of life and death,

468
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,920
I'm too scared to say anything.

469
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,790
Why did she hide this at my house?

470
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:01,019
Because if she gives it to Min Ho,
he'll know it's her?

471
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,610
I think seals are used during
the buying and selling of houses.

472
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,149
She obviously knows about
Min Ho and In Jung's relationship,

473
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,370
but she's still hanging around.
What is that about?

474
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,709
Because it's hard to control your feelings.

475
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,790
There's too much to think about.
My head's going to explode.

476
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,649
My mind is full of questions
related to Ji Hyun.

477
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,200
Think it over calmly.

478
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,920
Right now you're the only person
who can help Ji Hyun.

479
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,340
What is this?

480
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,260
Am I asleep?

481
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,440
Did I sleep alongside Song Yi Kyung
for the whole night?

482
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:55,330
Oh... so that's actually possible.

483
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,260
I haven't felt this relaxed in so long.

484
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,689
Oh my, look who's here?

485
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,159
Hello.

486
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,380
Who is this?

487
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,830
She's the girl I mentioned last time.

488
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,400
She's Ji Hyun's friend from the magic club.

489
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,890
Hello, Father. I'm Park Jung Eun.

490
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,300
So this is the girl
who managed to cheer you up.

491
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,440
Why did you come here?

492
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,500
I was in Jinan for something,

493
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,719
and remembered Ji Hyun saying
her dad likes suckling pig soup,

494
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,070
so I bought some.

495
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,770
You brought this all the way from Jinan?

496
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,760
She even told you about the things I like?

497
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,750
She said without her dad,
she's like a zombie.

498
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,649
She said no matter
how great her future husband is,

499
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:08,859
her dad will always be her number one.

500
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:13,140
So she hopes you'll be healthy
and live a long life.

501
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,289
<i>Kang said he knows you're going to Jinan.</i>

502
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:50,210
<i>He asked you to wait at the
cherry blossom path pavilion by 7 o'clock.</i>

503
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,740
Who sent this text message?

504
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,070
<i>Incoming call from Shin In Jung.</i>

505
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,470
<i>Shin In Jung wants you to answer.</i>

506
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,790
Yes, this is Song Yi Kyung.

507
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,570
Song... Yi Kyung.

508
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,330
Yes, In Jung.

509
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,259
Why did you send me a text message?

510
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,089
Because I don't want to be like you
and stab people in the back.

511
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,629
We can't be considered friends,

512
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,029
but we're still acquaintances.

513
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,040
Are you playing around with me?

514
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,199
Why did you say you'd keep what I told you
about Kang's birthday a secret?

515
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,209
I only said I'd keep it secret,

516
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:42,089
I never said I wouldn't see Kang Min Ho.

517
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,029
You obviously know about our relationship,

518
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,039
so what are you trying to do?

519
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,089
Shin In Jung,
aren't you seeing your friend's fianc�?

520
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,410
He was my man to begin with!

521
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,360
Did you send your boyfriend
over to your friend then?

522
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:55,290
So you tricked your friend.

523
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,170
Then it's fine for me to do it too.

524
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:00,539
What did you say?

525
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,330
You even trick your friends,

526
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,579
so why can't I see Kang Min Ho?

527
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,879
I'm not even your friend.

528
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,539
Min Ho oppa and I,

529
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,349
our relationship isn't that simple.

530
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,299
Of course
it can't be a serious relationship,

531
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,880
since the two of you are allies.

532
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,459
Don't act like you understand
when you don't.

533
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,200
You turned your boyfriend
into your friend's fianc�.

534
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,980
Besides coveting your friend's wealth,
is there any other reason?

535
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,389
There are. But I have no reason to tell you.

536
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:30,219
For two years, you brought your friend
and boyfriend together,

537
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,900
but acted like nothing happened.

538
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,340
So why are you so worked up
over a woman like me?

539
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,679
You never worried about Ji Hyun,

540
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,290
but you're afraid
I'll steal Kang Min Ho away?

541
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:48,180
Min Ho oppa wouldn't break up with me.

542
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,840
He said that clearly yesterday.

543
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:53,160
Of course he won't break up with you,

544
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,310
you're his right hand man at the office.

545
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,900
Right hand man?!

546
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,940
Aren't you the president's secretary?

547
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,129
Because you're his daughter's close friend,

548
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:05,429
the president also trusts you a lot.

549
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,950
<i>You have a lot of influence.</i>

550
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:11,690
"President, is that man trust-
worthy?"

551
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,810
"Have him investigated secretly."

552
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:17,560
<i>"The report indicates
that he's a perfect man."</i>

553
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,270
"President, a man like this
must not be passed over."

554
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,690
Oh! That was really how it happened.

555
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,419
How could he break up
with such a capable partner?

556
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,470
Kang Min Ho definitely
wouldn't break up with you.

557
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:39,300
Don't worry about me.

558
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,780
I'm sorry. I said I'd go
but I didn't end up going.

559
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:51,359
It's okay. I'm sure something
must have come up.

560
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,009
But, why are you here alone?
Where's In Jung?

561
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:58,450
In Jung went home,
but then something came up at home...

562
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,250
So she couldn't make it.

563
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:05,910
Did you guys go to Jinan
because you knew Min Ho was going?

564
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,809
Min Ho went to Jinan too?

565
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:10,769
You didn't know? In Jung must have known.

566
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:12,750
She didn't mention it.

567
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,680
How did you guys get back to Seoul?

568
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,560
About that...

569
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,900
I drank a lot yesterday

570
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:24,269
and thought someone piggybacked me home.

571
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:27,090
I thought it was a dream. Was it Min Ho?

572
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,540
What are you saying?

573
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,170
Jung In and Min Ho were arguing at home.

574
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,920
They said they've dated for five years.

575
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,090
Five years?!

576
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,159
It can't be. It had to have been a dream.

577
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,249
In Jung has a boyfriend.

578
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,619
Have you seen the man In Jung is dating?

579
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,519
I didn't see him clearly,
but I think Yi Kyung saw him before.

580
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,709
Song Yi Kyung saw him?

581
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:51,379
She said she knows who In Jung is dating,

582
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,720
but In Jung asked her to keep it a secret.

583
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,820
About me drinking yesterday,

584
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:03,169
I was really pitiful waiting for you
at the hotel.

585
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:06,390
Going to Jinan made me miss Ji Hyun more.

586
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,830
Plus, I was worried about
Ji Hyun's dad's brain tumor surgery.

587
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:11,189
What do you mean by that?

588
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,740
What do you mean
Ji Hyun's dad's brain tumor surgery?

589
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:16,080
I didn't tell you?

590
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:20,440
I heard Ji Hyun's dad
won't live for much longer.

591
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,680
<i>That's why he made out a will.</i>

592
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:30,700
The look in the eyes.

593
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:31,950
Gift.

594
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,180
I choose feelings.

595
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:37,679
You recognize love based on feelings.

596
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,000
How would you show evidence
of these feelings?

597
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:43,299
Using the language of a bachelor...
it's a kiss.

598
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,060
Using the language of lovers, it's...

599
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:47,500
That's enough. You can stop there.

600
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,600
This is so hard.

601
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:52,430
How many do we have?

602
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:55,090
About 20 of them.

603
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:59,990
But, Hae Won, why are you asking about
how to show evidence of your love?

604
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,579
I told you not to ask why. Stop it.

605
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:04,940
I'm here.

606
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,579
Where's the boss?

607
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,129
He stepped out.

608
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,600
Oh, did he?

609
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:20,339
Yi Kyung, have you eaten?

610
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,559
I haven't yet.

611
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,799
How could you still not have eaten yet?

612
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,479
Go and eat. Go!

613
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,360
Okay.

614
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:34,090
What happened to make your attitude
completely change?

615
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:38,210
No one has shown me so much concern before.

616
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,290
Too bad it's a woman.

617
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,219
If they started dating five years ago...

618
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,699
<i>Do you still feel guilty?</i>

619
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,479
<i>What would happen if I died because of you?</i>

620
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,809
Who is Shin Ji Hyun to die
at that kind of place?

621
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:55,619
You're God's daughter.

622
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,710
If it weren't for Min Ho oppa,
I would've died long ago.

623
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,549
They approached Ji Hyun with a plot.

624
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:06,299
<i>She said she knows who In Jung is dating,</i>

625
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,339
<i>but In Jung asked her to keep it a secret.</i>

626
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,930
This... I'm going to borrow it temporarily.

627
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,410
What are the two of you doing?

628
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:17,990
<i>Ji Hyun knew about all of this.</i>

629
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:19,690
I want to stay here.

630
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,349
<i>I heard Ji Hyun's dad wants to
hand down the company to Min Ho.</i>

631
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,360
Dad, you can't!

632
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,230
<i>Why did you come to Jinan?</i>

633
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:30,139
Even though I came with Kang Min Ho,

634
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,259
but, we only came together.

635
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,729
Do you like Min Ho hyung so much

636
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:33,889
that you went with him to Jinan?

637
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:36,680
Of course I have my reasons
for following him there.

638
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:40,850
Shin Ji Hyun, so you didn't do it
because you like Min Ho hyung.

639
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:44,130
You had a different motive.

640
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,099
[Resignation Letter]

641
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,850
I'm resigning.

642
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:58,500
What are you doing?

643
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,739
The woman who purposely sent me
a text message so I'd see her with you,

644
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,920
is she the woman you like the most?

645
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:11,970
It's great that you have me playing your
secretary and friend in front of that woman.

646
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,599
What are you talking about?

647
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,150
You're only a few days away
from declaring bankruptcy,

648
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,130
therefore you don't need
company information from me anymore.

649
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,620
I'm resigning.

650
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:38,369
In Jung.

651
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:39,620
What's going on?

652
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:42,829
Hello.

653
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:44,190
Long time no see.

654
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,790
What are you doing here?

655
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,849
That's a strange question.

656
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:56,139
She came to visit her friend,
so what is your reason

657
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,720
for questioning her about it?

658
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,240
I thought she'd call me before coming.

659
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,209
In fact, I called
the secretary's desk several times,

660
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,569
but you didn't pick up.

661
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:10,050
Even when the president isn't there,
the secretary should never desert her post.

662
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:15,599
After the interview with Park Jung Eun,

663
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,500
I suddenly thought of our Ji Hyun.

664
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,619
That's why I came.

665
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,000
Park Jung Eun?

666
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,979
Interview? What do you mean?

667
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:27,049
In order to film a video interview
that will help Ji Hyun's brain recover,

668
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:30,629
she contacted all of Ji Hyun's
friends and classmates.

669
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:31,850
<i>Didn't you know about it?</i>

670
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:36,759
Park Jung Eun is Ji Hyun's friend
who came to your house last time?

671
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,860
Yes, she really is Ji Hyun's friend.

672
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,229
Yesterday, she said she went to Jinan

673
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:47,379
and brought over suckling pig soup
for Ji Hyun's dad.

674
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,660
Jinan... yesterday?

675
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:07,150
<i>She's tall, slender, and is very pretty.</i>

676
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:12,520
<i>Ji Hyun's friend
was looking for Ji Hyun's classmates,</i>

677
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:16,100
<i>so why didn't she contact Seo Woo and me?</i>

678
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:22,070
Park Jung Eun... Who is she?

679
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:30,330
Kang Min Ho, why haven't you called me?

680
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:36,330
How could he just leave
after I fainted like that?

681
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,190
How could he not call me?

682
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,280
Did he get back together with In Jung?

683
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,630
He wouldn't have.

684
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,070
No.

685
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,750
He has to break up with Shin In Jung.

686
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:54,670
Why is he declaring bankruptcy?

687
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:57,210
I have to get that password.

688
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:09,170
She sent a text message to In Jung
telling her to come to our meeting spot.

689
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,780
She's no ordinary woman.

690
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:12,169
She's a scary woman.

691
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,389
She's even using an unregistered
cell phone number.

692
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:15,940
That's the most suspicious part.

693
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:23,419
Go look into it.
She must be at Kang's restaurant.

694
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,849
Follow her. Investigate where she lives,

695
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,180
her family background, past, history,
and past relationships.

696
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,720
Pay close attention to things related to me.

697
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:31,910
Got it.

698
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,960
Also, go to the hospital, Minseng Hospital.

699
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,740
I bumped into her there before,

700
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,869
but in Jinan she didn't recognize me.

701
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:42,210
Look into her medical history.
Do a thorough investigation.

702
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:46,330
I want to know why
she's playing games with me.

703
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:08,670
<i>I heard Ji Hyun's father
won't be able to live much longer.</i>

704
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:11,970
<i>Ji Hyun, you still don't know, do you?</i>

705
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:14,420
<i>I really hope you don't know.</i>

706
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:15,730
<i>In your current condition,</i>

707
00:53:15,731 --> 00:53:19,080
<i>how could you handle finding
out about your father's illness?</i>

708
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:35,710
<i>Hey, kid.</i>

709
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,760
<i>Shin Ji Hyun, what are you thinking about?</i>

710
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:42,010
<i>You can't tell anyone.
You're all by yourself.</i>

711
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:00,350
Are there only 23 days left?

712
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:23,860
Yi Soo.

713
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,830
<i>Don't appear in my dreams.</i>

714
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,460
<i>Don't appear even in my dreams.</i>

715
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,130
<i>Don't appear.</i>

716
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:46,790
<i>There are 20 days,
4 hours, 59 minutes remaining.</i>

717
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,840
Hi, President!

718
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,670
What?

719
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:28,590
Where are you going dressed up so nicely?

720
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:30,640
Here is your flower delivery.

721
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,349
What is this? Where are you going?

722
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,560
On a date.

723
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,279
Date?

724
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,810
Why? Why?

725
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:45,319
How funny.
I can't give my girlfriend flowers?

726
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,269
You have a girlfriend?

727
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:48,919
That's even funnier.

728
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,070
What? You think I don't have a woman I like?

729
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,810
So you have a girlfriend.

730
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,070
She's not my girlfriend,
she's a woman I like.

731
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,450
<i>You have a woman you like,
but you treat me...</i>

732
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,659
<i>No, you treat Song Yi Kyung that way?</i>

733
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,439
You're clearly a playboy.

734
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,720
What? How am I a playboy?

735
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,349
You're giving a woman flowers.

736
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:12,160
Plus, a man who gives that many flowers
to a woman is a playboy.

737
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,840
I don't know who she is, but I pity her.

738
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,600
How annoying,
she likes the same flowers I do.

739
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:27,680
Why is she mad?

740
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:34,950
You are so strange.

741
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:36,899
I told you not to come,
so why are you here again?

742
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,949
I would like to be responsible
for the design.

743
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:41,689
If you give me another chance,
I really will do my very best.

744
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:46,380
That's enough. I don't want to entrust
the work to such an irresponsible person.

745
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:50,560
Ji Hyun doesn't need flowers.
Don't come here ever again.

746
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:53,159
These are Ji Hyun's favorite flowers.

747
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,360
That's none of your concern!

748
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:58,180
Please stop saying that, Honey.

749
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:01,910
I will leave for today.
I'll come back again.

750
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:05,059
Why would you come back?
I already told you not to come.

751
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,290
Stop being like this.

752
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:15,840
I'm sorry.

753
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,579
He's not feeling well
so he's a bit overly sensitive.

754
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,460
I understand. It doesn't matter.

755
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,899
But the surgery...

756
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,070
He said he can't abandon Ji Hyun
and go get surgery.

757
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,110
I'm letting him have his way.

758
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,679
May I ask you a question?

759
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,879
Please ask. What is it?

760
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,750
On the day of Ji Hyun's accident,

761
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,650
I heard she was on her way to bring
something

762
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,870
to Min Ho hyung when she got into
an accident.

763
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,099
What was it?

764
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,699
Oh, it was her seal.

765
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,080
Seal?

766
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,629
What is that sort of thing used for?

767
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,589
It was because of the contract
on Ji Hyun's land.

768
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:56,220
We need to sell it to fund
the Hae Mi Do project.

769
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,240
Hae Mi Do?

770
00:57:58,570 --> 00:57:59,980
[Song Yi Kyung]

771
00:58:02,631 --> 00:58:04,131
[Song Yi Kyung]

772
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:26,889
I originally didn't want to contact you.

773
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:27,809
Really?

774
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:30,850
Did you get it trouble with Shin In Jung?

775
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:33,519
She must have said something about
how you wavered because of a woman...

776
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,450
who sent a text message telling her to come
out in order to sabotage your relationship.

777
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,979
Shin In Jung was right.

778
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,560
I sent that text message.

779
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:49,610
I followed you to Jinan
after I found out she was going there.

780
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:51,220
Why?

781
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:52,930
Why else?

782
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,640
Song Yi Kyung, what do you want from me?

783
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:01,270
Isn't it the same as you... now?

784
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,390
What is it that I want?

785
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,950
Song Yi Kyung, what do you think I want?

786
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:12,909
It's what I want.

787
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:14,850
What do you want?

788
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,979
Are you trying to play word games with me?

789
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:19,400
I don't want anything from you.

790
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:24,109
That's how I feel. But you're saying that
what you want is what I want.

791
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:25,900
I'm very curious what that is.

792
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:29,720
Why aren't you talking?

793
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:34,410
I'm very curious because
you act like you can read my mind.

794
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,430
<i>Why is he suddenly being like this?</i>

795
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,780
That's why
I say not to get ahead of yourself.

796
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,640
Because you'll get caught.

797
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:46,870
There's no need to contact me.

798
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,450
I haven't been caught.

799
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:56,219
Kang Min Ho, you could never figure me out.

800
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:58,250
You're no longer someone
I want to figure out.

801
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,630
I only have 20 days left.

802
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:39,690
Dad, what should I do?

803
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:45,550
The number of things I can do with my
own strength is growing fewer and fewer.

804
01:00:56,930 --> 01:01:02,140
<i>The seal she was bringing to Min Ho hyung
ended up at my house after the accident,</i>

805
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:06,550
<i>because the seal cannot fall
into Min Ho hyung's hands.</i>

806
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,390
Do I have to do that?

807
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,400
Be a groomsman or whatever.

808
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:13,660
Don't be then. You don't have to.

809
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:17,649
<i>But from the start,
he had no intention of marrying Ji Hyun.</i>

810
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,770
I saw my friend at the hotel.

811
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:22,339
And I saw my fianc� too.

812
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:25,149
<i>You didn't know about it
until after the accident.</i>

813
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:28,689
Can't I just be a free-lance part-timer?

814
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:30,299
I have a lot of things to take care of.

815
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,640
I'm stuck here and can't just leave.

816
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:40,590
Ahjussi and ahjumma
seem to really love each other.

817
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,309
Is love something that can be faked?

818
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:43,680
I'm envious.

819
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,250
I want to live like that too.

820
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:52,320
That doesn't matter.
You were my support during that time.

821
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:58,280
If you just treat me with the care you feel
towards your friend... that's enough.

822
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:00,820
<i>Song Yi Kyung is an orphan.</i>

823
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:04,190
<i>She had no one to talk to or rely on.</i>

824
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:09,240
There's no one who loves her.
Is that enough?

825
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:14,420
<i>During this time,
caught between life and death,</i>

826
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:18,570
<i>you've had such a hard time,
what can I do for you?</i>
