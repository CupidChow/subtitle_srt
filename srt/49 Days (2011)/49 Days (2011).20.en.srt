{\a6}Final episode

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,582
You remember me,

5
00:00:08,606 --> 00:00:11,317
yet you don't remember
Han Kang?

6
00:00:14,502 --> 00:00:16,885
Do you remember him?

7
00:00:17,774 --> 00:00:19,442
If you do,

8
00:00:19,622 --> 00:00:21,984
then why do you pretend not to?

9
00:00:23,303 --> 00:00:25,296
Because...

10
00:00:26,183 --> 00:00:27,498
I'm...

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,309
going to die again soon.

12
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,324
Oh?

13
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,826
You're the Scheduler, right?

14
00:00:54,905 --> 00:00:56,502
This is a bit sad.

15
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,949
You've forgotten me already?

16
00:00:58,052 --> 00:01:00,026
That's not it.

17
00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:02,307
Why am I able to see you?

18
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:06,545
Isn't the Scheduler only visible
to those who are dead?

19
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:14,183
I remember.

20
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,897
Why...

21
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:19,486
do I remember those 49 days?

22
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:22,063
It is a cruel...

23
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:25,204
final gift given to you.

24
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,842
Which you can reject.

25
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:31,598
What... do you mean?

26
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:39,405
I'm...

27
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,535
going to die?

28
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:46,133
I received my final schedule,

29
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,770
and the last person on
my list to escort

30
00:01:51,574 --> 00:01:53,740
is you, Shin Ji Hyun. 

31
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:59,629
Your expected death date

32
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:02,519
is 6 days from today.

33
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,175
What?

34
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:05,528
<i>However,</i>

35
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:08,853
you unfairly had to go through the
49 days of your journey,

36
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:11,501
and even earned 3 tears.

37
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:13,326
<i>So...</i>

38
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,950
you've given the opportunity to retain
the memory of those 49 days...

39
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:22,115
from above.

40
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,070
You're allowing me

41
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:30,845
to choose whether or not
I want to remember

42
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,259
those 49 days?

43
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:35,332
If you're not willing,

44
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,186
then on the 6th day,

45
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,138
we'll meet for the first time.

46
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,555
So you're saying that...

47
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:49,536
I will die in 5 days?

48
00:02:49,605 --> 00:02:52,414
On that day,
you will be born into...

49
00:02:55,023 --> 00:02:57,384
your destined fate.

50
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:03,517
Are you angry?

51
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:06,426
You must be very angry.

52
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,989
Who can I be angry at?!

53
00:03:13,124 --> 00:03:15,287
Who should I be mad at?

54
00:03:15,915 --> 00:03:17,884
<i>I know that no matter
how angry...</i>

55
00:03:18,056 --> 00:03:20,025
no matter how tortured...

56
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,453
or how saddened I am...

57
00:03:25,106 --> 00:03:27,941
there is nothing I can do.

58
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,852
No matter how much I wish.

59
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,117
<i>Yes.</i>

60
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,606
As a human,
there is nothing you can do.

61
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:51,148
You are born to die.

62
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,369
That's why,
I accepted the memory.

63
00:03:58,403 --> 00:04:00,315
Then what does all that mean?

64
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:03,510
What are those 49 days?
What is your destined fate?

65
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:06,874
Exactly who was it who said
all this to you?

66
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,021
There is someone,
and some things...

67
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:14,608
that you can never understand.

68
00:04:15,164 --> 00:04:18,464
Then... Ji Hyun, you're really...

69
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:20,258
Soon...

70
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:22,235
I will die.

71
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:24,912
This is too unfair.

72
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:28,988
You'd suffered so much
in order to live on.

73
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:32,354
This is too cruel.

74
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:37,953
If I had never started the
49 day journey,

75
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:41,916
father's company would probably
already be in Kang Min Ho's hands.

76
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:43,083
And...

77
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:46,784
the terrible shock of the betrayal
by my friend and fiance,

78
00:04:47,196 --> 00:04:49,676
would have broken my spirit.

79
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,251
Or, perhaps being unable to
handle the shock...

80
00:04:54,735 --> 00:04:56,822
I would've committed suicide.

81
00:04:57,106 --> 00:04:59,560
That could have been my fate.

82
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,999
Because of the 49 day journey,

83
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:10,188
I was able to gain Kang's love...

84
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,412
to experience love...

85
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:18,836
and was able to save my
father's company.

86
00:05:21,915 --> 00:05:26,773
I was also able to reflect on the life
I have experienced.

87
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:30,848
Sometimes, thinking back,
I find that I'm very fortunate.

88
00:05:31,787 --> 00:05:34,378
If I had died
without knowing anything,

89
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:40,147
my life then really would've been
fake and meaningless.

90
00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:43,944
Then why must you feign
memory loss?

91
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,982
Since I'll have to die anyways,

92
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:50,979
I want to die with the expression
that I've lived a happy life.

93
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:54,115
I want to die...

94
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:56,505
as the kind, naive, open-minded...

95
00:05:56,646 --> 00:05:58,479
Shin Ji Hyun.

96
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:03,805
Initially, I desired a quiet death.

97
00:06:06,982 --> 00:06:08,782
But Unni...

98
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:17,628
being able to see you again
in my real body,

99
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:21,192
<i>there was no way I could pretend
to not recognize you.</i>

100
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,719
What about Han Kang then?

101
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:33,267
He's done so much for you,

102
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:35,328
loved you all this time.

103
00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:37,535
Even if your parents don't know,

104
00:06:37,784 --> 00:06:40,622
he still remembers those 49 days.

105
00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:43,564
<i>Didn't you say that once
you awoke,</i>

106
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:46,474
you would tell him that
you love him?

107
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,878
That night...

108
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,745
didn't you say you wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye?

109
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:56,390
What use is that?

110
00:06:57,803 --> 00:07:00,149
I'm leaving...

111
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,988
and Kang will remain behind.

112
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,090
<i>"I like you."</i>

113
00:07:06,253 --> 00:07:08,098
"I love you."

114
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,336
What help would it be
to say those words to Kang?

115
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,479
They will only cause him
to suffer more pain and sorrow.

116
00:07:17,634 --> 00:07:20,153
It's painful for you too.

117
00:07:20,844 --> 00:07:23,182
Seeing you, I realize that those

118
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,639
who are left behind...

119
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,588
must live their own lives.

120
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:32,111
So...

121
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:35,383
please don't say anything to Kang.

122
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:38,744
<i>It will be fine...</i>

123
00:07:39,062 --> 00:07:41,825
as long as I'm nothing more
than Kang's friend.

124
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:55,493
<i>How surprising</i>

125
00:07:55,705 --> 00:07:57,736
that you initiated this meeting.

126
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:01,185
I wanted to see your
complacent face.

127
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,562
You were boasting
that you would stop me,

128
00:08:03,745 --> 00:08:05,195
and you succeeded.

129
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,143
Are you satisfied?

130
00:08:06,155 --> 00:08:07,951
It's not satisfaction I feel.

131
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:11,258
I feel very relieved,

132
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,627
because I don't have to watch you
destroy yourself anymore.

133
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:15,689
I've already been shattered
into pieces.

134
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:18,467
The Kang Min Ho you knew,
disappeared long ago.

135
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:19,791
No.

136
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,330
I know you'll come back.

137
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,998
<i>No matter how many
years it takes,</i>

138
00:08:25,557 --> 00:08:27,975
accept your punishment and
return peacefully...

139
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:30,777
to the Hyung I wanted
to be like

140
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,961
and once respected.

141
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,295
You once respected me?

142
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:40,991
Unable to conquer my own pain,

143
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:44,380
wallowing in self-pity...

144
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,023
you were different from me,

145
00:08:48,155 --> 00:08:50,601
you didn't depend on your
surroundings and laze around.

146
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:52,362
<i>Hyung,</i>

147
00:08:52,524 --> 00:08:54,323
you were someone...

148
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:57,695
who used your abilities to
rise above your surroundings.

149
00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:01,085
Do you know why I liked you?

150
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:02,795
You once liked me?

151
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:05,536
I liked you because you were
suffering your own pain.

152
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:08,093
<i>You accepted
your parents' pain,</i>

153
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:10,890
living with a wound
that never ceased bleeding.

154
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:13,880
Because you were upright
and honest,

155
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:17,258
and never considered healing
your own pain, you emitted

156
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,781
<i>a sense of purity that I admired...</i>

157
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:22,492
but never attained.

158
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,211
Ji Hyun...

159
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,618
is healthy and doing well.

160
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,725
Although she doesn't know
about your situation, 

161
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:32,431
but when she does

162
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:34,909
I will remain at her side
to help her get through the pain.

163
00:09:34,944 --> 00:09:36,999
Don't say any more.

164
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:44,631
A simple meal would've done.
This is too much.

165
00:09:44,677 --> 00:09:46,251
Ahjumma made all of this.

166
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:48,998
All your mother cooked
was this bean paste soup.

167
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:52,424
No wonder. My hand keeps
reaching for this.

168
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:55,018
So delicious.

169
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:58,966
Ah, don't just drink the soup.
Here, eat this.

170
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:06,338
- Father too.
- Yes.

171
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:09,211
Father is the best.

172
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,190
Mother too.

173
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,992
Oh, this feels like a dream.

174
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:19,911
<i>I've always wanted the
three of us to sit down and</i>

175
00:10:20,055 --> 00:10:22,193
have dinner together
as a family.

176
00:10:22,364 --> 00:10:25,229
As expected, you're
more magnanimous than I am.

177
00:10:25,388 --> 00:10:30,126
Just seeing Ji Hyun's smile again
would have been enough to satisfy me.

178
00:10:31,682 --> 00:10:32,797
Really?

179
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,004
Then I've made both
my parents' wishes come true?

180
00:10:36,175 --> 00:10:38,131
Shin Ji Hyun is incredible.

181
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:39,711
Unni!

182
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:50,988
Why are you outside?

183
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:54,122
You would be waiting for me
here every day,

184
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:57,116
yet I never once paid
attention to you.

185
00:11:57,534 --> 00:11:58,949
Of course.

186
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:01,264
Because you couldn't see me.

187
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:04,385
Let's go.

188
00:12:16,524 --> 00:12:19,303
They're so much more delicious
than the ones I make.

189
00:12:29,795 --> 00:12:34,318
Even though I'm fine on my own,
I really want to stay by your side.

190
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:36,628
Is this the time to be
worrying about me?

191
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:37,826
Unni...

192
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:39,943
I'm willing to bet that

193
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,786
soon there will be lots of good people
appearing by your side.

194
00:12:47,871 --> 00:12:49,209
<i>Hey, Kang!</i>

195
00:12:49,455 --> 00:12:50,581
Kang!

196
00:12:51,985 --> 00:12:53,513
Ji Hyun's come.

197
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:55,518
Ji Hyun's here?

198
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:13,562
Hey, Shin Ji Hyun.

199
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:17,145
You should be at the hospital.
What are you doing here?

200
00:13:20,824 --> 00:13:22,700
I've escaped from the hospital.

201
00:13:22,798 --> 00:13:24,809
I want to go somewhere with you.

202
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:26,658
Where?

203
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:32,504
I've never once made kimbap to eat
with a boyfriend on a picnic.

204
00:13:33,357 --> 00:13:36,253
Since when did I become
your boyfriend?

205
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:38,862
Ah... that's not what I meant.

206
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:41,459
Look at you twisting
your words.

207
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:44,887
Hey! If you like me,
then just say so.

208
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,560
Ah, I've forgotten my mp3.

209
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,099
Do you have an mp3?

210
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:50,805
For what?

211
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,208
It's a necessary item
for any picnic.

212
00:13:53,276 --> 00:13:55,469
You're borrowing a rug,
an mp3 player,

213
00:13:55,593 --> 00:13:56,539
and even my car.

214
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:58,340
What will you ask to
borrow next?

215
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:00,226
You.

216
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:02,341
What?

217
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:04,789
Han Kang,

218
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:06,869
can I borrow you for a day

219
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:08,968
as my boyfriend?

220
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:17,609
Are you unwilling?

221
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:19,432
Then you too...

222
00:14:21,038 --> 00:14:23,168
must let me
borrow you for a day,

223
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:25,156
as my girlfriend.

224
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:32,742
Ta-da! Shin Ji Hyun's
signature kimbap is revealed!

225
00:14:33,097 --> 00:14:34,654
Did you make these?

226
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:38,059
Before I woke up, I heard
that you took care of my parents.

227
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:40,237
This is a thank you present.

228
00:14:43,777 --> 00:14:44,810
How is it?

229
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:46,752
What kind of taste is this?

230
00:14:47,757 --> 00:14:49,921
The spinach
isn't bad though.

231
00:14:50,277 --> 00:14:50,988
It doesn't taste good?

232
00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:52,993
If it didn't, would I eat it?

233
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:00,791
<i>So,</i>

234
00:15:00,848 --> 00:15:03,586
this is Shin Ji Hyun's
signature kimbap, right?

235
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,277
Hey!

236
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,595
<i>Stop taking pictures.</i>

237
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,807
Who is this handsome fellow?

238
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,485
Whoever's daughter this is...

239
00:15:38,528 --> 00:15:39,507
Quite cute, huh?

240
00:15:39,608 --> 00:15:41,303
Quite ugly.

241
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:44,853
Take a look at you with your
mouth full of kimbap.

242
00:15:45,048 --> 00:15:47,109
Hey! Give it to me.

243
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:48,965
<i>Give it to me!</i>

244
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:51,449
Taking my picture without
asking me first

245
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,002
and then not letting me
see them.

246
00:15:57,512 --> 00:15:59,183
Ah... this...

247
00:15:59,555 --> 00:16:01,750
So it was you who had
it all along?

248
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,694
Anyways...

249
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,050
<i>this...</i>

250
00:16:08,437 --> 00:16:10,858
your mother gave this to me.

251
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:16,726
Since you don't seem to
hate me now, I'll tell you about it.

252
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:18,758
Actually...

253
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:21,764
your mother and I had
a good relationship which

254
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:23,363
<i>you didn't know about.</i>

255
00:16:23,677 --> 00:16:26,129
You're saying that you were
close to my mother?

256
00:16:33,565 --> 00:16:36,956
It makes me happy to see you
eating so heartily, Ji Hyun.

257
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:39,603
Didn't you say that Kang
doesn't eat these foods?

258
00:16:39,728 --> 00:16:41,840
The why make it every day?

259
00:16:41,928 --> 00:16:44,745
That's because I wasn't able to
take proper care of him,

260
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:47,598
so I want him to at least
eat some of this.

261
00:16:49,902 --> 00:16:52,865
Why does Han Kang hate
you so much?

262
00:16:53,518 --> 00:16:57,450
Because I would never give Kang
the answers he demands.

263
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:58,777
Why?

264
00:16:58,868 --> 00:17:00,569
When you love someone,

265
00:17:00,627 --> 00:17:04,099
even if you are misunderstood
there are some things you cannot say.

266
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:08,090
This is... a way to minimize the pain
that Kang will suffer.

267
00:17:09,749 --> 00:17:12,393
When you really love someone,

268
00:17:12,546 --> 00:17:15,609
even if you are misunderstood
you cannot explain.

269
00:17:16,316 --> 00:17:18,703
I would rather
be misunderstood

270
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:21,964
than knowingly inflict
pain on him.

271
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,558
I remember someone once said

272
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,578
that love is letting
someone misunderstand you.

273
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:33,561
Because, that would cause
them less pain.

274
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:37,084
It must be like that when
you love someone so much.

275
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,689
<i>So she was relaying
my mother's words to me.</i>

276
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,609
I now understand

277
00:17:47,754 --> 00:17:51,324
your mother's words and
her intention.

278
00:17:52,884 --> 00:17:54,217
Yes.

279
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:56,866
Hiding the feelings
in your heart,

280
00:17:57,267 --> 00:18:00,902
is even more painful than not
knowing how you feel.

281
00:18:08,624 --> 00:18:10,534
<i>Hiding the feelings
in your heart,</i>

282
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:12,666
is more painful than

283
00:18:13,006 --> 00:18:14,926
not knowing how you feel.

284
00:18:17,261 --> 00:18:19,209
Why would you come to
my house when...

285
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,753
I wasn't even home.

286
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:25,188
Seeing that you never were,
I befriended your mother instead.

287
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:37,670
What are we doing here?

288
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:40,546
I heard that...

289
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:42,620
if you toss a coin and
make a wish,

290
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:44,494
your dreams will come true.

291
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:49,207
Really? That's perfect then.
I have a wish.

292
00:18:51,891 --> 00:18:53,722
Here.

293
00:19:15,456 --> 00:19:17,125
Ji Hyun...

294
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:20,553
didn't want me to
tell you this.

295
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:24,338
She's had a hard time and
it's been quite lonely for her.

296
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,470
And now again...

297
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:31,950
I feel bad for those she's leaving behind
that she has to suffer alone.

298
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:36,970
<i>Ji Hyun wishes for you to
let her go.</i>

299
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,225
Although it's difficult for you,

300
00:19:41,164 --> 00:19:44,557
I felt that you should know.

301
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:47,216
<i>I...</i>

302
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:49,925
need you to...

303
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:52,132
understand her heart.

304
00:19:54,324 --> 00:19:56,947
What I had hoped for most,

305
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:00,662
was for Ji Hyun to live.

306
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:03,922
Must it be like this?

307
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,948
Even if we never see
each other again,

308
00:20:07,144 --> 00:20:09,677
I just want her to live.

309
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:16,745
<i>{\a6}It is okay for you to come back</i>

310
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,485
<i>{\a6}It is okay for you to come back</i>

311
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,952
<i>{\a6}I love you, I still do</i>

312
00:20:25,036 --> 00:20:27,881
<i>{\a6}Please, please</i>

313
00:20:28,324 --> 00:20:32,377
<i>Please allow Ji Hyun to
continue living by my side.</i>

314
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:37,005
<i>Please allow Han Kang
to forget me.</i>

315
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,815
Open your eyes.

316
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,380
Yes.

317
00:20:47,477 --> 00:20:50,965
<i>{\a6}It is okay for you to come back</i>

318
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:55,304
<i>{\a6}I love you, I still do</i>

319
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:58,718
<i>{\a6}Please, please</i>

320
00:20:58,873 --> 00:21:02,539
<i>{\a6}Nothing has happened</i>

321
00:21:02,648 --> 00:21:04,505
<i>{\a6}Nothing has happened...</i>

322
00:21:04,684 --> 00:21:06,721
Yes. You've done well.

323
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:09,775
Han Kang, you did well.

324
00:21:10,524 --> 00:21:13,021
But why do I feel so restless?

325
00:21:14,712 --> 00:21:16,369
Ah, so refreshing.

326
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:19,869
Aigoo, why not simply wash
when it's so tiring to take a shower?

327
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:21,781
It's not tiring at all.

328
00:21:21,986 --> 00:21:25,208
Today, I feel very cheerful,
very happy.

329
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:30,088
Who did you spend the day with
that you've reached such a degree of happiness?

330
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:32,792
Dad, you're back so early.

331
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,099
- Dad!
- Yes.

332
00:21:35,146 --> 00:21:37,910
Shall I tell you what has
made me so happy?

333
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:39,904
Tell me.

334
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:44,054
I'm very happy to be born
as your daughter.

335
00:21:44,443 --> 00:21:47,153
Aigoo. Is that so?!

336
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:50,007
You two are
isolating me again, right?

337
00:21:50,164 --> 00:21:52,582
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

338
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:56,244
Mom!

339
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,063
I'm very happy to be born
as your daughter.

340
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:02,044
Ah! Really?

341
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:06,930
I have lived a very happy life.

342
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,562
<i>What is it?
What's wrong, Ji Hyun?</i>

343
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,634
<i>- Ji Hyun!
- Ji Hyun!</i>

344
00:22:23,229 --> 00:22:24,409
<i>Ji Hyun!</i>

345
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:26,660
<i>- What's wrong with her?</i>
- Ji Hyun!

346
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:28,210
Ji Hyun!

347
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,123
<i>Honey! Honey!</i>

348
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:30,170
Doctor Cho!

349
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:32,048
Call Doctor Cho!

350
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,462
Were you waiting for me here
all this time?

351
00:23:13,246 --> 00:23:14,836
It's been...

352
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:17,041
really...

353
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,953
really difficult for you.

354
00:23:21,118 --> 00:23:22,628
<i>Ji Hyun!</i>

355
00:23:22,843 --> 00:23:24,931
<i>Ji Hyun!</i>

356
00:23:25,561 --> 00:23:28,128
Ji Hyun!

357
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:30,255
Ji Hyun!

358
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:36,632
Let's hurry and go.

359
00:23:37,194 --> 00:23:38,822
Follow me.

360
00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:45,827
<i>Ji Hyun...</i>

361
00:26:17,182 --> 00:26:19,302
It was a ruptured

00:41:38,741 --> 00:41:40,231
<i>Yes, Yi Kyung.</i>

542
00:41:40,294 --> 00:41:42,764
Please, let us confirm it.

543
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:56,144
Ji Hyun was always wanting
to have the same things as her sister.

544
00:41:56,462 --> 00:41:58,283
Ji Hyun was the sun and
Ji Min was the star,

545
00:41:58,361 --> 00:42:00,624
that's how I differentiated
their things.

546
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,579
Ji Min loved stars very much.

547
00:42:21,462 --> 00:42:22,472
<i>This...</i>

548
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,409
looks like a drawn star.

549
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:26,699
I must have drawn it.

550
00:42:27,346 --> 00:42:29,559
You did draw it.

551
00:42:35,354 --> 00:42:38,143
And this was embroidered by me.

552
00:42:41,264 --> 00:42:43,281
Heavens.

553
00:42:44,274 --> 00:42:46,647
You're still alive?

554
00:42:49,141 --> 00:42:51,986
Our Ji Min's still alive.

555
00:43:12,797 --> 00:43:14,906
At least three drops
of 100 percent pure tears.

556
00:43:14,973 --> 00:43:17,619
You can't count family
or blood type.

557
00:43:19,926 --> 00:43:22,055
Yi Kyung is...

558
00:43:22,377 --> 00:43:24,775
Shin Ji Hyun's sister.

559
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:31,534
Then...

560
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:35,376
from whom did my

561
00:43:35,422 --> 00:43:36,596
two tears come from?

562
00:43:36,664 --> 00:43:38,473
Now that it's time to leave,
you want to know?

563
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:41,051
Since there's no way to
go back now,

564
00:43:41,301 --> 00:43:43,121
I want to know before I leave.

565
00:43:43,446 --> 00:43:45,296
The 1st tear was from Kang

566
00:43:45,386 --> 00:43:48,510
and the other 2 were from
Seo Woo and Yoo Kyung, right?

567
00:43:51,064 --> 00:43:53,404
You're right about
Park Seo Woo,

568
00:43:54,074 --> 00:43:56,436
but not Song Yi Kyung.

569
00:43:57,694 --> 00:43:58,784
Then...

570
00:43:58,906 --> 00:44:00,554
who was it?

571
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,411
<i>Shin In Jung.</i>

572
00:44:09,556 --> 00:44:11,046
What's the matter?

573
00:44:11,764 --> 00:44:14,142
What are you trying to
do right now?

574
00:44:18,438 --> 00:44:20,721
Shin In Jung, no.

575
00:44:20,777 --> 00:44:21,866
In Jung.

576
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:24,524
Don't do this. Don't do this!

577
00:44:56,156 --> 00:44:58,564
What am I doing here?

578
00:45:00,466 --> 00:45:02,147
What am I doing?

579
00:45:04,506 --> 00:45:06,422
Heavens,

580
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,709
how could I...

581
00:45:16,194 --> 00:45:18,214
Ji Hyun...

582
00:45:19,034 --> 00:45:21,871
<i>What am I trying to do
right now?</i>

583
00:45:24,474 --> 00:45:27,363
What exactly am I doing?

584
00:45:27,888 --> 00:45:30,044
<i>How could I...</i>

585
00:45:31,951 --> 00:45:35,044
This isn't what I wanted.

586
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:39,780
Here.

587
00:45:40,756 --> 00:45:42,496
Wipe your hands and face.

588
00:45:42,857 --> 00:45:44,081
And your lips.

589
00:45:44,127 --> 00:45:45,196
Disconnect Ji Hyun's
life-support.

590
00:45:45,241 --> 00:45:47,545
From this moment on
we're over.

591
00:45:48,366 --> 00:45:50,400
It was me.

592
00:45:52,061 --> 00:45:54,662
It wasn't because of you

593
00:45:55,899 --> 00:45:58,615
but because of me.

594
00:46:00,034 --> 00:46:03,506
It was because my thoughts went askew
that I became jealous of you.

595
00:46:04,444 --> 00:46:07,181
Allowing oppa
to approach you,

596
00:46:07,814 --> 00:46:10,024
<i>and causing you to fall
into this state.</i>

597
00:46:10,347 --> 00:46:12,968
Throwing away
Seo Woo's friendship...

598
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:17,119
was my destruction.

599
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:22,104
This was all because of me.

600
00:46:31,978 --> 00:46:33,770
Ji Hyun...

601
00:46:36,218 --> 00:46:38,454
I was wrong.

602
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:41,075
<i>I was...</i>

603
00:46:43,491 --> 00:46:45,914
I did you wrong.

604
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,533
<i>Ji Hyun...</i>

605
00:47:06,161 --> 00:47:07,906
I'm sorry.

606
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,352
Shin In Jung!

607
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:34,459
I...

608
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:36,764
went to remove
Ji Hyun's oxygen mask.

609
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,568
Are you insane?

610
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,509
Just because a crazy guy like me
said to do it, why would you?

611
00:47:41,577 --> 00:47:43,202
I didn't.

612
00:47:44,468 --> 00:47:47,300
You never really wanted me to.

613
00:47:47,954 --> 00:47:51,519
<i>It was because you were
scared and suffering.</i>

614
00:47:53,109 --> 00:47:56,006
I wasn't clear-headed either.

615
00:47:57,056 --> 00:47:58,965
Because I can't love...

616
00:47:59,649 --> 00:48:02,687
I also have no way to
strip away my hatred of Ji Hyun.

617
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:05,332
<i>Oppa, let's not...</i>

618
00:48:06,081 --> 00:48:08,386
do such foolish things again.

619
00:48:08,582 --> 00:48:09,598
Let's stop.

620
00:48:09,644 --> 00:48:10,785
No...

621
00:48:11,129 --> 00:48:12,009
we must stop.

622
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,055
I told you before to
stay out of this.

623
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,917
I gave you money to leave.
Why didn't you?!

624
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:20,127
Oppa, after you found out
Ji Hyun's father had a brain tumor,

625
00:48:20,232 --> 00:48:22,592
you didn't file for bankruptcy.

626
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,879
Why did you do this?

627
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:28,550
You had no idea when
Ji Hyun's father might pass away,

628
00:48:29,048 --> 00:48:32,526
and because you couldn't watch him
see his company collapse, you did this.

629
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,554
I did that to get the Will.

630
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,154
As long as they

631
00:48:36,502 --> 00:48:39,637
declared bankruptcy
there was no need for a Will.

632
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:41,529
<i>Yet oppa,</i>

633
00:48:41,578 --> 00:48:44,110
you used threats against
Director Jung

634
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:47,149
and delayed the
bankruptcy process.

635
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,949
Why did you do this?

636
00:48:55,518 --> 00:48:58,411
It was only to show some care
for President Shin.

637
00:48:58,994 --> 00:49:01,777
He stubbornly refused to
have the operation,

638
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,389
even though he faced
imminent death.

639
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:05,625
It was because
you felt apologetic.

640
00:49:05,674 --> 00:49:08,944
<i>Within half a year, you developed
a relationship with Ji Hyun's parents.</i>

641
00:49:09,144 --> 00:49:12,434
The trust they placed in you
allowed your heart to be at peace.

642
00:49:12,632 --> 00:49:14,351
That's why you hesitated.

643
00:49:14,376 --> 00:49:15,595
I regret that hesitation.

644
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,874
Please stop saying things
you don't mean.

645
00:49:18,074 --> 00:49:19,822
I will never let it go.

646
00:49:20,194 --> 00:49:22,431
Even if I am
completely destroyed...

647
00:49:22,804 --> 00:49:24,552
I will continue.

648
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,009
Didn't Jin Young give you an
envelope, mother?

649
00:49:34,106 --> 00:49:35,855
I don't know. I don't know, brat!

650
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,820
I don't know, brat!

651
00:49:38,122 --> 00:49:39,842
Even if I know, I can't tell!

652
00:49:40,044 --> 00:49:41,334
Mother,

653
00:49:41,426 --> 00:49:43,289
if you love oppa,

654
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:46,068
then you must give me
that envelope.

655
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:49,533
Only that way can he
live decently.

656
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:51,439
Mother...

657
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,090
please!

658
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,491
Oppa is destroying himself.

659
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,714
<i>Mother, your beloved son,
Kang Min Ho...</i>

660
00:49:59,274 --> 00:50:01,104
has now become...

661
00:50:01,348 --> 00:50:04,760
someone even worse than
his own father!

662
00:50:10,431 --> 00:50:11,959
Please send it express.

663
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,311
[ To : The Chief Central Attorney's Office ]

664
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,669
<i>Ji Hyun...</i>

665
00:50:23,134 --> 00:50:26,039
<i>I really want to turn back
the hands of the clock.</i>

666
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:31,519
<i>To not misunderstand
the naive intentions of your heart.</i>

667
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:35,228
<i>To give you...</i>

668
00:50:35,668 --> 00:50:38,698
<i>100 percent of my heart.</i>

669
00:50:39,288 --> 00:50:41,907
<i>I really want to go back.</i>

670
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:46,315
<i>To when we were looking
at each other...</i>

671
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:49,909
<i>To those days filled with laughter.</i>

672
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,682
The 3rd tear...

673
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,399
is Shin In Jung's.

674
00:51:07,306 --> 00:51:09,332
In Jung's?

675
00:51:11,126 --> 00:51:13,646
I thought it was Yi Kyung's.

676
00:51:14,254 --> 00:51:16,548
I never thought
it could be In Jung.

677
00:51:17,146 --> 00:51:18,703
That silly girl.

678
00:51:19,124 --> 00:51:21,429
I knew her feelings were genuine.

679
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:48,683
<i>Ji Hyun...</i>

680
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,904
Ji Hyun...

681
00:51:55,936 --> 00:51:58,959
How can you be my
little sister?

682
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,246
If I had known...

683
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:06,802
I could have recognized
you sooner.

684
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,657
I would have allowed you
to use my body more.

685
00:52:15,534 --> 00:52:17,847
So what sunbae meant...

686
00:52:19,024 --> 00:52:20,774
was this?

687
00:52:22,928 --> 00:52:25,610
Huh? Oh? So it's like that?

688
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:28,525
Why didn't I ever confirm it?

689
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,659
Then...

690
00:52:32,551 --> 00:52:34,167
I can see Yi Kyung tomorrow?

691
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,702
However...

692
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:41,057
you must first finish dealing with
traveller Shin Ji Hyun's case.

693
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,210
Of course I will.

694
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,195
No need to worry.

695
00:52:47,268 --> 00:52:48,715
Also...

696
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:51,394
your heart has
still not changed?

697
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:53,814
Resolving the misunderstanding,
giving her the ring...

698
00:52:53,999 --> 00:52:56,165
confirming your love.

699
00:52:56,586 --> 00:52:59,056
To those that are
left behind that wish...

700
00:52:59,094 --> 00:53:00,211
means nothing.

701
00:53:00,284 --> 00:53:01,523
Are you crazy?

702
00:53:01,524 --> 00:53:04,805
Five years of living this way
is enough to drive me insane.

703
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:06,891
As if.

704
00:53:06,988 --> 00:53:11,706
Don't young people only know of love
and think that love is all?

705
00:53:12,075 --> 00:53:13,450
Sunbae...!

706
00:53:13,792 --> 00:53:16,366
You'd purposely allowed the
recover my memory ahead of time...

707
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,820
You allowed me to see how
Yi Kyung lived...

708
00:53:18,968 --> 00:53:21,686
Just so that I would
change my wish and my feelings.

709
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:24,119
Ah, seriously?!

710
00:53:25,758 --> 00:53:29,536
The gears in your head aren't
spinning at the typical rate.

711
00:53:30,326 --> 00:53:32,038
You wanted me to help repair...

712
00:53:32,139 --> 00:53:35,182
the bond between
Shin Ji Hyun and Yi Kyung?

713
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:37,602
There's a reason for
that too, right?

714
00:53:37,658 --> 00:53:39,708
If it weren't for Shin Ji Hyun,

715
00:53:39,896 --> 00:53:41,832
would Song Yi Kyung
still love the you

716
00:53:42,096 --> 00:53:44,732
who would appear
5 years later?

717
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:48,715
Upon seeing you, her heart would have
frozen and then said goodbye.

718
00:53:49,448 --> 00:53:51,425
Hey...

719
00:53:51,727 --> 00:53:53,927
Besides that,

720
00:53:54,063 --> 00:53:56,291
there should still be
another reason.

721

to start from the bottom.
