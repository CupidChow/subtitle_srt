Episode 9

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,300
What? What's the matter?

5
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:18,400
I'll just ask one thing.
Song, why are you here?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,600
That? I said it yesterday.

7
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:25,100
If you're staying here because of
your interest in Kang Min Ho, then say it.

8
00:00:25,101 --> 00:00:27,600
And this will be the end.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,400
If it's not, then stop doing this here!

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,200
Wait. Wait. Wait!

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,200
My hand hurts.

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,700
Why did you just suddenly
drag me out like this?

13
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:01,000
You, seriously.

14
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:03,100
You won't leave when I tell you to,
and now you burnt your hand.

15
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:05,000
Great.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,700
What? You still want to stay here?

17
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:12,400
<i>- What should I do?
- You definitely cannot!</i>

18
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:15,400
Even if I die, I won't leave you
at Kang Min Ho's house.

19
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,800
What I mean is, I definitely can't let you
stay by my friend's fiance's side.

20
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,800
Kang.

21
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,800
Do you really want to stay here?

22
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,500
I'm asking you.

23
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,700
Humans have conscience.
Where do you think this is?

24
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:50,500
When I offered you the job again,

25
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,100
you should've been deeply
grateful and came with me.

26
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:55,000
What have you done right?
You're still stubborn?

27
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,700
Please take care of me again.

28
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:43,400
Good thing you came back.

29
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,300
Thank you!

30
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,500
Don't try to act smart. Just work hard.

31
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,100
Oh, don't let Song do the dishes.

32
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,100
You're so lucky.

33
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:09,700
What did you say to the President
for him to give your job back?

34
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:13,100
It looked like the President
dragged Yi Kyung here.

35
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:15,100
Look at her apron!

36
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:17,600
Did the President go find you?

37
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:21,400
Ah, well?
Give that to me.

38
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,100
Now you feel at ease, right?

39
00:03:37,101 --> 00:03:38,500
Pretty at ease.

40
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:39,600
That's good.

41
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:41,800
Oh really?

42
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:45,600
Ahjussi, why do you think I'm like this?

43
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,500
I can feel Ji Hyun's vibe from her.
Is that normal?

44
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,400
What do you mean by that?

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Get to work. Work!

46
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:00,500
Okay.

47
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,500
She always pretends I'm her friend.

48
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:07,500
What you mean is that
you can never refrain from smiling?

49
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:09,200
Am I crazy?

50
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,300
Who knows.
Only time will tell.

51
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,700
What is this?

52
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,900
Yi Kyung.

53
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,000
What happened?

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
[Secretary Shin]

55
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,100
In Jung.

56
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:30,000
It seems that the President came to work
to learn about the financial affairs.

57
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:32,900
What did he say to you? Why did he come?

58
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,600
That's what he said to me too.

59
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:39,900
He clearly has you. Why would he personally
come to ask about company matters?

60
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,500
Maybe he's becoming aware
of what's happening?

61
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,000
It's not like that.
Don't worry about anything.

62
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:49,000
There's something urgent that I
have to deal with right now.

63
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:51,000
Talk to you later.

64
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,300
What's more urgent than this?

65
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,900
[Seo Woo]

66
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,400
Kang, you know where Song Yi Kyung
lives, right? Give me her address.

67
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:20,700
She's not picking up her phone.
I'm afraid something happened to her.

68
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:23,000
She suddenly disappeared from my house.

69
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,700
You didn't see the text I sent you?

70
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:26,000
Text?

71
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,300
<i>I took Song Yi Kyung away.</i>

72
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,000
- You said you took her away?
- Let's go talk inside, Hyung.

73
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,700
Please enjoy.

74
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
The house was in a mess,
and she wasn't there.

75
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:02,500
Of course I would assume that something happened!

76
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:03,800
What exactly are you trying to do?

77
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:06,400
Did you take her away or
did you forcefully drag her here?

78
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:08,800
I can be impulsive once in awhile.

79
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,500
Why were you impulsive? Why?

80
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:15,400
This isn't something that you
should be impulsive for.

81
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:19,500
And this definitely isn't
something you did for Ji Hyun.

82
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:20,700
It's for Song Yi Kyung, right?

83
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:23,500
You were able to meet
Song Yi Kyung because of me.

84
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:26,900
At the very least, I have this amount of
responsibility for Ji Hyun.

85
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,100
Out of everything,

86
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:32,500
the most important thing is that you
are Ji Hyun's fiance. Are you not?

87
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:34,400
Not anymore.

88
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:36,000
You're not?

89
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:40,700
Kang, I look towards the future.

90
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:42,800
I'm a very realistic person.

91
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,500
What do you mean by that?

92
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:47,200
Towards a person
I can't be with in the future,

93
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,800
I don't believe I can continue to love her.

94
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,200
Hyung, have you given up on Ji Hyun already?

95
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:55,000
Hey, punk!

96
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:57,500
Is this a situation where
I can choose to give up or not?

97
00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:58,700
Even if it turns out like that, but Hyung?

98
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:01,700
Do you not know how I lived in the past?

99
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:02,800
A world where I don't
give up on hopeless Ji Hyun.

100
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:06,500
I've never lived in a world that is
sincere and persists on without regret.

101
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:08,300
Did I never say that?

102
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:11,500
Why is there a word called hope?
I often beg to differ.

103
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:13,000
Even if it's like that. But, Hyung!

104
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,500
How long has it been
since Ji Hyun's accident?

105
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:17,000
Then, how much longer do you want me to wait?

106
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:18,400
If it were you,
would you wait for a year?

107
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:20,400
Or would you wait for Ji Hyun for 10 years?

108
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:22,100
Being noble and kind?

109
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,700
Would that be a person with a conscience?

110
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:29,100
I just think, how can a person break it
off whenever they want so easily?

111
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:35,400
Simply giving up as you please.
Can you give her up that way?

112
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:37,300
I'm that kind of person.

113
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:42,500
During the time when I can
love, I'll love when I want.

114
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,800
I don't intensely wish
that you'd understand.

115
00:08:47,801 --> 00:08:50,100
But of course, I'll decline your reproach.

116
00:08:50,101 --> 00:08:53,500
Ah, starting from now, I will also
refuse to be Ji Hyun's guardian.

117
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:55,900
So that's why you were so
solicitous to Song Yi Kyung?

118
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:58,200
I said, it's not that.

119
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:01,800
It's because she's a woman you fired and
means nothing to you, so I helped her out.

120
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:05,000
You already brought her back
and everything's back to before.

121
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:07,500
It's pretty relaxed right now.

122
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,500
Your friends came and
are asking for you to go upstairs.

123
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,000
Good thing we left
the cake and the present here.

124
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:23,600
So in the future, listen to me well.

125
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,300
You guys came.

126
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:28,700
Kang, where did you go in such a hurry?

127
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,800
Min Ho came too?

128
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,000
I came over because it's Kang's birthday.

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,800
I didn't see you at
the company, but we meet here.

130
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:44,700
<i>Right now I have something
urgent, so I have to leave.</i>

131
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,900
Hey, why did you even prepare presents?

132
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:49,500
How did you guys know that it's my birthday?

133
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:53,100
Seo Woo already knew
your birthday from last time.

134
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,400
- Hey. Let's eat the cake first!
- What cake?

135
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:02,100
- Let's go eat downstairs.
- Hey, what are you saying?

136
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,800
Birthdays are very important days.

137
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:09,100
Be thankful to yourself, and you also
have to accept your friend's blessings.

138
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:19,800
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

139
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:23,700
<i>Happy birthday, dear Han Kang.</i>

140
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:27,400
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

141
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,300
Han Kang, happy birthday.

142
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,100
These kinds of events are quite awkward.

143
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:42,400
Anyway, thank you for
celebrating my birthday.

144
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,200
Have you eaten seaweed soup yet?

145
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:45,100
Yes.

146
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:46,800
Who made it for you?

147
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:48,700
Someone made it for me.

148
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,900
Hello!

149
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:55,700
Long time no see, Seo Woo.

150
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:58,800
We see each other often.
I can see you everywhere.

151
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,100
See me everywhere?
The two of you met somewhere before?

152
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,700
I just borrowed this for a little while.

153
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,600
That's my thermos.

154
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,900
Why is it in Song Yi Kyung's possession?

155
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,800
You can ask Shin In Jung about it.

156
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,100
Did you lend it to her?

157
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,900
- It's nothing.
- You didn't lend it?

158
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,700
What is it? You're making it seem like
the thermos is holding some secrets.

159
00:11:30,701 --> 00:11:32,300
What secrets?

160
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:34,900
The story behind this thermos?

161
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,000
Please have a talk with me.

162
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:39,200
- Why?
- Just a few words.

163
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,600
What's with In Jung all of a sudden?

164
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:57,300
She's very mysterious in her dating.
Are there other secrets too?

165
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:58,500
In Jung said that she's dating?

166
00:11:58,501 --> 00:12:01,800
Yes, she said that there's someone she likes.

167
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:04,000
But she wouldn't tell me who it is.

168
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:11,000
Why? Why can't I that we met
each other at Min Ho's house?

169
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,800
You don't need to know the reason.

170
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Not telling me the reason,
you're just telling me to shut up?

171
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,600
It's because of something. Please.

172
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,800
You're only making it harder to understand.

173
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:25,100
Miss Shin In Jung, you're a secretary.

174
00:12:25,101 --> 00:12:27,800
Didn't you say that it was
an errand from the President's wife?

175
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:30,000
Why can't I say anything?

176
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:34,000
Plus, Mr. Kang Min Ho is your friend's fiance.

177
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:36,200
Everybody knows that.

178
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:39,100
I got it!

179
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,700
It wasn't an errand, right?

180
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,400
It was an errand.

181
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:47,100
Looks like he's not your friend's fiance.

182
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,600
I know now. I understand now.

183
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:54,400
The reason why you don't want me to say it.

184
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:56,500
Miss Song Yi Kyung.

185
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Please don't make wild guesses.

186
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:01,100
But didn't you do that already?

187
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:04,100
Who are you? Why
were you at my man's house?

188
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:07,400
When did I do that?
When did I say that?

189
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:09,500
Does it only count if you say it out loud?

190
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:11,500
Your expressions can speak too.

191
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,100
- Hey, there.
- I got it.

192
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:16,900
The fact is that Miss Shin In Jung
is Kang Min Ho's girlfriend.

193
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:19,400
- I won't tell anyone.
- I said, it's not like that!

194
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:21,900
Okay, just pretend it's not.

195
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:25,600
It definitely, definitely, definitely, is not.

196
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,100
Miss Song Yi Kyung.

197
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,200
What are you two doing?

198
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,000
The food is ready.
Everybody's waiting for you.

199
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Really?

200
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,200
It's a secret between us two women.
It's nothing.

201
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,200
Go home.

202
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:21,500
Start work tomorrow.
Why are you not leaving?

203
00:14:21,501 --> 00:14:23,500
There's a call from Yoon Ji Sun.

204
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:28,200
- I already said, there's a call from Yoon Ji Sun!
- Then, I'm going!

205
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
What kind of ringtone is that?

206
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,200
Ji Sun! What's the matter?

207
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,300
Really? They're going to
have a get-together?

208
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,100
What time? Where?

209
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,000
You're really not going to spill it?

210
00:14:51,001 --> 00:14:52,800
What exactly did you say to Song Yi Kyung?
What did you talk about?

211
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:54,900
It's nothing.

212
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,600
The person you're dating
is someone Yi Kyung knows, right?

213
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,600
Is it Song Yi Kyung's brother?

214
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,000
What?

215
00:15:07,001 --> 00:15:10,800
My thermos passed from
your hands to Song Yi Kyung's hands.

216
00:15:10,801 --> 00:15:12,800
You also said that you didn't lend it to her.

217
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:14,500
Then, doesn't this explain it?

218
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:15,600
No.

219
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,700
Then, why won't you say it?
It's just over this thermos.

220
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,000
That girl! It can't be that
she's dating a married man, right?

221
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,300
<i>Come to the park by your house.</i>

222
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,800
This is close to my house, Oppa.

223
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,600
What if someone sees us?
Why didn't you stay in the car?

224
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,300
It's saying that,

225
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:03,300
our relationship still isn't something
that can be discovered by others.

226
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,900
The fresh air at night is so nice.
I didn't want to hide in the car.

227
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:10,800
Whether Song Yi Kyung
discovered our relationship or not...

228
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:13,300
Didn't you come because
you're curious of that?

229
00:16:13,301 --> 00:16:16,100
What's the big deal if
a woman like that knows about it.

230
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,500
It's not like it's Kang or Seo Woo.

231
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:20,200
I actually wish that they know.

232
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,200
Right now, I really want
to see you comfortably.

233
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,500
I want to live just like ordinary lovers.

234
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:31,500
Until this matter ends,
we can't live as ordinary lovers.

235
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:34,500
- Didn't we come to an understanding?
- Hasn't it ended now?

236
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:38,300
Even if we let Ji Hyun's father know of our
relationship, what can he say about it?

237
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,300
Can he snatch away Haemido
from your hands?

238
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:41,900
Or can he prevent the Shin's bankruptcy?

239
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,300
I can understand your feelings right now.

240
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:45,500
But don't say things against your will.

241
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:47,800
This isn't against my will.

242
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,900
You wouldn't understand me.

243
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:53,800
I know it was you who called
Kang to come to my house.

244
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:58,000
- That's right. I asked him to go.
- I also know why you want him to go.

245
00:16:58,001 --> 00:17:02,500
That's right. I hate that woman
staying at your house for even an instant.

246
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:04,700
I hate it when I'm afraid
and say I'm the secretary,

247
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:07,800
in front of the woman
who entered my man's house.

248
00:17:07,801 --> 00:17:09,300
I'm sorry.

249
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,900
I'm sorry about letting
Song Yi Kyung into my house.

250
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:16,000
That's a very cruel thing to do to you.

251
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:22,300
So Song Yi Kyung saw you,
and knew of our relationship.

252
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't have anything to say to you either.

253
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,600
We've gotten along for this long.

254
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:30,800
In the end, that type of
woman made you waver.

255
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:33,400
Song Yi Kyung doesn't know.

256
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,000
I made up an adequate lie.

257
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:56,800
When Kang dragged me out,
my mood became calm.

258
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,500
I had to work very hard
at Kang Min Ho's place.

259
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:04,000
So that was why I followed him out.

260
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,000
I know that he has a secret safe.
Now, I have to think of ways to open it.

261
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,300
My friend also gave me a call.

262
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:16,000
There will be three people coming.
I can get at least one drop, right?

263
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,000
If I have good luck, maybe even 2 drops.

264
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,600
No, I shouldn't set my hopes too high.

265
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,100
It's such fortune that I have you, Unnie.

266
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:31,000
Even though you can't hear me,

267
00:18:31,001 --> 00:18:34,000
but being able to look at someone
while speaking is already good enough.

268
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,900
I really hope that Unnie can cheer up.

269
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,400
Song Yi Soo.

270
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,700
Although the scheduler
won't help me find him, I will.

271
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,900
Dad, we just got engaged yesterday.

272
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:05,800
You want us to get married
within a fortnight?

273
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:07,900
I told you I didn't think it all through.

274
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:10,500
I should have thrown you
a wedding, not an engagement.

275
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:14,500
Originally, he planned to undergo
the operation 2 days after the wedding.

276
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:16,900
But now, he's stubbornly saying,

277
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:20,100
that he won't undergo
the surgery until Ji Hyun wakes up.

278
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:23,600
Looking at Ji Hyun from
a medical point of view,

279
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:25,500
the chance of her waking up is low.

280
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:28,500
Then, if he doesn't accept
the operation, what will happen?

281
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,000
He won't be able to live much longer.

282
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,200
That's terrible.

283
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,800
President Shin.

284
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,000
What will?

285
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:52,300
Why are you suddenly talking about this?

286
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,700
Ji Hyun is in this state and nobody
knows what will happen in the future.

287
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,500
I was thinking of turning
over the company to him.

288
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:06,000
That's true. How are you going to pass over
the company to an unmarried Min Ho?

289
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:09,300
He can only be the son-in-law
when our daughter is here.

290
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,500
- I object.
- It's not all because of this.

291
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:17,300
All matters regarding the cooperation of
Haemido meetings are all managed by Min Ho.

292
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:20,500
He's always very knowledgeable
about our family's business.

293
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:22,800
He's just too young.

294
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,300
Are you feeling pain anywhere?

295
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,500
What pain?

296
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:35,300
No, recently you've been
throwing up frequently.

297
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:40,000
Don't think about some will.
You should get a check up first.

298
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:44,500
They say I don't get enough exercise,
and that my digestion is slower.

299
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,200
You should go back.

300
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,400
Father, you're up.

301
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,500
It's early in the morning.
What are you doing here?

302
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:10,000
Father, please accept the surgery.

303
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,700
I asked Doctor Jo.

304
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,200
Your insight is amazing.

305
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:20,500
If you heard it from Doctor Jo,
then don't try to convince me.

306
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:22,500
Keep it a secret from Ji Hyun's mom.

307
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:25,700
Father, doing this won't have
any benefit on Ji Hyun.

308
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:29,100
It's not for Ji Hyun.
It's for myself.

309
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:32,800
I'm afraid that I won't see Ji Hyun
wake up and die in the operating room.

310
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:37,500
If you continue like this, it's possible
you might leave before Ji Hyun does.

311
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,000
Just leaving my child here and not caring,

312
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,100
I can't possibly enter the operating room.

313
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:47,000
Just pretend she's still living.

314
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:49,100
You have to accept the surgery.

315
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,000
The rate of failure of the surgery is 70%.

316
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:54,100
Isn't there still a 30% chance of success?

317
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:56,000
The chance of death is 70%.

318
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:59,100
Father. You have to be strong.

319
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,100
In your current condition,
you can't go on much longer.

320
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:06,800
You can survive only by doing the surgery.

321
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,500
Good thing I still have you here.

322
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,000
I must be successful today!

323
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,500
I usually don't have many tears.

324
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:24,700
It's not like Ji Hyun's dead.

325
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,800
That's right.

326
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:31,600
Maybe it's because I'm not
dead yet, so nobody can cry.

327
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,100
Oh, Han Kang!

328
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,400
President!

329
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,000
You're back from exercising?

330
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:46,400
Try calling me that again.

331
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:47,600
- What?
- My name.

332
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:48,600
Han Kang.

333
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,100
I'm telling you to call me that again.

334
00:22:50,101 --> 00:22:52,300
You think that I'll be
afraid when you ask me?

335
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:53,800
Han Kang!

336
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,700
<i>Han Kang!</i>

337
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,500
- Where did you go to high school?
- High school?

338
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:01,900
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

339
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,300
I went to high school at Chun Cheon.

340
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,300
Why are you suddenly investigating me?

341
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,300
Let's go.

342
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,700
I'm hungry already.

343
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:19,000
- Do you like mussels?
- No.

344
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
Then, why did you make
seaweed soup with mussels?

345
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:23,500
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

346
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:25,100
Didn't you bring over
seaweed soup with mussels?

347
00:23:25,101 --> 00:23:28,400
On my birthday.
How did you know how to make that way?

348
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,500
<i>Why is he questioning me in detail?
It's as if he's suspecting me.</i>

349
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:36,200
I saw mussels at Kang Min Ho's house
and I put it in the seaweed soup.

350
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,000
That's strange.

351
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,300
Why are you always asking about this?

352
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,000
My friend and Song Yi Kyung are very similar.

353
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,400
Are you and that friend very close?

354
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,500
Didn't you risk your life in order
to protect that friend's fiance?

355
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,300
We're not close.

356
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,100
<i>That's right, not close.</i>

357
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:03,700
If you're not close, then why
do you care for her so much?

358
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:06,200
Because I owe that friend many favors.

359
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,500
<i>Owe me many favors?
What are they?</i>

360
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,400
In our country, the only place for
expanding your own islands is here.

361
00:24:24,401 --> 00:24:27,100
There are only two individual islands.
These two places.

362
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:30,500
Our Haemido completely uses
the island's central vacation resort.

363
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:32,900
Construction plan will allow family access
to the vacation resort department.

364
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:37,200
And also a place of utmost privacy.

365
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:39,800
The case with Haemido
is still going as planned, right?

366
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:41,800
The work on written verification for
the materials is almost complete.

367
00:24:41,801 --> 00:24:44,300
The approval of the business
should be no problem.

368
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:47,100
They're currently consulting
with the construction group.

369
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:49,000
The vacation resort's supplementary
facilities are developing,

370
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:51,700
in the environmental direction.

371
00:24:51,701 --> 00:24:54,000
Then there are no mistakes
with the expansion right now.

372
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,300
How's the work for the bidding?
Did you find out the other side's numbers?

373
00:24:57,301 --> 00:24:59,100
Have you checked the situation at Hyuk San?

374
00:24:59,101 --> 00:25:02,400
About Hyuk San, I heard that there
aren't high expectations for this bid.

375
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:05,000
Don't trust those twisted lies.
Don't lower your guard.

376
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:07,900
If we cannot get this,
you know it is going to cause problems.

377
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,700
Yes, President.

378
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,100
[Resignation Letter]

379
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,100
Director Jung, you came.

380
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:27,100
Is the President here?

381
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,800
He's in a meeting right now.

382
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:30,500
Then, please let him take a look at this.

383
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:34,400
If there's no problem,
then ask the witnesses to come.

384
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,400
Yes, I understand.

385
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,800
Witnesses?

386
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,300
[Will]

387
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,300
You're saying that the President
laid out my future in his will?

388
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:10,200
In it, he wrote that all of his shares
will be transferred to your name.

389
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:15,000
He's going to pass all of the
managerial authority of the company to me?

390
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:19,400
Ji Hyun's father...
Do you know why he's suddenly doing this?

391
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,700
Well...

392
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,200
You'll know when the time comes.

393
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,900
<i>Shin Woo. Ji Sun. Sun Young.</i>

394
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,700
Hello. You all are Ji Hyun's friends, right?

395
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:05,700
Miss Park Jung Eun?

396
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Yes.

397
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,700
We only know that
Ji Hyun got into a car accident,

398
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:24,500
the severity of her wounds,
and if she underwent surgery.

399
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:25,900
Oh, really?

400
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,901
<i>So that's why you guys didn't cry?</i>

401
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:30,700
There's one named In Jung.

402
00:27:30,701 --> 00:27:33,700
She's always been a very good
hometown friend of Ji Hyun's.

403
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:35,500
She told us.

404
00:27:35,501 --> 00:27:38,100
Her parents rejected
all our requests to visit,

405
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:41,200
so we weren't even
able to go to the hospital.

406
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:45,300
How sad would Ji Hyun be?

407
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:51,300
Then right now, is Ji Hyun
in a vegetative state?

408
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:53,800
They say she's almost brain dead.

409
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,200
Yes.

410
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,000
I heard she barely has hope left.

411
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,100
What should we do? How could this happen?

412
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:06,700
She was at the verge of being married.

413
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,400
<i>Right now, I have to give them
one more push for them to cry.</i>

414
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,700
The message that all her close friends
give her will nourish her brain.

415
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:21,300
This is for Ji Hyun to watch.
I'll start filming.

416
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,100
All of you were very close
with Ji Hyun at university, right?

417
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,400
When we were at university,
we were the 4 musketeers.

418
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:35,300
During our graduation performance,
Ji Hyun and I sang a duet.

419
00:28:35,301 --> 00:28:40,300
We would always go shopping
because our tastes were similar.

420
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:43,400
Then, maybe in the future,
you'll never see her again.

421
00:28:43,401 --> 00:28:46,800
For Ji Hyun, everybody should say something.

422
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:49,200
What do we do?

423
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:51,900
Is Ji Hyun about to die?

424
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,600
What do I do?

425
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,600
- What do I do?
- What do I do?

426
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,100
You think it's just crying?

427
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:13,200
As long as they're tearing,
they're crying?

428
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:18,500
Those are tears of someone
pitying the short life of her friend.

429
00:30:18,501 --> 00:30:24,100
The lady next to her is consoling herself
over the early death of her friend.

430
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:27,900
And that one is forcing out
tears for courtesy.

431
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,500
<i>Right now, what exactly
are you guys crying about?</i>

432
00:30:45,501 --> 00:30:48,900
<i>What are the meanings of these tears?</i>

433
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,700
Turns out people can disappear
in the blink of an eye.

434
00:30:53,701 --> 00:30:59,800
In order to prepare my thesis,
I've been working so hard on it.

435
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,900
<i>You cried because of sadness
for your own difficulties?</i>

436
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:07,100
I say, how could she be so perfect?

437
00:31:07,101 --> 00:31:10,100
So if you pretend to be too arrogant,
then you don't come to a good end.

438
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:13,000
Seems like that's true.

439
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
<i>Arrogant?</i>

440
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:18,000
After she started dating Min Ho,
she kept on talking about soulmates.

441
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,400
She showed off everywhere.

442
00:31:20,401 --> 00:31:26,000
And now, what money and what boyfriend?
They're all useless.

443
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,100
Shin Woo, stop crying.

444
00:31:31,101 --> 00:31:35,400
<i>Jung Shin Woo, why are you crying?</i>

445
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,800
I've been very tired recently.

446
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:48,700
This double eyelid, I've already
had to redo the surgery twice.

447
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:51,100
Because they made it look terrible.

448
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:55,000
At that time, I wanted to die
because of the double eyelid.

449
00:31:55,001 --> 00:32:01,000
I made myself bear such suffering in
my heart. It really makes me speechless.

450
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:05,200
Ji Hyun.
She's too pitiful.

451
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:10,300
What kind of friend was Shin Ji Hyun?

452
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,300
Wasn't Ji Hyun kind?

453
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:20,100
She was kind. She was extremely kind.

454
00:32:20,101 --> 00:32:23,400
It's a problem when she's too kind.

455
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,300
She's okay with this,
she's okay with that.

456
00:32:26,301 --> 00:32:28,400
You guys can do whatever you want.

457
00:32:28,401 --> 00:32:31,400
She's a little too kind,
to the point of annoyance.

458
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:33,000
<i>What's so annoying about being kind?</i>

459
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:37,900
But actually, she pretended
to be better than us.

460
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:42,000
I think that she couldn't take hints.

461
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:45,100
Well, didn't I have a guy I liked
in second year of university?

462
00:32:45,101 --> 00:32:46,800
Sun Woo.

463
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:49,900
He liked Ji Hyun, but
Ji Hyun never realized it in the end.

464
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:52,500
She was always trying to put us together.

465
00:32:52,501 --> 00:32:54,700
She kept trying to set him up with me.

466
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:58,800
<i>Shin Woo, I really didn't know.</i>

467
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:03,700
Hey! Even so, Ji Hyun really
is a kind person.

468
00:33:03,701 --> 00:33:05,300
- Of course!
- Of course!

469
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:33,700
Within 49 days, find three people
who truly love you.

470
00:33:33,701 --> 00:33:35,600
Then you can go back.

471
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:46,500
The tears of the person who loves you,
crying over you is the proof.

472
00:33:46,501 --> 00:33:50,000
At least three drops of genuine tears.

473
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,800
Will?

474
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,500
So you're saying that Father will
pass over the company to Min Ho?

475
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:10,400
Father is healthy right now.
So why is he doing this?

476
00:34:10,401 --> 00:34:18,400
Exactly. So can you ask In Jung if
something happened with the company?

477
00:34:18,401 --> 00:34:20,900
Why don't you call In Jung and ask?

478
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:24,400
I don't know if Ji Hyun's dad
told In Jung to keep it a secret.

479
00:34:24,401 --> 00:34:27,400
Then she wouldn't come at all.

480
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,700
Okay.

481
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,100
<i>Joo Ri went to study abroad.</i>

482
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
What are you doing here?

483
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,700
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

484
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:43,000
No.

485
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,000
Why do you have no color on your face?

486
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:53,300
Didn't you say you have good news?

487
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,600
Kang! Kang!

488
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,900
Kang.

489
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,900
Big news! Big news!

490
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:02,700
Ji Hyun's dad is going to
hand over the company to Min Ho.

491
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,400
What?

492
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,500
He's going to sign his will today.

493
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:11,800
Ji Hyun's dad completely
thinks of Min Ho as his own son.

494
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:15,200
Why is Ji Hyun's dad
suddenly writing his will?

495
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,400
I'm not sure about that either.

496
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,100
Doctor Jo will go to the
company to be the witness.

497
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,900
No. No!

498
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,600
Over here!

499
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:11,100
My dad is going to give the company
to Kang Min Ho in his will.

500
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:13,700
It's not to anyone else. It's to Kang Min Ho.

501
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:20,500
Let's talk after we see if the Shin family has
a-trust-people-stupidly gene in their DNA.

502
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm sorry. I was wrong. I was wrong.

503
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,800
I won't ever do it again.
Just help me this once.

504
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:31,800
You go tell my dad to not sign the will.

505
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:35,300
Or you can tell him that Kang Min Ho
is bad and not to trust him.

506
00:37:35,301 --> 00:37:37,700
I definitely can't help you with this.

507
00:37:37,701 --> 00:37:40,700
If I do that, then I will be
100% involved in human matters.

508
00:37:40,701 --> 00:37:43,600
I'll definitely get punished for it.

509
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,600
Then, what should I do?

510
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,400
Can I go see my dad
in Song Yi Kyung's body?

511
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
Wait a moment.

512
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,400
There's only this left.

513
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:16,100
In exchange for being able to touch one thing,
you have to give up one of your 49 days.

514
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:18,400
I can touch one thing?

515
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,500
Okay, I'll do that.

516
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:22,500
Think about it before taking action.

517
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:26,100
You're a wandering spirit that hasn't even
collected one tear in your 49 days yet.

518
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:29,700
This is only time that you'll be given
an opportunity to touch something.

519
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:31,700
This is very important!

520
00:38:31,701 --> 00:38:35,400
Originally, I wouldn't give this to anyone
before half of their 49 days are over.

521
00:38:35,401 --> 00:38:37,400
Can you take off two days
and let others hear my voice?

522
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:38,500
There's nothing like that?

523
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:43,900
No. One day could change
whether you live or die.

524
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:47,700
I can definitely touch one thing, right?

525
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,900
What is she doing?

526
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,700
It's just this once. You must
think carefully beforehand.

527
00:38:54,701 --> 00:38:57,500
Also, I can't help you at all.

528
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,100
Go in or out,

529
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:02,100
- you'll have to decide for yourself.
- Okay, I got it.

530
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:06,300
First, I have to go home and return
this body to Unnie and then leave.

531
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:07,400
She's alone?

532
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,400
Oh my.

533
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:14,000
There's no time left. The rest? The rest,
I'll think about on the way home.

534
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,800
Taxi!

535
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,600
To Maleedong.

536
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,900
Maleedong?

537
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,000
What happened?

538
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,300
Aigoo. Really...

539
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,900
Phone number.

540
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,900
Taxi driver, do you know the phone number
of the express delivery company?

541
00:39:47,901 --> 00:39:49,000
Yes.

542
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,500
If she has to do something,
she should leave after explaining.

543
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:59,100
Then, you still don't know
Yi Kyung's number?

544
00:39:59,101 --> 00:40:02,500
Exactly! Aren't I stupid?

545
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,800
Kang, do you know Song Yi Kyung's
address? Give me her address.

546
00:40:09,801 --> 00:40:12,800
She's not picking up her phone.
I'm afraid something happened to her.

547
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,800
No one is available to take
your call. Please leave a message.

548
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,300
President!

549
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,600
President! Song Yi Kyung
has completely gone crazy.

550
00:40:28,601 --> 00:40:29,700
You saw Song Yi Kyung?

551
00:40:29,701 --> 00:40:33,500
Sun Jung, you can't be certain.

552
00:40:33,501 --> 00:40:34,500
What exactly happened?

553
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:38,700
Song Yi Kyung was by herself on
the road and was talking to thin air.

554
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:42,000
She's definitely not
a normal person. She's crazy.

555
00:40:42,001 --> 00:40:43,000
Song Yi Kyung did that?

556
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:46,600
When people run into
something very angering or sad,

557
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:49,800
they can do things out of the ordinary.

558
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:52,100
When? Where did you
see her? Where is she now?

559
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:56,000
She ran like a crazy woman. She said
she's going to Maleedong and left on a taxi.

560
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:57,800
Maleedong is her home.

561
00:40:57,801 --> 00:41:01,000
That's good. If she went home,
she must have to do something there.

562
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:04,400
Really? But, tell me again.

563
00:41:04,401 --> 00:41:05,900
Why was she talking to herself?

564
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,700
Bye.

565
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,100
Ahjussi, can I take this away?

566
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:18,700
- You can.
- Thank you.

567
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,500
- Manager.
- Yes, Yi Kyung.

568
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:36,700
This was left behind by a customer
yesterday. I forgot about it.

569
00:41:36,701 --> 00:41:40,000
When the express delivery comes,
can you help me give it to them?

570
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,700
Oh, okay.

571
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,100
Regarding the ownership of all the
company's shares in the will

572
00:42:20,101 --> 00:42:23,800
under President Shin Il Shik's name
being transferred to Kang Min Ho,

573
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:26,100
the two witnesses, please confirm.

574
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,600
It's for President Shin Il Shik.

575
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,400
Hyuk Mountain Industry

576
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Why would Hyuk Mountain Industry send something to our President?

577
00:43:13,001 --> 00:43:14,900
Why are you looking at that?

578
00:43:14,901 --> 00:43:18,000
How impolite. Quickly take it in!

579
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,900
I'm sorry, President. A document arrived from Hyuk Mountain Industry. They said that it's urgent.

580
00:43:48,901 --> 00:43:54,700
What would Hyuk Mountain Industry send me?

581
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,500
What is this?

582
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,100
Whose prank is this?

583
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,300
Dad, I'm sorry.

584
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,000
What is it?

585
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:30,500
In America, a woman who was in
a vegetative state woke up after 20 years.

586
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,200
Then, who sent it to you?

587
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,500
20 years?

588
00:44:39,501 --> 00:44:42,600
Dad, no! I won't let you wait that long.

589
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:45,600
So don't sign the will.

590
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,000
Let's continue.

591
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,700
What happened?

592
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,700
Are you okay?

593
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,000
I did that, Dad.

594
00:45:27,001 --> 00:45:29,500
You definitely must not hand
the company over to Kang Min Ho.

595
00:45:29,501 --> 00:45:34,000
It's as if someone
knocked it off, President.

596
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,200
Dad, it's me. It's Ji Hyun.

597
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:42,300
I did that.

598
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,400
Dad, no! No!

599
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,800
Dad, don't stamp it! Please!

600
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,600
I've really had enough. I've had enough.

601
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,000
How did this fall down?

602
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:29,500
Are you sad because I'm treating
you like you're a dead person?

603
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,500
Dad.

604
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,000
I'm sorry for making you
come here for nothing.

605
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,100
Let's end it here for today.

606
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,300
They stopped the signing? Why?

607
00:46:52,301 --> 00:46:56,200
According to what Lawyer Park said,
strange things happened at the signing.

608
00:46:56,201 --> 00:46:57,800
Strange things?

609
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,800
Thank you very much.

610
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,100
I really feel nothing but thankfulness.

611
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,400
I won't forget this favor until I die.

612
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:22,200
- They didn't find out?
- Why are you looking around?

613
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,500
Su-sun... Sunbae.

614
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I just knew you'd cause
trouble sooner or later.

615
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:56,200
Sunbae, what did I do to deserve this?

616
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,800
Granny! What are you doing?

617
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,300
Granny?

618
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,100
Who are you? Why are you
hitting him? Talk it through.

619
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:14,500
Go home.

620
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,200
Go quickly!

621
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,400
You?

622
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,800
Who let you meddle in human affairs?

623
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:28,700
Sunbae, no. Talk after she leaves.

624
00:48:28,701 --> 00:48:31,800
You have to leave some dignity
for the scheduler.

625
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:59,400
We can't directly meddle in human affairs.

626
00:48:59,401 --> 00:49:02,000
That's the first rule for a scheduler.

627
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,100
You dare to violate it?

628
00:49:04,101 --> 00:49:09,400
No, I had no choice in that situation.
I had to help.

629
00:49:09,401 --> 00:49:11,000
Since I became a scheduler,

630
00:49:11,001 --> 00:49:16,000
- I've never met a human like her.
- You? Are you dating her?

631
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,800
No!

632
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,200
You don't know how ridiculous
and stubborn she is.

633
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:27,700
Sunbae, have you met anyone
who returned 49000 won that fast?

634
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:30,600
No, has anyone ever returned it?

635
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,600
We can't listen to the wishes
of the people who die young.

636
00:49:36,601 --> 00:49:39,200
Human emotions recover too quickly.

637
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,500
Then, the one who accepted me was you?

638
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,100
You said that you couldn't have died
that way and you threw tantrums.

639
00:49:46,101 --> 00:49:49,500
So that's why you received
special treatment, brat.

640
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:51,500
I was scared that if you got
excited, the spirits will disappear.

641
00:49:51,501 --> 00:49:55,900
Then, since you've forgiven me
once, just forgive me again.

642
00:49:55,901 --> 00:49:58,500
You term has been extended by a week.

643
00:49:58,501 --> 00:50:00,700
One week?!

644
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,000
No, Sunbae!
I only have 30 days left.

645
00:50:07,001 --> 00:50:10,000
I've been crazily waiting for the day it ends.

646
00:50:10,001 --> 00:50:11,400
One week?!

647
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,400
You might as well let me die!

648
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,900
I've worked so diligently
for these 5 years.

649
00:50:17,901 --> 00:50:22,100
I can turn a blind eye to some things,
but I cannot to other things.

650
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,400
If I don't agree to extend my term
by a week, then what will happen?

651
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:34,700
Then, the work you've done
for five years will be wasted.

652
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:38,200
Wow! You have no human feelings at all.

653
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,900
I'm not a human. So where
would I get human feelings?

654
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:45,200
Oh, seriously!

655
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,000
- I'm going out.
- Okay.

656
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,200
What is it?

657
00:51:00,201 --> 00:51:02,400
I was too busy before
but I received your call.

658
00:51:02,401 --> 00:51:04,700
- Let's have a drink.
- Eat something, then leave.

659
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,100
- Hey, I came to see you.
- I was just heading out.

660
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,200
Section Leader Kang.

661
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:16,700
Please sit.

662
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,100
Did Miss Song Yi Kyung get off work?

663
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,700
You could say that.
Do you still want the usual drink?

664
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,100
Unnie woke up so early.

665
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,600
Unnie must've gotten frightened.

666
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,000
How do I get here?

667
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:29,000
Here? Go straight ahead, turn right
at the house with the red roof.

668
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,400
Thank you.

669
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,500
Hello, this is Noh Kyung Min.

670
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,700
Doctor.

671
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:50,200
I'm Song Yi Kyung.

672
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,600
Who is it?

673
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,500
Where could she be if she's not at home?

674
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,200
Feel free to say it, Miss Song Yi Kyung.

675
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:45,000
You also know I don't
have anyone I can talk to.

676
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:47,000
I'm sorry.

677
00:55:47,001 --> 00:55:52,600
Thank you for contacting me.
Now, what's the matter?

678
00:55:52,601 --> 00:55:55,700
Over the phone,
your voice sounded frightened.

679
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:03,100
I think I'm going crazy.

680
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,700
Why would you think that?

681
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,400
First of all, my hair changed.

682
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,500
It smells like the shampoo
that I don't use often.

683
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:23,200
Secondly, my ankle hurt.

684
00:56:23,201 --> 00:56:27,900
Then suddenly, the landlady mentioned
that she talked to me the day before.

685
00:56:27,901 --> 00:56:30,600
I also threw up things that I never ate.

686
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:40,000
When I woke up, I found that
I was sitting in the middle of the house.

687
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,700
Today when I woke up,
I found the door was open.

688
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,500
Everything you said now?

689
00:56:52,501 --> 00:56:57,200
I don't remember doing any of it.

690
00:56:57,201 --> 00:57:00,900
Do you remember when it started?

691
00:57:00,901 --> 00:57:07,500
It just happened suddenly one day.

692
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:11,000
How's your health? Do you feel tired?

693
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:15,100
I would before, but recently?

694
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,900
I'm not too sure.

695
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,600
It sounds like you're sleepwalking.

696
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,500
Sleepwalking is when you move
around when you're sleeping.

697
00:57:26,501 --> 00:57:29,100
So it's possible that
you don't remember anything.

698
00:57:29,101 --> 00:57:30,600
Sleepwalking?

699
00:57:30,601 --> 00:57:34,200
Don't be too worried.
Come to the hospital tomorrow.

700
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:36,700
It'll be best if you get a check-up.

701
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,500
She left without saying anything.

702
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,500
Kang will be worried.

703
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,800
What is it?

704
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,000
Well, oh just...

705
00:58:59,001 --> 00:59:01,400
I just wanted to help replace that.

706
00:59:01,401 --> 00:59:04,400
Why are you helping
our Ji Hyun replace the flowers?

707
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,300
I heard you quit designing the project.

708
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,900
Isn't that way too irresponsible?

709
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,700
I'm sorry.

710
00:59:12,701 --> 00:59:18,300
Do you know how much Section Leader
Kang pleaded me to give the job to you?

711
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I'm sorry.

712
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,600
Don't come here again!

713
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,000
[We're closed today.]

714
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:48,500
Ahjussi isn't cleaning today?

715
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,700
Manager.

716
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,100
There's no one here.

717
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,000
Who are you?

718
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:13,600
Are you Ji Hyun?

What did you come here for? Are you sick?

726
01:03:39,601 --> 01:03:41,800
- Miss Song Yi Kyung.
- Take your hand from my arm.

727
01:03:41,801 --> 01:03:43,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

728
01:03:43,201 --> 01:03:46,100
No. No. No. No. No. No!

729
01:03:46,101 --> 01:03:48,500
If you don't have any
issues, then don't contact me.

730
01:03:48,501 --> 01:03:52,100
Tell me honestly. Do you
really like me as a person?

731
01:03:52,101 --> 01:03:54,300
Human hearts change.
That's their specialty.

732
01:03:54,301 --> 01:03:56,100
There's no such thing as forever.

733
01:03:56,101 --> 01:03:58,000
It's a beautiful morning, Han Kang!

734
01:03:58,001 --> 01:04:00,500
For everything up to now, I thank you.

735
01:04:00,501 --> 01:04:01,200
What is this?

736
01:04:01,201 --> 01:04:04,200
I plan to leave this place
and go somewhere far away.

737
01:04:04,201 --> 01:04:06,400
Song Yi Kyung. Song Yi Kyung?

738
01:04:06,401 --> 01:04:08,500
You know me?
