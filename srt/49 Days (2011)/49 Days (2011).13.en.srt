Episode 13

4
00:00:23,795 --> 00:00:26,717
<i>"I love you" ~</i>

5
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:30,939
<i>are words I keep shouting
in my heart</i>

6
00:00:31,095 --> 00:00:33,786
<i>"I love you" ~</i>

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,169
<i>are words I can only whisper
behind your back</i>

8
00:00:38,356 --> 00:00:41,693
<i>"I love you" ~</i>

9
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:46,279
<i>are words that I can't speak for fear
they will disappear</i>

10
00:00:46,486 --> 00:00:49,334
<i>I love you so much...</i>

11
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:52,522
<i>that it scares me...</i>

12
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:56,291
<i>"I love you"</i>

13
00:00:59,215 --> 00:01:01,363
What do you think you're
doing? No...

14
00:01:01,605 --> 00:01:03,174
What did you just do?

15
00:01:03,316 --> 00:01:04,314
What?

16
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:06,099
What? Did I just do
something?

17
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,042
Didn't you just hug me?

18
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:09,125
Did I?

19
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:12,560
I must be sleep-walking...
I don't remember.

20
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,232
Why are you surprised?
You're so old-fashioned.

21
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:17,804
<i>You looked down,</i>

22
00:01:17,857 --> 00:01:19,956
so I hugged you
to give you encouragement.

23
00:01:20,154 --> 00:01:22,878
It's a comfort hug,
don't you know?

24
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:25,969
I lived in America for 10 years.

25
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:28,291
Over there, hugging is
quite common.

26
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:32,129
Ah... You never lived in America
so you wouldn't know this.

27
00:01:32,315 --> 00:01:34,750
It didn't seem like that
type of hug.

28
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:36,807
Song, didn't you say you're
an orphan?

29
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:39,744
That you had no one to
talk to or rely on?

30
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,164
You seemed all dejected
walking over here,

31
00:01:42,284 --> 00:01:44,592
looking very lonely,
like you're having a hard time.

32
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:49,250
<i>Do you want to become the person
who loves Song Yi Kyung?</i>

33
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:51,913
Why are you looking at me
so seriously?

34
00:01:52,364 --> 00:01:53,562
Let's go.

35
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:57,344
In Korea, a person

36
00:01:57,418 --> 00:02:00,134
who has a girlfriend shouldn't casually
hug other women.

37
00:02:00,214 --> 00:02:01,907
I never said that I have
a girlfriend.

38
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:03,718
Didn't you say you have a
woman you like?

39
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,003
Just because I like her,
does that mean she's my girlfriend?

40
00:02:06,055 --> 00:02:08,612
You even gave her a
huge bouquet of flowers.

41
00:02:08,784 --> 00:02:11,038
What have you been doing all this time
if she's still not your girlfriend?

42
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:13,731
I didn't give her flowers to get her
to be my girlfriend.

43
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:15,257
Then why did you give
her flowers?

44
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:16,979
To cheer her up!

45
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:22,334
You also said just now that
you hugged me to cheer me up!

46
00:02:24,136 --> 00:02:25,670
What? What's the problem?

47
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:27,518
This woman and that woman...

48
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,274
Is it your hobby to
encourage every woman?

49
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,656
It's not this woman, that woman!

50
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,368
What does that mean?

51
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,665
- Ahjussi.
- Yes?

52
00:02:52,783 --> 00:02:55,811
Roast beef risotto, Pasta with olive oil sauce
margarita style, and a salad.

53
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:57,034
Please tell them
to prepare it quickly

54
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:58,520
Is someone coming?

55
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,400
I going to eat it.

56
00:03:02,187 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh.

57
00:03:03,089 --> 00:03:04,804
<i>Oh, I understand.</i>

58
00:03:05,196 --> 00:03:06,709
Make it quick.

59
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:08,300
Got it.

60
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:22,321
What's with the guys and girls
that are around us lately?

61
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:23,454
Huh?

62
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:38,617
And that's all of it.

63
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:40,839
Miss Song Yi Kyung,
who has a big appetite,

64
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,608
help me clear
some of this away.

65
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:43,874
Clear it away?

66
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,266
Sometimes, I have a
poor appetite,

67
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:48,084
so just a taste is enough.

68
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,685
It'd be a shame to let this
go to waste.

69
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:51,039
So you're...

70
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:53,507
asking me to help eat
all of this?

71
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,020
I'm just asking you
to take care of the leftovers.

72
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:57,925
The way you say things...

73
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:02,305
It's a shame to waste
all this food.

74
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:04,277
I have no choice
but to eat it.

75
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,937
As a person...

76
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,760
you need to know what
is important.

77
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,788
<i>Song Yi Kyung...</i>

78
00:04:14,997 --> 00:04:16,744
why are you eating that?

79
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,815
Didn't you tell me to
clear it away?

80
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,713
You're eating to survive.

81
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,846
People eat to survive.

82
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:24,975
<i>They don't eat to die.</i>

83
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:27,230
To survive. Survival...

84
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:28,770
is more important than
anything else.

85
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,992
Do you understand?

86
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,430
I understand your words,
but I don't understand your meaning.

87
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:40,415
Eating this delicious food,
getting angry, revenge, and love.

88
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:42,933
If you die, then
none of that matters.

89
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,762
<i>Why is he like this?</i>

90
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:47,800
<i>Does he know who I am?</i>

91
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:49,541
You said you haven't much
longer to live.

92
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,544
You mentioned before,

93
00:04:50,618 --> 00:04:52,857
that you'll only be able to live
for 49 more days.

94
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:55,171
Ah...

95
00:04:57,057 --> 00:04:58,590
I don't know what illness
you have,

96
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:01,235
but cheer up and eat a lot.

97
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:06,539
<i>Does he suspect something?</i>

98
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:10,431
<i>I don't know what you're doing,</i>

99
00:05:10,662 --> 00:05:13,894
<i>but survival comes first... brat.</i>

100
00:05:17,772 --> 00:05:18,838
What?

101
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:20,668
Kang and Song Yi Kyung?

102
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,343
That's utterly preposterous.

103
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,271
I'm just reporting what I saw.

104
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:25,790
You saw it wrong.

105
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:27,973
You must have seen it wrong!

106
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:34,342
<i>Here.</i>

107
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:43,516
The seal was actually
hidden in a place like that?

108
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:46,222
The day Ji Hyun hid the seal
at my house,

109
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,107
was the day the restaurant
was being cleaned.

110
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:50,294
That was also the day of
Ji Hyun's wedding...

111
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:52,140
and the day you went to
the hospital.

112
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:53,601
She hid the seal

113
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:55,336
on the day of her own wedding.

114
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,642
Those bastards deserve
to go to hell!

115
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,595
You're going to let them
get away with it?

116
00:05:59,711 --> 00:06:02,155
On my way back, I picked up
the Hae Mi Do register.

117
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,484
I also asked my sunbae to look into
the Shin and HM project.

118
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:07,854
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

119
00:06:07,998 --> 00:06:09,818
Is the company
important right now?!

120
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:11,503
Saving Ji Hyun
is most important!

121
00:06:11,523 --> 00:06:14,306
This is something Ji Hyun
herself knows best.

122
00:06:14,802 --> 00:06:17,337
But seeing she's hanging
around Min Ho,

123
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:19,237
I'm guessing she must have
her reasons.

124
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:23,087
If it's regarding the company,
we can just tell Ji Hyun's father.

125
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,796
And what exactly would
we tell him?

126
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:27,801
He trusts Min Ho, even preparing
his will in his favor.

127
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,965
Would he believe me,
without any proof?

128
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,796
That's a good point.

129
00:06:33,022 --> 00:06:34,736
So we can't reveal Ji Hyun's situation.

130
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,357
If we make a wrong move,
Ji Hyun will be in danger.

131
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:40,324
Ahjussi, you found out for yourself.
I wasn't the one who told you.

132
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:42,991
I know. I know, punk.

133
00:06:43,523 --> 00:06:45,239
Souls possessing human bodies...

134
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,755
How could there
be something like this?

135
00:06:48,571 --> 00:06:50,882
I feel like I'm in a dream.

136
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,347
Ah!

137
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:55,184
Well it's not! Huh!
So come to your senses.

138
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,286
<i>Hey Kang.</i>

139
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,974
Don't do something
you'll regret later, okay?

140
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:00,425
The most important thing is

141
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:02,626
for Ji Hyun's father to
have the surgery.

142
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:03,947
Yes.

143
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:11,607
Cheer up. Okay?

144
00:07:12,662 --> 00:07:14,179
<i>Hae Won!</i>

145
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:15,969
Hae Won!

146
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,642
What are...
the two of you up to?

147
00:07:20,746 --> 00:07:22,055
Hwa Jun...

148
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:23,652
you should have knocked.

149
00:07:23,714 --> 00:07:27,770
Ah... I think
I've figured something out.

150
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:29,193
Here, take a look.

151
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:33,915
<i>The only way to express sincerity
is by using your heart.</i>

152
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:37,755
If you need to prove your sincerity
then it's in... the eyes.

153
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:41,603
But haven't we
done this before already?

154
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,840
<i>Have we?</i>

155
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:47,011
People say the eyes
are the mirror to the heart.

156
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,550
That's pretty good.

157
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,728
<i>I should write it down
like this too.</i>

158
00:08:09,412 --> 00:08:11,997
Aish... there's a shadow now!

159
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,102
Did you investigate?

160
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:15,966
Does Han Kang suspect
something?

161
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,792
Why do you need to
know that?

162
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:20,970
I'm really scared...
scared to death.

163
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:22,914
Just use some
common sense here.

164
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:25,616
A person's body is
overtaken by another person's soul.

165
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,842
Is that even possible?

166
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,764
Hang Kang is being a
little strange.

167
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,281
Before he was always
suspicious of me.

168
00:08:30,374 --> 00:08:31,835
But now he's really
nice to me.

169
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:34,026
Does he like
Song Yi Kyung now?

170
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:35,852
<i>How terrible.</i>

171
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:39,384
Having to become a spirit in order to
know the meaning of true love.

172
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:43,157
Twists and turns...
are what make love interesting.

173
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:46,374
In any case,
can I rest easy now?

174
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,950
You'll be fine as long as your actions
don't give you away.

175
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:53,184
Humans know, that their lives
will end one day,

176
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,781
but no one knows what happens

Something terrible
will happen, if you do.

what happened during the 49 days,

You knew I would come?

00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,815
Earlier when you said
you weren't interested in me,

This is my answer.

00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:11,124
What does she want from Min Ho

323
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,540
In order to help her
I need to know.

00:18:16,574 --> 00:18:18,487

Narcolepsy?

330
00:18:47,944 --> 00:18:50,377
It's an illness where you suddenly
faint and fall asleep.

there's confusion and hallucinations.

00:18:55,363 --> 00:18:57,103
I've heard of it before.

334
00:18:58,377 --> 00:19:00,386
So that's why you didn't
recognize me?

335
00:19:00,578 --> 00:19:02,761
Why didn't you tell me sooner
that you have such a serious illness?

336
00:19:02,845 --> 00:19:04,779
Why would I tell
so much to a man

337
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:06,859
who abandoned
a severely ill person

338
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,108
and went back to In Jung?

339
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:12,016
Then why did you send that
text message to In Jung?

340
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:14,311
I wanted to be open with her,

341
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,923
so that I'd feel a little better.

342
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:19,209
You acted too rashly.

343
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:21,905

00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:25,169
I don't know.

00:19:26,195 --> 00:19:28,305
I don't know what
I'm doing.

346

I want to go back to

00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:32,201
The food there is delicious,

348
00:19:32,285 --> 00:19:34,133
but there wasn't enough time
to fully enjoy it.

349
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,387
You said when you were poor,

350
00:19:36,486 --> 00:19:38,627

go there to eat often.

00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:42,831
So, now that you're successful,
where do you go to eat with your mother?

352
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:45,939
The last place I ate at
before I left to study abroad,

353
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:47,786
was at that restaurant.

354
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:50,559
Before studying abroad?

355
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,962
She's been in the hospital
for years now.

356
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:55,826
<i>For years?!</i>

357
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:04,176
<i>So the woman I met
wasn't really his mother?</i>

358
00:20:04,757 --> 00:20:06,858
Which hospital is she in?

359
00:20:07,012 --> 00:20:08,937
I must've drunk too
much alcohol.

360
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:11,659
When my head is clear,
I usually don't talk about her.

361
00:20:18,865 --> 00:20:20,922
<i>It was definitely 6 digits.</i>

362
00:20:21,117 --> 00:20:22,497
<i>The password is probably...</i>

363
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:25,481
<i>a significant date of someone
close to him, not easily forgotten.</i>

364
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:28,960
<i>It is probably
his mother's birthday.</i>

365
00:20:38,623 --> 00:20:40,756
You're so pitiful.

366
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,819
So much you don't want to say,

367
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:44,647
just like me.

368
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:53,775
When do you plan
to tell me your home address?

369
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:55,257
When the time is right.

370
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:56,553
No matter what else I say,

371
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:57,825
you're not going to
tell me, right?

372
00:20:57,904 --> 00:20:59,362
I'm leaving now.

373
00:21:28,927 --> 00:21:30,423
Agasshi.

374
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,558
If love isn't going your way,

375
00:21:32,664 --> 00:21:35,257
how about...
have some soju with me?

376
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:36,584
Hey!

377
00:21:36,902 --> 00:21:38,611
Shin Ji Hyun...

378
00:21:38,678 --> 00:21:42,256
you are a troublemaker who's going
to make me not finish this term on time.

379
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,212
You definitely are!

380
00:21:44,415 --> 00:21:46,317
Did I do something
wrong again?

381
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:48,697
You're just a traveler with
20 days left,

382
00:21:48,729 --> 00:21:50,727
but you're living quite
spectacularly.

383
00:21:50,863 --> 00:21:52,586
Do you think you're in
a Bourne movie?

384
00:21:59,132 --> 00:22:01,379
That's... my dad's car!

385
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:05,696
You think your dad would investigate you
and send someone to follow you?

386
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:10,102
Driver Cha... is supposedly
Kang Min Ho's high school friend.

387
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:13,607
Kang Min Ho sent him!

388
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,820
What do I do?

389
00:22:15,005 --> 00:22:20,190
We'll have to be like Matt Damon* and
Franka Potente*. (*leads actors, The Bourne Identity)

390
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:26,295
Cool!

391
00:23:30,903 --> 00:23:32,009
Thanks!

392
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:33,659
I didn't do it for you.

393
00:23:33,764 --> 00:23:35,846
I was protecting Song Yi Kyung.

394
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,015
That's true.

395
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:43,255
Because of me Unni must be
emotionally and physically exhausted.

396
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,793
I can't frighten her again.

397
00:23:45,877 --> 00:23:48,632
Then, why are you doing this
pointless spy work?

398
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:50,791
I have to figure out the password
for Kang Min Ho's safe.

399
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,246
And after you do?

400
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,513
Will everything
be resolved then?

401
00:23:53,563 --> 00:23:55,621
When his true intentions
are revealed,

402
00:23:55,785 --> 00:23:57,564
I can get Dad
to have the surgery

403
00:23:57,695 --> 00:23:59,315
and stop the company from
going bankrupt,

404
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:01,345
and I can protect Hae Mi Do too.

405
00:24:01,743 --> 00:24:03,104
<i>Plus...</i>

406
00:24:03,297 --> 00:24:05,443
if I end up surviving,

407
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:08,159
I'll never be tricked
by Kang Min Ho again.

408
00:24:08,243 --> 00:24:09,863
What about the old
Shin Ji Hyun?

409
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,606
You're not going to search for
tears shed for you?

410
00:24:13,275 --> 00:24:15,364
There have to be some.

411
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:17,880
I'm not sure...

412
00:24:18,046 --> 00:24:20,208
if it'll be 3 tear drops,
or just one.

413
00:24:21,281 --> 00:24:22,573
What do you mean?

414
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,366
In truth...

415
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:27,030
it's already predetermined.

416
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:29,771
The reason 49 days
is granted,

417
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:32,875
is to give the souls,
who shouldn't have died early,

418
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:35,602
a final gift or
something, right?

419
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:37,878
Tears...

420
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:40,695
there's no reason to
search for them to begin with.

421
00:24:40,891 --> 00:24:43,541
I can't reveal my identity
and say that I'm Shin Ji Hyun,

422
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:46,587
and it's not like I can get them
to love my spirit.

423
00:24:47,076 --> 00:24:48,476
And this too.

424
00:24:48,694 --> 00:24:50,506
It filled up by itself,
didn't it?

425
00:24:50,627 --> 00:24:51,782
"Am I right?"

426
00:24:51,996 --> 00:24:53,579
"Tell me the truth. "

427
00:24:53,857 --> 00:24:55,979
This is all
just wishful thinking.

428
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,940
Then stop talking about
tears all the time.

429
00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:00,363
Tears...

430
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,689
are something that are already decided
when a person dies.

431
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:07,841
Okay, let's stop here.

432
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:11,404
If this conversation continues,
we'll cross the line.

433
00:25:11,691 --> 00:25:13,233
I get it.

434
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:16,318
Ah, let me ask you.

435
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:17,659
<i>When you first</i>

436
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:19,941
described Song Yi Kyung
unni's conditions,

437
00:25:20,026 --> 00:25:22,619
you said she grew up in
an orphanage, right?

438
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,010
Did I?

439
00:25:27,065 --> 00:25:29,689
Oh, that's right. What about it?

440
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:32,801
You said you're not looking for
Song Yi Soo, so I will.

441
00:25:32,927 --> 00:25:35,349
Stop thinking about
how to find Song Yi Soo.

442
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:38,197
And focus on not getting caught
by Kang Min Ho.

443
00:25:38,628 --> 00:25:41,363
Don't disrupt Song Yi Kyung's
life too much.

444
00:25:41,475 --> 00:25:44,766
I get it. I'll be careful.

445
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,476
It must be hard to forget
Song Yi Kyung...

446
00:26:05,245 --> 00:26:06,881
for you to
be drinking alcohol.

447
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:09,235
You shouldn't randomly come in
to someone's apartment.

448
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:12,498
Then you should reset
the passcode so I don't know it.

449
00:26:20,895 --> 00:26:22,883
That's not all
you came to say.

450
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:26,013
Do you remember
when you couldn't find the seal?

451
00:26:26,363 --> 00:26:29,192
Do you remember the name
Park Jung Eun?

452
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:31,560
<i>Ji Hyun's friend.</i>

453
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,193
She has reappeared and

454
00:26:34,688 --> 00:26:36,797
is doing strange things.

455
00:26:39,617 --> 00:26:42,710
I'm positive that woman
took the seal.

456
00:26:43,611 --> 00:26:46,703
It was really strange that she went around
looking for Ji Hyun's friends.

457
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:49,019
When we went to Jinan,

458
00:26:49,147 --> 00:26:51,939
she did also
and that bothers me.

459
00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:55,166
Is she following us?

460
00:26:55,353 --> 00:26:57,265
Aren't you going overboard
with your guesses?

461
00:26:57,353 --> 00:26:59,117
Don't be like that.
Oppa, you should look into it.

462
00:26:59,214 --> 00:27:00,497
In Jung...

463
00:27:00,683 --> 00:27:04,065
if you're so nervous,
then go study languages abroad.

464
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:05,989
Study languages?

465
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:08,291
Until after this
situation is resolved...

466
00:27:08,451 --> 00:27:09,611
No...

467
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:11,929
go and study abroad for
an indefinite period.

468
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,246
You want me to go
study abroad?

469
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:17,971
Are you trying to
get rid of me?

470
00:27:18,287 --> 00:27:19,243
<i>You said you don't</i>

471
00:27:19,248 --> 00:27:21,839
have feelings for Song Yi Kyung
and I should wait.

472
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:24,397
What are you planning by
sending me abroad?

473
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,394
That's not what I mean.

474
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,630
Oppa, how can
you treat me this way?

475
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:31,220
<i>For 2 years, you never developed
feelings for Ji Hyun.</i>

476
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:33,941
Why are you like this
with that woman?

477
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,089
Yes, I like Song Yi Kyung.

478
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:38,279
<i>But, it's not just because
of Song Yi Kyung.</i>

479
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:39,180
What?

480
00:27:39,255 --> 00:27:41,089
Think about how we've spent
the last 2 years.

481
00:27:41,174 --> 00:27:42,742
You and I, these last 2 years...

482
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:43,904
<i>No...</i>

483
00:27:44,134 --> 00:27:46,152
<i>to be exact, it started
when you said those words...</i>

484
00:27:46,245 --> 00:27:48,375
It started on October 5, 2009.

485
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:50,023
On my birthday.

486
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:52,526
From that day until the day of
Ji Hyun's accident,

487
00:27:52,628 --> 00:27:54,811
when we were together,
all we did was plot.

488
00:27:54,878 --> 00:27:56,909
What are you trying
to say?

489
00:27:59,757 --> 00:28:03,155
We've studied what kind of person Ji Hyun is
beginning with her personality.

490
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:04,587
Her favorite foods,

491
00:28:04,654 --> 00:28:06,419
colors, clothing, hobbies, and
music preference.

492
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:08,284
The movies
that made her cry. 

493
00:28:08,635 --> 00:28:09,691
<i>And on top of that...</i>

494
00:28:09,786 --> 00:28:11,341
Ji Hyun's parents' personalities,

495
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:14,061
their values and so on,
kept us endlessly busy.

496
00:28:14,344 --> 00:28:15,856
<i>I found someone to
negotiate with</i>

497
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:18,598
in order to force bankruptcy
and take over Hae Mi Do.

498
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:21,686
I planned so carefully, in order to achieve all this
without President Shin suspecting anything.

499
00:28:21,768 --> 00:28:24,353
We toiled and suffered
to get to this point.

500
00:28:24,482 --> 00:28:26,471
What about it?

501
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:28,684
It was for both our sakes.

502
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:31,345
For the past 2 years, it's been a
business deal between us...

503
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,578
rather than love.

504
00:28:43,061 --> 00:28:45,341
Our conversations,
our memories,

505
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:47,543
have meant nothing these
past 2 years.

506
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:49,812
We've shared nothing
with each other.

507
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:52,786
Isn't it only natural
that the feelings have cooled?

508
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,977
You're saying...

509
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,859
your feelings have cooled?

510
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,579
I thought you
felt the same way.

511
00:29:04,098 --> 00:29:05,706
Oppa...

512
00:29:05,982 --> 00:29:07,829
Honestly, my feelings...

513
00:29:08,257 --> 00:29:10,746
aren't something
I can control, In Jung.

514
00:29:31,389 --> 00:29:35,096
Ever since we went to Jinan, why is it
getting harder to leave her body?

515
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:38,579
Do souls suffer the weaknesses
of the body too?

516
00:29:42,854 --> 00:29:45,014
I'll find Song Yi Soo for you
really soon.

517
00:29:45,097 --> 00:29:47,179
Just be patient a little longer.

518
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,214
Did you really

519
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,098
take the day off
the day before yesterday?

520
00:29:54,265 --> 00:29:58,595
Did... something happen,
by any chance?

521
00:29:58,872 --> 00:30:00,502
I took the day off?

522
00:30:00,681 --> 00:30:02,280
You said you were taking
a day off

523
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,056
and not coming to work.

524
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:05,630
I did?

525
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:08,952
When I came by the other day,
a young guy said...

526
00:30:09,397 --> 00:30:11,697
that you took the day off.

527
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:14,593
The day before yesterday?

528
00:30:17,355 --> 00:30:19,160
If it was...

529
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:23,492
I thought I was dreaming.

530
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,316
<i>It wasn't a dream after all.</i>

531
00:30:27,948 --> 00:30:31,045
<i>Oh, this is trouble.
Big trouble!</i>

532
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:34,207
Oh! How could I make a
mistake like this?

533
00:30:34,317 --> 00:30:36,761
How could I forget to
transform myself?

534
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:41,125
This... will I be
penalized again?

535
00:30:47,957 --> 00:30:49,389
Yi Kyung...

536
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,606
where are you going to
right now?

537
00:30:52,221 --> 00:30:54,693
On the way to see Yi Soo.

538
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,916
How could a person
not change?!

539
00:30:59,944 --> 00:31:01,680
Changing is what makes
a person human!

540
00:31:01,722 --> 00:31:03,629
No matter what...

541
00:31:03,715 --> 00:31:05,188
you're still Yi Soo.

542
00:31:05,524 --> 00:31:08,127
Can't you just
understand me a little?!

543
00:31:10,979 --> 00:31:13,739
<i>I'm... crying.</i>

544
00:31:27,697 --> 00:31:30,607
<i>I went back to the
hotel crying.</i>

545
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:35,000
<i>It's Oppa!</i>

546
00:31:37,365 --> 00:31:40,095
I see a man
and I'm very happy.

547
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,754
But...

548
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,684
<i>that man went into a hotel room
with another woman.</i>

549
00:31:48,828 --> 00:31:50,848
<i>I was secretly watching them.</i>

550
00:31:51,061 --> 00:31:53,403
<i>and I seemed to be
very shocked.</i>

551
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,944
Was that man...

552
00:31:57,235 --> 00:31:58,845
Song Yi Soo?

553
00:31:59,077 --> 00:32:00,597
He wasn't.

554
00:32:02,012 --> 00:32:04,145
I don't know that man.

555
00:32:04,817 --> 00:32:06,561
The person watching...

556
00:32:06,702 --> 00:32:08,154
is it you?

557
00:32:10,124 --> 00:32:12,411
It looks like me...

558
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:16,071
but it's not me.

559
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:25,383
Don't be afraid, Yi Kyung.

560
00:32:25,832 --> 00:32:28,257
You seem to be having
a lot of fun.

I beg you to
pull yourself together.

565
00:32:46,511 --> 00:32:49,901
In trying to remember the past
you've locked away in your mind,

566
00:32:49,987 --> 00:32:51,351
you're mixing this up with

567
00:32:51,442 --> 00:32:53,374
memories from your past life.

568
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,013
It's not...

569
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,555
my past life.

570
00:32:58,384 --> 00:33:00,503
Something very strange...

571
00:33:01,361 --> 00:33:03,337
seems to be
happening to me.

572
00:33:03,438 --> 00:33:05,292
What do you mean by that?

573
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:07,589
What strange thing?

574
00:33:09,105 --> 00:33:10,255
<i>Yi Kyung.</i>

575
00:33:10,587 --> 00:33:13,034
Tell me exactly
what is happening.

576
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,797
What... is causing you
to be this way?

577
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:21,964
I don't know either.

578
00:33:22,785 --> 00:33:24,940
I want to tell you...

579
00:33:25,852 --> 00:33:28,638
but I have this strange feeling

580
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:31,276
that I shouldn't tell you.

581
00:33:43,781 --> 00:33:46,476
<i>Unni, you're coming home late
more often now.</i>

582
00:33:48,023 --> 00:33:49,414
But it's a good thing,

583
00:33:49,575 --> 00:33:52,479
because it seems like
you're moving on little by little.

584
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:33,912
What are you doing here
at this time of day?

585
00:34:34,617 --> 00:34:37,013
I want to try the
A region project again.

586
00:34:37,112 --> 00:34:38,661
Did you find a
new person to handle it?

587
00:34:38,813 --> 00:34:40,954
If you haven't,
then let me do it, Hyung.

588
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:43,877
Why did you suddenly change your mind
about doing this project?

589
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,444
At that time, it was when Ji Hyun
became like that,

590
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:48,460
I felt uneasy so
I didn't want to do it.

591
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:50,137
You felt uneasy?

592
00:34:50,342 --> 00:34:52,861
Working for the family of someone
who suffered such a misfortune,

593
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:54,807
it felt a little weird.

594
00:34:55,217 --> 00:34:57,067
You don't feel that way now?

595
00:34:57,278 --> 00:34:58,592
That may be so,

596
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:01,280
but now I know about
your relationship with In Jung,

597
00:35:01,487 --> 00:35:03,332
I feel like I should at least
help out with it.

598
00:35:03,407 --> 00:35:04,856
Kid!

599
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,119
Can I do it or not?

600
00:35:07,226 --> 00:35:08,662
Of course I'm happy
if you're willing to help.

601
00:35:08,745 --> 00:35:10,122
Then I'll take that
as a yes.

602
00:35:10,205 --> 00:35:11,792

I was going to take you out

610
00:35:47,055 --> 00:35:49,418
to eat lunch at a restaurant.

611
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:51,162
Eat lunch?

612
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,560
Since yesterday,

00:35:53,669 --> 00:35:57,313
I've been craving the pasta
that Ji Hyun likes.

614
00:35:57,412 --> 00:35:59,260
Then you go
and eat some yourself.

615
00:35:59,379 --> 00:36:00,949
Ji Hyun had said

616

that she wanted to eat there
only with you.

617
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:10,504
She only wanted to eat there
with her mom?

It would be great if you could
come along too.

619
00:36:13,652 --> 00:36:14,790
Should I ask the nurse
to come?

620

This is Kang's restaurant.

626

I brought Ji Hyun's mom
to try the pasta that Ji Hyun likes.

Please take your time deciding.

628

00:41:11,394 --> 00:41:12,471
I know about it.

704
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,086
<i>That being the case,
you're going overboard</i>

705
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,340
by doing this.

706
00:41:16,524 --> 00:41:17,534
No...

707
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,336
you're completely shameless.

708
00:41:21,637 --> 00:41:23,455
Go back in there

709
00:41:23,909 --> 00:41:26,700
and don't make
Ji Hyun's mom worry.

710
00:41:30,607 --> 00:41:32,393
<i>How did he know?</i>

711
00:41:33,597 --> 00:41:35,643
She must have told him.

712
00:41:36,173 --> 00:41:38,306
Why didn't I think of this?

713
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:45,139
Then, Ji Hyun introduced you
for this job here?

714
00:41:45,426 --> 00:41:46,445
Yes.

715
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,207
But, In Jung hasn't finished eating.
Where did she run off to?

716
00:41:56,254 --> 00:41:57,705
She's back.

717
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,730
I'm sorry, I had
an urgent phone call.

718
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:04,841
You're going back to the hospital?
When you finish, I'll take you.

719
00:42:05,096 --> 00:42:06,126
Kang...

720
00:42:06,287 --> 00:42:08,043
You have work matters
to attend to.

721
00:42:09,035 --> 00:42:10,068
I'll take you.

722
00:42:10,177 --> 00:42:12,538
I need to head that way
to see a customer anyway.

723
00:42:13,212 --> 00:42:14,601
Let's do that then.

724
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:15,995
<i>Song Yi Kyung...</i>

725
00:42:16,163 --> 00:42:18,106
bring a cup of coffee
to my office.

726
00:42:18,189 --> 00:42:19,442
Don't add cream.

727
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:29,449
Song Yi Kyung.

728
00:42:29,587 --> 00:42:32,060
Are you really friends
with Ji Hyun?

729
00:42:32,732 --> 00:42:33,872
Yes.

730
00:42:34,045 --> 00:42:35,454
Really?

731
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,217
Then why didn't you
tell me?

732
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,196
After hearing you just now,

733
00:42:40,278 --> 00:42:42,617
the two of you must have been
internet buddies.

734
00:42:42,733 --> 00:42:44,113
An online magic cafe.

735
00:42:44,363 --> 00:42:47,707
Ah, that's why you're similar to Ji Hyun
in so many ways.

736
00:42:50,293 --> 00:42:52,131
But Boss,

737
00:42:52,354 --> 00:42:54,879
why did you tell her that
you already knew?

738
00:42:55,077 --> 00:42:56,605
Although I didn't fully understand,

739
00:42:56,705 --> 00:42:58,986
I sensed that you were
in a tight spot.

740
00:43:01,392 --> 00:43:02,692
What do you mean by that?

741
00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:04,247
I said to you before,

742
00:43:04,327 --> 00:43:06,465
I owe Ji Hyun a lot of favors.

743
00:43:06,558 --> 00:43:07,785
<i>That's one of the reasons...</i>

744
00:43:07,931 --> 00:43:10,073
Oh, but you know Ji Hyun
very well.

745
00:43:10,224 --> 00:43:13,362
She always sticks up for
the underdogs.

746
00:43:13,772 --> 00:43:15,488
If a weaker person is
being bullied,

747
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:17,681
she'll stand up for them
without thinking twice.

748
00:43:18,058 --> 00:43:20,104
<i>This is what he calls
owing a favor?</i>

749
00:43:20,644 --> 00:43:21,913
Also...

750
00:43:22,094 --> 00:43:24,424
I really don't like In Jung
that much.

751
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:25,974
Why?

752
00:43:26,414 --> 00:43:28,669
Don't you know about it?

753
00:43:29,447 --> 00:43:32,114
Min Ho hyung...
and In Jung's relationship.

754
00:43:32,931 --> 00:43:34,738
<i>How did he know?</i>

755
00:43:35,691 --> 00:43:37,192
You didn't know?

756
00:43:37,805 --> 00:43:39,350
I know.

757
00:43:39,774 --> 00:43:41,792
That's fine then.
Go on out.

758
00:43:41,977 --> 00:43:43,160
What?

759
00:43:43,535 --> 00:43:45,839
That's why I helped you.

760
00:43:49,263 --> 00:43:51,591
Boss, the customers say
they're leaving.

761
00:43:52,001 --> 00:43:53,427
Got it.

762
00:43:56,307 --> 00:43:57,774
I'll be right back.

763
00:44:07,417 --> 00:44:10,326
<i>In Jung will surely tell
Kang Min Ho right away.</i>

764
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,600
[ Song Yi Kyung ]

765
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:49,771
Hello? This is Kang Min Ho.

766
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:51,294
I've something to say to you.

767
00:44:51,374 --> 00:44:53,044
Can we meet up now?

768
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:55,720
I'm heading out to an
office meeting right now.

769
00:44:55,801 --> 00:44:57,161
Did something happen?

770
00:44:57,384 --> 00:44:58,775
What time will it end?

771
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:01,157
Around... 5 o'clock.

772
00:45:01,374 --> 00:45:03,240
Then, I'll be waiting
in front of your house.

773
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,530
[ Shin In Jung ]

774
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,161
I'm here again.
Have you had lunch yet?

775
00:45:35,253 --> 00:45:37,381
I said not to come but here you are
like it's your job or something!

776
00:45:37,448 --> 00:45:40,297
The place In Jung took me to turned out
to be Han Kang's restaurant.

777
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:42,262
I don't care
what the reason is.

778
00:45:42,353 --> 00:45:44,155
Why did you here again?

779
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:46,427
He says he has
something to say to you.

780
00:45:50,898 --> 00:45:52,838
What could we possibly have
to talk about?

781
00:45:52,944 --> 00:45:55,694
Although it's not my place
to say this,

782
00:45:56,238 --> 00:45:58,334
please listen to what I have to say
on Ji Hyun's behalf.

783
00:45:58,414 --> 00:46:00,091
What right do you have to
speak for Ji Hyun?

784
00:46:00,197 --> 00:46:03,317
I... am just like Ji Hyun.

785
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:04,657
What?

786
00:46:04,787 --> 00:46:07,580
I'm someone who didn't even know
when my mom died.

787
00:46:07,978 --> 00:46:09,688
I found out a year later,

788
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:10,769
<i>the fact that</i>

789
00:46:10,796 --> 00:46:13,609
my mother had already
passed away.

790
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:15,377
<i>That was...</i>

791
00:46:15,474 --> 00:46:17,928
the decision that my mom made
for my sake.

792
00:46:17,943 --> 00:46:19,955
What are you trying to say?

793
00:46:20,021 --> 00:46:22,011
My mom never told me.

794
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:23,637
Why she got divorced,

795
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,753
what illness she had,
or when she would die.

796
00:46:25,857 --> 00:46:28,109
She didn't even tell me
that she was dying.

797
00:46:28,174 --> 00:46:29,945
I was packed off to America.

798
00:46:29,976 --> 00:46:31,217
Alright.

799
00:46:31,463 --> 00:46:32,918
I know what you're trying to say
so you can stop now.

800
00:46:32,994 --> 00:46:34,809
<i>My mom did it for my sake,</i>

801
00:46:34,862 --> 00:46:37,219
but even now,
I still don't understand why.

802
00:46:37,564 --> 00:46:40,111
If she was doing it for my own good,
she should've told me.

803
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:42,144
How does that make you
similar to Ji Hyun?

804
00:46:42,197 --> 00:46:43,837
It will be even worse
for Ji Hyun.

805
00:46:43,988 --> 00:46:45,207
If Ji Hyun wakes up

806
00:46:45,383 --> 00:46:47,338
and finds that you're gone,
what would she do?

807
00:46:47,501 --> 00:46:49,648
Especially if she finds out
you refused surgery because of her.

808
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:51,020
If she finds out about that...

809
00:46:51,047 --> 00:46:52,397
Punk!

810
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:54,771
How dare you threaten me?

811
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:56,548
<i>What do you know? Huh?!</i>

812
00:46:56,951 --> 00:46:59,159
What right do you have...?!

813
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:04,070
Father!

814
00:47:05,845 --> 00:47:08,228
The wind is so nice.

815
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:15,713
The sky is so... beautiful.

816
00:47:16,257 --> 00:47:20,495
<i>Will I still see all this
in 19 days?</i>

817
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:25,159
<i>I'm afraid
I won't be able to.</i>

818
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:35,937
<i>No, I'll be able to
see it.</i>

819
00:47:36,123 --> 00:47:38,469
<i>I'll be able to see it.</i>

820
00:47:47,065 --> 00:47:48,480
What are you doing?

821
00:47:50,711 --> 00:47:53,763
The wind and the sun
are really beautiful.

822
00:47:54,025 --> 00:47:55,739
Let's go for a drive then.

823
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:57,627
It's a waste to stay home
with such nice weather.

824
00:47:57,731 --> 00:47:59,775
It's inconvenient to
talk in the car.

825
00:48:21,257 --> 00:48:23,196
You'll stare a hole through
the photo.

826
00:48:23,411 --> 00:48:25,781
I once had a friend,

827
00:48:26,054 --> 00:48:28,154
and although we didn't
meet often,

828
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:31,854
we knew each other's faces as well as
every inch of each other's hearts.

829
00:48:32,114 --> 00:48:34,534
Don't you have something say?
Come sit down.

830
00:48:34,687 --> 00:48:36,368
I'm telling you already.

831
00:48:37,384 --> 00:48:40,114
She's a friend I met on
the internet.

832
00:48:40,461 --> 00:48:42,052
She is...

833
00:48:42,956 --> 00:48:44,769
Shin Ji Hyun.

834
00:48:48,334 --> 00:48:49,833
Shin Ji Hyun.

835
00:48:50,387 --> 00:48:52,351
<i>She is my friend.</i>

836
00:48:55,043 --> 00:48:57,329
<i>When I found out
that you were Kang Min Ho,</i>

837
00:48:57,527 --> 00:49:00,191
I was initially very happy
because you were her fiance.

838
00:49:00,707 --> 00:49:02,744
But when I found out about you
and Shin In Jung,

839
00:49:02,837 --> 00:49:04,197
I despised you.

840
00:49:04,518 --> 00:49:05,667
<i>And then it became like this.</i>

841
00:49:05,787 --> 00:49:07,197
Wait a second....

842
00:49:08,441 --> 00:49:10,033
Wait a second...

843
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:18,697
You...

844
00:49:19,232 --> 00:49:21,061
are Ji Hyun's friend?

845
00:49:21,557 --> 00:49:23,332
My internet nickname is...

846
00:49:23,571 --> 00:49:25,284
Park Jung Eun.

847
00:49:26,009 --> 00:49:27,158
Park Jung Eun?

848
00:49:27,211 --> 00:49:30,323
You haven't heard Shin In Jung
mention that name?

849
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,440
That person...

850
00:49:33,115 --> 00:49:35,186
is you?

851
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:37,389
How can that be?

852
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:40,480
Next time I come here,
that photo...

853
00:49:41,101 --> 00:49:43,763
<i>as well as the engagement photo
with Shin Ji Hyun,</i>

854
00:49:44,228 --> 00:49:46,100
I don't want to see them.

855
00:50:01,391 --> 00:50:02,577
Come in.

856
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:04,376
I've finished what I
came to say.

857
00:50:08,727 --> 00:50:10,445
What did you finish saying?

858
00:50:10,564 --> 00:50:12,768
What you were planning to say.

859
00:50:16,834 --> 00:50:17,585
Hey!

860
00:50:17,638 --> 00:50:19,990
Whether or not it's a lie,

861
00:50:20,231 --> 00:50:22,620
you can confirm it with
Kang Min Ho.

862
00:50:26,533 --> 00:50:29,102
Oppa, why are you standing
there like that?

863
00:50:29,497 --> 00:50:31,341
What did she say?

864
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:40,058
I heard about it.
Let me think it over.

865
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:42,178
She is Park Jung Eun.

866
00:50:42,244 --> 00:50:43,931
<i>Park Jung Eun is Song Yi Kyung.</i>

867
00:50:44,052 --> 00:50:45,664
In other words,
Song Yi Kyung is Ji Hyun's friend.

868
00:50:45,731 --> 00:50:47,104
I said, I've already
heard about it.

869
00:50:47,171 --> 00:50:49,174
Don't you find it suspicious?

870
00:50:49,845 --> 00:50:53,064
I'll think it over.
So please just leave.

871
00:50:53,104 --> 00:50:55,778
- Oppa.
<i>- Let me think about it alone!</i>

872
00:51:15,324 --> 00:51:17,071
<i>It's all over now.</i>

873
00:51:17,378 --> 00:51:20,174
<i>Kang Min Ho
won't give up so easily.</i>

874
00:51:20,724 --> 00:51:22,865
<i>If it ends like this with
Kang Min Ho,</i>

875
00:51:22,974 --> 00:51:25,578
<i>I won't be able
to find out anything more.</i>

876
00:51:26,387 --> 00:51:29,398
<i>Dad, what do I do?</i>

877
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:41,503
Why did In Jung leave
so soon?

878
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,932
Where is Kang Min Ho going?

879
00:52:31,037 --> 00:52:33,001
