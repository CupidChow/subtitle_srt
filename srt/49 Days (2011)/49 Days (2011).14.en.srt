3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,200
I... have found Song Yi Soo!

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,029
You want me to help find
where he is and what he's doing?

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,149
No Way!

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,380
That's not what I mean. Look at this.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,210
Here.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,939
[Song Yi Kyung] [Song Yi Soo]

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,040
Huh?

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,040
What... what is this?

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,380
This is...

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,560
me...

13
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,810
It's you, isn't it?

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,390
So you are Song Yi Soo!

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,229
The person unni loves is you.

16
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,639
You and unni were lovers.

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,110
Wait... wait a moment.

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,960
How could that be? You rushed all the
way here so early in the morning...

19
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,960
This is you!

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,739
It does look like me.

21
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,330
That's why I'm saying you are Song Yi Soo.

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,910
Song Yi Soo?

23
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,640
Look at this.

24
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,539
To Song Yi Kyung on her 20th birthday,

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,079
from Song Yi Soo who will celebrate
Yi Kyung's next 99 birthdays. Look at the heart.

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,350
A red heart with an arrow through it.

27
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,210
It's a romantic relationship, isn't it?

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,739
Didn't you say that the reason
you became a Scheduler

29
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,510
was to do something extremely important?

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,370
Then, could it be
because of Song Yi Kyung unni?

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,960
You're saying that I...

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,360
...loved this woman?

33
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,759
How could that be?

34
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,979
No! That's impossible!

35
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,790
Look at Song Yi Kyung.

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,129
You're saying that because of this woman,

37
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,309
I've suffered for 5 years as a Scheduler?

38
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,170
You've seen this unni scream
Yi Soo's name as she cried.

39
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,800
I'm sure it's because of you
that she became like this!

40
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,449
Think about it carefully.

41
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,960
Don't you remember any of it?

42
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,200
Of course, I don't remember.

43
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,990
I can't remember anything that happened
during my life until my term ends.

44
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,500
But...

45
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,710
why were you the one who found me?

46
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,780
Something must have gone wrong somewhere.

47
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,820
Don't tell me... this face is borrowed?

48
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,790
You can even borrow faces?

49
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,659
I mean this feels so strange!

50
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,649
Then, you should appear in front of
Song Yi Kyung unni and see what happens.

51
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,379
Can't you show yourself to people?

52
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,669
You really want to interfere
in our matters, as well?

53
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,379
When Schedulers appear in front of people
who knew them in life,

54
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,100
will naturally appear with another face.

55
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,619
If I appear to those who knew me,
wouldn't that mean I've risen from the dead?

56
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,580
If that's the case, wouldn't the rules
of the world be in complete disarray?

57
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,789
Also, it's absolutely impossible

58
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,330
that I would have a passionate romantic
relationship with this type of woman!

59
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,169
Didn't you say it was because you had
something extremely important to do?

60
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,829
It's also possible it's something else.

61
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,390
Because of parents, or like you,
because of revenge that I'm here.

62
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,480
You're an orphan!

63
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,979
Don't keep denying it.

64
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,899
Appear in front of unni
and be certain once and for all.

65
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,769
Then you'll know whether you had
any relationship with Song Yi Kyung unni.

66
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,519
Stop blindly pursuing this!

67
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,319
Don't I have to think about this, as well?

68
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,330
Leave! I'm telling you to leave!

69
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,420
You don't remember?

70
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,650
Bad fellow!

71
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,680
Unni is living like this because of him.

72
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,550
Why didn't he remember
even after he saw the photo?

73
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,650
<i>It's sad. It's crazy sad.</i>

74
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,580
How, how, how, how?

75
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,440
Sunbae, this is maknae*. (*youngest)

76
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,819
I want to bring forward
the fulfillment of the wish,

77
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,210
that I wanted to fulfill
at the end of my term...

78
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,000
This unni's temper is really...

79
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,910
I know that as well,

80
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,100
but someone has recognized me.
That's why I'm asking.

81
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,240
Yi Kyung unni is really pitiful.

82
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,800
She's living like this
because she can't forget Song Yi Soo.

83
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,210
<i>If I die,</i>

84
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,640
<i>I don't think there would be even a single
person who would remember me like that,</i>

85
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,970
<i>other than my mom and dad.</i>

86
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,860
<i>I've wasted three days
at Kang Min Ho's house.</i>

87
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,520
<i>I really miss Kang.</i>

88
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,880
<i>He must be really worried about me.</i>

89
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,990
<i>There wasn't any call
for the past three days.</i>

90
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,790
Looks like Kang isn't worried about me,
he's angry at me.

91
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,490
What has Kang Min Ho been up to?

92
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,989
I've made inquiries based on the address
on Song Yi Kyung's ID.

93
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,209
- She moved three years ago.
- Where did she move to?

94
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,470
As the address on her ID was not updated,
I was unable to find out.

95
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,339
Without an ID, how could she live?

96
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,250
She dated someone in the past,

97
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,850
but he died.

98
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,859
From then on, she stopped working.

99
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,249
She just stayed home, then after she used
up the security deposit, she moved out.

100
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,739
A man? He passed away?

101
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,189
It seems she discovered
that I was tailing her previously.

102
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,190
She hasn't appeared at Heaven
for the past few days.

103
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,859
She didn't go to Kang's restaurant, either?

104
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,609
I'll go there again today to check it out.

105
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,990
It would be faster if you'd go there
to find out if she resigned or not.

106
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,130
I understand. Thanks for your hard work.

107
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,129
Her lover has passed away.
So she's living as if she's given up hope.

108
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,810
<i>She's a friend I met at the Internet Cafe.</i>

109
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,880
That person is Shin Ji Hyun.

110
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,090
<i>So that's why the sentimental Shin Ji Hyun
was so compassionate towards her.</i>

111
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,630
<i>Kang also said it was to help her.</i>

112
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,960
[Shin In Jung]

113
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,770
Three days should have been enough
for you to have thought it through.

114
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,630
Have you had enough time to think?

115
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,560
Then, what do you plan to do now?

116
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,270
Kang already knows about our relationship,

117
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,439
and we don't know when
he'll tell Ji Hyun's parents.

118
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,940
Don't worry about Kang.

119
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,539
He's not that thoughtless.

120
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,860
What about Song Yi Kyung?

121
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,949
That woman also knows our plan.

122
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,449
Song Yi Kyung won't inform
Ji Hyun's parents, either.

123
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,410
Oppa, you know about it all?

124
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,530
Of that woman knowing our plan,

125
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,089
how did you find out?

126
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,350
It's not important how I found out.

127
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,199
She definitely won't say anything.
Don't worry.

128
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,700
Do you mean to say, the reason she won't
say anything is because she likes you?

129
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,830
Song Yi Kyung is not interested in you.

130
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,650
That woman clearly has an ulterior motive

131
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,790
in appearing around us.

132
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,219
If she were going to say anything,
she would have done so a long time ago,

133
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,860
whether to Kang or to Ji Hyun's parents.

134
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,500
You have confidence in that woman?

135
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,230
Isn't she Ji Hyun's friend?

136
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,060
That's not right, for all we know
she's pretending to be Ji Hyun's friend.

137
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,399
Don't tell me... you're planning
to continue to see Song Yi Kyung?

138
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,490
Talking to you like this,

139
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,990
I've realized the answer.

140
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,810
Yes. That's my answer.

141
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,880
Oppa.

142
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,099
I'm sorry, In Jung.

143
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,550
You can't, oppa.

144
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,320
You can't do this.

145
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,350
You know very well
how important a person you are to me.

146
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,680
You know better than anyone.

147
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,060
If I lose oppa as well,

148
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,730
you know I won't be able to endure.

149
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,870
What are you doing?

150
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,439
I know.

151
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,040
Then don't do this.

152
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,820
How could a person like you...

153
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,569
If only you set your mind to it,
you can do anything.

154
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,820
You're someone who plans very well.

155
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,600
When you first met me, because you were
going overseas to continue your studies,

156
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,600
you wanted to spare our feelings
so you stopped seeing me.

157
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,710
The promise you made, about me
not having to worry because of Ji Hyun,

158
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,410
you kept that promise for two years.

159
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,419
And here I am, unable to do that right now.

160
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,029
Oppa, don't you love me, too?

161
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,180
I did love you.

162
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,290
But my feelings have changed now.

163
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,580
- Now I can't go back. I can't do it.
- Really?

164
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,850
Can't you just let fate take its course?

165
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,830
No, I can't.

166
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,700
Did you think you just made
a two-year business deal with me?

167
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,630
Then starting now, I'm making
a business deal with you. So listen well.

168
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,880
Don't see Song Yi Kyung anymore.

169
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,359
Otherwise, I'll reveal everything
to Ji Hyun's father.

170
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,840
Don't do this, In Jung.

171
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,329
What will you get by doing this?

172
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,739
What then do I get by suffering in silence?

173
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,099
Hiding your background,
betraying your friend,

174
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,620
all these ridiculous things
were because of emotions.

175
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,070
Emotions are things you can't control.
And you're blaming my emotions?

176
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,110
How could I control my emotions?

177
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,980
Then, it's even harder for me.

178
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,940
Although it's only been a month for you,

179
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,360
I have loved you...

180
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,020

<i>Park Jung Eun is someone

186

A dead person?

187
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,530
Park Jung Eun is someone
who died a year ago?

188
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,840
What about Song Yi Kyung...
Who could she be?

189
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:20,240
<i>Kang said that
Song Yi Kyung is Ji Hyun's friend.</i>

190

<i>I might not be able to work
for a few days.</i>

194
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,650
It's been four days. Where has she been?

195
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,370
I'm back.

196
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,719
Ahjussi, how did it go?

197
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,829
I went everywhere from the Gyeonggi-do temples
to psychics,

198
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:02,700
but I still haven't found out anything
regarding the 49 day traveler,

199
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,460
and haven't found out the conditions
for coming back to life, either.

200
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,089
I'm sorry.

201
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:07,909
What's there to be sorry about?

202
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,880
Your feet must be sore. Have a seat.

203
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,800
I heard that Ji Hyun didn't
come to work today, either.

204
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,899
Have you been to her house?

205
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,559
Of course, I went.
It looked like Ji Hyun wasn't in.

206
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,810
It seems like Song Yi Kyung
lives by herself.

207
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,789
I went to take a look every morning,

208
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,580
but Ji Hyun never once came out.

209
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,970
It's like she went somewhere else.

210
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,460
Where do you think she went?

211
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,869
How is the Hae Mi Do project going?

212
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,619
Have you asked around?

213
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,540
All three sections of Hae Mi Do
have been bought by HM Industries.

214
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,389
The party who is selling Ji Hyun's land

215
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,070
is someone called Park Seung Jae.

216
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,030
However, that person can't be found at all.

217
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:46,470
This one, that's 270,000 square feet,
was originally owned by Jun Sae Company,

218
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,250
but less than 6 months after being sold,
construction was halted completely.

219
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,020
I'm not certain about that.

220
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,029
So?

221
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:58,659
It looks like HM Company is a
paper company set up to sell the land.

222
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,220
Paper company?

223
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,099
What about the parent company?

224
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,449
It's a bogus company!

225
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,060
A bogus company?

226
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,399
I still need to check it out.

227
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,469
Let's talk again after I meet Oh sunbae.

228
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,900
Only you would think like that.

229
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,840
If it was me I would have exploded
a long time ago. Exploded.

230
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,949
No matter how I think about it,

231
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,289
the only ways to show your sincerity
are through money and gifts.

232
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,749
What importance can feelings have?

233
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,090
You can't even see them.

234
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,929
But haven't I said that's not it?

235
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,629
I don't know, either.

236
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,819
I think so, too!

237
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,549
How can it be like that
between a harmonious couple like yourselves?

238
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,850
That's right, right?

239
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,179
He even went somewhere on his own overnight.

240
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,930
I don't know anymore, either.

241
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,320
I'm here.

242
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,029
- Yi Kyung, did you have a nice holiday?
- What?

243
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,670
President said that Yi Kyung
went on holiday.

244
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,220
Where did you go?

245
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,079
Excuse me,

246
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,009
you didn't give me permission so...

247
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,029
Have you finished your important matters?

248
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,669
What?

249
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,430
Looks like you haven't finished.

250
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,769
How did you know?

251
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,379
It's written on your face.

252
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,730

254
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,700

255
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,860
[To whoever finds this letter: Please give to
Minseng Hospital, Rm. 507, Shin Il Shik]

256
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,310
Why can't you answer?

257
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,399
I'm asking you whether
you really like Kang Min Ho.

258
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,879
Why should I answer your question?

259
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,950
Because I was thinking that if you
really like him, I'll let you have him.

260
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,320
But there's no need to, right?

261
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,320
Because you're not interested
in Kang Min Ho.

262
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,100
If you're not interested in him, then what
reason do you have for getting close to him?

263
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,060
What game are you playing?

264
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,009
I don't have to tell you that, either.

265
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,300
I know you're not Ji Hyun's friend.

266
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,930
When did you get to know Ji Hyun?

267
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,509
Why are you interviewing Ji Hyun's friends?

268
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,929
Why have you finished it
but not shown it to Ji Hyun?

269
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,629
Why didn't you contact Seo Woo?

270
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,509
Why didn't you ask to interview me?

271
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,089
Because you're not Ji Hyun's friend.

272
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:34,369
Ji Hyun didn't know anything
before the traffic accident.

273
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,049
Why do you think she didn't know anything?

274
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,700
That's why I'm saying
you're definitely not a friend of Ji Hyun.

275
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,580
Because Ji Hyun is an innocent child
who was completely fooled by me.

276
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,510
If she had any friends
that I didn't know about,

277
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,630
then she wouldn't have been taken in by me.

278
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,409
You clearly know about
my and Min Ho oppa's plan,

279
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,200
yet you haven't revealed anything.

280
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,380
That would clearly demonstrate
that you are in love with Kang Min Ho,

281
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,200
but I sense something different.

282
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:06,000
If you were Ji Hyun's friend,
of course you would hate me...

283
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,329
but you're clinging to Kang Min Ho
to show your contempt for me.

284
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,299
That you can't explain, right?

285
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,720
There seem to be many
inexplicable things in this world.

286
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,960
In Jung, then why did you do that?

287
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:20,260
To someone who fully trusted you,
someone who's truly sincere to others,

288
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,419
why did you do those things?

289
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,880
Ji Hyun isn't the one who showed me.

290
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,600
Because she was always that kind of person.

291
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,539
What do you mean?

292
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,989
Didn't Ji Hyun ever tell you about me?

293
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,510
God didn't give her any siblings,

294
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,370
but instead gave her
Shin In Jung and Park Seo Woo.

295
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,049
She said that they are friends that
she wouldn't regret giving anything to.

296
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:43,259
She said before
that she wanted to give you everything.

297
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,240
That's why I did it.

298
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,570
I wanted to give her something
but had nothing to give.

299
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,320
I wanted her to become like me.

300
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,889
Someone who wouldn't be able
to say that she'd give everything.

301
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,189
What does that mean?

302
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,780
Your level of comprehension
is really similar to Ji Hyun's.

303
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,480
You're obviously not friends.

304
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,930
Then why are you're still pretending
to be her friend...

305
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,290
aren't you going to explain to me?

306

307
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,010
Rather than wasting such effort on me,

308
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,430
you should set your focus on Kang Min Ho.

What am I thinking?

345
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,990
You're a really persistent fellow.

346
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,290
What is it this time?

347
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,689
Today, I have something to ask you.

348
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,859
What?

349
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,399
Father, do you feel that Ji Hyun's
not here anymore?

350
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,810
You rascal!

351
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,050
Ji Hyun is still alive.

352
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,810
Of course, she's still alive.

353
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,260
Although Ji Hyun is in this state,

354
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,679
Ji Hyun's soul,

355
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,320
Ji Hyun's heart,
where do you think it is?

356
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,890
Ji Hyun's mom,

357
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,459
what is with this child?

358
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:56,820
It's not time for Ji Hyun's soul
to return to her own body, yet.

359
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,629
For all we know
it's wandering around somewhere.

360
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,959
What are you trying to say?

361
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,780
If she's still alive,
she'll be in that state.

362
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,079
Maybe she's in this hospital room,

363
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,500
constantly watching over you.

364
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,460
Actually, it could be possible.

365
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,700
If I were Ji Hyun,

366
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,569
I would go die.

367
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,510
What?

368
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,239
I would be unable to tell my father,

369
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,730
that rather than postponing his surgery
to wait for me to wake up...

370
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,829
I would rather die,

371
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,499
so father would undergo surgery.
It's possible she's thinking like that.

372
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,839
It's not enough that you threaten me,
you even dare to scare me?

373
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,620
That father's surgery won't be successful,
I fear that, as well.

374
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,310
But, you can't continue like this.

375
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,259
You really can't continue like this anymore.

376
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,830
Do you have anything else in mind
about Ji Hyun?

377
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,633
Ji Hyun...

378
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:56,990
is not my type.

379
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,460
Since she's not,

380
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,529
why are you here being so persistent?

381
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,000
About that,

382
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,990
after your successful surgery,
I will tell you everything.

383
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,410
Min Ho.

384
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,390
Min Ho... Min Ho.

385
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,010
Min Ho.

386
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,060
Min Ho.

387
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,420
Min Ho.

388
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,090
<i>Min Ho.</i>

389
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,610
<i>Min... Min Ho.</i>

390
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,090
<i>Min Ho...</i>

391
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,169
<i>I said Song Yi Kyung's my friend.</i>

392
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,860
<i>Does he still want to meet?</i>

393
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,609
I trust that you've been well,
Song Yi Kyung.

394
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,349
Whether that's a blessing or a curse,

395
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,279
I'm still unclear.

396
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,020
You're Ji Hyun's friend.

397
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,650
Ji Hyun recommended you
to work in Kang's restaurant.

398
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,609
Kang has also spoken up for you.

399
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,980
Is that everything?

400
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,179
Is there anything else you're hiding?

401
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,610
Right, there's nothing else.

402
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,520
If I had told you
would you have believed it?

403
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,690
Are you someone
who believes what people say?

404
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,780
You're someone who knows
how to steal a woman's heart.

405
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,480
I finally know why
I feel so comfortable with you.

406
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,649
You understand me very well.

407
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,919
We're very alike.

408
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,780
Actually, we're not a good match.

409
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,480
Don't work at Kang's place anymore.

410
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,609
You want me to leave the restaurant?

411
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,120
Then even if you're with me,

412
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,219
you still want to remain
at Kang's restaurant?

413
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,879
I still haven't considered
whether we'll see each other again.

414
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,699
I'll arrange another job for you.

415
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,570
Stop working immediately tomorrow.

416
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,999
Let's talk while eating sujebi*.
I'm hungry. (*hand torn noodle soup)

417
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,330
You really want to eat sujebi
at that restaurant?

418
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,680
We didn't eat get to eat sujebi that day.
You don't remember?

419
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,230
At this restaurant, who did you
come with before?

420
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,400
Your mother, Shin In Jung, me, Shin Ji Hyun?

421
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,879
Ah! You did say
you never came with Ji Hyun, right?

422
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,689
This doesn't seem like a question
Song Yi Kyung would ask.

423
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,340
That's so trite.

424
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,340
That's true.

425
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:28,289
Then, the most important person
to Kang Min Ho...

426
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,400
It's okay if we talk about your mother?

427
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,480
How old is your mother?

428
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,679
She's 60.

429
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,490
That's quite young!

430
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,430
So she's going to be 60 next year.

431
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,910
When is her birthday?

432
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,610
Why are you so concerned about my mother?

433
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:48,520
Because she was the one
who brought you up.

434
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,680
What was she like?

435
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,670
In order to bring me up,

436
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,029
she allowed herself to be
bruised and battered.

437
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,370
That's my mother.

438
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,779
Shouldn't you ask about my birthday first?

439
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,180
Have you forgotten that there's nothing
Ji Hyun and I don't talk about?

440
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,149
Then what about your birthday?

441
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,410
You haven't answered my question, yet.

442
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,540
I asked when your mother's birthday is.

443
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,949
Unless it's your strategy
to not reveal personal details

444
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,490
to someone you've been seeing briefly?

445
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,100
If that's the case, I won't ask anymore.

446
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,810
January 10.

447
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,120
That's when it's cold.

448
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,180
Song Yi Kyung's birthdate is
8 November 1984.

449
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,020
Who do you celebrate your birthday with?

450
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,260
That doesn't sound like a question
Kang Min Ho would ask, either.

451
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,940
So trite, yet you asked.

452
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,600
<i>10 January, 60 years old.</i>

453
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,019
<i>If she's 60 this year,</i>

454
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,170
<i>she would have been born in 1952, I guess.</i>

455
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,320
Please follow that bus.

456
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,200
This is unni's bag.

457
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,690
I need to sew it up.

458
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,870
Unni.

459
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,120
How was it the last few days I wasn't here?

460
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,670
Today I finally...

461
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,460
Unni...

462
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,920
Song Yi Soo has indeed passed away.

463
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,380
Is it because you can't forget him,

464
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,740
that you lived like this
for the past 5 years?

465
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,390
Something happened
between the two of you, right?

466
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:11,940
That's why Song Yi Soo volunteered
to be a Scheduler.

467
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,280
Wait a little longer.

468
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,220
I will have him,

469
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,520
come see you again.

470
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,160
I really hope that
if I come back to life,

471
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,000
I'll be able to see you again.

472
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,500
That way, at least, I won't let you
feel lonely anymore.

473
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,240
Why has he been standing there
since earlier?

474
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,089
Really. This is a disgrace for a Scheduler.

475
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,580
I really do anything?

476
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,320
Cafe mocha, large.

477
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,720
Extra cream.

478
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,220
5,300 won.

479
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,480
Customer, you have to pay first here.

480
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,050
I know.

481
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,670
Please wait a moment.

482
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,250
No, no... No, no.

483
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,380
Shouldn't she look like that?
At least, to match my style.

484
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,870
No, no.

485
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,140
They wouldn't be my type, either.

486
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,170
That type of woman...

487
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,820
Doesn't seem to be, either.

488
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,130
I actually loved that woman before?

489
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,560
It's really hard to believe.
It's hard to believe.

490
00:31:57,413 --> 00:32:00,566
<i>~ You are breathing ~</i>

491
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:04,107
<i>~ you are living ~</i>

492
00:32:04,108 --> 00:32:08,278
<i>~ inside my heart ~</i>

493
00:32:10,939 --> 00:32:13,009
<i>~ Tears keep flowing ~</i>

494
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,160
Your cafe mocha's ready.

495
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:18,203
<i>~ Cold tears are flowing ~</i>

496
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:22,558
<i>~ inside my heart ~</i>

497
00:32:25,189 --> 00:32:37,633
<i>~My heart hurts, and it hurts because of you~</i>

498
00:32:38,096 --> 00:32:44,727
<i>~I long for you in the day, Oh how I long for you~</i>

499
00:32:44,728 --> 00:32:46,843
<i>~ I miss you so much ~</i>

500
00:32:46,878 --> 00:32:51,768
<i>~ and tears fall again ~</i>

501
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,890
<i>~ You are breathing ~</i>

502
00:32:54,925 --> 00:32:56,270
She didn't recognize me.

503
00:32:58,141 --> 00:32:59,571
<i>~ inside my heart ~</i>

504
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,650
Is she really related to me?

505
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,870
<i>15 days, 4 hours and 29 minutes left.</i>

506
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,020
The letter.

507
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,360
Where did it go?

508
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,530
Looks like it fell out of this.

509
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,150
What do I do? What do I do?

510
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,440
What do I do?

511
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,850
Where on earth did it fall?

512
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,610
What do I do
if someone really gives it to my dad?

513
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,030
If I reveal who I really am,

514
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,550
I wouldn't die immediately, would I?

515
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,569
I heard that someone found this

516
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,760
and left it at the nurses' station.

517
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,740
What is this?

518
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,039
<i>Father,</i>

519
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,720
<i>This is Ji Hyun.</i>

520
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,900
This is from Ji Hyun.

521
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,270
Ji Hyun?

522
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,860
Our Ji Hyun?

523
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,450
It's really hot!

524
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,300
I told you before
never to reveal your real identity,

525
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,660
Shin Ji Hyun.

526
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,260
I...

527
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:51,520
Is this the end for me now?

528
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,019
Am I dead?

529
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,470
Shin Ji Hyun traveler,

530
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:00,040
I'm informing you, that you've been
taken off the 49 days journey.

531
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,340
Take the elevator, Shin Ji Hyun.

532
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,460
No, no.

533
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,179
<i>Maybe she's in this hospital room,</i>

534
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,030
<i>constantly watching over you.</i>

535
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,129
<i>I would rather die,</i>

536
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:42,290
<i>so father would undergo surgery.
It's possible she's thinking like that.</i>

537
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,440
Ji Hyun.

538
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,980
Could it be really be true?

539
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,600
Was it really you?

540
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,520
[An American woman regained
consciousness from a 20-year coma]

541
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,169
After I came that time,

542
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,900
you said that the woman
named Park Jung Eun had just left.

543
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:39,929
Are you sure?

544
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,410
That's what I said.

545
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:45,059
But, I didn't see her when I came in.

546
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,690
That's impossible.

547
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,469
Did she hide somewhere?

548
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:52,639
That woman, what did she say to
Ji Hyun's mother?

549
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,109
That I do not know.

550
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,989
But it seemed like
she was very close to Ji Hyun.

551
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,870
She even knew that Madam
doesn't eat beef rib soup.

552
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,040
<i>She hid in order to avoid me.</i>

553
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:25,010
<i>She knew the placement of the things
in Ji Hyun's room,</i>

554
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,919
<i>and also knew mother's food preferences.</i>

555
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,240
<i>She even has the same handwriting.</i>

556
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,220
Why do I keep thinking...

557
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,690
that she resembles Ji Hyun?

558
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,459
Our daughter is still lying here.

559
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,719
Why are you looking at photos
in front of her?

560
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,060
It's unlucky!

561
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,150
Honey, I...

562
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,780
Actually,

563
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,889
I'm thankful that at least
Ji Hyun can breathe like this.

564
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:21,750
At least this way,
she can always be by our side.

565
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,320
Fine.

566
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,360
So be it.

567
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,400
Even if I'm not here anymore,

568
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,710
she can be by your side forever.

569
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,080
However, you must abide by your promise.

570
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,619
What... what do you mean by that?

571
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,900
This girl...

572
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:47,359
Even if she lies here
for as long as five or ten years,

573
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,710
even if just by yourself,
you have to persevere to the end.

574
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,940
I don't want to hear Ji Hyun blaming me,

575
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,350
so I am going for surgery.

576
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,500
Honey!

577
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,239
It's really good to hear that!

578
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,160
Yes.

579
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,249
Yes. Thanks for calling me, mother.

580
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,430
Thank you!

581
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,390
Ji Hyun's father has agreed
to undergo surgery?

582
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,610
Yes, he's agreed.

583
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,029
That's great!

584
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,110
Quick, go call Ji Hyun.

585
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,519
But what should I do with this?

586
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,729
She'd be terribly worried
if she knew she'd lost this.

587
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,520
Just hurry up and call her first.

588
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,459
Jung Eun.

589
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,789
Did you receive any letter or the like?

590
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,220
Letter?

591
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,469
Did father go somewhere?

592
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,530
He went to see Doctor Jo?

593
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,610
He agreed to undergo surgery.

594
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,700
Really?

595
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:54,560
He really agreed to undergo surgery?

596
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,870
That's great!

597
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,410
It's really good to hear that.

598
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:04,519
Why did he suddenly decide
to agree to undergo surgery?

599
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,670
It's all because of our Ji Hyun's friend.

600
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,710
That's right. We owe it all
to your restaurant's president.

601
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,389
Our restaurant's president? Han Kang?

602
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:17,199
He's been here a few times,
each time trying his best to convince him.

603
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,999
The way he said every single word...

604
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,369
He speaks so well.

605
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:24,259
It was President Han Kang
who persuaded Ji Hyun's father?

606
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:29,000
It looks like,
he is interested in Ji Hyun.

607
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:32,370
This whole time...

608
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,850
Look at those roses.

609
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,569
Pink roses.

610
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:39,210
He has continually been refreshing them.

611
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,120
Those roses...

612
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,350
<i>Pick up the phone.</i>

613
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,240
<i>Quick, pick up the phone.</i>

614
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,749
<i>Pick up the phone.</i>

615
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,940
[Han Kang]

616
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,300
<i>Quick, pick up the phone.</i>

617
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,309
Hello.

618
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,509
<i>There's an emergency at the restaurant,</i>

619
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,690
<i>come over now.</i>

620
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,040
Thank you.

621
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,240
Thank you.

622
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,010
Thank you.

623
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,770
Could it be, just now...

624
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,809
Park Jung Eun also heard about the surgery?

625
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,039
Yes.

626
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,040
She was so happy.

627
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,940
I was even more grateful.

628
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,480
<i>Ji Hyun...</i>

629
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,320
<i>What is going on?</i>

630
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,460
<i>You're obviously here.</i>

631
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,070
<i>Why can I feel in Song Yi Kyung</i>

632
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,020
<i>your presence?</i>

633
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,399
What's the matter?

634
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,469
Hurry to the locker room and change quickly
then come out again.

635
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,420
What?

636
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,550
Okay.

637
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:00,000
I shouldn't be staying here at this time.

638
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,259
I need to be keeping watch at the hospital,

639
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,870
to see if anyone delivers the letter.

640
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:15,671
<i>~ And how much my heart aches ~</i>

641
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:24,521
<i>My cell phone.
~ I miss you so much, through the ravages of ~</i>

642
00:43:24,522 --> 00:43:29,522
<i>~ the passage of time ~</i>

643
00:43:31,021 --> 00:43:33,821
<i>~ My tired footsteps ~</i>

644
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:37,122
<i>~ bring me to your side ~</i>

645
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,323
<i>~ unknowingly ~</i>

646
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:42,724
<i>~ Even though I know there's nothing ~</i>

647
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:47,225
<i>~ I can do for you ~</i>

648
00:43:47,226 --> 00:43:54,469
<i>~ I love you ~
~ words I keep shouting in my heart ~</i>

649
00:43:54,504 --> 00:44:02,092
<i>~ I love you ~
~ words I can only whisper behind your back ~</i>

650
00:44:02,127 --> 00:44:07,419
<i>~ I love you ~
~ words that I can't speak for fear they will disappear ~</i>

651
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,500
What did he want with my bag?

652
00:44:09,501 --> 00:44:17,501
<i>~ I love you so much it scares me ~</i>

653
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,560
This...

654
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,940
Kang must have read it!

655
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,049
What do you mean she didn't come out?
I clearly saw her come out.

656
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,890
I already said she didn't come out!

657
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:42,930
Song Yi Kyung!

658
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,730
What to do? What to do?
It seems that I've been found out.

659
00:44:55,590 --> 00:45:00,089
Kang... Han Kang seems to have
read the letter I wrote.

660
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,390
No, he's read it. He's read it.

661
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:08,319
I wrote it for my dad
when I was afraid I'd die suddenly.

662
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,919
If I couldn't come back to life
after the 49 days are over,

663
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,690
I warned him to be wary of
Kang Min Ho in the letter.

664
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,940
Han Kang seems to have read that letter.

665
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,290
The necklace is still intact.

666
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:26,899
How come it's okay? Why didn't it shatter?

667
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,949
Didn't you say that if I revealed
my identity, I would definitely be dead?

668
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:32,880
Looks like it's because he'd already deduced
the situation before he read the letter.

669
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:34,420
What?

670
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,110
That's why the necklace didn't shatter.

671
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,689
If people discover you
before you reveal yourself,

672
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,620
you wouldn't be considered at fault.

673
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,859
Can that be? Is that also possible?

674
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:50,820
Amongst the 49 day travelers,
about 11% of the time,

675
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:53,500
familiar people deduce the situation.

676
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,900
Then, you won't take me away?

677
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:59,849
But that doesn't mean that
you can act recklessly with Han Kang!

678
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:03,479
Until the 49 days' journey is over,
you can never reveal yourself.

679
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,080
I got it.

680
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,879
But why is Han Kang pretending not to know?

681
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,170
If you're finished, please leave.

682
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:14,819
Have you remembered Song Yi Kyung unni?

683
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,310
Before my term of duty is over
I will definitely not be able to remember.

684
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,639
Anyhow, you're just a troublemaker!

685
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,259
Why did you interfere
and vexed this Scheduler?!

686
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,250
So you're vexed.

687
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:29,809
But didn't you say
you don't feel human emotions?

688
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:32,839
I'm gradually regaining human emotions now.
Why?

689
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,629
Because my term of duty as a Scheduler
is ending soon.

690
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:37,479
Then think of a way
that'll let you regain your memory sooner.

691
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,869
Since Unni's situation is able
to make you so uncomfortable,

692
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:42,250
it must be that your heart is hurting.

693
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:44,700
I don't know!

694
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,740
<i>Are you... Ji Hyun?</i>

695
00:46:59,100 --> 00:46:59,849
You're Ji Hyun right?

696
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,569
Song Yi Kyung appeared in my dreams,

697
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:04,829
saying that she was Shin Ji Hyun,
and asked me to save her.

698
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,489
I sleepwalk sometimes.

699
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,719
<i>It's also possible to fall in love
with someone who is already engaged.</i>

700
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,099
She really is Ji Hyun's friend.

701
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,319
<i>It's because someone like you
who has a huge appetite didn't eat,</i>

702
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,700
<i>that you're so hungry
you can't walk steadily.</i>

703
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,560
<i>Han Kang, so it's because you know
that you treat me like that.</i>

704
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:23,900
<i>I don't have a girlfriend,
but I have a woman I like.</i>

705
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,739
<i>This woman, that woman...</i>

706
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,049
Is giving encouragement
to every woman your hobby?

707
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:30,090
Not just any woman!

708
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:35,070
<i>Is it not Song Yi Kyung unni...
but me instead?</i>

709
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,070
<i>Is Han Kang in love with me?</i>

710
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,330
<i>What do I do?</i>

711
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,370
It's killing me.

712
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,840
So this is how it is when you're unable
to say anything. So it's like this!

713
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,330
Yet I can't ask her directly,

714
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,450
nor can I acknowledge her.

715
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,510
Where have you been?

716
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:12,279
What's the matter with you?
Did something happen?

717
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,680
You... In future, you...

718
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:16,469
When you step out,

719
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,669
go out, get off work,
or go away for a while,

720
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,950
you should let me know before you leave.
Huh?

721
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,670
Because you ran off like a crazy person.

722
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,500
Don't you agree?

723
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,540
You're right.

724
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,870
I ran off like a crazy woman.

725
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,570
That's not what I meant.

726
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,810
Is everything all right?

727
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:44,570
Are you alright?

728
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,840
Then that's fine. Let's go in.

729
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:51,799
But, didn't you say there was
something urgent at the restaurant?

730
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,020
Oh, that...

731
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,580
My friend Ji Hyun...

732
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,799
Her father decided to undergo surgery.

733
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,959
I know.

734
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,769
You know? How did you know?

735
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,720
I've been to the hospital.

736
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,969
Thank you.

737
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:10,850
Thanks? What for?

738
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:16,190
Because you convinced Ji Hyun's father
to accept the surgery.

739
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,640
I'm thanking you on Ji Hyun's behalf.

740
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,340
Shin Ji Hyun is also my friend.

741
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:30,160
Shin Ji Hyun is very fortunate...

742
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,180
to have two people fighting
to call themselves her friend.

743
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:37,770
<i>President!</i>

744
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,530
I went there already.

745
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:45,149
Are you stupid?

746
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,150
How many times must I repeat myself
before you understand?

747
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,940
I've told you before to watch what you say.

748
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,370
Let's hurry in.

749
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:01,610
What's going on?
He's behaving suspiciously.

750
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,650
Who is it? What does he look like?

751
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:10,900
Regardless, thanks for telling me,
Director Lee.

752
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:13,180
Yes, see you.

753
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:18,890
It seems like someone is inquiring
about the sale of Hae Mi Do.

754
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,610
This is Song Yi Kyung's address.

755
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,060
Thanks for your hard work.

756
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:31,860
Take this.

757
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,049
Thank you.

758
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:39,149
Go to Hae Mi Do to meet
the property developer Director Lee.

759
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:40,210
Understood.

760
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:48,440
[Han Kang]

761
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,169
What do you mean you know everything?
You're even asking me to let it all go?

762
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:06,100
I know all about how you're planning
to manage Ji Hyun's family's company,

763
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:07,970
so I'm asking you to let it all go.

764
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:11,300
What I mean by asking you
to let it all go is

765
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:13,569
even if Ji Hyun's father's surgery
is unsuccessful,

766
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,070
you must also refuse the terms of the will.

767
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,989
Your affiliation with Shin Il Group,
Hae Mi Do,

768
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:21,959
and the promotional activities,
I want you to give them all up.

769
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,530
Kang, it's you who should give up.
You can't stop me.

770
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,479
Hyung.

771
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:32,360
I don't care how you found out,
or how much you know.

772
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,299
Ji Hyun is no longer around,
so you're on my side.

773
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,689
Hyung, you really don't know me.

774
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:38,830
Even if President Shin's surgery
is successful,

775
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:40,789
he won't be able to continue
running the company in his condition.

776
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:42,660
But it's not your company, either.

777
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,269
It has nothing to do
with President Shin's brain tumor.

778
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,040
You joined hands with Hyuk San Industries.

779
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,560
So it was you.

780
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,939
When did you start investigating m...

781
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:54,400
I really couldn't believe
that you could be such a person.

782
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,220
Why did you do such a thing?

783
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:59,100
Did Ji Hyun's parents offend you in any way?

784
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,429
Or do you love money that much?

785
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:03,550
Neither Ji Hyun's parents
nor Ji Hyun offended me,

786
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,649
nor is it because of money.

787
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:06,150
Then, what is the reason?

788
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:08,569
Why would you do something like this

789
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:09,909
to people who have didn't offend you?

790
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:11,489
Why must you take what's theirs?

791
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:15,030
I'm just using my own two hands
to change my future.

792
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:15,970
What?

793
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:20,010
It's just that President Shin and Ji Hyun
were extremely unlucky.

794
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:22,659
Just like how my luck was very bad at birth.

795
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:25,560
Are you venting your anger
for being born in difficult circumstances

796
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,369
at Ji Hyun's family?

797
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:28,530
Venting my anger?

798
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,960
How could someone like you
possibly understand?

799
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,419
How could you, who encountered good parents,
possibly understand?

800
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,949
Don't blame the circumstances.

801
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,329
No one is able to choose
the circumstances of their birth.

802
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:42,269
That's up to the Gods,
and not for us to choose for ourselves.

803
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:44,870
The circumstance of our birth
is just a matter of luck.

804
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,630
A fellow like you can say that.

805
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:50,070
Kang, you are someone
who lives in your memories, right?

806
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:51,360
Your parents,

807
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:55,949
especially your mother. You're still
struggling with the painful memories of her.

808
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:57,859
Even though you are incredibly gifted,

809
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,380
you are just scraping by at the wine bar.

810
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:02,209
Even though you are enmeshed in the past,

811
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:04,819
that has no bearing on your life now.

812
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,640
Stop quibbling!

813
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,750
You...

814
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:14,289
Have you ever been beaten every day,

815
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:17,080
that it is how you start to know
what the world is like?

816
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:20,420
To not even have rice to eat
when you were 4 years old,

817
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:23,290
and not be able to get any milk from
your mom, no matter how much you suckled.

818
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:27,380
A time when even if you bit off mom's nipple
and ate it, you'd still be hungry?

819
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:30,450
To have a father who
because of a gambling addiction,

820
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:35,370
even snatched away his wife's compact
who'd labored all day to make a bet,

821
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,499
who lived drinking soju like we'd eat rice.

822
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:41,590
What it feels like to be the son of a father
who'd use his wife as a stake,

823
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,670
do you know?

824
00:53:46,871 --> 00:53:49,771
When I was 13,
father died of alcohol poisoning.

825
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:53,800
That was the happiest day of my life
since I was born.

826
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:56,809
I didn't even collect father's body,

827
00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:00,030
and escaped in the middle of the night
with my mom, crying tears of joy.

828
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:05,100
Finally, I wouldn't have to suffer
any more beatings.

829
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:09,869
But do you know what awaited me,

830
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:12,030
as a result of not having to suffer
any more beatings?

831
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,270
The miserable feeling of starvation.

832
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:16,979
Feeling so miserable, I wanted to die.

833
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,290
Insults, disregard, indifference.

834
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:22,300
Do you know how difficult it was for my mom;
a woman over 40 with a son,

835
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:25,860
who barely graduated middle school and

836
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,220
lacked educational qualifications to seek refuge
in the city and bring up that 13 year-old son?

837
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,930
In the winter, because of frostbite,
her hands and feet would be all blistered.

838
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:38,010
In the summer, her whole body
would be soaked with sweat.

839
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:41,150
To provide a room
where mother and son could stay,

840
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:43,840
to bring up her son,
and let that son go to school.

841
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,339
Hyung.

842
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,490
I asked countless times,

843
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,189
why my mom and I had to live like this.

844
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:52,610
What have we done wrong?
Who have we wronged?

845
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:56,709
No one ever answered.

846
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,679
It wasn't Ji Hyun's family
that made you like that.

847
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,160
As I've said before,

848
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:03,779
just like we were unlucky, it's just that
Ji Hyun's family was also unlucky.

849
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,579
No matter how you put it, hyung...

850
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,460
Why are you venting your anger on Ji Hyun's
family, who hasn't done anything wrong?

851
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,950
Not to mention,
you also stole Ji Hyun's heart.

852
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:14,460
Don't you feel sorry towards Ji Hyun?

853
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,650
Why would I be sorry?

854
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,270
Then who should I be angry at?

855
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,890
Towards the Gods?

856
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:24,180
God, Buddha, and the rest?

857
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:29,910
The Gods made me suffer, so why is it wrong
that I similarly make people suffer?

858
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,939
But they were very lucky at birth, so they
have already enjoyed what they should enjoy.

859
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:34,930
Hyung.

860
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:38,440
I'm not actually targeting
President Shin Il Shik or Shin Ji Hyun,

861
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:43,210
but rather the fate
that gave me such a dismal life.

862
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:46,490
I want to change by my own hands

863
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,550
the fate that made me have
such a miserable life.

864
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:51,520
It's not right. That's not right.

865
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:54,870
No matter how much you've suffered,

866
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,889
you've done wrong.

867
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:59,099
If you haven't lived as I have,

868
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,940
then don't use this society's laws
and rules and ethics to judge me.

869
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,120
So?

870
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,819
You don't plan to stop?

871
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,349
Because there is no reason to stop.

872
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,360
Then what can I do?

873
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,760
I will stop you.

874
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:14,060
Just try it.

875
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,860
Yes, I will try.

876
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,510
Although your life
is going to be lamentable,

877
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:28,630
but I can't let innocent people
pay the price.

878
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:40,600
<i>Seo Woo, take a look at this.</i>

879
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,170
This is written by Ji Hyun?

880
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:44,149
Isn't it?

881
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,330
What is this? A letter from Ji Hyun?

882
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,610
What's the matter with you?

883
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:52,360
In Jung,
what's the matter with you recently?

884
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:53,880
Did something happen?

885
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:58,349
Seo Woo,
are there really ghosts in this world?

886
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:01,540
No. Do ghosts really exist?

887
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,020
Do you believe in such things?

888
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,569
Do you believe that spirits
can enter other people's bodies?

889
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:08,549
Isn't that possession?

890
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,540
Aren't people like that called possessed?

891
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,440
In Jung.

892
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:43,529
What are you doing here?

893
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:45,750
Oppa, I have something to ask of you,

894
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:48,810
but you asked me
not to enter uninvited, so...

895
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:53,320
Why are you shaking like that?
Is something wrong?

896
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:10,590
Shin In Jung, have you really gone crazy?
Why are you like this?

897
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,690
I also feel I've gone crazy.

898
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:16,519
So tell me, am I crazy?

899
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,579
Do you think it's possible
that Song Yi Kyung is Ji Hyun?

900
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,810
That's why I want you to verify it.

901
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:26,130
Oppa, this is not because of jealousy.

902
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:29,110
Even if your heart has changed,
don't you know me?

903
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:31,419
Think about the time when we were together.

904
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,519
No matter what...

905
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:36,759
Treat Song Yi Kyung as Ji Hyun.
Just once would be enough.

906
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,820
Also, think about what I said.

907
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,660
And help me understand. Please.

908
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:53,850
Yi Kyung.

909
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:06,290
I have to make a condolence visit in Daejeon,
so I came to see you on the way there.

910
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,570
Yes.

911
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,610
Why have you stopped coming
for the hypnosis treatment?

912
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,960
Hypnosis treatment?

913
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,300
What's the matter?

914
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,490
Nothing.

915
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,930
I'm a bit unwell.

916
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,520
The first steps could be difficult,
but you can't give up halfway, Yi Kyung.

917
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:30,769
Compounded with strange actions recently...

918
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,430
I have to go in now.

919
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:36,990
Yi Kyung...

920
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:47,530
What to do? What to do? What to do?

921
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:00,800
<i>The password is incorrect.</i>

922
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:06,030
<i>The password is incorrect.</i>

923
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:08,500
Did he change the password?

924
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:12,020
It wasn't easy to obtain that password.

925
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,110
[Kang Min Ho]

926
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,209
This is Song Yi Kyung.

927
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:23,320
<i>Where are you?</i>

928
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:25,190
<i>Let's have lunch together.</i>

929
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,600
Lunch?

930
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:42,340
<i>Treat Song Yi Kyung as Ji Hyun.
Just once would be enough.</i>

931
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:46,170
What am I doing?

932
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:58,530
Get in.

933
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,259
What's the matter?

934
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:12,280
Nothing. Let's go.

935
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,799
<i>He said we were going to eat pasta,
but suddenly said he wanted to buy shoes.</i>

936
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,010
That's not bad, either. What do you think?

937
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:31,360
Both are alright. This one then.

938
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:34,829
<i>How could I find his new password?</i>

939
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:37,100
No need to box them up,
she'll wear them out.

940
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:39,129
No need, I'll wear my original pair.

941
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:41,699
Those are too old, that's why we came here.
Throw them away.

942
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,630
<i>Those aren't mine.</i>

943
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:47,170
I like them very much.

944
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,130
What is it?

945
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:56,160
I don't like them.

946
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:09,590
Oppa, is something wrong?

947
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,350
These, right?

948
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,850
Leave.

949
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:08,900
<i>There was a strange woman crouching here.</i>

950
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:16,750
Why was Song Yi Kyung
crouching at the corridor?

951
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,860
<i>I don't know.
Song Yi Kyung seems to be Ji Hyun.</i>

952
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:32,860
<i>I've confirmed that Song Yi Kyung
went into the apartment earlier.</i>

953
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:12,350
Welcome.

954
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,540
Song Yi Kyung.

955
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:28,280
What's is it, Kang Min Ho?
