<i>Episode 15</i>

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,266
Welcome.

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,460
Song Yi Kyung.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,320
What is it, Kang Min Ho?

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,821
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,650
Who are you?

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,330
Leave.

11
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,180
Look at me, Song Yi Kyung.

12
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,280
Look at me!

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,850
Look here.

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,610
Do you know me?

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,510
Who are you?

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,680
What's the matter?

17
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,720
Yi Kyung, what is it?

18
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,780
Do you know Song Yi Kyung?

19
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,320
Who are you?

20
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,050
What's the matter?

21
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,670
I have something to say to Song Yi Kyung.

22
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,790
It looks like she has no intention of talking to you.

23
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,180
But what is it?

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,940
It's nothing.

25
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,030
Who is that woman?

26
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,770
Shin Ji Hyun?

27
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,250
Song Yi Kyung?

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,310
What's happening?

29
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,070
Who is that person?

30
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,530
Is it someone you know?

31
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,630
Do you know him or not?

32
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,500
I don't know him...

33
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,090
But when he called me,

34
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,090
I unwittingly said his name.

35
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,670
If it's someone you don't know,
how do you know his name?

36
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,490
It looked like he knew you.

37
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,490
Don't you remember where you met him?

38
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,410
He's someone I saw under hypnosis, but...

39
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,080
I didn't get a good feeling from him.

40
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,120
Under hypnosis?

41
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,020
Yi Kyung, do you remember meeting me yesterday?

42
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,760
I... met you yesterday?

43
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,400
I met you in front of your house yesterday,
but you didn't recognize me.

44
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,140
Your clothes were also not that of the Yi Kyung I know.

45
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:55,480
I think you have multiple personality disorder.

46
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,070
In cases of severe traumatic shock,

47
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,800
- People create different identities within themselves...
- I have multiple personality disorder?

48
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:06,430
In you, I'm positive there is another personality.

49
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,140
That's not it.

50
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,700
The shock from his death seems to
have been greater than I expected.

51
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,900
The death of a close person is one of the causes.

52
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,480
That's not it, Doctor.

53
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:29,060
There's someone... living with me.

54
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,030
It's weird.

55
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,320
- It's a bit weird, let's go somewhere else.
- Let's go.

56
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,200
I said I'm okay with it.

57
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,730
If what you're saying is true, the situation is worse than I thought.

58
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,650
You're saying that a ghost is by your side.

59
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,790
Aren't you afraid?

60
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,490
You said you even felt it enter your body.

61
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,370
Ghost...

62
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,030
It's not that kind of feeling.

63
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,860
I don't know what it is...

64
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,010
But it's familiar and pitiful.

65
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:08,110
And I felt it worry for me.

66
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,510
Yi Kyung.

67
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,330
It's a first after Yi Soo.

68
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,750
This feeling.

69
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,780
The feeling that someone is truly...

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,280
concerned for me.

71
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,180
Yi Kyung, are you saying that you're
being comforted by a ghost?

72
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,540
Doctor...

73
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,340
All you know is that the person I loved
suddenly died from an accident, right?

74
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,680
Five years ago, all you did was sit and then leave.

75
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,940
When I was five, in February,

76
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,350
my mother threw me away at Choon Chun Station.

77
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,100
She told me we were going on a train trip.

78
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,420
In my favorite backpack,

79
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,820
she filled it with my most treasured items and put it on me.

80
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,040
But after saying she was going
to change my sibling's diaper,

81
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,680
she never came back.

82
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,570
Even though you were five years old,
you didn't know your name?

83
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,230
I was called by my nickname.

84
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,420
And there was no reason for her to look for me either.

85
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,980
On the first day I was sent to the orphanage,

86
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,760
I was crying in the corner.

87
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,140
Some child approached me and
gave me a bar of chocolate.

88
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,620
From now on, you're Song Yi Kyung.

89
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,860
I'm Song Yi Soo.

90
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,870
Yi Soo,

91
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,830
had been thrown away as an infant,

92
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,320
so he had been at the orphanage the longest.

93
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,020
The pain of being thrown away by my mother,

94
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,110
Yi Soo was able to make me forget that.

95
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,030
With only the reason that we were
both thrown away in February,

96
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,810
we became Yi Soo, Yi Kyung.

97
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,930
Like siblings,

98
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,330
like an oppa,

99
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,290
like a friend...

100
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,930
We lived like that for 18 years.

101
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,730
Then Yi Soo...

102
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,520
threw me away.

103
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,810
Then... in fifteen days, he died.

104
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,590
I wasn't even ready to let him go.

105
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,800
There were things I wanted to say...

106
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,170
And something I needed to ask.

107
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,640
But Yi Soo went away.

108
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,590
I threw you away?

109
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,780
Being thrown away by my mother,

110
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,460
I was able to forget that because of Yi Soo.

111
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,400
But after being thrown away by Yi Soo,

112
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,010
I couldn't trust anyone.

113
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,684
Because I'm...

114
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,560
a person who no one wants.

115
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,390
What's wrong with me?

116
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,500
Tears?

117
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,870
That's not true.

118
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,620
And even if it is,

119
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,620
does it make sense that you're
being comforted by a ghost?

120
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,690
But... I am.

121
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,190
Have you thought about leaving that house?

122
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,190
Even though I'm frightened and afraid,

123
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,880
that woman...

124
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:54,480
I feel that she's very desperate and sincere.

125
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,850
Yi Kyung.

126
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,810
What if that ahjusshi noticed something?

127
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,680
He can't tell unni.

128
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,280
Why haven't you come in for hypnosis treatment?

129
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,920
Why did she receive hypnosis treatment?

130
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,110
Did she get it because of me?

131
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,700
It's so nerve-wracking.

132
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,880
Why am I so weak?

133
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,280
I told you to change your front door pass code,

134
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,760
and you really changed it.

135
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,050
Why are you waiting for no reason?

136
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,980
Oppa, what happened?

137
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,290
It's not Song Yi Kyung, right?

138
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,260
Is it Ji Hyun?

139
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,660
It's not.

140
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,700
It's not?

141
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,030
Of course it's not,

142
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,950
there's no reason she would be.

143
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,620
How did you make sure?

144
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,620
Did you see her as Ji Hyun?

145
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,370
What she eats, penmanship, habits...

146
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,120
- No, have you been to Song Yi Kyung's house?
- I said it's not!

147
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,366
It's not, so leave.

148
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,880
Oppa.

149
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,170
Song Yi Kyung can't be Shin Ji Hyun.

150
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,850
From the beginning, it was ridiculous!

151
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,060
Tell me how you made sure!

152
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,710
Tomorrow is President Shin's surgery.

153
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,590
I need to get some sleep and go out.

154
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,700
When I come to this house next time...

155
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,160
That picture...

156
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,860
That engagement picture with Shin Ji Hyun...

157
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,640
Put it where I can't see it.

158
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,140
How can you be Song Yi Kyung?

159
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,780
It makes no sense.

160
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,150
It makes no sense!

161
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,810
It makes no sense!

162
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:08,820
<i>13 days, 4 hours, 29 minutes are left.</i>

163
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,660
Unni, you must've not received
your hypnosis treatment today.

164
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,490
That's a relief.

165
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,090
What's wrong with unni?

166
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,960
Did ahjusshi say something?

167
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:46,190
Unni, today is the day my dad gets surgery.

168
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,290
Can you please sleep early?

169
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,610
It's a relief.

170
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,030
Unni, thank you.

171
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,640
Thank you!

172
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,070
Oh!

173
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,170
"Oh, what brings you here?"

174
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,460
What would bring me here.

175
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,790
I'm not going to the store right now.

176
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,790
I'm not going to the store either.

177
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,420
Ji Hyun's father is receiving surgery today.

178
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,990
I'll be bored by myself,
let's go together.

179
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,060
You're going to the hospital?

180
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,940
There's not much time, so let's go to the hospital first.

181
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,790
That way you can meet him comfortably
before people start arriving.

182
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,700
Oh, that is...

183
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,860
You're a bit thoughtless.

184
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,190
You cry regardless of the situation.

185
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,960
To others, it can seem really indecent.

186
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,760
"Who does she think she is?
She's not even his daughter and she's crying so much."

187
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,860
It's the perfect excuse to criticize you.

188
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,660
On top of that, what if In Jung gets angry and says,

189
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:50,482
"She's dating Ji Hyun's fiance."

190
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:52,130
What are you going to do then?

191
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,110
So, when there's no one around,
meet Ji Hyun's father first.

192
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,970
- I'm not dating Kang Min Ho.
- Pretending to date Kang Min Ho...

193
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,410
I wish you'd stop that, too.

194
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,750
Thank you for coming on the day of his surgery.

195
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,910
It's nothing.

196
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,370
I hope the surgery goes well.

197
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:24,020
Ji Hyun, she sure did keep a lot of loyal friends.

198
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,670
It's because she's like you.

199
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,070
She likes people and trusts them.

200
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:34,040
When Ji Hyun wakes up, come by often.

201
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,020
I'll come by often to see you.

202
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:41,260
And check in on Ji Hyun's mother, too.

203
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,720
<i>Dad...</i>

204
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:00,600
Can... I hug you this one time?

205
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,610
I'll see you later.

206
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,470
Stop, stop.

207
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,230
It's going to be okay.

208
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,610
What are you crying for?
Why are you crying?

209
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,370
Are you crying because your father may pass away?

210
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,950
I mean,

211
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,070
why are you crying as if Shin Ji Hyun's
father is going to pass away?

212
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,570
Here, you can't cry here,
so let's go out to cry, okay?

213
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:05,080
I'll keep an eye on the surgery,
you go wait at the store.

214
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,780
They say the surgery is going to
take six to seven hours,

215
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,740
so I'll call you when it's over, all right?

216
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,640
Well, this is unpleasant.

217
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,240
Why are you going with my woman?

218
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,411
You should've called me if you were coming here.

219
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:35,506
She probably didn't think you would come here.

220
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,770
If I can't come, Song Yi Kyung shouldn't come either.

221
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,140
Going to Heaven?

222
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,680
Let's go, I'll take you there.

223
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,870
On a day like this, do you need to make it so obvious?

224
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,950
On a day like this, why did you bring Song Yi Kyung?

225
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,980
Take me there.

226
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,570
I'm going to go insane.

227
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,120
What is it she has to find out that
she's hanging out with him?

228
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,710
How much longer is she going to do it?

229
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,450
What did you do after work yesterday?

230
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,530
Why are you asking me such things?

231
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,630
Haven't you been in a relationship before?

232
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,220
Aren't we dating?

233
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,210
I slept early because I was tired.

234
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,570
You forgot about the surgery and slept,

235
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,320
so what's with the crying at the hospital?

236
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,610
You can call it a last farewell.

237
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,100
Didn't you feel sorry when you saw Ji Hyun?

238
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,980
Being sorry is one thing,

239
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,420
having something to do is another.

240
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,680
Isn't that a quality of people like us?

241
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,050
I said that I'll tell you later.

242
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,910
I can't wait any longer.

243
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,710
You asked me to show sincerity, but you aren't.

244
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,980
Can you really not trust me?

245
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,270
You're the one making me not trust you.

246
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,120
Day and night, you're always whispering with Han Kang.

247
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,890
You're always going out, but afterwards,
you never tell me where.

248
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,630
Stop it!

249
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,240
It's Kang's mother's memorial today!

250
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,160
Memorial?

251
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,752
Did you just...yell at me?

252
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:38,221
I can overlook it any other day, but today I won't!

253
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,550
What kind of person was Kang's mother to us!

254
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,770
That's... I feel thankful for that.

255
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,330
What use is it if you just feel it?

256
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,190
You said she left it in her will to not
hold a memorial service for her.

257
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,160
Just because we're not holding a service
doesn't mean there's nothing to prepare!

258
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,100
Let's go together, Hye Won!

259
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,260
Jun Hee's not even here,
what happens if you go, too!

260
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,380
Work here.

261
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,780
It's his mother's memorial.

262
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,710
Han Kang,

263
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,840
you're protecting my father.

264
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:21,200
I'm trusting you... and going in.

265
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,600
I'll be waiting.

266
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:28,110
During all this time, I was at ease because of you.

267
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,950
Seo Woo, you...

268
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,900
Don't say anything to me.

269
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,010
Say it after you come out.

270
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,460
I don't have anything to say to you.

271
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,130
Don't say it! Don't say it!

272
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,300
After hearing it all last night, I'm sick of it!

273
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,850
Hey, good-for-nothing.

274
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,620
Yes, Father.

275
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,100
Thanks.

276
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,130
I'll be waiting for you to come out.

277
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,060
Ji Hyun,

278
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:08,160
your dad, is doing as you wish.

279
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,200
I'm going crazy.

280
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,020
The surgery will go well, right?

281
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,720
I have work, so I'll be going.

282
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,860
I'll be back after taking care of some business.

283
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,250
In Jung, let's stay here.

284
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,850
I also have work to do,
I'll be back later.

285
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,180
Hey, Han Kang.

286
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:40,150
Who's in this hospital that you're making the New
World president brief you in the hospital lobby?

287
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,180
I'm sorry, sunbae.

288
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,850
Hae Mi Do, I'm 90% certain it's a dual contract.

289
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,220
In contrast to President Shin's contract on that land,

290
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,430
when HM Industries bought it,

291
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,290
the price of the land increased too much.

292
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,580
Jun Sae Company and Park Seung Jae,
used a different name to sign a dual contract.

293
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,370
And the profit, he's probably set it aside as slush funds.

294
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,990
What about finding evidence?

295
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,810
For dual contracts, you either have to find the seller or the funds.

296
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,710
But it's not easy.

297
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,650
That's why I asked this favor of you.

298
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,380
For dual contracts, finding the person he negotiated with or a written contract is the surest way,

299
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,950
but where do we find that?

300
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,600
Ki Jun Hee,

301
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,470
I heard you're busy nowadays going on
Kang's errands and selling investments.

302
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,140
Excuse me?

303
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,600
You took a leave of absence in order to earn your tuition,

304
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,850
and you're working at Kang's store.

305
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,460
Did Kang say he was going to pay all your tuition?

306
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,980
What do you mean?

307
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,920
I heard you're majoring in business administration
and entered at the top of your class.

308
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,670
How about joining HM Industries after graduating?

309
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,170
HM Industries?

310
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,550
You'll have to go through some warm-up tests of course.

311
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,990
If you help me out before that.

312
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,390
Your team play is great.

313
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,050
What are you talking about?

314
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,600
You're quite the perfect couple.

315
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,020
Whether someone's looking or not...

316
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,190
Whether one's Ji Hyun's best friend or fianc�e.

317
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,320
One of you is always in those roles.

318
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,580
Knowing our relationship...

319
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,340
why haven't you told Ji Hyun's parents?

320
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,300
They're barely hanging on...

321
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,650
and you want me to tell them about you two?

322
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,170
Miss...

323
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,460
This tear...

324
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,870
H-h-how did you receive it?

325
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,830
You really can receive it.

326
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,660
Ahjusshi, you're a 49 days traveler?

327
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,580
I thought in Seoul, I was the only one.

328
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:47,180
What? I came from Daejeon.

329
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,980
I finally found out that my friend was at this hospital, but...

330
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,420
That bastard...

331
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,120
They say he died an hour ago.

332
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,230
Oh, no.

333
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,840
If he was going to die,

334
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:05,600
he should've at least left me a tear.

335
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,960
Tomorrow is your last day?

336
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,930
But, you haven't even received one tear?

337
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,020
I, who used to be called President,

338
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,380
have been working during the day at a construction site.

339
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,470
Looking for all my friends and acquaintances in my free time.

340
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,970
Lee Seung Bok.

341
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,790
I'm Lee Seung Bok.

342
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,060
Asking them if they know Lee Seung Bok!

343
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,470
Don't trust humans, they're all trash!

344
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,030
Your face, did you get hurt working at the construction site?

345
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,960
Oh, this bastard?

346
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,220
Every once in a while, I give him a good beating.

347
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,350
This bastard is the one who put me in a vegetative state.

348
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,940
He suddenly just came at me,

349
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,660
and with a rock, he hit me on the back of my head!

350
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,440
Oh! Ahjusshi!

351
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,580
Miss,

352
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,430
since you've gotten one tear,

353
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,300
you must at least have hope.

354
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,020
How many days do you have left?

355
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,660
I have thirteen days left.

356
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:29,020
Then, you'll gradually begin to weaken,
and lose your stamina.

357
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,440
You must've been getting some soul symptoms.

358
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,460
They're soul symptoms?

359
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,030
When you get out of that body, it becomes difficult.

360
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,040
And in your soul state, you can't even use your strength.

361
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,060
It'll continue to get worse.

362
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,520
If I had thirteen days left,

363
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:57,350
I would send my wife a bouquet
telling her I was so thankful.

364
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,000
I'd see my mother's face one last time.

365
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,160
And to my children, I would've at least left a letter.

366
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,670
You can still do it now.

367
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:16,000
If I take the KTX and leave now,
I'll just have two hours left.

368
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,980
I wonder if I'll be able to at least see their faces.

369
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,880
I'm going to miss the train.

370
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,030
At least take a bath before you go see them.

371
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,640
Thanks.

372
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,520
It must be difficult to earn money in another's body.

373
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,780
These 49 days...

374
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,670
are too cruel.

375
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,670
Goodbye.

376
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,860
Ahjusshi.

377
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,240
The woman you were just talking to, do you know her?

378
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:05,630
- How do you know her?
- How I know her... why do you ask?

379
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,190
Do you need money?

380
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,820
I can give you a lot of money.

381
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,590
How much can you give me?

382
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,790
I'll give you as much as I can.

383
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:19,360
As long as you clearly identify who that woman is.

384
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,920
Save me, first.

385
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:29,790
Then, the seven floor building I have in Daejeon Jijong District,

386
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,740
I'll give it all to you.

387
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,530
First of all, the tumor was successfully removed.

388
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,240
Then can we now feel rest assured?

389
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,840
It's still a bit too early to be at ease.

390
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,200
We need to monitor him overnight
in the intensive care unit.

391
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,800
He first needs to wake up in order for you to relax.

392
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,700
Please help him.

393
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:29,130
Then, as long as he regains consciousness, he'll live?

394
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,170
Because the doctor said the tumor was successfully removed.

395
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,520
That's a relief.

396
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:34,890
You haven't eaten dinner, right?

397
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,430
Let's go somewhere to eat and look in on Father.

398
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,680
No. You go.

399
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,210
I heard it's your mother's memorial.

400
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,260
Since we don't hold a memorial service for her,

401
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,260
we can do it at night.

402
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,890
Sleep, Mother.

403
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,450
Have a glass of the wine that you like.

404
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:25,390
Do you know how tough my mother was?

405
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,010
She didn't even leave one picture.

406
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,870
There's only this piano.

407
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,160
While drunk,

408
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,270
she would always play this piano.

409
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,500
When I was young,

410
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,340
my father would go back and forth
to America because of business.

411
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,960
And one day, my mother set up this wine bar.

412
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,300
She even drank with other men.

413
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,710
To a young kid's eyes,

414
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,100
she looked like a woman who
sold her smiles and liquor.

415
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,000
My father made plenty of money,

416
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:23,300
I couldn't understand why she would do such a thing.

417
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,770
I couldn't imagine that she was doing
it because she was lonely.

418
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,510
Being lonely,

419
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,440
at that time, I didn't know what that meant.

420
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,760
Then they got divorced.

421
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,330
I naturally thought it was because of my mother.

422
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:49,620
I thought my mom had been unfaithful
with a man she'd met here.

423
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:54,230
After getting divorced,
we couldn't get in touch with my dad,

424
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,660
and I thought that was also my mom's doing.

425
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:04,790
Then she dragged me to Jinan,
saying she wanted to rest.

426
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,750
She said she needed her son.

427
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,040
It made me laugh.

428
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,320
Who is she to say that she needs me with her?

429
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,440
In Jinan, I went completely mad.

430
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:22,610
At every little annoyance, I wouldn't come home.

431
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,720
And there hasn't been one time that
I made eye contact with her.

432
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,420
I never once spoke to her with kind words.

433
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:34,040
Her face was getting darker by the day,

434
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,950
and I thought it was because of Jinan's bright sun.

435
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:44,190
They say in the last stages of pancreatic cancer,
it is unbearably painful.

436
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,930
And I didn't even know she was dying of pain.

437
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,200
I...

438
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,840
I thought it was all because of the sun.

439
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,250
And then...

440
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:02,330
to the end, she didn't tell me anything.

441
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:05,310
She sent me to America...

442
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,500
and died alone.

443
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,810
It was after I went to America that I found out.

444
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,350
My father had another son who was over ten years old.

445
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,530
Isn't she too cruel?

446
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,040
Did she really want to make me
into such a terrible person?

447
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:33,390
You know that's not true.

448
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,890
The last memory she has of me...

449
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:41,010
She must've thought I was a twisted kid.

450
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:45,270
Probably thought it would have been better
not to have me and regretted it.

451
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,420
That's not true, Kang.

452
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:55,100
Leaving the piano may have been her way of leaving her all.

453
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,320
Because when she was lonely and going through hard times,
she was comforted by playing this piano.

454
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:04,980
You can call this the one thing that contains your mother's soul.

455
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,630
Why didn't she leave a picture?

456
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,650
Pictures...

457
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,540
She didn't leave it because she knew you'd be like this.

458
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:17,230
If her son looks at his mother's picture,
he'd just feel even guiltier.

459
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,820
That kind of makes sense.

460
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:23,010
It doesn't kind of make sense.
It's true.

461
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,080
You comfort me.

462
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,530
Song Yi Kyung herself definitely said it was possession?

463
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,970
She even said she saw some woman enter her body.

464
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,540
Some... woman?

465
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,350
If it's possible, let's talk while eating, shall we?

466
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,950
Then, can I ask a question?

467
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,790
Ask.

468
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,760
Last time you said you owed Shin Ji Hyun a lot,

469
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:02,810
what is that?

470
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,120
You said you were really close to Shin Ji Hyun.

471
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,920
Didn't she tell you?

472
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,400
She didn't say anything.

473
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:12,020
Ji Hyun doesn't seem to think there's anything like that.

474
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,180
I wanted to go to my dad without my mom knowing.

475
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,840
So I stole her money and bought a plane ticket.

476
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,960
It was a ticket for a week later.

477
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,680
But then my mom suddenly dragged me to Jinan.

478
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,330
Plane ticket?

479
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,190
America?

480
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,070
But three days after I transferred,

481
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,250
I sprained my ankle because of Shin Ji Hyun.

482
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,140
Hey, transfer student!

483
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,840
Could you help me get my bicycle?

484
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,530
Because of this overeager girl, I missed my plane.

485
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,290
I hated her.

486
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,330
So every time I met her, I'd glare and annoy her.

487
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,580
But she's so naive and bright,
everything she did was funny.

488
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,210
It was really fun to tease her.

489
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:58,050
<i>That's why you picked on me so much?</i>

490
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:01,840
Because of that, I started to forget about leaving Jinan.

491
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,490
Then one day,

492
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:07,230
this kid scammed me with magic
and made me eat seaweed soup.

493
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,170
Don't even leave one drop and eat it all!

494
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:15,050
<i>- You got really angry that time.
- I was so thankful.</i>

495
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:19,180
Truthfully, I had thrown it away, but really regretted it.

496
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:22,910
My mom had come all the way to school to give
her son soup because it was his birthday.

497
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,320
If it wasn't for Shin Ji Hyun,

498
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:30,600
I would've been a son who didn't even eat the last birthday
soup his mom had made for him before she died.

499
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,170
That's all you owe her for?

500
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,350
Shin Ji Hyun would laugh.

501
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,450
The biggest thing I owe her

502
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,090
is not saying sorry before we separated.

503
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,480
During the cherry blossom festival,

504
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,050
I had ruined everything over nothing.

505
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:47,670
Pretending because of my mom, not saying what I felt...

506
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,750
It was when I hated everything like an insane person.

507
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,140
Leave.

508
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,020
Go!

509
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:03,940
Give this back to Ji Hyun.

510
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,390
You said you're Shin Ji Hyun's friend.

511
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,760
Keep it, and give it to her later.

512
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,370
I made it with the mussels you like.

513
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,580
- Eat it for me, son.
- I don't want to.

514
00:37:29,585 --> 00:37:30,800
I'm leaving.

515
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,290
Kang!

516
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,790
Kang!

517
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,850
Kang!

518
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,330
Give it to me.

519
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,580
I'll make him eat it.

520
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,420
Hello.

521
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:58,170
I'm Han Kang's friend, Shin Ji Hyun.

522
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:03,680
Our Kang really ate the seaweed soup?

523
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,270
He ate every last drop.

524
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,560
I tricked him into it.

525
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,560
Not a bad trick!

526
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:14,110
How impressive, you were able to beat Kang.

527
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,850
What is this?

528
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:21,110
As a present for getting into college,
my father had bought it for me.

529
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,530
But I don't have a daughter.

530
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,150
I was going to give it to Kang's first girlfriend.

531
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,100
I'm not Han Kang's girlfriend.

532
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,860
You're a friend and a girl.

533
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,270
Aren't you his friend?

534
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,090
We're not even friends yet.

535
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,900
You said you were Kang's friend before.

536
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,040
Kang really doesn't like me.

537
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:42,950
Kang's not that bad of a kid.

538
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,330
He's too pure.

539
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,760
He's so angry with me that he's just acting out.

540
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,620
Even if that's true, acting like that to his mother is a bit harsh.

541
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:57,370
Before, you said your name was Shin Ji Hyun, right?

542
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,440
Yes.

543
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,110
Aren't you a bit hungry?

544
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,950
Do you like toast?

545
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,780
I like anything that requires eating.

546
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,210
Why are you staring so intently at someone else's bracelet?

547
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:19,530
<i>Your mother gave this to me.</i>

548
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,690
It's already eleven.
You'll be late.

549
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:35,600
What's the reason you were standing at Kang's place?

550
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,990
You said it wasn't Ji Hyun but Song Yi Kyung.

551
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,460
Then why were you staring at Kang chatting?

552
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,960
It's because you're also suspicious.

553
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,060
If it really is Ji Hyun,

554
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,250
we need to figure out why she hasn't told anyone,

555
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,650
even though she knows all about our relationship and plans.

556
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,330
Oppa, you're not...

557
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,710
hoping it isn't Ji Hyun, are you?

558
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,900
Is that why you aren't verifying it?

559
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,620
Because it can't be Ji Hyun.

560
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,710
If it's true that Ji Hyun's soul is in Song Yi Kyung's body,

561
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,940
then you'll have fallen in love with Ji Hyun.

562
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,470
Ji Hyun's not a kid that can pretend to love someone.

563
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,340
So that's why it's not Ji Hyun?

564
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,860
Then does that mean Song Yi Kyung loves you?

565
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,840
I'll look into it further, so leave.

566
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,000
No.

567
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:30,660
Song Yi Kyung didn't like you.

568
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,610
And Ji Hyun didn't love you either.

569
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:37,040
She believed she was in love.

570
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,520
Because she thought you loved her,
you were her soul mate.

571
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,450
Do you think Ji Hyun, who didn't love you before,

572
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,610
can love you now?

573
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,350
I'm telling you it's not Ji Hyun!

574
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,100
So it can't be Ji Hyun.

575
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:56,940
It's not the Ji Hyun that I know,
so how can it be Ji Hyun?

576
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:14,200
Unni, I'll see you later.

577
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,140
Has she not noticed anything yet?

578
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:09,520
Dad, what are you doing here?

579
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,390
Why aren't you coming back?

580
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,070
Dad.

581
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,720
Hurry and come here.

582
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,680
Why aren't you coming back?

583
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,130
Where and what are you doing?

584
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,690
Ji Hyun!

585
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,870
Ji Hyun!

586
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,110
Ji Hyun!

587
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:12,800
Ji Hyun!

588
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,430
Ji Hyun!

589
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,040
Ji Hyun!

590
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,040
Ji Hyun!

591
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,360
Dad!

592
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,410
Dad!

593
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,220
He woke up!

594
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,290
My dad woke up!

595
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:47,050
Dad, thank you.

596
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,510
Thank you, Dad.

597
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:53,390
Dad, I love you.

598
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,060
I love you, Dad.

599
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:17,100
What are you doing, voyager Shin Ji Hyun?

600
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,820
The buses aren't running, so I'm walking.

601
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:29,820
My dad's alive.

602
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:33,090
I told you life and death isn't determined by human actions.

603
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,740
What?

604
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:38,110
Did you know that my dad wouldn't
pass away during the surgery?

605
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,460
How could I know that?

606
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,250
You're really mean.

607
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,720
I was afraid that Dad wouldn't
get the surgery because of me.

608
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:47,590
Do you know how much I worried and how much time I wasted?

609
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,850
- You should've given me a hint.
- I have to know something in order to give you a hint!

610
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:55,090
I only found out your dad wasn't passing away...

611
00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:01,090
When I downloaded my schedule yesterday,
and Shin Il Shik's name wasn't on it.

612
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,890
- Your schedule?
- Right.

613
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:06,270
I only move after I've downloaded the
death schedule every ten days.

614
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,330
I'm a low-level scheduler.

615
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:09,870
Right.

616
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,440
When I first met you,

617
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,760
you said that humans are all born with their
life expectancy already determined.

618
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:16,830
Hurry and get on.

619
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,060
I came here to give you a ride
since the buses aren't running.

620
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,050
Scheduler's way of having fun.

621
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:27,210
Whatever I do, follow the styles of this neighborhood.

622
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:39,475
{\a6}You are breathing, you are living, inside my heart

623
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:34,560
But who determines life expectancy?

624
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,090
You, yourselves determine it.

625
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:41,990
The life you lived before determines your
expectancy this time around.

626
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,830
And the way you live this life determines your next.

627
00:45:42,507 --> 00:45:46,526
{\a6}Starting from the first day you came to me,

628
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:47,830
That's what I've been taught.

629
00:45:46,561 --> 00:45:55,050
{\a6}it became a longing, and you called out to me.

630
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,830
That's how it is?

631
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,930
Then what about you?

632
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,950
I didn't live well in my past life,

633
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,620
satisfied?

634
00:45:55,183 --> 00:46:02,063
{\a6}Tears keep flowing. Cold tears are flowing.

635
00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:00,130
I'm sorry for hitting a sore spot.

636
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:05,320
Instead, I hope you live a long time in your next life.

637
00:46:02,064 --> 00:46:09,403
{\a6}My heart hurts, and it hurts because of you.

638
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,630
I don't think that's going to happen.

639
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,830
Why?

640
00:46:09,404 --> 00:46:15,737
{\a6}I long for you in the day, Oh how I long for you.

641
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,650
I think I was a bastard.

642
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,390
What are you saying?

643
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,550
Did someone say that?

644
00:46:15,738 --> 00:46:22,763
{\a6}I miss you so much and tears fall again.

645
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,170
Someone did say that.

646
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,060
Unni!

647
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,690
Dad lived!

648
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:35,110
Now, I'm not going to force myself to meet Kang Min Ho.

649
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:38,000
Since Kang read my letter,

650
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,510
when dad wakes up, he's going to tell my dad.

651
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,880
And even if I wake up, he won't let me marry Min Ho.

652
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:53,180
There's only twelve days left.

653
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:00,140
I don't know if I'll be able to get two more tears.

654
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:06,970
But in any case, I want to do what I can for you.

655
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:11,190
If I don't pay you back at all,

656
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:14,190
twelve days later,

657
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:17,660
I think I'll regret it like that ahjusshi.

658
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:27,360
Dad's okay now, so don't worry at all, Ji Hyun.

659
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,630
That's right, Shin Ji Hyun.

660
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:31,470
Now it's your turn to come back.

661
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:35,140
Seo Woo, you should go back and rest, too.

662
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,400
You've done enough.

663
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,400
All right.

664
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,020
What's wrong with her lately?

665
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:12,700
Pick it up here.

666
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,860
Why are you taking Kang Min Ho's call in your room?

667
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,350
Take the call here!

668
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,300
Did you see the person In Jung is dating?

669
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:30,220
We've been together five years, five years!

670
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,660
You guys...

671
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:36,540
The man you're dating...

672
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:39,260
is it Min Ho?

673
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:41,310
Seo... Seo Woo...

674
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:45,040
You bitch! You bitch!
Are you human?

675
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,210
How could you do that to Ji Hyun!

676
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,930
You bitch! You bitch!

677
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:55,190
How much have you received from Ji Hyun!

678
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,250
If it wasn't for Ji Hyun,

679
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,610
you wouldn't have even been
able to go to college in Seoul.

680
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,740
Because you lived with Ji Hyun, you were able to
attend college and get a job in Seoul!

681
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,640
After betraying her, were you scared?

682
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:10,650
Is that why you saw Ji Hyun as a ghost?

683
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:11,880
Hey!

684
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:13,670
If I was Ji Hyun,

685
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,650
I wouldn't be able to die peacefully!

686
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,690
That's a great relief!

687
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:25,390
I knew it would turn out like this.

688
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,680
Yes, all right.

689
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,590
I need to let Ji Hyun know.

690
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:34,410
Hey, Han Kang!

691
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,080
I was just going to call you.

692
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:46,810
- Song, my friend Shin Ji Hyun's father...
- I know, I know.

693
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:49,330
You know?

694
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,410
You little...

695
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:01,050
If I tell you to sit down, you should do so quickly!

696
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:03,210
Song Yi Kyung.

697
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,250
How can you call your nuna Song Yi Kyung?

698
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,930
Hey, Han Kang, didn't I tell you before?

699
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,160
Song Yi Kyung is one year older than you!

700
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,220
If you've come to a country where elders take precedent,
you should follow the laws of that country.

701
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:18,010
How can you keep referring to me as Song Yi Kyung,
Song! Song!

702
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,210
But, do you really know that Ji Hyun's father woke up!

703
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,860
It's because I know that, in thanks,

704
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,510
I've prepared your favorite breakfast.

705
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,970
- What's this?
- A meal from your childhood.

706
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:33,600
Sugared toast and strawberry milk.

707
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:36,170
I heard there are guys who like receiving things like this.

708
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,120
Only kids...

709
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:40,540
This is what I used to like.

710
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,100
By any chance, has Shin Ji Hyun ever met my mother?

711
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,990
Uh...

712
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:51,250
I think she said she did.

713
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,100
She did a lot of things, Shin Ji Hyun...

714
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:56,260
If it's good, ask me to make it again.

715
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:58,530
Nuna's busy, so I'll be going.

716
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,720
Must be really happy that Father's okay.

717
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,830
It's Shin Ji Hyun's father.

718
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,410
Why is she correcting it as Shin Ji Hyun's father?

719
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,190
At night she works at the coffee shop,
and in the day she works at Heaven.

720
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,190
So she doesn't have much time to sleep.

721
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,490
That's fine.

722
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,080
From now on, don't go investigating Song Yi Kyung.

723
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:22,540
All right.

724
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,510
<i>Director Lee</i>

725
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,720
It's been a while, Director Lee.

726
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:41,060
Now, I think it's about time we start.

727
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,800
Amnesia?

728
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,390
Because of severe traumatic shock,

729
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:01,770
they say it's a temporary case of amnesia.

730
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:04,190
That's why you couldn't recognize me.

731
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,330
That's why I came to find out more about myself.

732
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,080
Were you close to me?

733
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:13,250
You were friendly with everyone,

734
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,820
but there wasn't anyone you were particularly close to.

735
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,840
Whenever you got off work,

736
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,830
you'd stick next to Song Yi Soo.

737
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:23,060
You know Song Yi Soo?

738
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:26,420
In our hotel, everyone knew about you two.

739
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:29,080
Song Yi Soo also worked here?

740
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:31,110
At first you both entered together,

741
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:35,440
but after six months he quit,
in order to become a singer.

742
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:39,100
Ah, I see.

743
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:43,710
After you broke up with him, you were like a ghost.

744
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,070
When you found out Song Yi Soo died, you fainted.

745
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,270
And after you left that time, you never came back here.

746
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:53,690
What do I do?

747
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,450
At that time, I was the one who packed up your belongings.

748
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,360
It'll probably be in storage somewhere.

749
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:02,100
Then, please give that to me.

750
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:13,350
How great must the shock have been
for a person to put a halt to their life.

751
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:20,290
Shin In Jung's calling.

752
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:22,290
It's Shin In Jung.

753
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,080
I said it's Shin In Jung.

754
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:35,210
I got hit by Seo Woo.

755
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,980
My relationship with Kang Min Ho, I was caught.

756
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:41,360
As expected from Park Seo Woo.

757
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:44,830
Since I've already been found
out by those closest to me,

758
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:48,040
I don't need to worry about getting caught,
it's all good.

759
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,390
Good?

760
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,390
You look pitiful to me.

761
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:53,400
You've ended it with Min Ho,

762
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,670
but it's a shame you had to get hit.

763
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,220
We haven't ended anything.

764
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:01,750
As long as you don't marry Kang Min Ho.

765
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:05,500
Are you going to marry? With Min Ho?

766
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,850
Last time,

767
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:14,190
you were wondering why I did
these things to Ji Hyun, right?

768
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:17,110
Today, I came to tell you that.

769
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:22,480
- Why all of a sudden...
- In college, I lived with Ji Hyun's family.

770
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:26,190
In my senior year of high school,
my father caused an accident without a license.

771
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:29,400
I wasn't in the position to come to Seoul and attend college.

772
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,280
Because I was so heart-broken,

773
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:34,070
I went over to Ji Hyun's and complained to her.

774
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,750
Then Ji Hyun, without even asking me,

775
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:43,380
begged her parents at the dinner
table to let me live with them.

776
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:48,100
At that time, I was so thankful I had tears in my eyes.

777
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:52,400
From Ji Hyun, you've heard this story, haven't you?

778
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:57,630
Someone at the top of her class not being able
to go to Seoul because of her situation.

779
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:00,000
She did say it was a shame.

780
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,700
She was quite a kind kid.

781
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:05,060
There's another.

782
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:07,500
During our winter break in freshman year of college,

783
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:11,610
I had a part-time job at the bakery Seo Woo works at now.

784
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:17,590
On my way to an outdoor event, I got very sick.

785
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:21,700
I only asked her to tell my boss I wasn't coming in.

786
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:26,900
But the kind Ji Hyun, without a word,
took my place instead.

787
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:32,280
While skipping her 250,000 won hourly piano lesson.

788
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,710
Didn't she do that because she was afraid you'd be fired?

789
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:37,780
From the perspective of Ji Hyun's mother,

790
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,670
it was unbelievable.

791
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:44,400
In order to earn 30,000 won,
she threw away 250,000 won.

792
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:47,010
When her mother scolded her,

793
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:50,180
it would've been better if she had just said, "I'm sorry."

794
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:53,030
But Ji Hyun, to whom friends are so very precious,

795
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,820
talked back to her mother.

796
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:58,750
Saying In Jung can't be fired from her part-time job.

797
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:01,340
Then unbeknownst to Ji Hyun,

798
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:04,600
her mother would call me aside.

799
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:07,850
She couldn't have even dreamed of it.

800
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,420
Cause she's so naive.

801
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,910
During college when we'd go on blind dates,

802
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:19,420
she'd always point out that In Jung is her
closest friend who lives at her house.

803
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,500
When my boyfriend would come
near the house to see me,

804
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,260
she'd follow me, saying she was bored.

805
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,110
Of course she never asked me if she could.

806
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:32,400
Even when that boy starts calling
Ji Hyun and breaks up with me,

807
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:35,200
Ji Hyun doesn't know why.

808
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:38,200
Because she's a kid who doesn't doubt others.

809
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,080
Now...

810
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,930
what is the reason you are saying those things?

811
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,420
When she buys new clothes, she wears them
and comes into my room.

812
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:47,000
"How are these clothes?"

813
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,310
"They're pretty."

814
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,240
"Then, you want to wear them?"

815
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,620
"Hey, Shin In Jung, I can always buy more."

816
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:57,370
"Even if I give it to you, it's not a waste at all."

817
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:00,370
"I don't have any greed."

818
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:03,360
She really meant it.

819
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:07,880
Those things... did they hurt your feelings?

820
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:12,290
They... made me wretched.

821
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:19,250
Her unending generosity made me so pitiful.

822
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,500
It's okay.

823
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,420
I'd say it was okay, and yet she still gave.

824
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:26,960
The generosity to never look at it from my point of view.

825
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:30,010
The generosity to ignore my feelings.

826
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,180
That annoying cheerfulness.

827
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:36,970
One day, I started to become curious.

828
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,440
Ji Hyun,

829
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:42,040
even if you had to run from one part-time
job to another and receive scholarships,

830
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:44,160
would you still be as cheerful as you are now?

831
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:45,080
No.

832
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:48,300
If you did not have a successful father,

833
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:51,570
would you have gone to that college with those grades?

834
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:55,020
Even if you had been raised as my father's daughter,

835
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,290
would ddukboki be so delicious,

836
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,700
and could you remain so kind and innocent?

837
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:04,020
I wanted to see if she would be the same after she lost everything.

838
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:09,500
If her successful father became a failure like mine,
I wanted to see if she would change.

839
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:14,600
"You guys, you should wear my wedding dress."

840
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:17,700
"You're going to have to borrow it anyway."

841
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:21,750
Ji Hyun herself had already established ranks.

842
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,770
And then she'd say she hadn't, which was funny.

843
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:31,690
So, I made a proposal to Kang Min Ho.

844
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:38,970
To bring her down to the same situation I was in.

845
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,520
That's nonsense.

846
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,210
In Jung is...

847
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,410
You said Ji Hyun said it herself.

848
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:50,510
That nothing was a waste when given to me.

849
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,530
Then she can give me her father's company

850
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:56,550
and her fianc�, too.

851
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:07,000
Later when you meet Ji Hyun, tell her this.

852
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:11,500
But,

853
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:16,470
her love for you was sincere.

854
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:20,150
Me, too...

855
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:23,280
My love for Ji Hyun...

856
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,170
was also sincere.

857
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,330
Even so, this isn't right.

858
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:21,270
That's not a reason to stomp on me like this.

859
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:57,880
What is this!

860
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,700
He's a complete player!

861
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,290
Leaving this unni...

862
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,830
<i>The depressed scheduler is listening to music.</i>

863
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:13,270
<i>Call a bit later.</i>

864
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:26,720
Hey, Song Yi Soo.

865
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:28,800
How could you do that?

866
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,840
You cheated and broke up with this unni.

867
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:36,840
What's wrong with humans?

868
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,100
Is betrayal a specialty? A hobby?

869
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:41,310
How could you backstab someone who trusts you?

870
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:43,960
What are you talking about?

871
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:47,560
Look at this.

872
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:52,020
Who's this?

873
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,750
Is this... me?

874
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:04,200
Your words were right.

875
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:05,920
Your earnestness,

876
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:07,870
I don't think it's for Song Yi Kyung.

877
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:09,710
It must be for that woman.

878
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:11,230
What?

879
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,770
- This really isn't it!
- What's not?

880
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,850
It's definitely you and another woman!

881
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:18,940
You...

882
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:21,920
Because of that woman, you broke up with unni.

883
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,980
Seeing as how this unni is living,

884
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:28,620
you could've been with that woman when you died.

885
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:29,480
It's not true!

886
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:30,760
What's not?

887
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,470
Look at the evidence!

888
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:34,720
And you, you said you couldn't even remember!

889
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:36,350
Even if I can't remember, it's not her.

890
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:38,190
It's not!

891
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:40,460
Why do you keep saying it's not?

892
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:41,550
Look at this!

893
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:42,600
It's still not true?

894
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:44,660
It's ridiculous, how could I with this woman?

895
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:47,640
I said this woman is nothing!

896
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:53,200
Just because you say this woman is nothing
doesn't mean it becomes nothing!

897
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:04,470
Just because you say it's nothing

898
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:07,400
doesn't mean it becomes nothing.

899
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,700
It's nothing, nothing!

900
01:03:09,628 --> 01:03:19,847
{\a6}You are breathing, you are living, inside my heart

901
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,150
It's nothing, Yi Kyung!

902
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,020
Song Yi Kyung, it's not true!

903
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,650
Why won't you believe me!

904
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:34,007
{\a6}My heart is ringing, you are walking, inside my heart

905
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:27,040
Yi Kyung...

906
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:35,100
Yi Kyung...

907
01:03:37,449 --> 01:03:41,171
{\a6}Starting from the first day you came to me,

908
01:03:41,172 --> 01:03:50,155
{\a6}it became a longing, and you out to called me.

909
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:46,170
Hey...

910
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,850
Song Yi Kyung.

911
01:03:54,058 --> 01:04:00,931
{\a6}Tears keep flowing. Cold tears are flowing.

912
01:04:01,248 --> 01:04:08,353
{\a6}My heart hurts, and it hurts because of you.

913
01:04:08,354 --> 01:04:14,698
{\a6}I long for you in the day, Oh how I long for you.

"S Loves K"

924
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:37,443
{\a6}They become tears of pain, they become tears of longing.

925
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,580
I need this room immediately.

926
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:36,110
If you evict them now, I'll compensate you.

927
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:38,230
Stop it, what can you do by meeting Kang Min Ho?

928
01:04:37,444 --> 01:04:44,143
{\a6}In my heart, you live like that.

929
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:39,520
You're Song Yi Kyung.

930
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:42,470
Because I'm Song Yi Kyung, I think there's something I can do.

931
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,680
I can't watch anymore.
Trust me.

932
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,410
I think unni's going to leave somewhere.

933
01:04:45,217 --> 01:04:51,891
{\a6}Tears keep flowing, cold tears are flowing.

934
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:47,330
What do I do?

935
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:50,230
Unni! Where are you going!
