Episode 11

4
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,750
<i>Someone...</i>

5
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,300
<i>Someone, please save me!</i>

6
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,640
<i>God...</i>

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,880
<i>please save me.</i>

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,800
<i>I need to live.</i>

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,360
<i>I want to live.</i>

10
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,080
This...

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,870
is it a tear?

12
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,300
How... it's a tear!

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,440
Who is it?

14
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,020
Who is it?

15
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,610
It's good to see you, Shin Ji Hyun.

16
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,300
Shin Ji Hyun, it's right.

17
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,780
Why did Shin Ji Hyun put her seal in
your pot?

18
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,640
Shin Ji Hyun has never come into my room.

19
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,480
Then who put this here?

20
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,460
Ji Hyun...

21
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,030
It was Ji Hyun!

22
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,660
<i>I cooked it with the mussels you like.</i>

23
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,300
Song Yi Kyung brought this.

24
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,880
Don't even leave one drop and eat it all!

25
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,330
Look... with this...

26
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,630
Tada!

27
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,030
Someone must've bought it to use
if I'm in danger.

28
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,120
My dad bought it to use if I was in danger.

29
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,260
I hope you live well, you jerk!

30
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,400
You jerk.

31
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,350
My feelings were right.

32
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,350
It was you.

33
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,940
Shin Ji Hyun.

34
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,100
It was you.

35
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,240
You were next to me.

36
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,470
It's good to see you, Shin Ji Hyun.

37
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,140
I don't know what's going on, but...

38
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,990
it's good to see you.

39
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,170
What about Ji Hyun's parents?

40
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,350
By any chance, did anyone come to see her?

41
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,850
Some lady did come here.

42
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,170
When?

43
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,890
Where did she say she was going?

44
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,400
There was someone who loved me.

45
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,600
I thought there wouldn't even be one person.

46
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,590
Thank you!

47
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:44,740
Congratulation, congratulation,
congratulations on your first tear!

48
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,560
Hey!

49
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,170
Shin Ji Hyun, I guess your 27 years
weren't completely useless.

50
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,970
I got it! I got a tear!

51
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,250
Wh-wha-what are you doing!
What are you doing!

52
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,850
You're not my type!

53
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,520
I think, but...

54
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,970
First,

55
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,060
we can't do this.

56
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,660
Signs of affection are given a penalty
of the highest degree.

57
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,520
Sorry, when I saw you I was so happy.

58
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,060
You're a terrible liar.

59
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,200
You say you're happy to see me,

60
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,770
but this is your last farewell?

61
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,220
<i>Scheduler, I'm leaving.</i>

62
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,290
<i>My father is thinking of not receiving
the surgery because of me.</i>

63
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,170
<i>As you know,</i>

64
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,800
<i>I don't have the confidence
to get three tears.</i>

65
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,530
<i>So I'm going to leave.</i>

66
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,080
<i>I'm feeling so conflicted right now,</i>

67
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,730
<i>so I won't be able to say goodbye
face to face.</i>

68
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,960
<i>Thanks for everything.</i>

69
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,640
I did that because I knew I was going
to see you on the elevator again.

70
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,890
Right.

71
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,300
Excuses are a specialty of the women
in this neighborhood.

72
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,680
But, this tear...

73
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,490
Whose is it? Who cried?

74
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,600
Do you still want to ask me such things?!

75
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,910
Penalties! Have you forgotten?

76
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,500
It's Seo Woo, right?

77
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,710
There's no one besides Seo Woo.

78
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,600
Believing what you want to believe is a
trait of the humans in this neighborhood.

79
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,980
I'm positive.

80
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,200
There's no one besides Seo Woo.

81
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,210
Even if it's Park Seo Woo,

82
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,380
are you going to meet her and give
her your thanks?

83
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,360
Of course I do! She gave me her tears!

84
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,940
The one who truly loved me...

85
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,340
she's the only one.

86
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,440
Is Shin Ji Hyun here? Is she here?

87
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,470
Don't you know that Ji Hyun is
in the hospital?

88
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,980
Ji Hyun's parents weren't at the hospital.

89
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,220
They left for the hospital not too long ago.

90
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,200
Has there been anyone by the house?

91
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,040
- Ji Hyun's friend did come by.
- Friend?

92
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,070
Who?

93
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,180
What did she look like?

94
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,040
What did she say her name was?

95
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:12,510
I don't know the name, but...
she was tall, thin and pretty.

96
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,320
She's a friend who has stopped by before.

97
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,150
Did she meet with Ji Hyun's parents?

98
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,480
Seo Woo!

99
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,990
Yi Kyung, did you come to buy some bread?

100
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,730
No, I came here to see you.

101
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,330
I wanted to thank you.

102
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,040
For what?

103
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:42,870
Um... last time, you allowed me
to eat for free.

104
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,660
That's nothing to come by for.

105
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,020
Like a frog who dies from a
thrown rock,

106
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,930
a piece of bread can save a person
starving to death.

107
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,620
Were you starving that time?

108
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,790
My heart was starved.

109
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,660
Because I didn't have any friends,
I was really lonely.

110
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,910
Is that so?

111
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,100
That friend in the hospital,

112
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,860
she's a really lucky person because
you're her friend.

113
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,070
Ji Hyun?

114
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,850
I'm the lucky one to be Ji Hyun's friend.

115
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,890
<i>So,</i>

116
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,110
<i>it really was you, Seo Woo.</i>

117
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,090
But why don't you have any friends?

118
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,580
<i>All right.</i>

119
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,260
I won't tell anyone that your boyfriend
is Kang Min Ho.

120
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,920
Who is that guy?

121
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,930
Let's see just how great of a guy he is.

122
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,390
<i>Manager?</i>

123
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,220
Just a moment.

124
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,910
<i>Hurry up with the bankruptcy and hand
over the Shin Ga Industries to Hyuk San,</i>

125
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,510
<i>and you can take over Hae Mi Do.</i>

126
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,320
Did you come here to buy bread?

127
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,860
Secretaries nowadays sure have it easy.

128
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:22,470
I guess it's okay to go anywhere at
any time during their work hours.

129
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,600
Your boss is so kind!

130
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,850
Oh, my!

131
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,470
Your boss' daughter is...

132
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,430
- Kang Min Ho's fianc�...
- Song Yi Kyung.

133
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,630
You're too much, Shin In Jung.

134
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,430
Why did you come here?

135
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,860
Are you on friendly terms with that woman?

136
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,850
What did you talk about?

137
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,420
Did you come here to ask about that?

138
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,390
No... I came here to make up with you.

139
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,480
What's with that woman?

140
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,730
Overseas, in Switzerland, red wine spa;
in China, radiant heat spa;

141
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,510
in Africa, potato and marula spa;
in France ??? spa;

142
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,100
<i>in Bali chocolate extract spa;
in Malaysia, crushed coffee bean spa, etc.</i>

143
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,860
<i>That's what we have gathered.</i>

144
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,110
<i>Oppa!</i>

145
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,740
Don't come out and stay here.

146
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,450
Don't move a step.

147
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,590
Hurry and go through with the bankruptcy.

148
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,070
<i>She must've heard everything.</i>

149
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,840
<i>Nationally there are resorts that
specialize in spas,</i>

150
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:59,900
<i>with German style outdoor open-air baths,
garden baths, and herb baths.</i>

151
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,710
And there is also a red ginseng spa
in Jinan.

152
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,200
<i>With that, she disappeared.</i>

153
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,330
<i>Manager,</i>

154
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,890
we asked in what order you wanted
to visit the spas in Korea.

155
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,260
Jinan, Taechon, Sokcho and Muju.

156
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,510
<i>Chauffeur Cha</i>

157
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,450
Gong Mi Jin, draw up the schedule, first.

158
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,950
What's Song Yi Kyung's address?

159
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,770
There's no record of Song Yi Kyung's
phone number.

160
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,090
There's no name for that number.

161
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,540
Does it make sense that there's a number
but no name attached to it?

162
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,720
Have you looked thoroughly?

163
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,900
Min Ho, this isn't the first or second time
I've done this type of thing.

164
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,290
Hyung, did Ji Hyun come here?

165
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,970
Ji Hyun?

166
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,730
I mean, Song Yi Kyung.

167
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,580
Did Song Yi Kyung by any chance come here?

168
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,460
Did something happen to Yi Kyung?

169
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,440
No, I just need to get in touch
with her quickly.

170
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,900
- Has she contacted you?
- What's the matter?

171
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,610
Don't you know Song Yi Kyung's address?

172
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,610
You didn't even get a resume from her?

173
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,270
If she contacts you, call me.

174
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,010
What's wrong with him?

175
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,270
What did you mean when you asked
if I had met Ji Hyun?

176
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,920
- A slip of the tongue.
- Then what about Song Yi Kyung?

177
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,200
Why are you looking for Song Yi Kyung?
What's the matter?

178
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,860
Later.

179
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,030
What's the matter?

180
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,830
It's nothing.

181
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:55,490
What does Ji Hyun have anything
to do with Song Yi Kyung?

182
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,040
Shin Ji Hyun, where did you go off to?

183
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,940
If not the house, hospital, or
with Min Ho...

184
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,490
<i>I've... decided to go away somewhere.</i>

185
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,240
<i>Going away...</i>

186
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,000
<i>so she didn't mean she was returning
to her own life?</i>

187
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,460
<i>What did she mean?</i>

188
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,690
Shin Ji Hyun, where are you?

189
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,730
Where are you!

190
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,620
Shin Ji Hyun!

191
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,250
Wh-what are you doing?

192
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,280
Ji Hyun...

193
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,560
Why are you doing this again?

194
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,920
- I told you I'm Song Yi Kyung.
- No!

195
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,900
You're Ji Hyun.
Shin Ji Hyun!

196
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,440
What's happened?

197
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,020
What happened to you?

198
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,340
<i>How did he know it was me?</i>

199
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,190
What is it?

200
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,530
No...

201
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,920
I'm not Shin Ji Hyun!

202
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,030
I'm Song Yi Kyung!

203
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,340
- Ji Hyun.
- I said I'm not her!

204
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,460
I'm not...

205
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,890
I'm Song Yi Kyung.

206
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,910
I'm Song Yi Kyung.

207
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,010
<i>I can't say that it's you?</i>

208
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,670
Look here, boss,

209
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,970
I'm not Shin Ji Hyun, or your
part-time worker.

210
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,590
I have nothing to do with you!

211
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,320
<i>Shin Ji Hyun,</i>

212
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,580
<i>there's some reason you're
doing this, right?</i>

213
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,630
So,

214
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,990
don't appear in front of me again.

215
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,020
I don't want to hear such nonsense.

216
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,380
Fine.

217
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,310
I made a mistake.

218
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,070
I...

219
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,880
How did he know?

220
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,320
What's suddenly come over Han Kang?

221
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,720
<i>From the beginning, she never told anyone
that she was Shin Ji Hyun.</i>

222
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,340
<i>What's the reason she can't?</i>

223
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,520
<i>Who is Song Yi Kyung?</i>

224
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,730
He must have left.

225
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,540
What do I do, what do I do, what do I do?

226
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,870
I came in early because of this!

227
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,330
All because of Han Kang...

228
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,930
I shouldn't have cleaned up.

229
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,270
What happens if unni notices something?

230
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,170
"Song Yi Kyung, congratulations on
becoming a middle school student."

231
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,850
It's Song Yi Soo.

232
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,360
<i>"Congrats! It's your twentieth birthday!</i>

233
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,910
<i>From Yi Soo, who will congratulate
you on your ninetieth birthday."</i>

234
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:31,500
Song Yi Soo, he must not be her
little brother.

235
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,870
Oh, my!

236
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:37,570
Name, Song Yi Kyung. Age 28, from
Chun Cheon orphanage.

237
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,490
Right, unni was an orphan.

238
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,360
Then who is Song Yi Soo?

239
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:51,110
"From Yi Soo, who will be there to congratulate
you on your ninetieth birthday."

240
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,090
Is this person the one who died?

241
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,520
Unni, thank you for lending me a hand.

242
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,680
Unni,

243
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,290
I'm not in a very good situation right now.

244
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,550
And I have so much to do...

245
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,500
But still, I'll figure out what happened
to Song Yi Soo somehow.

246
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,430
<i>Somnambulism is when you move
around while sleeping,</i>

247
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,140
<i>so you might not be able to
remember anything.</i>

248
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,670
Thinking that it's sleepwalking is less
frightening, but...

249
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,920
It feels like there is another me that
I don't know about.

250
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,660
How about undergoing the hypnosis
treatment I talked about last time?

251
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,800
The clinic is closed the day after tomorrow,

252
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,410
so with no employees around, you can
receive treatment comfortably.

253
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,780
Dad,

254
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,160
what can I do with you holding out
like this?

255
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:25,020
I've only just received one tear.

256
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,410
What happens if something goes wrong
before those 49 days are up?

257
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,720
Fine,

258
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,520
don't get the surgery.

259
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,500
Mom! What do you mean?

260
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,870
You say that Min Ho, instead of you,

261
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,810
will look out for me and Ji Hyun
our entire lives?

262
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,920
I don't need it.

263
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,280
I don't need anyone to look out for me
besides you.

264
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:01,250
And I'll look out for Ji Hyun.

265
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,690
When you die,

266
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:09,360
I'll take care of your funeral, and somehow,
I'll live longer than our Ji Hyun.

267
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,410
So, don't worry and die.

268
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,130
Why are you doing this?

269
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,390
Is it because you can't trust Min Ho?

270
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,170
You can't trust Kang Min Ho.

271
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,550
Dad... you can't.

272
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,790
It's not because I can't trust Min Ho.

273
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,540
I'm saying I don't need it!

274
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,540
I can do it.

275
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,560
I, am Ji Hyun's mother.

276
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,770
I've lived comfortably under your protection
my entire life,

277
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,770
and from now on...

278
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,620
I'll look out for you and Ji Hyun.

279
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:08,410
<i>24 days, 4 hours, 59 minutes are left.</i>

280
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,650
Unni!

281
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,410
<i>So that was it.</i>

282
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:59,060
<i>You were living by borrowing
Song Yi Kyung's body.</i>

283
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,340
Hey, Song Yi Kyung!

284
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,920
Song Yi Kyung, I thought you said you were
going far away somewhere nice.

285
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,410
I see you haven't left.

286
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,780
Why did you come again?

287
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,330
Wow, I'm being completely ignored.

288
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,400
I've come here to scout you.

289
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,410
What?

290
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,610
If there are no other jobs, let's go
to my store.

291
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,170
I'm fine.

292
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,950
Wait, wait.

293
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,730
The reason I made such a mistake yesterday

294
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,790
is because I fell asleep while drinking
and woke up while dreaming.

295
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,570
In my dream you appeared,

296
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,490
saying you were Shin Ji Hyun and
said that you needed to be saved.

297
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,220
Truthfully, I'm a bit of a sleepwalker.

298
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,930
You think that makes any sense?

299
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,450
If I don't make any sense,

300
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,830
does that mean you're really Shin Ji Hyun?

301
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,240
That doesn't make sense!

302
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,870
What did I do wrong?!

303
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,110
It's because of the dream.

304
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,190
Or... I'm just insane.

305
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,620
<i>Is he really crazy?</i>

306
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:29,900
You're not thinking that I'm really
crazy, right?

307
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,130
Do you really sleepwalk?

308
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,980
Ask Hae Won.

309
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,350
After hearing that story,

310
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,160
I was scolded the entire night and came here
to get you.

311
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,780
Why did you get scolded by him?

312
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,890
He used to be a monk.

313
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,890
So he's able to interpret dreams.

314
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,400
He said that our store would go out of
business if we didn't bring you back.

315
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,430
What do you mean?

316
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,070
The reason you asked me to save you
in my dream

317
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:56,610
meant that I needed a Song in my life
or something...

318
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,690
Oh, really... he was so urgent about it.

319
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,280
<i>I didn't know sleepwalking was that serious.</i>

320
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,750
50 percent increase in your part-time wage,

321
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,590
continue as a freelancer, and you're free
to come and leave as you want.

322
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,720
Really?

323
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,740
Why hand in your resignation and
humiliate me!

324
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,330
Hurry and follow me!

325
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,990
<i>He really doesn't know, right?</i>

326
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,770
You better not tell anyone that I sleepwalk.

327
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,490
I won't tell anyone, until I die.

328
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,490
Song Yi Kyung is free to come and leave
as she wants.

329
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,560
She's a freelance, part-time employee free
to do whatever,

330
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,550
so act accordingly.

331
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,630
<i>That's all.</i>

332
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,440
Ahjussi, can I see you?

333
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,150
<i>Okay.</i>

334
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,680
In any case, welcome home!

335
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,950
Yi Kyung, I'm also glad you're here,
because couples are one.

336
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,660
Welcome from me, too!

337
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,680
'Cause I need to stay on the right side.

338
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,440
In any case, thank you.

339
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,700
I'm not.

340
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,590
Song Yi Kyung.

341
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,700
What's the reason you gave this to me?

342
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,390
"You're as prickly and mean as a cactus,"
right?

343
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,740
You were telling me to piss off as you quit
and left, right!

344
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,260
That's not what I mean.

345
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,000
I gave it to you because although on the
outside, you have a lot of needles,

346
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,680
on the inside you are full of tears,
like a cactus.

347
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:55,650
Tears?

348
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,910
Cacti are full of tears?

349
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,840
It's something I heard in a drama
a long time ago.

350
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,890
Someone who is ready to cry.

351
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,610
<i>"You got a call! Get the phone!</i>

352
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,690
<i>Hey, get the phone! Get the phone!"</i>

353
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,010
<i>Kang Min Ho</i>

354
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,850
I'll be back after I take this call.

355
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,520
She's a weird kid.

356
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,920
How did she know?

357
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,400
I never told her that you failed love
thirteen times,

358
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,420
and topped it off with a failed marriage.

359
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,410
Noona, you're divorced?

360
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,170
All right.

361
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:38,050
For Yi Kyung, I'll go along with the whole
dream and interpretation story.

362
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,800
When you were a novice-monk,
were you at Jinan, too?

363
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:42,670
Yeah.

364
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,760
Until I followed your mom to Seoul,
I had never been out of Jinan.

365
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,340
That... what was it?

366
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,190
49 days?

367
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,100
Could you tell me in detail,

368
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:57,250
about those 49 days during which
a soul is searching for something?

369
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,670
Why do you suddenly want to hear that?

370
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,840
Ah, I'm going to Jinan tomorrow,

371
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,200
and I was just suddenly curious.

372
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,720
You're going to Jinan tomorrow?

373
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,100
The anniversary of mom's death
is not far off.

374
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,810
I figured I'd go see her house
and get some fresh air.

375
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,290
Boss.

376
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,680
Can I go out for a while?

377
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,850
You're going to come back, right?

378
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,680
You have to come back, okay.

379
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,170
Of course I'll come back.

380
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,330
Promise me first.

381
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,200
If by chance you're going to
take the rest of the day off,

382
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,460
give me a call.

383
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,540
All right.

384
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,760
You're quite a hard person to reach.

385
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,280
Song Yi Kyung,

386
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,740
- Why did you turn your phone off?
- Turning my cell phone off...

387
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,500
Do I need to explain myself to you?

388
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,880
You should've given me a chance
to explain myself.

389
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:21,370
After seeing all that and just taking off...

390
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:25,410
- You must've known how many times I called.
- You called 27 times over two days.

391
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,490
Let's hear the reason why you made me
call 27 times during those two days.

392
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,380
I didn't come here to tell you that reason.

393
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,680
I came here to return this.

394
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,340
His fianc� wasn't enough,

395
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:43,190
so he kept his fianc�'s friend as his
girlfriend and joint conspirator...

396
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,060
Even though I found that out,

397
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:50,730
I thought I may still feel the impulse
to go into your house.

398
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,410
Kang Min Ho, this doesn't mean I'm
never going to see you again.

399
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,250
Even though there are things
you've seen and heard?

400
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:06,940
I already knew that you were a bastard.

401
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:11,730
If you judge me by society's standards,
I am the bad one.

402
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,540
Although you probably wouldn't understand.

403
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,560
Ruining your fianc�'s company... the will...

404
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,490
It's not a situation that can be easily
understood with a few words.

405
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,960
On top of that, you have
the fianc�'s friend.

406
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,660
That's right, Shin In Jung has been
my long-time girlfriend.

407
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,620
Even before I left to study overseas,
I loved her.

408
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:33,390
And she waited for me two years
after I returned.

409
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,550
- Until now...
- That's no fun.

410
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,560
If you expose everything at once,
it's no fun.

411
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,880
If I ask, tell me then.

412
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,270
Your relationship, your business,
I have no interest in it.

413
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,200
Do you mean...

414
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:53,360
<i>Even after knowing everything,
you'll still see me?</i>

415
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:01,060
<i>Jinan Factory Manager</i>

416
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,740
It seems like an important phone call,
take it.

417
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,950
I'll leave.

418
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,220
Yes, Factory Manager Suh.

419
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,840
I said that you can't go through
with it yet.

420
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,940
Director Jung?

421
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,130
<i>Factory Manager Suh is someone who has been
with the company from the beginning.</i>

422
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,730
I said you can't!

423
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,500
I'll go down there tomorrow,
let's meet and discuss this.

424
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,290
Assistant Director Nam, Gong Mi Jin.

425
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,410
We're going on a business trip to Jinan
tomorrow, so make preparations.

426
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,540
Tomorrow?

427
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,340
Since we're going to stop by
Mujo and Sokcho,

428
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,270
it'll be a two day trip.

429
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,610
<i>You went too far, Shin In Jung.</i>

430
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,980
Why are you looking for Song Yi Kyung?
What's the matter?

431
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,970
What in the world...

432
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,210
What's happening?

433
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,690
Yeah, In Jung.

434
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,320
Oppa, you said you weren't busy
tomorrow, right?

435
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,340
I'm going on a business trip
to Jinan tomorrow.

436
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,340
Why all of a sudden?

437
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,490
That's great, let's go together.

438
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,270
I'm going with Assistant Manager Nam
and Gong Mi Jin.

439
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,480
And it's not even a one day trip.

440
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,370
Then you're coming the day after tomorrow?

441
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:50,300
Yeah, I'm going to take a look around
Gangwon province before I come back.

442
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,530
I need to get ready so I'll hang up now.

443
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,960
Have a good tri...

444
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,880
Where did she go?

445
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,960
I need to know what she's
going around doing.

446
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,250
What are you doing in the parking lot?

447
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,730
What do you care what I'm doing or not?

448
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,260
Fine, continue, then.

449
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,520
<i>Kang!</i>

450
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,980
We see each other again, Yi Kyung.

451
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,140
Song Yi Kyung's here again.

452
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,590
I thought she was gone.

453
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,500
Are you dating Song Yi Kyung?

454
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,870
What are you talking about?

455
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,940
Then why do you run around looking for her?

456
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,010
On top of that,

457
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,800
why are you asking Manager Kang
when you're looking for Yi Kyung?

458
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,590
How... do you know all that?

459
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:20,010
Didn't you see me in front of the elevators?

460
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,630
You were there?

461
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,860
What's going on?

462
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,840
You said you had something to tell me,

463
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,650
what is it?

464
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,330
Oh, I wanted to know how your schedule
was tomorrow.

465
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,850
I'm going to Jinan tomorrow.

466
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,470
Jinan?

467
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,870
Why are you suddenly going to Jinan?

468
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,010
No reason in particular.

469
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,550
That's great!

470
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,740
I was going to ask you if you
wanted to go to Jinan together.

471
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:49,050
Seo Woo and I are going to Jinan tomorrow.

472
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,690
The cherry blossoms should be in full bloom
right now.

473
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,530
Really?

474
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,350
That's great, we can go together tomorrow.

475
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,490
I'm going to leave early tomorrow,

476
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,330
and I have things to take care of
in the morning.

477
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:03,900
But we can still have dinner together,
right?

478
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,610
Yi Kyung, what are you doing?

479
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,010
Do you have something to tell me?

480
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,800
I don't have anything to say in particular.

481
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,430
Can't I sit here?

482
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,850
Of course you can.

483
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,760
Now that I think about it,

484
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,700
we didn't properly greet each other
that day.

485
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,920
About keeping your secret?

486
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,250
You may not be able to understand it,

487
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,660
but we have our reasons.

488
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,680
That's what I thought too.

489
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,100
That's why I said that I wouldn't
tell anyone.

490
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,470
Really?

491
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,740
I guess you're bothered that you saw me
at Seo Woo's store.

492
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,710
I have a habit of speaking harshly
sometimes.

493
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,370
I see.

494
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,880
I thought you were acting hostile
because you'd misunderstood me.

495
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,520
If you don't know the whole story,

496
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,380
it is a situation that can't be seen
in a positive light.

497
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,100
We should meet up sometime and talk.

498
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,860
It would be nice to see a movie together.

499
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,910
How about tomorrow?

500
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,540
I can't tomorrow.

501
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,950
I'm going to Jinan.

502
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,500
Jinan?

503
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,670
Now in Jinan...

504
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,510
The cherry blossoms must be in full bloom,
right?

505
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,040
Do you want to go to Jinan tomorrow?

506
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,840
After moving to Busan, you haven't
been back to Jinan.

507
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:59,110
I don't feel like it.

508
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:04,240
Kang said he's going to Jinan tomorrow, too.

509
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,590
Let's go too.

510
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:09,550
I'll set up a date between you two.

511
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,390
In front, you see a door, right?

512
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,640
Open that door first.

513
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,560
It's... not opening easily.

514
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:36,380
Put some more strength into it.

515
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,930
It opened...

516
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,310
Please, unni!

517
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,520
Yi Kyung! It's okay.

518
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,910
It's okay, Yi Kyung.

519
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,760
Open your eyes, Yi Kyung.

520
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,600
What is it?

521
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,690
What did you see?

522
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,340
Doctor,

523
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,760
what is it...

524
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,790
that I saw?

525
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,460
What did you see?

526
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,520
You're becoming more and more reckless,
aren't you?

527
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,470
Why are you here?
I didn't even call you.

528
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,470
So,

529
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,750
now you're not even going to ask
before causing another accident?

530
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,030
I didn't cause an accident.

531
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,570
You're going to do it right now!

532
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,870
In someone else's body,

533
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,730
you're going on an overnight trip?

534
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:24,060
What kind of reckless action is this!?

535
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,270
Is that body yours?

536
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,360
It's not an overnight trip!

537
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:32,320
Look! I reserved a bus for 8:30.

538
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,000
I'm going to come back by twelve.

539
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,380
Kang Min Ho is thinking that it is
an overnight trip!

540
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,210
Do you really not know men?

541
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:42,250
Going as a one-day trip and making it two
is what men do!

542
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:47,240
Are you worrying about me right
now or Song Yi Kyung?

543
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,060
Wh-what are you talking about?

544
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,420
Your client, isn't it me?

545
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,730
But why are you acting like
Song Yi Kyung's brother?

546
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,030
If I don't come back by twelve,
my days are cut short.

547
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,770
Do you think that I'd spend the night
with Kang Min Ho?

548
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,560
Do I have a reason to be dragged by
you into the elevator to the afterlife?

549
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,080
You still shouldn't do it!

550
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,840
It's dangerous!

551
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:09,280
Kang Min Ho and Shin In Jung
are both going to Jinan.

552
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,510
You're going to make it a trio in Jinan?

553
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,610
What reason do you have to go there?

554
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,920
I'm going to do what I can.

555
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:18,810
My dad, because of Kang Min Ho,

556
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,870
is resisting and not getting the surgery.

557
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,400
Even if I stay in a vegetative state
my entire life,

558
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,240
he trusts that Min Ho will forever
guard me and my mom.

559
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,850
I need to break that trust.

560
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,260
That way, he'll get the surgery.

561
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,440
All you need to do is get two more tears.

562
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:37,210
That's... not something I can do.

563
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,700
You were crying buckets
after receiving just one tear.

564
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,150
That's...

565
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:45,660
from the emotions I felt having received
the love of one person.

566
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:48,380
Because of that, I've gotten the strength
to hold on.

567
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,890
But I realized that whether people
love me or not

568
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:55,520
was decided while I was alive.

569
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,240
No matter how desperate I am...

570
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,330
Love is not something you can receive
by begging.

571
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:05,370
The things that'll happen in this
neighborhood once you leave,

572
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,830
just let them be.

573
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,120
They no longer have any consequence
on your life.

574
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,900
My dad's life is on the line here!

575
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,220
This kid, really...!

576
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,860
Hey, go! Go, go!

577
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,470
Go and make another mess!

578
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,630
It's not my responsibility!

579
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,370
Don't think of me as the naive Shin Ji Hyun
of before.

580
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:24,500
I died after getting into an accident and
overcame two near-deaths after dying.

581
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:27,000
I'm not afraid of dying.

582
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:29,090
But because of me,

583
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,690
I'm afraid that Dad will die.

584
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,770
Life and death are not things that
can be altered by human actions.

585
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,060
<i>Kang! Kang!</i>

586
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:51,690
Here, Hwa Jun made some rice balls
for you to eat on the trip.

587
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:53,150
Along with some boiled eggs and fruit.

588
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,940
And this is the name of the hermitage.

589
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,260
How did you find this out?

590
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,340
It's towards the top of the temple.

591
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:59,870
At the temple, you should be able to
find it by asking monk Do Hyun.

592
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,230
Ahjussi, I didn't even say anything.

593
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,860
Why are you acting as if you know
everything?

594
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,210
What do I know?

595
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,210
I don't know anything?

596
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,200
It's because I'm afraid to say it.

597
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:15,360
Your not being able to say anything,
I know there must be some reason for it.

598
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,650
Thanks, ahjussi.

599
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:34,830
What are you doing here?

600
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,660
I'm going to Jinan, too.

601
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,660
I wanted to get a ride.

602
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:41,040
Why are you going to Jinan?

603
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:43,590
Because you're going.

604
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,970
What kind of woman is Shin Ji Hyun?

605
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,900
I don't think the woman you should
be worrying about is Shin Ji Hyun.

606
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:35,710
What kind of woman is she,

607
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:39,150
that she's so easily manipulated
by her friend and fianc�?

608
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:42,980
She was not an interesting woman.

609
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,240
She was too simple and innocent.

610
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:48,150
You aren't an interesting man either.

611
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,830
Not being interesting,
isn't this what it means?

612
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,350
That you can clearly read them.

613
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,530
Does that mean that you can read me?

614
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,380
I see everything,

615
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,840
but there's one thing that I don't.

616
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:07,230
Why you're trying to bankrupt the company.

617
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,290
Do you have a grudge against
Shin Ji Hyun's family?

618
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:12,160
Some driving force?

619
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,260
I have no such thing.

620
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,520
Didn't I tell you last time?

621
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:17,960
She was a kind woman,

622
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,960
and her parents are both good people.

623
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,280
Then why are you trying to bankrupt
their company for no reason?

624
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:26,260
They just have bad luck, like me.

625
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,390
- "Like me?"
- Right, like me.

626
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,800
What do you mean?

627
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:38,030
If you become too curious,
it'll become boring.

628
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,770
I'm asking you because I'm interested.

629
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:43,470
I have no interest in entertaining you.

630
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,550
I thought you said it would be no fun
if I told you everything at once.

631
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:11,330
You said it's your first time in Jinan,
right?

632
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,200
Jinan is a clean region where the
water is clear and the air fresh.

633
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:16,770
<i>I know better than you.</i>

634
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,320
What you see up there is Ma Yi Mountain.

635
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,690
<i>That was my playground.</i>

636
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,190
It looks interesting.

637
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,160
- Are you Monk Do Hyun?
- Yes.

638
00:47:56,570 --> 00:48:00,420
I came here because I heard you
know where this hermitage is.

639
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:30,520
Who are you?

640
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:35,120
I came here to see someone.

641
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,140
I heard that for 50 years they lived
as an ascetic...

642
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,630
Because I look so ragged, "You're not it,"
is that it?

643
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,160
N-no, that's not it.

644
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,490
Please tell me.

645
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,770
I won't tell anyone else!

646
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,460
I already know that
I can't tell anyone.

647
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,140
You already know that
you can't talk about it.

648
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:07,150
So why are you asking me to talk?
You rotten bastard.

649
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:10,540
I'm going to live another thirty years.

650
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:15,420
So, for those 49 days, they can't reveal
who they are, right?

651
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:19,540
I don't know... Other people may say so.

652
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,500
So after 49 days, if they want to live,

653
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:25,750
how and what do they have to do?

654
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:48,560
Meeting the factory manager

655
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:51,200
and going around the spas is
going to take three or four hours.

656
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:52,960
How are you going to spend your time alone?

657
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,800
Can't we go to the factory together?

658
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,580
Did I say I was going to the factory?

659
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,770
You spoke with the factory manager.

660
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:01,550
I'm not going to the factory.

661
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,210
When I'm done I'll call you,

662
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:05,310
so figure out by yourself what
you're going to do.

663
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,740
All right.

664
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,070
{\a6}Shin Industries
Jinan Factory

665
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:28,260
<i>Are you threatening me?</i>

666
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:32,810
Director Jung said since you're the one
postponing the bankruptcy.

667
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:36,630
- So we should negotiate with you.
- So your negotiation is a threat?

668
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,520
I expected the factory to close down
by the end of March,

669
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:40,120
and in plans of taking off,
I had already bought land!

670
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:43,180
You're the one who bought land in
preparation of leaving here, not me.

671
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:48,930
What if I reveal everything
to President Shin Il Shik?

672
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,340
What can I do? It can't be helped.

673
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,440
I didn't place you in Jinan Factory
to do such things.

674
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:58,580
What to do?

675
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:01,320
What should we do?

676
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:08,640
Before I give the command,
do not take action.

677
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:25,530
If I didn't move to Jinan because of
my atopy, I would have never met you guys.

678
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,530
Right.

679
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:32,700
My atopy was cured after coming here,
and now I have perfect skin.

680
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:35,540
You remember my face when I
moved here, right?

681
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:38,010
It was the talk of the town.

682
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,790
At that time, you and Ji Hyun scolded
the other kids.

683
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:43,770
From that time onwards, we had so much fun
as a trio.

684
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,320
To you,

685
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:48,050
Jinan only seems to hold good memories.

686
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:52,380
We should go around to the schools
we attended, your orchard,

687
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,770
the houses we lived in,
let's go to all of them!

688
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:58,370
Fine, go look around.
I need to make a call.

689
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,340
Hello?

690
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:13,250
There's a reservation for Manager
Kang Min Ho from Seoul's Shin Group, right?

691
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,640
What room is he in?

692
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:51,550
<i>Shin Ji Hyun, how lonely were you
all that time?</i>

693
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:54,130
<i>No one recognized you,</i>

694
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:57,300
<i>and you couldn't tell anyone,
all by yourself...</i>

695
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,020
<i>How lonely were you all by yourself?</i>

696
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:12,250
Guys, for the charity fundraiser,
we're going to divide into teams.

697
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,300
Like this, people who grab the same
tarot cards will become a team.

698
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:20,450
Here, pick one.

699
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:40,590
Okay. One, two, three!

700
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,320
No, no, no!

701
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,310
I'll completely fail if I do it with him!

702
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:56,520
Hey, does anyone want to switch?

703
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,540
Let's switch! Switch with me!

704
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:00,610
Won't you switch with me?

705
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:03,310
What do I do? Ah, really.

706
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,880
I don't want to do it with you either!

707
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,350
Hey, Song Yi Kyung!

708
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:27,060
What do I do? What do I do?

709
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,870
What are you doing here?

710
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,790
That is...

711
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:36,680
I mean...

712
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:39,860
Oh, you know this school is famous, right?

713
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:41,780
I attended this school.

714
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:44,360
<i>Our school isn't famous.</i>

715
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,430
I've asked the wrong question.

716
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:49,100
I guess I should ask what you are doing
in Jinan.

717
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,460
What are you doing in Jinan?

718
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:53,980
I came with Kang Min Ho.

719
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:55,670
Min Ho?

720
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,330
I came with Kang Min Ho,

721
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,870
but there's no particular reason I came.

722
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:02,650
<i>Right, I guess you could still like Min Ho.</i>

723
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:06,780
I don't like men with fianc�s!

724
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:10,590
Looks like you'd give the death penalty to
anyone who liked someone with a fianc�.

725
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:13,230
There's really nothing between
me and Kang Min Ho.

726
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,590
You could like someone with a fianc�.

727
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:18,480
Because liking someone is all up to you.

728
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,290
But hiding what you feel

729
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:23,530
is more painful than not knowing.

730
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:26,680
<i>Han Kang, what's with him all of a sudden?</i>

731
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,310
<i>Why isn't he getting angry?</i>

732
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:37,370
Hello?

733
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,370
<i>Where are you, and what are you doing?</i>

734
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,720
Yeah, In Jung.

735
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:48,750
Then come to the restaurant at the end
of the cherry blossom reservoir by 6:30.

736
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,930
All right, let's see each other later.

737
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:57,630
<i>Oppa, when does your work end?</i>

738
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:02,780
Then let's see each other at seven
at the pavilion.

739
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,260
<i>Oppa, when does your work end?</i>

740
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:12,790
<i>Let's talk when you're finished.</i>

741
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,360
<i>I'm going to have a drink with Assistant
Manager Nam and Go Mi Jin.</i>

742
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:21,360
<i>I'll call you afterwards.</i>

743
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:42,890
<i>In the red ginseng spa, the ginseng is...</i>

744
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,660
- Are you feeling that great?
- Of course.

745
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:10,780
During all that time in stifling Seoul,

746
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:14,050
my skin was suffering and my atopy
was about to come back.

747
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:16,380
Now that my skin is better,
I feel like I could fly away.

748
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:21,820
Tell Kang that I'll be stopping by my house,
and you two have dinner together.

749
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:25,360
- When are you going to come?
- Why would I go?

750
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:27,330
After some thirty minutes,

751
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:29,090
call me and ask me why I'm not coming.

752
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,860
Then I'll make the excuse that
something happened at home.

753
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:33,590
You're really not going to come?

754
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,440
Of course.

755
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,880
Give me your car, and you can take
Kang's car back to Seoul.

756
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:42,440
And don't talk about Ji Hyun.

757
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,090
You're going to stay at your parent's house,
right?

758
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:46,490
Yeah.

759
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:50,790
<i>Manager Kang says he knows you're here...</i>

760
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:55,450
<i>and wants you to come by 7 to the pavilion
on the road with the cherry blossoms.</i>

761
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:04,220
You said you had an appointment
with Min Ho at 7, right?

762
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,030
There's still time left, what are you
going to do?

763
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:07,280
I'll figure it out on my own.

764
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:10,000
You don't even know your way around here,
how are you going to figure it out?

765
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,290
Since it's your first time in Jinan,
I'll show you around.

766
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,770
Get in.

767
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,160
Because of you, I had a good time
around Jinan.

768
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,280
Have a good time with Min Ho.

769
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:06,270
Yeah, Park Seo Woo.

770
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:08,170
<i>Kang, why aren't you here?</i>

771
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:10,210
Go on.

772
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,750
<i>Seo Woo must be waiting by herself.</i>

773
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:15,750
I'm going right now.

774
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:33,480
What did you do and where?

775
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:36,100
I was having a good time.

776
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,980
What did you do by yourself?

777
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,310
It's pretty here, let's walk.

778
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:41,810
Aren't you hungry?

779
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:44,040
After eating, walking at night is also nice.

780
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:46,400
It's because I just want to walk right now.

781
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,640
What's wrong?

782
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,950
I feel dizzy...

783
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:41,774
Yi Kyung.

784
01:01:41,775 --> 01:01:43,980
<i>- I'm going crazy because of you.
- What did I do?</i>

785
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:55,680
Yi Kyung!

786
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,280
Yi Kyung!

787
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:01,360
Yi Kyung!

788
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:04,700
Yi Kyung!

789
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,650
Yi Kyung, are you okay?

790
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:18,150
Who are you?

<i>Everything about Ji Hyun
is full of desire.</i>

799
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:46,530
<i>Enough to follow him to Jinan,
do you like Min Ho that much?</i>

800
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,870
<i>I had a reason to do so,
that's why I followed him.</i>

801
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,050
<i>You bastard!</i>

802
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:52,400
<i>What's wrong with you?
Is it because of Song Yi Kyung?</i>

803
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:54,450
<i>You clearly know what our relationship is.
What are you trying to do?</i>

804
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:57,180
<i>Are you afraid you're going
to lose Kang Min Ho?</i>

805
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:00,380
<i>Wow! Where are you going
that you're so smartly dressed?</i>

806
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:01,500
I'm going on a date.

807
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:02,730
You were a complete player.

808
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:04,620
<i>Song Yi Kyung, what is it
you want from me?</i>

809
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:07,460
<i>Kang Min Ho, you'll never figure me out.</i>

810
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,680
Now you're no longer a person
I want to figure out.
