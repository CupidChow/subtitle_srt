00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:36,779
Oh! I am...

4
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:41,490
Shin Ji Hyun.

5
00:01:24,768 --> 00:01:27,208
When did she last wash her hair?

6
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:31,161
Oh my, my.

7
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,290
What is this?

8
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:36,363
Am I a gangster?

9
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:46,373
Episode 2

10
00:02:02,175 --> 00:02:04,145
There is no shampoo?

11
00:02:34,258 --> 00:02:37,208
She can't not use skin lotion.

12
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,259
She doesn't wear a
padded bra or lipstick.

13
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:26,610
What kind of girl is she?

14
00:03:35,436 --> 00:03:38,580
Song Yi Kyung, you are 28.

15
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:42,700
She is a lot taller than me.

16
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,910
Her fingers are longer too.

17
00:03:45,737 --> 00:03:48,440
She has a slim figure and it's pretty.

18
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:56,825
Ah! I am going to go crazy.
I totally look like a bum.

19
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,346
Aiyoo, how can I
walk around like this?

20
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,909
Wow, it's you scheduler!

21
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:08,811
You scared me!

22
00:04:08,846 --> 00:04:11,380
When did you come?
Why are you here?

23
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:12,547
What's wrong with you?

24
00:04:12,582 --> 00:04:15,990
Hey. It's me, Shin Ji Hyun.

25
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:17,901
What did you just say?

26
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:19,400
Shin... Ji... Hyun?

27
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:20,404
Yeah!

28
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,270
I am Shin Ji Hy...!

29
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,769
I am sure I told you yesterday,

30
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:30,656
that for the next 49 days there are
3 things you must promise to do.

31
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,390
I'm sure of it.

32
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:36,700
Three promises?

33
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,795
One. You cannot tell anyone
that you are Shin Ji Hyun.

34
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,890
What?

35
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,334
But I am Shin J...

36
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:46,411
Even if you are Shin Ji Hyun,
you cannot tell anyone who you are.

37
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:49,269
You can't tell them or even... think it.

38
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:53,059
If I can't say I'm Shin Ji Hyun,
how can I collect the 3 tears?

39
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:56,864
If it was that easy, why would you
have to borrow someone else's body?

40
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:58,879
You'd just ask, "Do you love me?"

41
00:04:58,914 --> 00:04:59,919
"No, I don't. "

42
00:05:00,148 --> 00:05:01,450
Do you think they'd say that?

43
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:02,558
That's true.

44
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,279
If you do not keep this promise,

45
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:07,339
you will be walking straight
into the elevator.

46
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:09,690
The first to enter with top status.

47
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:14,190
But you ignored what I told you?

48
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:15,944
Ignored?

49
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:17,746
Not ignored, I just forgot.

50
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:19,679
I remember the 2nd and 3rd rules.

51
00:05:19,892 --> 00:05:20,690
The second.

52
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:25,429
Shin Ji Hyun, you can only use
Song Yi Kyung's body when she's sleeping.

53
00:05:25,464 --> 00:05:27,457
If we calculate it by time,

54
00:05:27,492 --> 00:05:30,373
that would be from 10 am to midnight.

55
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:32,140
Right?

56
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,809
Your IQ is 2 digits, right?

57
00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:36,311
I told you,

58
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:40,374
you have to be at Song Yi Kyung's house,
every night by midnight.

59
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:44,303
What happens if I don't
return to her house by midnight?

60
00:05:44,338 --> 00:05:47,929
If you are one minute late
you lose a day out of the 49 days.

61
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:49,000
How is that fair?

62
00:05:49,035 --> 00:05:50,443
That is our world's rule.

63
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:52,626
What is the third rule?

64
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:55,698
The money you need,
you will have to earn it.

65
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,054
You want me to earn
my own money?

66
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:00,553
I am warning you,
while you borrow her money.

67
00:06:00,588 --> 00:06:02,982
You cannot do bad things,
immature things.

68
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:06,065
What I am saying is
you cannot disturb her life.

69
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,526
I understand, so stop!

70
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:11,299
By appearance,
you look like a man.

71
00:06:11,546 --> 00:06:14,310
But your nagging
is worse than my mom's.

72
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:16,434
Excuse me.

73
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:20,828
In our world there is no
male or female.

74
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:22,710
Excuse me.

75
00:06:22,745 --> 00:06:25,439
I do not care about your world.

76
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:26,009
What?

77
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:29,800
I am not going to your world!
I will not go.

78
00:06:30,552 --> 00:06:31,690
You said

79
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,440
that even if 3 of my friends
cry tears tomorrow,

80
00:06:34,475 --> 00:06:36,494
it shows that they love me, right?

81
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,513
It has to be 3 people who...

82
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:39,909
really love you.

83
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,779
What if it's more than 3?

84
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,139
I've thought about it.

85
00:06:44,351 --> 00:06:47,245
If you exclude my mom and dad,
I have 3 people who

86
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,913
truly love me.

87
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:53,425
I tried to shrink the numbers of people
but I couldn't. You said only 3.

88
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,684
But I can predict 5 to 6 people.

89
00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:01,150
So, will you give me an incentive,
if there are more than 3?

90
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,096
I- Incentive?

91
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,504
I was thinking,

92
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:06,600
one extra person would be
one extra year,

93
00:07:06,897 --> 00:07:08,449
so I can live 2 or 3 years longer.

94
00:07:08,484 --> 00:07:09,724
Wow...

95
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,618
This time I've really scored an
annoying one to work with. Ow...!

96
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,218
If you don't know the answer,

97
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,497
try calling them.

98
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:21,389
Hey!

99
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,460
But, you see...

100
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:38,242
You're not...

101
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:41,392
my mom or dad,

102
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,439
nor my friend or boyfriend.

103
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:44,354
So?

104
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:47,409
So, you are... the scheduler?

105
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:49,085
Yeah, so?

106
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,507
So...

107
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:55,903
telling you... I am Shin Ji Hyun,

108
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,259
should just be forgiven
as a mistake.

109
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:00,613
It is.

110
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:01,590
Huh?

111
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,019
Were you going to act like
you weren't Shin Ji Hyun?

112
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:05,109
Hey!

113
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:06,762
Take this.

114
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:09,544
It's a hand phone.

115
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:13,169
<i>{\a6}48 days 3 hours, 25 minutes left.</i>

116
00:08:13,204 --> 00:08:13,984
Ah! What is this?

117
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:15,329
The time that you have left.

118
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:19,004
<i>This is an emergency button,</i>

119
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,722
push it when it is an emergency.

120
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:23,710
Also, my number is on speed dial.

121
00:08:25,745 --> 00:08:28,470
When I say emergency,
it has to be a real emergency.

122
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:31,867
An emergency situation is when you
break one of the 3 promises

123
00:08:32,107 --> 00:08:35,770
or when you are... really in trouble.

124
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,184
This really looks like a hand phone,
one of those newly released ones.

125
00:08:40,872 --> 00:08:42,727
Here's some cash until you find work.

126
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:44,131
It's a loan.

127
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:47,757
You have to pay it back within 49 days.

128
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,999
Whether you stay in this world or not.

129
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:50,973
49,000 won?

130
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:53,555
Then... I'm leaving.

131
00:08:54,162 --> 00:08:55,243
Hey, hey.

132
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,559
But why do you ride a motorcycle?

133
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:00,334
When like the last time,
you can just go here, go there.

134
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:02,966
So why would you go around
acting like a human?

135
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,563
This is how, I enjoy my life
as a scheduler.

136
00:09:05,598 --> 00:09:07,900
Enjoy your life as a scheduler?

137
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:14,579
Stop involving yourself in my life,
get on with your own.

138
00:09:14,614 --> 00:09:17,126
If you're to get 3 tears,
you'll have to get busy.

139
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:18,530
Oh yeah, yeah!

140
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:22,407
But, how do I know if I
get 3 tears?

141
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:24,169
There, that necklace.

142
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:26,437
Neck... Necklace?

143
00:09:27,486 --> 00:09:30,725
If someone really drops a genuine tear,

144
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,320
catch it there.

145
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:34,196
Here?

146
00:09:35,657 --> 00:09:37,200
Let's go together!

147
00:09:37,738 --> 00:09:39,798
Drop me off at the hospital.

148
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:47,330
Our rule is...

149
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:50,460
A scheduler doesn't get involved
with a person's life.

150
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,900
He is so disrespectful.

151
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,251
Oh!

152
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:08,008
Taxi!

153
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,939
[ 9,500 won ]

154
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:13,434
Oh, yes.

155
00:10:13,469 --> 00:10:15,387
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

156
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,150
[ Shin Ji Hyun ]

157
00:10:43,217 --> 00:10:45,477
How long are you
going to be like this?

158
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,343
I told you to go home and sleep.

159
00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:50,422
I am fine.

160
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:51,726
Oppa.

161
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:54,179
You need to at least
change your clothes.

162
00:10:54,214 --> 00:10:56,350
I want to be next to Ji Hyun.

163
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:58,010
Oppa...

164
00:10:59,096 --> 00:11:00,464
Min Ho,

165
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,857
is... this a dream?

166
00:11:04,892 --> 00:11:06,911
I wish it was.

167
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:10,507
That Ji Hyun...

168
00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:13,597
is just having a dream.

169
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,020
<i>She will come back.</i>

170
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:23,917
She will come back, father.

171
00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:25,340
Yes.

172
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:31,255
She will come back because
she feels bad.

173
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:33,366
<i>This girl.</i>

174
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:38,093
Dad.

175
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:41,138
Oppa.

176
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,989
What if you hadn't meet him
in the mountains?

177
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:54,238
You should have asked for his name.

178
00:11:54,273 --> 00:11:56,946
I wasn't in any condition
to ask him.

179
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:59,620
I think, I'll place a newspaper ad.

180
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,719
"Kang Won Do Mountain's life saver".

181
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:04,067
"Looking for the man who
saved my daughter's life". Like that?

182
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:06,172
If you are not grateful,
then you're not much of a person.

183
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:09,917
<i>Don't you think an ad in the newspaper
is a little... over the top?</i>

184
00:12:09,952 --> 00:12:12,769
An over* is the thing you buy every winter.
(* Play on words, making a joke. 'over' the top ='overcoat'.)

185
00:12:12,804 --> 00:12:14,764
He saved our daughter's life.

186
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,945
He piggybacked her,
she was unconscious.

187
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,518
That is true.

188
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,272
When he had me on his back,
it was less cold...

189
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,010
and less scary.

190
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,099
You can't come?

191
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:33,018
I thought you'd left?

192
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:36,216
<i>I did. But my senior called me.</i>

193
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:38,869
<i>I told you right?
That I have a blind date.</i>

194
00:12:38,904 --> 00:12:41,434
<i>I forgot that it was today.</i>

195
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:45,019
You are the one that organized this to
apologize for what happened in the mountains.

196
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:46,419
<i>I know.</i>

197
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:48,386
<i>I will tell senior I can't go.</i>

198
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,749
Which is more important, coming to the
movies or your blind date?

199
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:54,309
- Hey, are you joking with me?
- Are you joking with me?

200
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:56,960
<i>How can a man watch a
movie by himself?!</i>

201
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:01,819
<i>You are fine now,
so find your inner strength.</i>

202
00:13:01,854 --> 00:13:03,159
<i>Ji Hyun.</i>

203
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:03,936
<i>Ji Hyun?</i>

204
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:05,165
Have a good blind date.

205
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,359
- Bye.
- Gosh, really?

206
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:09,620
If you intended to make up,
why did you cry and ask for comfort?

207
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:15,719
I want to go with you but
I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

208
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,559
Take care of yourself.

209
00:13:21,887 --> 00:13:22,358
Oh my!

210
00:13:22,393 --> 00:13:23,910
It's fine, kiddo.

211
00:13:28,145 --> 00:13:29,710
Oh, excuse me...

212
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,329
Don't you remember me?

213
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:35,899
Last week in the Ohon Mountains.

214
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,430
Ohon Mountains?

215
00:13:38,953 --> 00:13:40,320
That crybaby?

216
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:47,060
<i>Oppa, I'm sorry.</i>

217
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:50,620
<i>Oppa, you saved me and
love me so much.</i>

218
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:54,330
<i>But I caused you pain,
I am so sorry.</i>

219
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,010
But, why isn't he crying?

220
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:11,837
He cried so much yesterday.

221
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:14,498
I guess his eyes are dry.

222
00:14:15,953 --> 00:14:17,380
Excuse me...

223
00:14:17,664 --> 00:14:19,560
Did you come to visit?

224
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,100
No, that is not it.

225
00:14:22,397 --> 00:14:24,747
I am looking for somewhere.

226
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:29,753
Are you looking for treatments?
They are on the first floor.

227
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:31,677
Treatments?

228
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:03,149
Goodbye.

229
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:05,300
[ Shampoo and Conditioner ]

230
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:13,966
<i>That's 29,000 won.</i>

231
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:34,661
Come inside and look.

232
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:36,482
Did the manager go somewhere?

233
00:15:36,517 --> 00:15:39,286
She said she couldn't come in today.

234
00:15:41,557 --> 00:15:43,297
Who are you?

235
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:46,470
I am no one.

236
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,164
<i>Shin In Jung. Get up.</i>

237
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,273
<i>Unni made you porridge.</i>

238
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:58,185
Ji Hyun's father is right.
You need to at least go to work.

239
00:15:59,474 --> 00:16:01,234
I should.

240
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:08,857
I need to.

241
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:11,863
Hey! Did Ji Hyun die?!

242
00:16:12,484 --> 00:16:15,004
Who would've thought she'd
end up like...?

243
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:17,640
I never dreamt that.

244
00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:21,638
Who did?

245
00:16:21,673 --> 00:16:23,349
<i>Who did?!</i>

246
00:16:25,888 --> 00:16:27,368
Stop crying.

247
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:32,188
Stop crying... and stay by her side...

248
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:36,079
and help Ji Hyun's parents. Huh?

249
00:16:50,672 --> 00:16:52,541
They're not home?

250
00:16:53,926 --> 00:16:56,956
They weren't at the hospital either.

251
00:16:58,057 --> 00:17:00,847
I need to see how they're doing.

252
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,711
They must be at Kang's.

253
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:38,804
So... you don't want me to
act cocky, right?

254
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:43,142
How should I act,
if I can't act cocky?

255
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:44,758
Gosh, this kid.

256
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:47,217
You're still acting cocky.

257
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:51,141
But I don't know who you all are...

258
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:53,199
and, I've never seen you either.

259
00:17:53,997 --> 00:17:55,767
Do you know me?

260
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,846
Gosh, this jerk...

261
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:02,205
This kid...

262
00:18:17,345 --> 00:18:17,870
<i>Let's go.</i>

263
00:18:17,905 --> 00:18:18,749
Come on, let's go.

264
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:20,469
If we touch her,
my father will kill me.

265
00:18:20,504 --> 00:18:21,299
<i>Let's go.</i>

266
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,639
<i>Quickly, let's go.</i>

267
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,685
I need to tell my dad to
quit or something.

268
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,320
You pathetic guys!

269
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:28,920
Stop right now!

270
00:18:39,488 --> 00:18:41,054
Hey! Hey!

271
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:43,304
Hey, new kid. Are you okay?

272
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:45,520
You must've been so scared.

273
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:46,742
Who are you?

274
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:50,809
Those kids. I told them not to mess
with the weaker kids.

275
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:52,305
Why don't they listen?

276
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,441
Weaker kids?

277
00:18:53,476 --> 00:18:57,584
You might not know
because you are from Seoul.

278
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:00,622
But Seoul city kids cannot win against
us Country kids.

279
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:02,400
So be careful.

280
00:19:04,147 --> 00:19:05,308
Hey, country girl.

281
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,460
Why is a girl getting involved?

282
00:19:07,874 --> 00:19:09,434
I am the peace keeper.

283
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:11,159
I can't stay away from
unfair situations.

284
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:11,750
What?

285
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:13,509
That's what my dad taught me

286
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:15,800
to take the weaker person's side
and to help them.

287
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:19,259
I am a Tae Kwon Do black belt
and Kumdo first degree.

288
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:21,840
Did you think they ran away
for no reason?

289
00:19:23,032 --> 00:19:26,560
You... get involved again,
I will kill you.

290
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,590
Oh, new student.

291
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:34,337
Can you help me get my bike?

292
00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:16,769
Are you going to go up?

293
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,440
Oh, you came!
Boss, have you come?

294
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,349
Aiyoo, I told you not to
call me boss.

295
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,656
Are your ears plugged?

296
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,773
Do you have Alzheimer's?
Are you a monkey head?

297
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,360
I am sorry.

298
00:20:29,954 --> 00:20:32,274
Why is that here?

299
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:34,957
What is that?

300
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:39,277
How many times have I told you
I do not like things strewn about!

301
00:20:42,437 --> 00:20:43,569
Ahjussi, what?

302
00:20:43,604 --> 00:20:44,674
What?

303
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,304
Why are you looking at me?

304
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:47,864
Is there something on my face?

305
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:50,689
Why are you staring at me like you're
looking at animals in the zoo?

306
00:20:50,724 --> 00:20:52,894
Oh... I'm sorry.

307
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:54,519
What are you sorry for?!

308
00:20:54,747 --> 00:20:56,219
Is looking at a person
something to be sorry about?

309
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:58,005
Why are you sorry?!

310
00:21:13,998 --> 00:21:14,893
Hello.

311
00:21:14,928 --> 00:21:15,974
How many?

312
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,020
That is...

313
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,270
They're not here.

314
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,076
You can sit and wait for them.

315
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:23,561
No, its okay.

316
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,549
Do you think she's really a customer?

317
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:45,823
You are always so fast to judge.

318
00:21:45,858 --> 00:21:48,647
They said if you eat well
you will be blessed. That's true.

319
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,670
Mr. Oh. That's not eating well, right?

320
00:21:53,728 --> 00:21:56,241
She is blessed with a healthy appetite.

321
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:06,930
Ah... Now I feel like I can live.

322
00:22:25,831 --> 00:22:30,200
It is a crime for people who eat
without having money.

323
00:22:30,443 --> 00:22:34,332
It isn't a crime...
it's just not having enough money.

324
00:22:36,305 --> 00:22:37,573
Should I call the police and ask?

325
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:39,106
No! You cannot!

326
00:22:39,595 --> 00:22:40,999
I told you I'll pay you back.

327
00:22:41,034 --> 00:22:42,403
I'll work to pay you back.

328
00:22:42,438 --> 00:22:44,642
By whose decision?

329
00:22:45,106 --> 00:22:47,280
Perhaps the boss.

330
00:22:49,006 --> 00:22:52,649
I was... really hungry.

331
00:22:52,857 --> 00:22:55,400
<i>My body can't tolerate being hungry.</i>

332
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,729
So I ate without thinking
about the money.

333
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:01,530
Do you really think I did it
on purpose?!

334
00:23:02,663 --> 00:23:04,227
<i>The boss...</i>

335
00:23:05,578 --> 00:23:07,370
said you can just go.

336
00:23:07,815 --> 00:23:08,995
Huh?

337
00:23:19,384 --> 00:23:21,693
Like his mother said,

338
00:23:21,728 --> 00:23:24,002
Han Kang has a good side.

339
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,702
Kang...

340
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:33,250
when I return...

341
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:36,056
I won't forget this kindness.

342
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:45,870
I need money for a ride.

343
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,230
The money you need,
you will have to earn it.

344
00:24:11,831 --> 00:24:14,701
There is nothing I can do.

345
00:24:19,272 --> 00:24:20,199
Part time job?

346
00:24:20,443 --> 00:24:21,189
Yes.

347
00:24:21,402 --> 00:24:24,469
- If you let me work, I can repay you.
- I don't need the money.

348
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,619
We're not looking for staff.

349
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,700
I know that.

350
00:24:28,515 --> 00:24:31,057
I graduated from a Hotel Training School

351
00:24:31,092 --> 00:24:33,599
and worked at the
Seoul Hotel for 2 years.

352
00:24:33,634 --> 00:24:35,865
We do not need a person.

353
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:41,060
My situation is...
I need to work here.

354
00:24:42,845 --> 00:24:45,609
We do not need a person
to work here.

355
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,490
Do you want to work here for free?

356
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:51,014
I can't work here for free.

357
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,836
<i>Wait, wait up.</i>

358
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,379
For just 48 days.

359
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:59,371
Just 48 days. Can't that work?

360
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:01,923
What are you? Are you joking?

361
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,164
48 days?

362
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:05,860
Think about it as if you're
saving a life.

363
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:08,294
No.

364
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:12,019
Not 48 days... just a week.

365
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:14,069
Just for a week.

366
00:25:16,195 --> 00:25:23,930
Ah... I am not really sure
but I think I don't have a job right now.

367
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,130
<i>Here.</i>

368
00:25:58,854 --> 00:26:01,084
Take it instead of working here.

369
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:08,460
Do you want more?

370
00:26:09,148 --> 00:26:12,259
It is... okay.

371
00:26:12,294 --> 00:26:13,649
My dad...

372
00:26:13,684 --> 00:26:17,795
said never accept money for free. Yo!

373
00:26:26,703 --> 00:26:30,020
Han Kang, you would, you...
bad person!

374
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:31,928
Excuse me.

375
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:39,030
Here he is.

376
00:26:43,953 --> 00:26:45,159
What?

377
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:46,510
Name?

378
00:26:46,892 --> 00:26:47,504
Huh?

379
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,580
What is your name?

380
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,810
It is Song Yi Kyung.

381
00:26:54,318 --> 00:26:57,859
From 11am to 12am,
at 4,000 won per hour.

382
00:26:58,063 --> 00:26:58,714
Huh?

383
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:01,270
When you work tomorrow,
bring your resume.

384
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:03,154
Wow!

385
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:06,350
Thank... thank you!

386
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:12,015
But...

387
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,930
I don't have any money for bus fare.

388
00:27:17,214 --> 00:27:19,500
Can you let me borrow
2,000 won?

389
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,010
Where is this?

390
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,900
What is wrong with her?

391
00:27:50,892 --> 00:27:53,100
She must not work out.

392
00:27:53,363 --> 00:27:55,130
She doesn't exercise.

393
00:28:03,503 --> 00:28:06,100
But where do I hide these?

394
00:28:25,189 --> 00:28:27,179
What is all this!

395
00:29:03,471 --> 00:29:05,932
She treats me like cold rice.

396
00:29:38,481 --> 00:29:40,831
I am not tired at all.

397
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:43,743
This is so amazing.

398
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:46,521
8:25

399
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:50,444
What should I do?

400
00:29:52,488 --> 00:29:53,718
Oh!

401
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:57,055
What to do, what to do?

402
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,092
I need to go out!

403
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:12,522
<i>To the end with this feeling</i>

404
00:30:12,557 --> 00:30:15,611
<i>Let this night just live on</i>

405
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:18,743
<i>Take your hands out of your pockets</i>

406
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:21,828
<i>Look into the big blue sky</i>

407
00:30:22,394 --> 00:30:28,067
<i>What do you really live for?</i>

408
00:30:29,187 --> 00:30:32,733
<i>I want to live just for you</i>

409
00:30:33,176 --> 00:30:35,087
<i>Just for you</i>

410
00:30:35,648 --> 00:30:41,438
<i>Live tonight, live for you</i>

411
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,220
<i>Save me, save me.</i>

412
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,990
<i>What type of emergency button is this?</i>

413
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,720
It's been 3 minutes
and he's still not here.

414
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,430
Is he wasting time riding around on
his motorcycle?

415
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:07,139
Ah! Father!

416
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:12,931
What is the problem?

417
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,650
What's this? What?!

418
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:19,992
Could you open the door?

419
00:31:22,152 --> 00:31:26,649
D- did you call me... to open the door?

420
00:31:26,862 --> 00:31:30,489
For this? I hope it isn't for this.

421
00:31:30,524 --> 00:31:32,290
To me, this is an emergency.

422
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:33,897
I need to leave...

423
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:35,504
but I cannot open the door.

424
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:36,976
Didn't you know you can't
open the door?

425
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,200
That you can't touch things here?!

426
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,421
What is this? I'm a spirit.

427
00:31:41,456 --> 00:31:42,628
And if I am,

428
00:31:42,663 --> 00:31:45,769
I should be able to walk through
doors and walls.

429
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,060
Why am I like this?

430
00:31:50,605 --> 00:31:51,730
It's because,

431
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:53,297
you are not dead yet.

432
00:31:53,332 --> 00:31:56,114
You are not fully a spirit
in your world.

433
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:57,688
Min Ho Oppa walked right through me.

434
00:31:57,723 --> 00:32:02,005
Because to the people in your world,
you are dead.

435
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:04,229
Can you not understand?

436
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:05,669
Is it hard to comprehend?

437
00:32:06,306 --> 00:32:07,450
No.

438
00:32:08,068 --> 00:32:10,964
Since you explained it...
you are right.

439
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:14,501
You are such a simple,
and easy to convince princess.

440
00:32:19,943 --> 00:32:22,353
The room is a little messy, right?

441
00:32:23,538 --> 00:32:24,329
<i>Oh my.</i>

442
00:32:24,548 --> 00:32:26,200
She must be getting up.

443
00:32:26,505 --> 00:32:29,339
No, you are out,
so she is free now.

444
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:31,249
Hey, let's go out.

445
00:32:31,476 --> 00:32:33,881
I don't want to be in
the same room.

446
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,590
A Scheduler,

447
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:38,309
does not get involved
in the every day life of a human.

448
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,559
As a 49-dayer, you need to
get used to your life!

449
00:32:41,594 --> 00:32:43,280
That's your rule.

450
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:44,760
Oh.

451
00:32:47,476 --> 00:32:49,579
Hey! Hey!

452
00:32:49,614 --> 00:32:52,539
I'm not going to help you
so don't look for me or call my name.

453
00:32:52,778 --> 00:32:54,930
Also, don't phone me.

454
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:57,824
Oh...

455
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:00,390
He is so cold.

456
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:38,050
<i>Slowly my tears fall down</i>

457
00:33:38,885 --> 00:33:41,821
<i>unintentionally fall.</i>

458
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:49,397
<i>You might wipe them,
so I hide them.</i>

459
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:53,619
<i>I can erase it.</i>

460
00:33:54,181 --> 00:33:57,038
<i>I can forget it.</i>

461
00:33:57,746 --> 00:34:05,003
<i>But thinking my life without you,
tears form.</i>

462
00:34:05,474 --> 00:34:10,025
<i>You didn't say anything,</i>

463
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,694
<i>You were the one that left</i>

464
00:34:14,078 --> 00:34:20,350
<i>I really wish it wasn't true</i>

465
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,927
<i>It is okay for you to come back</i>

466
00:34:24,404 --> 00:34:27,819
<i>It is okay for you to come back</i>

467
00:34:28,177 --> 00:34:35,952
<i>I love you, I still do. Please, please</i>

468
00:34:35,987 --> 00:34:39,196
<i>Nothing has happened</i>

469
00:34:39,693 --> 00:34:43,233
<i>Nothing has happened.</i>

470
00:34:43,573 --> 00:34:47,003
<i>When I wake up tonight,</i>

471
00:34:47,383 --> 00:34:51,006
<i>I will be...</i>

472
00:34:51,698 --> 00:34:52,598
<i>with you... again.</i>

473
00:35:03,836 --> 00:35:04,987
This is nice.

474
00:35:05,246 --> 00:35:07,061
I don't have to pay
to ride the bus.

475
00:35:21,028 --> 00:35:22,668
Oppa.

476
00:35:22,985 --> 00:35:26,235
Is this really... me?

477
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,473
When I see it like this,
it's scary.

478
00:35:43,198 --> 00:35:44,210
Don't look!

479
00:35:44,245 --> 00:35:46,339
Or the feelings you have for me
will all dissipate.

480
00:35:46,374 --> 00:35:48,084
Shin Ji Hyun...

481
00:35:49,721 --> 00:35:52,001
What should I do?

482
00:35:54,131 --> 00:35:55,821
Cry.

483
00:35:57,373 --> 00:35:59,421
It's only been one day

484
00:35:59,645 --> 00:36:01,470
but it feels so long.

485
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,809
Oppa, give me the first tear

486
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:10,059
and tell In Jung and Seo Woo
to cry for me too.

487
00:36:10,278 --> 00:36:12,568
Don't hold it in, huh?

488
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,240
Hello.

489
00:36:22,882 --> 00:36:25,527
Can I get a pack of cigarettes?
The one far to the right.

490
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,060
<i>It's 2,500 won.</i>

491
00:36:31,715 --> 00:36:33,485
Are you okay?

492
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:37,325
Are you dizzy... or your hands shaky?

493
00:36:38,344 --> 00:36:42,834
If your head hurts,
you have to go to the hospital.

494
00:36:54,052 --> 00:36:55,499
Who are you?

495
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:57,829
Don't you know me?

496
00:36:59,923 --> 00:37:02,686
I've come here, the same time
for the past 6 months

497
00:37:02,995 --> 00:37:04,714
and bought these cigarettes.

498
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,241
How much was the hospital bill?

499
00:37:10,705 --> 00:37:12,674
I will give you the rest tomorrow.

500
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,811
There is the taxi fare too.

501
00:37:15,575 --> 00:37:16,969
I will give it to you tomorrow.

502
00:37:17,004 --> 00:37:18,309
And...

503
00:37:18,782 --> 00:37:20,689
from now on, don't get involved.

504
00:37:20,914 --> 00:37:22,089
Okay.

505
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,617
I will bring the receipt tomorrow.

506
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:59,970
<i>47 days, 3 hours, 29 minutes left</i>

507
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:10,951
Ah... it feels nice, nice, nice!

508
00:38:16,218 --> 00:38:19,788
I am sure she doesn't have a dryer.

509
00:38:27,393 --> 00:38:28,673
Aigoo.

510
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,900
Wow!

511
00:38:34,183 --> 00:38:36,253
Ah! A dryer!

512
00:38:38,553 --> 00:38:40,865
Oh, my. What is all this? Wow!

513
00:38:49,198 --> 00:38:50,648
I am going to do this.

514
00:38:59,157 --> 00:39:01,117
Please help me learn.

515
00:39:02,004 --> 00:39:05,157
<i>You sure you're not the younger sister
of the girl from yesterday?</i>

516
00:39:05,192 --> 00:39:06,198
No, I am not.

517
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:09,092
Song Yi Kyung,
doesn't have a younger sister.

518
00:39:09,365 --> 00:39:10,523
Did you bring your resume?

519
00:39:10,558 --> 00:39:11,428
Yes.

520
00:39:12,779 --> 00:39:14,067
Here.

521
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,980
I am sorry.

522
00:39:52,129 --> 00:39:54,899
I am sorry. I am sorry.

523
00:40:00,171 --> 00:40:01,925
<i>How could this happen!</i>

524
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,387
<i>What did my daughter do wrong!</i>

525
00:40:04,822 --> 00:40:08,745
What did she do
for her to go through all this?!

526
00:40:08,995 --> 00:40:11,064
Please calm down, honey,
Calm down. Calm down.

527
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:13,214
What were you doing?!

528
00:40:13,249 --> 00:40:17,339
As her father,
what were you doing?!

529
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:19,790
Yes. I am sorry.

530
00:40:23,077 --> 00:40:24,648
Why?

531
00:40:25,672 --> 00:40:30,397
Why was she there,
why an accident there?

532
00:40:30,432 --> 00:40:33,150
She was at Kang Nam looking at
bridesmaid dresses...

533
00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:36,387
and then going to get a massage.

534
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:40,910
Why was she at the Gook Dong*?
(* Gook Dong is a province in Gyeonggi)

535
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:47,240
She...

536
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,394
What if she isn't Ji Hyun? Huh?

537
00:40:50,429 --> 00:40:52,829
- Huh?
- What are you saying?

538
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:54,597
It is true.

539
00:40:54,632 --> 00:40:56,331
Look at her.

540
00:40:56,671 --> 00:40:58,485
<i>Is she our Ji Hyun?</i>

541
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,380
Does our Ji Hyun look like that?

542
00:41:01,895 --> 00:41:05,851
She... is not our Ji Hyun.
She isn't. She isn't.

543
00:41:05,886 --> 00:41:08,535
<i>- Ji Hyun's mom...
- She isn't!</i>

544
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:12,253
Ji Hyun's mom, why are you
acting like this?

545
00:41:12,288 --> 00:41:15,936
- She isn't, she isn't.
- Stop, stop. Stop.

546
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:33,389
<i>Hey Shin In Jung. Move, move.</i>

547
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,875
The porridge is cooled
to the perfect temperature.

548
00:41:37,613 --> 00:41:38,369
Mother...

549
00:41:38,404 --> 00:41:40,555
if you don't eat this
entire bowl,

550
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,706
we are going to get killed by father.

551
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:50,207
Why don't you listen?

552
00:42:51,091 --> 00:42:52,940
Are my words a joke to you?

553
00:42:53,242 --> 00:42:54,701
I told you to go!

554
00:42:54,736 --> 00:42:55,638
Father...

555
00:42:55,673 --> 00:43:00,319
How can you wear the same clothes for 4 days
and sit near my daughter smelling like that?

556
00:43:05,997 --> 00:43:08,377
I'll go wash and
change my clothes.

557
00:43:10,471 --> 00:43:12,711
The manager position is yours.

558
00:43:15,078 --> 00:43:16,412
So...

559
00:43:16,909 --> 00:43:21,591
go eat, wash... get some sleep,

560
00:43:22,332 --> 00:43:24,242
and change your clothes.

561
00:43:27,315 --> 00:43:29,345
You need to go to the company.

562
00:43:29,716 --> 00:43:31,149
Father.

563
00:43:31,382 --> 00:43:33,216
Here...

564
00:43:34,776 --> 00:43:37,363
I will stay here.

565
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:55,701
Kang.

566
00:43:57,088 --> 00:43:58,443
Thank you, Ahjussi.

567
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:03,049
Song Yi Kyung...
you should let her go home.

568
00:44:22,805 --> 00:44:24,568
Welcome.

569
00:44:26,938 --> 00:44:28,793
- Sit here.
- No, it is okay.

570
00:44:29,035 --> 00:44:29,963
Hyung!

571
00:44:30,175 --> 00:44:31,330
Welcome.

572
00:44:36,485 --> 00:44:38,975
- What...
- You have to eat right?

573
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:41,201
Song Yi Kyung...

574
00:44:43,803 --> 00:44:46,273
It just looks
like he hasn't eaten.

575
00:44:51,748 --> 00:44:53,178
Why aren't you at the hospital?

576
00:44:53,213 --> 00:44:54,934
I want to drink alcohol.

577
00:44:55,922 --> 00:44:57,706
Okay. I'll get it for you.

578
00:44:57,741 --> 00:45:00,911
Not wine... something stronger.

579
00:45:01,178 --> 00:45:02,114
<i>What to do...</i>

580
00:45:02,149 --> 00:45:03,769
<i>On an empty stomach?</i>

581
00:45:03,804 --> 00:45:05,389
Give me a strong drink.

582
00:45:06,994 --> 00:45:08,364
Wait here.

583
00:45:13,155 --> 00:45:17,485
Do you want... some potato soup?

584
00:45:20,144 --> 00:45:21,580
Oh, I am...

585
00:45:22,012 --> 00:45:25,334
a new employee, Song Yi Kyung.

586
00:45:26,069 --> 00:45:27,709
Yes, Song Yi Kyung...

587
00:45:27,928 --> 00:45:29,591
Yes, please continue.

588
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:31,254
Thank you for caring,

589
00:45:31,456 --> 00:45:33,314
but I'd like to be alone right now.

590
00:45:33,602 --> 00:45:35,843
Oh, yes.

591
00:45:52,415 --> 00:45:55,259
<i>Oppa, you don't have to do that.</i>

592
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,240
[ Mr. Jung ]

593
00:46:40,194 --> 00:46:41,678
Drink this.

594
00:46:43,157 --> 00:46:45,447
Everything will turn out fine.

595
00:46:50,732 --> 00:46:52,452
Song Yi Kyung...

596
00:46:54,055 --> 00:46:56,515
Ahjussi, she can leave now.

597
00:46:59,536 --> 00:47:00,578
Hyung!

598
00:47:00,796 --> 00:47:02,183
You should stop.

599
00:47:02,218 --> 00:47:02,933
Go.

600
00:47:07,441 --> 00:47:09,091
This isn't right.

601
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,961
Ji Hyun cannot be like this.

602
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:15,664
It will get better.

603
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:18,386
This can't be happening.

604
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,222
<i>Here.</i>

605
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:45,650
Yes.

606
00:48:05,783 --> 00:48:08,237
- Take...
- Take care of him.

607
00:48:17,085 --> 00:48:18,880
What are you doing?

608
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,505
<i>He is my friend's fiance!</i>

609
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,180
Are you interested in him?

610
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,819
I am just being nice
because he is a customer.

611
00:48:27,025 --> 00:48:29,685
So, you wait outside for an hour?

612
00:48:31,023 --> 00:48:32,372
You, from tomorrow...

613
00:48:32,407 --> 00:48:33,634
I'm late!

614
00:50:12,947 --> 00:50:14,477
Shin Ji Hyun...

615
00:50:15,084 --> 00:50:16,794
You look great.

616
00:50:17,825 --> 00:50:20,938
You used to come by
and act like you were the best.

617
00:50:24,499 --> 00:50:28,049
<i>Slowly my tears fall down,</i>

618
00:50:28,084 --> 00:50:31,600
<i>unintentionally fall.</i>

619
00:50:32,021 --> 00:50:38,361
<i>you might wipe them,
so I hide them.</i>

620
00:50:39,623 --> 00:50:42,759
<i>I can erase it all.</i>

621
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:45,960
<i>I can forget it.</i>

622
00:50:47,334 --> 00:50:54,543
<i>But thinking my life without you,
tears form.</i>

623
00:50:55,028 --> 00:50:59,460
<i>You didn't say anything,</i>

624
00:50:59,762 --> 00:51:02,917
<i>You were the one that left</i>

625
00:51:03,635 --> 00:51:04,735
<i>I wish it wasn't true.</i>

626
00:51:33,248 --> 00:51:35,624
I can't live because of you.

627
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:38,700
<i>Who now a days, stays at the hospital
overnight like this?</i>

628
00:51:38,735 --> 00:51:40,805
You're supposed to hire someone!

629
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:17,341
Dad.

630
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:20,666
Just wait a couple of days.

631
00:52:22,045 --> 00:52:25,105
Oppa, In Jung, and Seo Woo too.

632
00:52:26,229 --> 00:52:28,739
They will cry, won't they?

633
00:52:33,638 --> 00:52:38,751
But, I guess people don't cry as often
as I thought they did.

634
00:52:40,972 --> 00:52:44,612
I thought people would think about me
all day and cry.

635
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,290
I am sorry. I am sorry.

636
00:53:43,406 --> 00:53:44,738
Aigoo.

637
00:53:49,813 --> 00:53:51,182
I am sorry.

638
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:41,710
Wow! You're really good.
How come you're so good at it?

639
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,049
Good at it?

640
00:54:43,725 --> 00:54:45,646
I learned as a part-time employee.

641
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:47,820
Did you do this kind... of work?

642
00:54:47,855 --> 00:54:49,959
I told you, as a part-time job.

643
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:52,799
But I am not a
hotel management major.

644
00:54:53,017 --> 00:54:54,960
Oh, that's because...

645
00:54:55,237 --> 00:54:59,720
I went through this difficult time and
lost some of my memory.

646
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,883
So how difficult a time was it
that you forgot... how to pour water?

647
00:55:04,918 --> 00:55:06,715
Well that is...

648
00:55:07,336 --> 00:55:10,819
I didn't work for a long time,
and I am not that smart.

649
00:55:11,028 --> 00:55:12,979
So, I think I forgot a lot.

650
00:55:13,189 --> 00:55:14,917
Song Yi Kyung...

651
00:55:15,764 --> 00:55:17,479
are you sure you worked at a hotel?

652
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,429
I have.

653
00:55:18,464 --> 00:55:19,169
No!

654
00:55:19,411 --> 00:55:22,419
You have never
carried a tray before.

655
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:24,698
Ah, that is... That is...

656
00:55:24,733 --> 00:55:25,974
That is...

657
00:55:26,009 --> 00:55:30,324
I got into a car accident,
and as a result I got amnesia.

658
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:32,349
Amnesia?

659
00:55:32,569 --> 00:55:34,247
It was short-term amnesia, too.

660
00:55:34,282 --> 00:55:36,515
I lost selected parts of my memories,

661
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:38,713
from the trauma suffered in the accident.

662
00:55:38,748 --> 00:55:41,863
You can search the internet or
watch dramas, it's often shown there.

663
00:55:41,898 --> 00:55:44,819
Go to Seoul Hotel and get proof
that you worked there.

664
00:55:44,854 --> 00:55:46,040
What?

665
00:55:46,381 --> 00:55:47,909
If you don't want to,
just quit now.

666
00:55:48,129 --> 00:55:49,004
I'll go get it.

667
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:49,844
In one hour.

668
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:52,353
How can I go to Seoul Hotel
and back in an hour?

669
00:55:52,388 --> 00:55:53,875
Take a taxi!

670
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:56,164
I don't have fare for a taxi.

671
00:56:04,999 --> 00:56:06,514
Twelve hours and 20 minutes yesterday,

672
00:56:06,549 --> 00:56:08,480
and today's 30 minutes...

673
00:56:09,214 --> 00:56:11,420
Here, 52000 won.

674
00:56:12,345 --> 00:56:13,497
Ki Jun Hee...

675
00:56:13,781 --> 00:56:15,245
start your stopwatch.

676
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,017
Wait. Wait!

677
00:56:34,338 --> 00:56:38,913
I'm... here to get proof of
my employment.

678
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,166
Oh! Yi Kyung!

679
00:56:42,201 --> 00:56:44,305
Song Yi Kyung, right?

680
00:56:44,972 --> 00:56:47,272
How long has it been?

681
00:56:48,917 --> 00:56:49,637
Hello.

682
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:54,039
Why are you acting like that?

683
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,675
Like we don't know each other.

684
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,532
Oh, I thought my liver was
going to fall out.

685
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:14,714
She worked at such a big hotel,

686
00:57:14,749 --> 00:57:17,609
so why does she live like a ghost?

687
00:57:55,158 --> 00:57:57,675
Oh. It's Oppa.

688
00:58:06,534 --> 00:58:08,404
Where is he going?

689
00:58:16,387 --> 00:58:18,157
<i>The restaurant?</i>

690
00:58:32,481 --> 00:58:33,701
In...

691
00:58:45,587 --> 00:58:47,447
<i>The 18th floor.</i>

692
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,920
What to do?

693
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:11,237
How could this be happening?

694
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:16,871
<i>Choose the one you like,
Ms. Ji Hyun.</i>

695
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:19,121
<i>On your wedding day, it's important
the bride be beautiful.</i>

696
01:01:19,156 --> 01:01:20,274
No, I can't.

697
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:23,676
I've chosen someone for her among
my fiance's friends.

698
01:01:23,711 --> 01:01:26,340
Then, tell her to come here
and try it on.

699
01:01:27,189 --> 01:01:28,195
I should.

700
01:01:28,561 --> 01:01:31,201
Can I wear this,
I will be right back.

701
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,474
<i>This doesn't make any sense.</i>

702
01:02:22,317 --> 01:02:24,198
<i>I didn't see it correctly.</i>

703
01:02:24,233 --> 01:02:26,079
<i>I didn't see it right.</i>

704
01:02:26,311 --> 01:02:27,889
<i>I didn't see it.</i>

705
01:02:31,031 --> 01:02:34,260
<i>I am going to the North
to get some air,</i>

706
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,710
<i>why don't we go together?</i>

707
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:51,197
<i>There is no way.</i>

708
01:02:51,232 --> 01:02:53,161
<i>Absolutely no way.</i>

709
01:02:53,196 --> 01:02:54,820
<i>Does this make sense?</i>

710
01:02:55,133 --> 01:02:57,969
<i>Shin Ji Hyun,
what are you doing?</i>

711
01:02:58,004 --> 01:03:00,805
<i>What bad thing are you thinking?</i>

712
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:03,620
<i>It is Min Ho Oppa and In Jung.</i>

713
01:03:03,872 --> 01:03:06,109
<i>It is Kang Min Ho and Shin In Jung!</i>

714
01:03:06,144 --> 01:03:08,540
I need to ask them myself.

01:04:09,544 --> 01:04:11,044
<i>Ji Hyun's land documents.</i>

722
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:14,289
<i>President Shin, hasn't had time to
think about her land issues right now.</i>

723
01:04:14,324 --> 01:04:15,376
So we need to find it.

724
01:04:15,411 --> 01:04:16,394
You knew about it.

725
01:04:16,429 --> 01:04:18,569
How I got into the accident,
you knew about it!

726
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:20,364
I do not care.

727
01:04:20,399 --> 01:04:22,144
<i>What am I going to do now?</i>

728
01:04:22,179 --> 01:04:24,869
<i>49 days, it is not that long.</i>

729
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:26,014
<i>Song Yi Kyung?</i>

730
01:04:26,049 --> 01:04:27,454
Do you not remember me?

731
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:28,824
Should I remember you?

732
01:04:28,859 --> 01:04:32,480
