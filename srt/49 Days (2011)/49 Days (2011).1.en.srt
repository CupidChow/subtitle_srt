Episode 1

4
00:01:21,912 --> 00:01:23,297
Oh no!

5
00:01:31,548 --> 00:01:35,365
What can I do?
I'll be late for my engagement!

6
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:39,205
In Jung, what can I do? What can I do?

7
00:01:39,368 --> 00:01:40,492
Get out.

8
00:01:40,713 --> 00:01:42,994
- What?
- Get out, I said.

9
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:10,089
Here.

10
00:02:10,648 --> 00:02:12,032
Wear it.

11
00:02:12,738 --> 00:02:14,973
Ahjussi, you want me to wear that?

12
00:02:15,054 --> 00:02:16,055
It's an engagement!

13
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,591
Just for an engagement, I need to-

14
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:21,001
Go upstairs and put it on.
You'll be late for the engagement.

15
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,556
Hurry, hurry.

16
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:41,042
Shin Ji Hyun, are you laughing right now?

17
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:46,469
It's so funny!
Doesn't it feel like we're in a movie?

18
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:48,714
Only ten more minutes!

19
00:02:51,763 --> 00:02:53,870
Oh my lord...

20
00:02:57,547 --> 00:03:00,271
Isn't this ridiculous.

21
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:01,656
Are you okay?

22
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,808
You aren't hurt?

23
00:03:02,877 --> 00:03:05,333
No. My heels.

24
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:17,368
What can I do?

25
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:21,185
In Jung, she's crying again.

26
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,793
Hey crybaby, stop crying.

27
00:03:27,795 --> 00:03:29,389
Put these on.

28
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:31,650
Hurry up and put them on.

29
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:33,279
What about you?

30
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,071
Hurry, hurry.

31
00:03:35,176 --> 00:03:38,387
We're right out front, Mother.
We'll be right there.

32
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:39,679
Hurry up!

33
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,518
I keep stepping on my dress!

34
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,544
Better?

35
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:47,884
Hey! Hey-

36
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:09,188
What is this?

37
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:23,416
[Kang Min Ho]
[Shin Ji Hyun]

38
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:59,524
<i>My friend, Kang Min Ho -
I am so envious of him at this moment.</i>

39
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:06,097
Now the bride's father will speak for both sets of parents.

40
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:08,726
Please welcome him with applause.

41
00:05:17,203 --> 00:05:18,739
I apologize.

42
00:05:19,077 --> 00:05:20,764
At a difficult time like this,

43
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:24,767
I've been extravagant
with my daughter's engagement.

44
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:31,708
As you all know,
my company is my son-in-law's-

45
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:49,914
That kid.

46
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:52,753
Han Kang just came?

47
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,069
Kang!

48
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,387
The work given to Manager Kang
Min Ho is so large.

49
00:06:04,515 --> 00:06:07,103
That by the time he's done
and arranges the marriage,

50
00:06:07,215 --> 00:06:12,793
it may be one or even two years from now.

51
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,247
So I wanted to introduce them to you all.

52
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:23,738
Cheers!

53
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,231
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

54
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,918
Thank you

55
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:34,246
Hey!

56
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,504
Who comes at the tail end of
an engagement like this?

57
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,517
I came, didn't I?
Can I go now?

58
00:06:38,587 --> 00:06:41,240
You'll be the last to arrive
and the first to leave, then?

59
00:06:42,613 --> 00:06:45,779
Hey Han Kang, at least give your
congratulations before you go.

60
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:47,745
Hyung, congratulations.

61
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:51,085
Min Ho.

62
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:51,981
Yes.

63
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:55,494
President Jo wants to see you.

64
00:06:57,868 --> 00:07:00,312
Kang, hold Ji Hyun's hand a bit.

65
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,734
Her dress is-

66
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:09,319
Why should I hold your fianc�e's hand?

67
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:11,590
I'm fine!

68
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:15,640
Careful, careful.

69
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:23,413
You met that friend
when you went to get your MBA?

70
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,453
He was an architecture major.
He's brilliant.

71
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:28,500
I'm planning to put him in charge of
constructing Private Space A.

72
00:07:28,536 --> 00:07:32,272
If you're the same year,
he must not have much experience.

73
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,020
During college, he received
the Top Award for Architecture.

74
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:40,860
Go ahead.

75
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:42,095
Yes.

76
00:07:43,072 --> 00:07:44,108
Yes,

77
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:49,961
it's almost over.

78
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:53,231
Now?

79
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:57,967
You want me to come now?

80
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,655
Welcome.

81
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:22,727
A box of cigarettes,

82
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:25,834
the ones on the right.

83
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:34,201
That's 2500 won please.

84
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:39,984
Have a nice evening.

85
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,199
Where in the world did you go?

86
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:48,165
Ji Hyun?

87
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:50,224
She went straight to sleep, of course.

88
00:09:50,317 --> 00:09:53,115
As soon as the engagement was over-

89
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,657
Father, no.

90
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:28,763
President, what are you saying?

91
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,254
Dad, we just got engaged yesterday.

92
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,859
You want us to get married
within a fortnight?

93
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:37,629
I told you I didn't think it all through.

94
00:10:37,922 --> 00:10:39,609
Before things get hectic,

95
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:41,980
I should've thrown you a wedding,
not an engagement.

96
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:44,598
But Father,
we've already done the engagement.

97
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:45,739
What?

98
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:47,926
You don't want to get married now?

99
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,858
You don't want to marry Ji Hyun?

100
00:10:50,044 --> 00:10:51,452
You know that's not true.

101
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:52,162
Then, it's set!

102
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:54,536
But still, how can we get
married in two weeks?

103
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:55,874
There's so much to do!

104
00:10:55,931 --> 00:11:01,349
This is strange. You've been inseparable lately,
but now what?

105
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:07,721
He wants to make him
one family quickly and officially.

106
00:11:07,803 --> 00:11:11,384
That way, the resort development
will go more smoothly.

107
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:13,787
He wants us to get married soon
because of the company?

108
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:16,943
Hey! Does your dad care
that much about the company?

109
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,383
You're first.
I'm second, and third is the company.

110
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:22,798
That's how it is for Shin Il Shik.
Don't you know that?

111
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,342
No, I know.

112
00:11:25,624 --> 00:11:28,192
But even Oppa was shocked.

113
00:11:41,856 --> 00:11:43,352
Oppa!

114
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:45,448
What's this?

115
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:53,209
Because of Father, I didn't even get to propose
before having the wedding date set.

116
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:55,258
Propose?

117
00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:11,074
Hurry up, Oppa.

118
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,385
I'm so hungry!

119
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:19,577
Why isn't there any food?
Didn't you order?

120
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:22,380
Min Ho is here too!

121
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,488
Didn't you go to the factory?

122
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,256
Before marrying,
I needed to pay my respects to you two.

123
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:30,447
You didn't even get our approval
before setting the date, backstabber.

124
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:31,696
What now?

125
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:35,441
Five minutes ago you said everything was good.

126
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:36,960
Look.

127
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:44,950
Ahjussi, did you take out bay leaves?

128
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,732
I took out the bay leaves and
put in twice as much garlic.

129
00:12:49,097 --> 00:12:51,194
What are you doing?
Take it over there quickly!

130
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:53,502
I just picked up the dish, boss!

131
00:12:53,644 --> 00:12:54,751
Go!

132
00:13:11,473 --> 00:13:12,697
Kang Min Ho,

133
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:16,783
that fateful day when you met Shin Ji Hyun

134
00:13:16,948 --> 00:13:20,776
did you expect she'd be a girl to eat so much?

135
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:22,449
Fateful day?

136
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,429
Oh, that day when my heart
almost became paralyzed?

137
00:13:32,773 --> 00:13:35,117
In Jung, hurry up.

138
00:13:45,786 --> 00:13:48,165
In Jung, what are you doing?

139
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,557
Let's go!

140
00:14:17,804 --> 00:14:20,559
In Jung!

141
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:26,024
In Jung!

142
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,553
It's okay now.
You're alive, it'll be just fine.

143
00:15:32,002 --> 00:15:35,441
I'd like to go with you,
but I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

144
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:37,443
Take care of yourself.

145
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,044
Get up.

146
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:46,214
<i>Just like in the movie, right?</i>

147
00:15:46,968 --> 00:15:49,653
Totally like in the movie,
don't you think?

148
00:15:50,195 --> 00:15:54,623
Even as he piggybacked me down the mountain
I wondered, is this a man or a ghost?

149
00:15:58,242 --> 00:15:59,490
What?

150
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:02,211
You're still feeling guilty, aren't you?

151
00:16:02,364 --> 00:16:04,943
What if I had died because of you.

152
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,534
Shin Ji Hyun couldn't die in that place.

153
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:09,266
Whose daughter are you?

154
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:13,065
If it weren't for Min Ho oppa,
I really would've died there.

155
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:27,963
The reception hall is set,
the dress is set, we need to send the invitations.

156
00:16:28,116 --> 00:16:30,649
Now we just need to shop
for bridesmaid dresses.

157
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,522
There are too many things to buy.

158
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:40,460
They're coming out!
Oh, they're so pretty!

159
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,369
In Jung and I need to wear
those dresses then, huh?

160
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:45,430
I'm going to go pick your dresses tomorrow.

161
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,612
Hey! How can you be so clumsy
with that dress on?

162
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:51,403
No kidding.

163
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:58,563
This dress...

164
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:01,013
You two should wear it
when you get married too!

165
00:17:01,531 --> 00:17:04,611
All three of us will get married
in the same wedding dress!

166
00:17:04,728 --> 00:17:08,132
It's better than renting a dress, no?

167
00:17:09,722 --> 00:17:12,278
You're making In Jung's room into a workroom, right?

168
00:17:12,384 --> 00:17:16,612
Yea. While we're on our honeymoon,
my mom said she'll take care of it all.

169
00:17:16,694 --> 00:17:20,011
If I had come to Seoul for school,
we all could've lived together.

170
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:23,580
In Jung, try it on.

171
00:17:23,851 --> 00:17:26,607
No, I feel guilty to Min Ho.

172
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,517
It's not like you're walking down
the aisle in this dress as the bride.

173
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:36,969
<i>Shouldn't you be sleeping now?</i>

174
00:17:37,864 --> 00:17:41,032
Min Ho is really a spirit.
How did he know we're not asleep yet?

175
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,647
There's nothing he doesn't know about me.

176
00:17:47,863 --> 00:17:51,172
<i>Going to bed now. Sleep well.</i>

177
00:18:17,572 --> 00:18:19,221
Where's the money?

178
00:18:22,071 --> 00:18:23,132
No, that one.

179
00:18:23,273 --> 00:18:25,793
Take out the money the boss left.

180
00:18:27,243 --> 00:18:30,329
We came knowing about
the money, so don't be stupid.

181
00:18:30,482 --> 00:18:33,556
What're you doing?
The girl isn't even moving!

182
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:38,396
We know the boss left the money here!

183
00:18:39,964 --> 00:18:41,884
She must be crazy!

184
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,615
This!

185
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:52,861
Won't you tell us where it is?
Do you want to die!?

186
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:55,526
Stab me.

187
00:19:06,314 --> 00:19:09,435
Lady, do you have no fear?
Standing up to two men?

188
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:13,984
I mean, if they're holding a knife to you,
just give them the money.

[South Police Station]

190

Each of the thirty houses need
to be unique designs, okay?

191
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:06,028
If you can't trust me,
hire someone else.

192
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:07,630
This kid...

193
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:10,197
Why don't you start your own company?

194
00:21:10,315 --> 00:21:12,400
- With your skills...
- Do I have to do that?

195
00:21:12,624 --> 00:21:14,850
Be your groomsman-whatever?

196
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,770
Don't do it, you don't have to.

197
00:21:18,795 --> 00:21:22,172
Ji Hyun's naive, try to understand.

198
00:21:25,293 --> 00:21:27,331
Who'll do it?

199
00:21:28,603 --> 00:21:31,277
Oh yea, the girl you said
you'd find after coming to Korea.

200
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:32,572
Did you find her?

201
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:36,772
What, in this small country
you couldn't find her?

202
00:21:36,937 --> 00:21:38,079
Shall I look for her?

203
00:21:40,352 --> 00:21:41,813

205
00:21:50,316 --> 00:21:53,190
Hey, Han Kang!

206
00:21:57,439 --> 00:22:01,185
We want to be surrounded by our
most beloved friends while getting married.

207
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:05,330
Because you're Min Ho's favorite
younger brother and my friend.

208
00:22:05,472 --> 00:22:06,991
We're not friends.

209
00:22:07,132 --> 00:22:09,796
Why aren't we friends?
We went to high school together.

210
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,825
If we're high school alums,
then we're alums, not friends.

211
00:22:14,943 --> 00:22:16,745
Even if we were friends,
I wouldn't be a groomsman.

212
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,253
Why not?

213
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:22,010
I already talked to Min Ho
and decided not to do it, so go.

214
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:24,365
Oppa said that's okay?

215
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:25,873
Just go.

216
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:27,707
Hey Han Kang.

217
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:33,549
Do you still have regrets from that time?

218
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:38,437
What man has such a long memory?

219
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:40,168
I've forgotten.

220
00:22:40,356 --> 00:22:44,777
To be honest, if we're going with regrets,
mine should be worse.

221
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,242
Still going overboard.

222
00:22:50,866 --> 00:22:51,337
What?

223
00:22:51,396 --> 00:22:54,635
Taking thing out of context
and going overboard as usual.

224
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:58,451
Yes, I'm not doing it because of you.
Better now?

225
00:22:58,851 --> 00:23:00,493
Han Kang.

226
00:23:01,977 --> 00:23:06,653
If you're once a jerk,
must you be always a jerk?

227
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,184
Yes.

228
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:14,296
Once you get married, I'll treat you well
as my hyungsoonim (*friend's wife),

229
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:16,338
so leave it be.

230
00:23:44,482 --> 00:23:45,554
He's not doing it, right?

231
00:23:45,648 --> 00:23:47,910
Isn't Han Kang just a rotten guy?

232
00:23:48,016 --> 00:23:49,319
How can a friend act like that?

233
00:23:49,366 --> 00:23:51,863
Do you want to be like that to Kang?

234
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:52,817
What'd I do?

235
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:56,292
Don't you remember
how close you were for those months?

236
00:23:56,386 --> 00:23:57,693
How long ago was that?

237
00:23:57,787 --> 00:24:01,438
Why does it matter if you call him a friend,
when he doesn't think so?

238
00:24:01,533 --> 00:24:04,313
How can you be a friend alone?

239
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:06,256
If you're friends once,
you're always friends.

240
00:24:06,327 --> 00:24:09,566
Kang hates you so much, don't you also?

241
00:24:09,731 --> 00:24:12,581
- No.
- Being an angel.

242
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:17,057
I dislike him occasionally,
but I don't hate him.

243
00:24:17,174 --> 00:24:20,208
If someone hates you, as a human being,
you're bound to hate them back.

244
00:24:20,314 --> 00:24:21,656
Why don't you hate him?

245
00:24:21,986 --> 00:24:23,093
There's a reason.

246
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,507
In Jung you'll be late to work.

247
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:26,391

and my personal seal.

253
00:24:46,422 --> 00:24:48,035
Nope.

254
00:24:49,449 --> 00:24:53,222
But oppa, did you tell Kang that he didn't
have to be your best man?

255
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:56,308
He hates being in front of people,

256
00:24:56,437 --> 00:24:58,663
why would he want to stand in
front of the wedding party?

257
00:24:58,781 --> 00:25:00,006
He was like that in America, too.

258
00:25:00,112 --> 00:25:03,362
He doesn't like people? Han Kang?

259
00:25:03,445 --> 00:25:06,435
He's more complicated
and scarred than he seems.

260
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:09,486
That's why he didn't want to do it.

261
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,877
I'll take care of choosing my groomsmen.

262
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:16,658
Make sure to choose that friend
of mine as one of the bridesmaids.

263
00:25:16,753 --> 00:25:19,226
Call me if you'll be done work by 4,
so we can go together.

99% sure that won't happen.

265

You've done well finishing off what I started.

00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:11,169
People are born with a particular destiny.

358
00:46:11,286 --> 00:46:16,339
There are always reasons,
but we can talk about that later.

359
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,614
Anyhow, making sure that people die
according to their time is my job.

360
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:22,958
Yes, so isn't that what a grim reaper is?

361
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:27,730
I told you - it's not grim reaper,
it's Scheduler!

362
00:46:27,824 --> 00:46:29,768
Either way!

363
00:46:31,464 --> 00:46:33,854
You're telling me I'm dead.

364
00:46:34,985 --> 00:46:37,152
Yes. You're dead.

365
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:40,343
So you're here to take me away?

366
00:46:40,473 --> 00:46:42,345
That's why you know my name?

367
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:43,499
No, it's not like that.

368
00:46:43,594 --> 00:46:45,820
Today, my schedule was messed up.

369
00:46:45,914 --> 00:46:47,610
You saw the man who just left?

370
00:46:47,716 --> 00:46:49,082
I was waiting for him.

371
00:46:49,235 --> 00:46:52,027
He was about to die from
a heart attack while driving.

372
00:46:52,121 --> 00:46:56,490
But because of today's accident,
the attack came late.

373
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:00,584
It's what we Schedulers hate most,
when our schedules get messed up!

374
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:02,645
But then why did I become this way?

375
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,224
Why isn't someone coming to get me?

376
00:47:04,306 --> 00:47:06,721
Because the schedule got messed up today.

377
00:47:07,698 --> 00:47:08,428
What?

378
00:47:08,581 --> 00:47:12,315
You weren't supposed to die today.

379
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:15,984
I wasn't supposed to die today?

380
00:47:16,914 --> 00:47:21,496
Every so often there are
troublemakers who disrupt the schedules,

381
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,934
like the one who tried
to commit suicide today.

382
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:25,359
Why don't they just wait?

383
00:47:25,477 --> 00:47:27,055
Even if they want to stay,
they can't stay forever.

384
00:47:27,149 --> 00:47:29,010
How can you do that!?

385
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:31,139
Ah! You scared me!

386
00:47:31,221 --> 00:47:32,976
How can I die when it wasn't my destiny?!

387
00:47:33,023 --> 00:47:34,743
I told you it was an accident!

388
00:47:34,825 --> 00:47:37,958
Exactly! How can I die by accident?

389
00:47:40,384 --> 00:47:44,848
You're lying, right? I'm not dead, right?

390
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,411
Yes, I'm not dead. How can there
be a grim reaper that looks like you?

391
00:47:49,529 --> 00:47:52,791
Who says there couldn't
be a Scheduler that looks like me?

392
00:47:53,098 --> 00:47:55,865
Have you ever met someone
who died and lived again?

393
00:47:56,278 --> 00:48:00,588
Even if there were,
they wouldn't remember us.

394
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:06,345
I'm not dead. There's no reason for it.

395
00:48:07,687 --> 00:48:10,066
I'm in surgery right now.

396
00:48:10,231 --> 00:48:13,070
I saw myself being wheeled
into the operating room.

397
00:48:13,235 --> 00:48:15,166
How can a dead person be operated on?

398
00:48:15,307 --> 00:48:19,778
How can a living person see
himself be wheeled into surgery?

399
00:48:36,252 --> 00:48:40,492
<i>We want to be surrounded by our
most beloved friends while getting married.</i>

400
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:43,931
<i>Because you're Min Ho's
favorite younger brother and my friend.</i>

401
00:48:44,072 --> 00:48:45,898
<i>We're not friends.</i>

402
00:48:46,063 --> 00:48:48,783
Yes, I'm not doing it because of you.

403
00:48:59,153 --> 00:49:01,143
Hey, Han Kang.

404
00:49:01,367 --> 00:49:02,062
Yes, Seo Woo?

405
00:49:02,203 --> 00:49:05,619
Why aren't you answering your phone?

406
00:49:06,796 --> 00:49:11,119
Kang, Ji Hyun was in an accident!

407
00:49:33,801 --> 00:49:36,122
Honey, what's going on?

408
00:49:36,204 --> 00:49:40,114
Why isn't she waking up?
When is she getting up?

409
00:49:40,821 --> 00:49:42,623
Where's the doctor!

410
00:49:42,776 --> 00:49:45,997
Just wait, dear.

411
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:50,048
See? I'm not dead.

412
00:49:50,178 --> 00:49:52,875
Keep your mouth shut and wait.

413
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:03,988
- In Jung
- Father.

414
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,432
Ji Hyun.

415
00:50:12,621 --> 00:50:13,775
It's my friend.

416
00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:15,789
I know. Shin In Jung.

417
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:20,131
Fiance Kang Min Ho, father, mother,

418
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,924
and Park Seo Woo and Han Kang will come too.

419
00:50:24,936 --> 00:50:26,220
Father.

420
00:50:26,409 --> 00:50:27,469
You came?

421
00:50:27,586 --> 00:50:32,027
What happened to Ji Hyun?
An accident? How?

422
00:50:45,347 --> 00:50:47,137
Ji Hyun.

423
00:50:49,575 --> 00:50:51,477
What happened?

424
00:50:54,952 --> 00:50:59,145
Dr. Jo! My daughter... how is she?

425
00:50:59,804 --> 00:51:02,042
She's in a vegetative state.

426
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:04,374
Her brain is almost dead.

427
00:51:18,796 --> 00:51:20,987
Brain is almost dead?

428
00:51:22,129 --> 00:51:24,511
Brain-dead?

429
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,316
- Mother!
- Mom!

430
00:51:30,105 --> 00:51:32,767
You're not to interfere here.

431
00:51:35,405 --> 00:51:37,219
What are you saying?

432
00:51:38,844 --> 00:51:42,253
I thought she just needed surgery.

433
00:51:45,445 --> 00:51:46,988
Ji Hyun!

434
00:51:55,984 --> 00:51:57,822
Ji Hyun.

435
00:51:59,624 --> 00:52:01,084
Did you see?

436
00:52:08,598 --> 00:52:11,060
Then what happens to me now?

437
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:12,084
Follow me.

438
00:52:12,214 --> 00:52:14,104
Where are we going?

439
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:25,493
I won't put you on the elevator,
so follow me.

440
00:52:32,538 --> 00:52:34,882
Gosh, I'm getting sick of this.

441
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:37,390
How can you all act the same?

442
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:40,193
Can't you think differently at all?

443
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:42,042
Don't come closer.

444
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:44,445
I said I wouldn't put you on the elevator.
Why are you running away?

445
00:52:44,492 --> 00:52:47,905
Don't joke. Why would I listen to your lies?

446
00:52:48,188 --> 00:52:51,615
Lies are the realm of humans.

447
00:52:52,263 --> 00:52:56,197
Do I look like a human to you?

448
00:52:56,762 --> 00:52:59,200
- Save me.
- Ridiculous!

449
00:52:59,353 --> 00:53:00,707
Asking me to save you.

450
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,769
Don't you know who I am?

451
00:53:03,028 --> 00:53:04,441
Let's go.

452
00:53:05,277 --> 00:53:06,585
I don't need you.

453
00:53:06,691 --> 00:53:08,681
Who's above you?

454
00:53:10,071 --> 00:53:10,495
What?

455
00:53:10,613 --> 00:53:12,261
You said you're just a messenger
from the nether world.

456
00:53:12,379 --> 00:53:14,499
How can I believe what you say?

457
00:53:14,593 --> 00:53:17,738
There must be someone above you.
God, Buddha, whoever!

458
00:53:17,797 --> 00:53:18,463
Sure!

459
00:53:18,558 --> 00:53:20,807
I'm a pawn who takes orders from above,

460
00:53:20,913 --> 00:53:22,786
but this is my jurisdiction!

461
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:26,637
Reporting, taking orders, making deliveries,
this place is my responsibility!

462
00:53:26,873 --> 00:53:29,252
A week from today is my marriage.

463
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:33,233
My mom and dad...
I'm their only child!

464
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:37,206
Making me dead even when it wasn't my time,
that's your fault!

465
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:40,574
There are always mistakes.

466
00:53:41,422 --> 00:53:46,711
But for mistaken deaths,
we don't force you on the elevator.

467
00:53:47,653 --> 00:53:49,313
Is that the truth?

468
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:56,169
This is my 5th year as a scheduler.

469
00:53:56,298 --> 00:53:59,090
In your neighborhood.

470
00:53:59,321 --> 00:54:03,513
During that time, I've only seen two cases like yours.
You're only the third.

471
00:54:03,772 --> 00:54:05,193
Twice?

472
00:54:05,487 --> 00:54:06,547
In that case -

473
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:09,916
when it isn't your time to die but
you do through someone else's mistake,

474
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:11,612
there are two choices.

475
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,202
You just have to choose one.

476
00:54:13,343 --> 00:54:14,344
What are they?

477
00:54:14,427 --> 00:54:18,761
One is, following a scheduler
and leaving this world.

478
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:22,025
Are you joking? That's telling me to die!

479
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:27,844
One of the others said they wished to leave this world
to find new opportunities in the next life,

480
00:54:27,926 --> 00:54:29,681
and walked into the elevator himself.

481
00:54:29,763 --> 00:54:31,459
Really?

482
00:54:33,285 --> 00:54:36,029
Who am I?
A lying person?

483
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:40,636
All right, I get it.
Don't come close.

484
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,485
What'd the other person do?

485
00:54:42,555 --> 00:54:44,734
Chose number two.

486
00:54:46,595 --> 00:54:47,773
What's number two?

487
00:54:47,891 --> 00:54:52,578
Within 49 days, you must find
3 people who love you.

488
00:54:52,672 --> 00:54:54,062
Then you can go back.

489
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,937
It's a measure of whether you're

490
00:54:56,078 --> 00:55:02,038
a worthwhile person enough
to send back to the world you've left.

491
00:55:02,109 --> 00:55:06,549
It's not like 30 people;
who isn't loved by at least three people?

492
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,986
Oh really?

493
00:55:08,174 --> 00:55:11,161
It's the work of leaving the afterlife,
do you really think it'll be easy?

494
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:13,822
Well, you said three people.
You saw earlier.

495
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:17,214
With my mom, dad, and friends,
I'm over three already.

496
00:55:17,285 --> 00:55:19,358
You can't count family or blood type.

497
00:55:19,405 --> 00:55:20,524
Why not blood type?

498
00:55:20,595 --> 00:55:23,127
Because family will always be on your side.

499
00:55:23,327 --> 00:55:24,905
But how can you prove it?

500
00:55:24,976 --> 00:55:30,072
The person who loves you -
their tears cried over you is the proof.

501
00:55:30,248 --> 00:55:33,358
At least three drops of 100% pure tears.

502
00:55:34,112 --> 00:55:35,737
It's like that?

503
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:37,668
You should've told me sooner.

504
00:55:37,763 --> 00:55:41,614
You saw Min Ho, In Jung,
and Seo Woo all crying for me.

505
00:55:41,696 --> 00:55:45,758
You think all tears are the same?

506
00:55:57,206 --> 00:55:59,197
Why are we here?

507
00:55:59,326 --> 00:56:00,587
Look carefully.

508
00:56:00,823 --> 00:56:01,541
What?

509
00:56:01,671 --> 00:56:05,333
The tears of people crying, look carefully.

510
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:24,446
Those are tears of someone
pitying the short life of her friend.

511
00:56:24,811 --> 00:56:30,323
The lady next to her is consoling herself
over the early death of her friend.

512
00:56:30,511 --> 00:56:34,545
And that one is forcing out tears
for the sake of courtesy.

513
00:56:45,204 --> 00:56:48,266
There they are - 100% pure tears.

514
00:56:48,561 --> 00:56:50,236
Where? Where?

515
00:56:54,123 --> 00:56:56,773
So that's a real tear.

516
00:56:57,185 --> 00:56:59,081
So that lady

517
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:02,414
truly loved the person who died?

518
00:57:02,509 --> 00:57:04,475
Yes, younger sister.

519
00:57:08,244 --> 00:57:10,788
Over there is the husband.

520
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:14,781
The one who died left quite a bit of life insurance,

521
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:19,810
the husband is sad but even
as he cries is thinking of the future.

522
00:57:24,447 --> 00:57:28,392
And there are two who are crying bitter tears.

523
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:36,719
Humans are quite complicated.

524
00:57:40,529 --> 00:57:41,989
How do you feel?

525
00:57:42,307 --> 00:57:43,838
I'm intrigued.

526
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:48,773
You're incredibly naive, aren't you?

527
00:57:48,938 --> 00:57:51,800
That's my nickname - Naive Princess.

528
00:57:51,941 --> 00:57:54,261
So what are you going to do now? Yes or no?

529
00:57:54,379 --> 00:57:55,766
What do I need to do now?

530
00:57:55,849 --> 00:57:59,052
Are you going to search for
the three drops of tears!?

531
00:57:59,417 --> 00:58:02,479
Of course! I'm different from that other person.

532
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:06,166
I don't need an explanation, just your decision.

533
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:07,873
So, I'm doing it!

534
00:58:07,968 --> 00:58:10,488
Okay, follow me.

535
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,127
Always saying follow me.

536
00:58:27,682 --> 00:58:28,980
<i>Name: Song Yi Kyung</i>

537
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:30,546
<i>Age: 28</i>

538
00:58:30,652 --> 00:58:37,024
Grew up in an orphanage, graduated from university
after studying hotel and tourism,

539
00:58:37,201 --> 00:58:41,276
<i>worked in Seoul Hotel for two years,
was unemployed for a year,</i>

540
00:58:41,382 --> 00:58:43,949
<i>then had a series of convenience store gigs.</i>

541
00:58:44,055 --> 00:58:45,729
<i>Wait, just a moment!</i>

542
00:58:45,976 --> 00:58:49,333
Can't I write this down somewhere?

543
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:51,924
My memorization isn't that good.

544
00:58:52,148 --> 00:58:55,092
She works 2am to 5am.

545
00:58:55,175 --> 00:58:57,083
Write it down for me, I said.

546
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:00,239
Woah, I remember it all.

547
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:03,687
Don't live the same way you've been living.

548
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:08,434
But, must I really borrow her body to live?

549
00:59:08,575 --> 00:59:09,930
Why?

550
00:59:10,365 --> 00:59:15,194
She doesn't look good.
That hair! And those clothes!

551
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,620
I don't know how it works
in this neighborhood,

552
00:59:16,738 --> 00:59:19,117
but in ours nothing happens for no reason.

553
00:59:19,234 --> 00:59:20,824
Everything is related.

554
00:59:20,919 --> 00:59:24,476
That woman and I are related in some way?

555
00:59:24,605 --> 00:59:26,301
How?

556
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:30,753
What in the world were you thinking
when you got in the accident!

557
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,013
I don't remember.

558
00:59:37,096 --> 00:59:39,051
Then stop interrupting and listen.

559
00:59:39,098 --> 00:59:41,548
Pay attention to things.
There was a really big truck.

560
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:03,734
<i>Mom, dad</i>

561
01:00:04,111 --> 01:00:06,419
<i>wait for just a few days.</i>

562
01:00:06,985 --> 01:00:12,002
Min Ho, wait too. I'll be right back.

563
01:00:49,582 --> 01:00:52,149
Wait until she falls asleep.

564
01:01:02,584 --> 01:01:07,354
Don't be afraid, or scared,
or think heavily about it.

565
01:01:23,874 --> 01:01:27,761
Entrust her with yourself.

566
01:03:59,534 --> 01:04:00,888
I am...

567
01:04:03,209 --> 01:04:05,387
Shin Ji Hyun.

568
01:04:10,571 --> 01:04:12,031
I am...

569
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:18,300
Shin Ji Hyun.

<i>Oh my goodness, I'm about to go crazy.
I totally look like a bum.</i>

578
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:57,643
<i>Participants of the 49 Days project
will adapt to their surroundings. This is the rule.</i>

579
01:04:57,714 --> 01:04:58,432
A part-time job?

580
01:04:58,479 --> 01:05:01,365
<i>Just for 48 days. It's just for exactly 48 days.
Can you do that?</i>

581
01:05:01,447 --> 01:05:02,943
<i>48 days? Are you kidding?</i>

582
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:05,722
<i>But, where do I put the three tear drops?</i>

583
01:05:05,805 --> 01:05:06,782
It's right there.

584
01:05:06,853 --> 01:05:08,102
What? My necklace?

585
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:09,220
Put it in there.

586
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:09,927
Here?

587
01:05:10,021 --> 01:05:13,449
I didn't imagine that Ji Hyun
could have ended up like this.

588
01:05:13,566 --> 01:05:15,755
<i>Shin Ji Hyun, what should I do?</i>

589
01:05:15,908 --> 01:05:19,747
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry
for making you hurt so much.</i>

590
01:05:19,853 --> 01:05:22,374
But why aren't they crying?
