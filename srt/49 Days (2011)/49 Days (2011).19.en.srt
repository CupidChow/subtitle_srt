00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,420
For our goodbyes.

{\a6}Episode 19

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,870
Hurry up and call the elevator,

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,330
Before I start having regrets.

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,010
Uh?

7
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,270
Uh!

8
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,860
This...

9
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,320
It's...

10
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,660
Are those three teardrops?

11
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,180
They're three teardrops!

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,920
So that's to say...

13
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,880
- It's true then?
- Shin Ji Hyun, your life has such meaning.

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,230
This situation must be unheard of.

15
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,800
How can this be?

16
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,480
No one has ever shed tears for me before.
No one at all.

17
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,715
Didn't I tell you?

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,280
Human hearts are always changeable.
There is no such thing as forever.

19
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,360
Then...
Can I go back now then?

20
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,890
- You must be curious as to who it was.
- Don't say that.

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,580
I don't want to know.

22
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,510
You don't want to know?

23
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,490
If I knew who it was,

24
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,900
I fear that I might love those three people.

25
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,330
That's quite sensible of you.

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
All right then.

27
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,360
- Go ahead.
- I guess our goodbye will...

28
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,940
Ji Hyun's mother. What is it?

29
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,320
What's going on?

30
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,910
Ji Hyun!

31
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,600
Look, look. Our Ji Hyun...

32
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,490
Mother, Ji Hyun's opened her eyes!

33
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,430
Ji Hyun!

34
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,430
- My girl...
- Ji Hyun!

35
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,730
<i>Ji Hyun!</i>

36
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,690
Call Doctor Cho. Hurry.

37
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,210
Ji Hyun!

38
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,960
- Ji Hyun.
- Ji Hyun.

39
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,660
Ji Hyun!

40
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,870
- It's father.
- Ji Hyun.

41
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,380
<i>Miss Song Yi Kyung.</i>

42
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,180
Come in.

43
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,470
Why didn't you come down to eat?

44
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,510
I'm going back.

45
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,310
Miss Yi Kyung, where are you going?

46
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,220
There's no reason for me to stay here.

47
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,750
What is that supposed to mean? How can there
be no reason for you to remain here?

48
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,340
Wait. This isn't the Song Yi Kyung I know.

49
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,700
Hello Ahjussi. How is Ji Hyun?

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,040
<i>Kang, what should I do?</i>

51
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,680
<i>- I think we've miscalculated the date?
- What is that supposed to mean?</i>

52
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,550
The real Song Yi Kyung has packed
her things and returned home,

53
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,970
<i>saying that there's nothing keeping
her here any longer.</i>

54
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,340
What do you mean?

55
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,680
What do you mean by, there's
no reason to stay?

56
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,770
Then... Ji Hyun...

57
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,170
Has died?

58
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,350
How can... this be?

59
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,800
Ji Hyun, do you remember your mother?

60
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,110
Of course.

61
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,520
Father.

62
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,700
Yes.

63
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,660
I am your father.

64
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,980
Seo Woo.

65
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,980
Ji Hyun.

66
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,470
No.

67
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,650
It can't be. It can't be.

68
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,600
[Ji Hyun's mother]

69
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,685
Hello Mother.

70
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:01,590
<i>President Han, you're back in Korea?</i>

71
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,340
<i>Our Ji Hyun's awoken.</i>

72
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,870
Awoken?

73
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,790
Unni, I've really missed you.

74
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,620
Have you been well?

75
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,330
Ji Hyun!

76
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,440
She's in an examination.

77
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,870
Yes.

78
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,040
Father, Mother. Congratulations.

79
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,870
Congratulations to you too.

80
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,950
My father said that he would like
to invest in the Shin family.

81
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,400
Is... that true?

82
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,670
He said that he'll send a lawyer
to Korea tomorrow.

83
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,120
Once the investment plan is completed,
the funds will be transferred immediately.

84
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,500
How will I ever repay this kindness?

85
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,870
The investment will begin once Hae Mi Do's
condition has been thoroughly assessed.

86
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,250
Ji Hyun's examination is complete.

87
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,650
Father, Doctor Cho wishes to speak with you.

88
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,990
Sure.

89
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,920
The level of oxygen in her blood
is satisfactory.

90
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,310
As her condition stands,
her brain is also normal.

91
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,460
I'll say!

92
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,570
How could you have said that there
was no hope, when she was able to...

93
00:07:58,571 --> 00:07:59,660
wake up perfectly fine?

94
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,940
From a medical perspective,
it was impossible.

95
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,260
As it has surpassed our medical knowledge,
it can be called a miracle.

96
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,260
No matter what, she's finally awoken.

97
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,090
Is everything else also fine?

98
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,570
Her muscles and joints will be
somewhat rigid,

99
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,150
so movement will initially be difficult.

100
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,470
I'll go see Ji Hyun now.

101
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,800
I never thought that I would be
lucky enough,

102
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:35,580
to have something this good to eat,
after 47 days.

103
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,280
It's delicious.

104
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,640
Eat slowly. There will be many more
opportunities to eat in the future.

105
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,010
Mother's babbling is pleasing
to my ears too.

106
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,400
Mom, give me another hug.

107
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,420
My daughter.

108
00:08:53,455 --> 00:08:55,910
How wonderful that you've returned.

109
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,100
The world's most adorable mother.

110
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,180
Me too. I want another hug too.

111
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,250
Sure, Seo Woo.

112
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,900
Thank you.

113
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,380
I haven't done anything, so
what is there to thank me for?

114
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,590
Thank you for being my friend.

115
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,680
That's so mushy, but you must
be feeling well then.

116
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,930
Actually, I should be thanking you.

117
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,190
I am so thankful for you.

118
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,370
Han Kang, it's been a long time.

119
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,840
Why have you come though?
Is it because you heard my news?

120
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,540
My child, when you were
unconscious, President Han...

121
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,630
Speaking of which, where
are In Jung and Min Ho?

122
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,940
Even Kang has come, so why
haven't they come yet?

123
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,230
Min Ho... He's gone on an excursion to
Europe for Hae Mi Do business.

124
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,280
<i>As for In Jung, we haven't been
able to contact her yet.</i>

125
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,880
President Han and Seo Woo, come
out with me for a second.

126
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,400
Mother, what is it? Just say it here.

127
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,470
She's just woken up, so if she were to
find out about In Jung and Min Ho,

128
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,150
I fear that she wouldn't be able
to handle the shock.

129
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,930
She also can't know about her
father's company or the operation.

130
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,040
Before Ji Hyun recovers,
these must be kept secret.

131
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,350
Of course, she has only recovered that much.

132
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,780
That's why it's worrying.

133
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,140
That week before the wedding was
her most joyous time.

134
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,380
Yes.

135
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:52,590
President Han,
you need not worry about it.

136
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,380
Once Ji Hyun has fully recovered,
I will tell her everything.

137
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,340
I'm completely fine with that.

138
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,810
Mother, Ji Hyun will start making
presumptions.

139
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,930
Yes, we should go back inside.

140
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,110
Director Jung,
have our new offices been readied?

141
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,820
After the Hae Mi Do shares transfer has been
confirmed, I'll hand in my resignation.

142
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,230
Are you planning on going to the
hospital to see your fianc�?

143
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,170
Or are you not even aware that she
has awoken, Manager Kang?

144
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,460
What did you say?

145
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,040
Who would have guessed that someone
as bold as yourself could be astonished.

146
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,790
<i>What does that mean?</i>

147
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,140
<i>Could it be that Ji Hyun has awoken?</i>

148
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,060
I'm sorry. I thought that there wasn't
anyone here.

149
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,060
That person has already left.

150
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,160
Do not come here again.

151
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,670
If you don't believe me,

152
00:12:28,771 --> 00:12:31,090
go to Shin Ji Hyun's hospital room
to confirm it for yourself.

153
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,690
I know it's true.

154
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,930
Why would you come here if you
already know that it's the truth?

155
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,550
I won't stay here much longer. You can go to
the landlord and ask for all the rent back.

156
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,570
Although there are only a few days,
return the key to me.

157
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,280
I only rented this apartment to chase you
away, so I have no need for it either.

158
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,630
Because the money has already been given,
I used your name to sign the contract.

159
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,660
Give me the key.

160
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,339
What are you planning on doing now?

161
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,360
I'm not Shin Ji Hyun.
Please don't get mixed up.

162
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,310
My intention was not to make
things difficult for you.

163
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,860
Please leave.

164
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,970
So while I was unconscious, mother and
father were both at the hospital?

165
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,520
Of course.

166
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,800
I was here even longer than your mother.

167
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,460
<i>Wow. I was living in complete happiness.</i>

168
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,200
- Of course.
- Shin Ji Hyun is so fortunate.

169
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,890
However, Han Kang,
why are you here and not leaving?

170
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,300
You child, while you were unconscious, Kang
was always bringing you flowers.

171
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,900
He put forth a lot of effort.

172
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,170
Yes, he's been so worried for you,
even taking care of your mother and father.

173
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,370
Is that so?

174
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,160
It seems that you do possess
some sense of chivalry.

175
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,630
Thank you.

176
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,240
Isn't it said though, that sudden changes in
a person can bring them death?

177
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,620
Why do something uncharacteristic of you?

178
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,460
You should go.

179
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,550
All right then.

180
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,350
Have you seen Ji Hyun?

181
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,560
Ahjussi, Ji Hyun doesn't recognize me.

182
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:41,450
She's forgotten the past, the time
we've spent together.

183
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,910
Her memories of those forty-nine
days are all lost.

184
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,910
Really?

185
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,850
If she knew about the 49 days, the secrets
of the heavens would be revealed.

186
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,850
That must be why.

187
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,760
What will our Kang do now then?

188
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,860
Secretly love her from afar again?

189
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,930
Even that would be too saddening.

190
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,660
A person without sadness would
not truly be a person.

191
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,310
It would be even more laughable
for me to be sad.

192
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,830
What is more important than her awakening?

193
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,400
<i>Wait, wait up!
For just 48 days.</i>

194
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,800
Just 48 days. Can't that work?

195
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,020
I don't have a job right now.

196
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,990
<i>I saw a friend of mine at the hotel.</i>

197
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,240
<i>I also saw my fianc�.</i>

198
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,900
<i>Since you seemed to have no strength,
I only hugged you to raise your spirits.</i>

199
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,060
<i>A comforting hug.</i>

200
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,840
<i>Leaving behind the piano may have
been her way of leaving her all.</i>

201
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,255
<i>Whenever my mother felt lonely,</i>

202
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:10,520
<i>she would play the piano
as a way of comforting herself.</i>

203
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,870
<i>Please pass this on to Ji Hyun.</i>

204
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,380
<i>When she awakens,
she must tell me again,</i>

205
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,520
<i>everything she wants to say now.</i>

206
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,550
<i>Don't leave without a word.</i>

207
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,420
<i>Don't leave like my mother did.</i>

208
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,140
How can she completely forget?

209
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,680
Yi Soo, when will you come?

210
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,040
Hurry and come.

211
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,070
I didn't have your phone number,
so I came without calling first.

212
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,400
I wanted to let you know that
Ji Hyun has awoken.

213
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,800
What?

214
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,000
She's at the hospital. Ji Hyun has
regained consciousness.

215
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,360
How fortunate. That's wonderful.

216
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,990
Of course it's fortunate.
That girl...

217
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,570
Completely forgetting everything
of the past.

218
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,720
It's possible that she doesn't even
remember you, Yi Kyung.

219
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,380
Is that so?

220
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,980
That's why, I thought that I
should at least come by.

221
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,060
Thank you for helping Ji Hyun.

222
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,400
Really. Thank you.

223
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,090
It was nothing.

224
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,820
Since it was because of Ji Hyun that you
were fired from your job at the coffeehouse,

225
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,980
Yi Kyung, why don't you come
work at my store?

226
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,080
You don't have to do this.

227
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,560
It's because that's also your profession-

228
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,040
I...

229
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,040
must wait for someone.

230
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,440
Please wait one moment.

231
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,070
Ji Hyun asked me to give this
to you before she left.

232
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,290
She said that it belonged to Kang's mother.

233
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,740
You're saying that...

234
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,820
This was my mother's?

235
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,340
- How can this be...
- She didn't tell me anything.

236
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,740
Go ask her yourself.

237
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,540
Also, she said to tell you, thank you.

238
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,060
She was sorry she left after having only
received from you.

239
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,440
<i>That if it weren't for you,</i>

240
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,010
<i>she would not have been able
to persist during that time.</i>

241
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,480
<i>She wanted me to tell you all of that.</i>

242
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,430
What is the meaning of this?

243
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,510
Prepare to handle JC's finances.

244
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,330
Why are you asking me to do this?

245
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,360
The planning section chief for
the Shin family is you.

246
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,040
Determine how much was loaned and returned,

247
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,820
formulate a plan for cooperation,
and report to the Shin family tomorrow.

248
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,700
It shouldn't be like this.

249
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,550
This is all because of you.

250
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,710
It was because your greedy heart contrived
to acquire President Shin's dying wishes.

251
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,250
That time, if it weren't for
your threatening us,

252
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:42,500
and forcing us into bankruptcy,

253
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,110
the situation would not have
ended up this way.

254
00:19:47,725 --> 00:19:49,617
{\a6}[Secretary Shin]

255
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:50,710
Now, you can handle this situation
however you wish.

256
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,830
I will figure out what's going on.

257
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,360
We'll speak again later.

258
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,760
<i>This number could not be reached.
Your call has been forwarded to voicemail.</i>

259
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:00,620
Please leave a message at the beep.

260
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,680
<i>Oppa, let's have dinner together.</i>

261
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,150
Is there something you need?

262
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,940
Ki Jun Hee, did you hear your
president say anything?

263
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,530
Anything regarding the Shin family's
finances? Any monetary problems?

264
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,170
Ah, that. Our president has gotten
an investment from America.

265
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,490
What? Why didn't you tell me?

266
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,860
Why must I tell you?

267
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,850
I'm not the kind of person who would
sell out my conscience for money.

268
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,680
Then the reports you have given me on Kang,
was that all false information?

269
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,720
Whether it's HM Industries
or that puppet company,

270
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,760
I can still get in through the exam.

271
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,140
Kang Min Ho speaking.

272
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,210
<i>This is the central attorney's office.</i>

273
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,520
<i>I've contacted you because I've accepted a
petition regarding Kang Min Ho's case.</i>

274
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,079
A petition?

275
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,720
<i>There are a few things
we need to look into.</i>

276
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,590
<i>Therefore, you are expected here by
ten o'clock tomorrow morning.</i>

277
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:45,944
<i>Your leaving has already been a day</i>

278
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:55,690
<i>Yet even now, I already fear forgetting</i>

279
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:03,028
<i>Because I am only your shadow</i>

280
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:11,746
<i>I know that I cannot be like this</i>

281
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:18,909
<i>I cannot be without you</i>

282
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:31,060
<i>What I fear is that I cannot walk
even a single step away from you</i>

283
00:22:31,743 --> 00:22:35,534
<i>I also...</i>

284
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,300
Cha Jin Young,

285
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,600
are you ridiculing me?

286
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,900
I can only drown in my sorrows.

287
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,890
I can only work until today.

288
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,430
So you can do as you please,

289
00:22:55,431 --> 00:22:57,620
but I really don't want to see
you destroying yourself like this.

290
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,610
Remaining by my side now,

291
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,880
would gain you nothing, right?

292
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,190
That Kang Min Ho would be so easily finished
is very strange to me.

293
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,490
Since high school, you have
always been so fierce.

294
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,150
What was Kang Min Ho's dream at that time?

295
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,500
I knew.

296
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,620
I know.

297
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,340
However,

298
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,480
I will not be broken by this.

299
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,610
How did you get in here?

300
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,330
I asked Jin Young.

301
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,350
What are you doing here?

302
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,390
Can you not appear in front of me?

303
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,280
Please do not reappear!

304
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,110
Before I leave Seoul,

305
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,790
I wanted to come
say good-bye to you.

306
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,010
I will go to Jinan temporarily.

307
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,390
If you need me you can call me anytime.

308
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,650
Oppa.

309
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,340
I'm sorry.

310
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,940
You've made me unable...

311
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,020
To even apologize to you.

312
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,560
In Jung seems severely ill.

313
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,960
I haven't heard anything from her.

314
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,500
All you have to do is tell her that I've
awoken and then she'll come running.

315
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,500
She's not answering her phone.

316
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,580
So go to her house.

317
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,990
Shin Ji Hyun.

318
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,040
Congratulations on your return.

319
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,110
From now on, I'll be coming here every day.

320
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,110
You'd better get used to my presence.

321
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,220
Mother, here is some cake for Ji Hyun.

322
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,490
We'll eat it together once
In Jung gets here.

323
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,330
Ji Hyun,

324
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,690
your friend, Jung Eun,

325
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,120
no, you have a friend named
Song Yi Kyung, right?

326
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,250
Oh. My college friend.

327
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,540
You gave her your seal, do you remember?

328
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,040
I don't remember that.
What do you mean?

329
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,570
Nothing, nothing.

330
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,870
- It's time for your physiotherapy.
- I'll take her there.

331
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,180
- What are you doing?
- Mother, we'll go now.

332
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,650
<i>Come forward a little. Left leg.</i>

333
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,340
<i>Use some more strength. Right leg.</i>

334
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:41,280
<i>Good. Wait a little.</i>

335
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,690
Watch your legs.

336
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:00,450
<i>The feeling has come, entering my heart</i>

337
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,822
<i>Always surfacing from within my heart</i>

338
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,920
<i>Even the very air you breathe</i>

339
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:12,490
<i>Seems to be speaking to me</i>

340
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:17,930
<i>{\a6}Love has come,
Stealing my heart</i>

341
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,690
What exactly does he want?

342
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,510
<i>{\a6}Even if it's like this I still love it</i>

343
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,070
<i>The more I love it</i>

344
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,500
<i>The more happiness this love brings me</i>

345
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,450
Doesn't this feel nice?

346
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,330
Where are you wheeling me?

347
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:37,080
Han Kang. Why are you acting like this?

348
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,360
Do you despise my doing this?

349
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,990
Not despise.

350
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,480
It's just strange.

351
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,800
What's strange about it?

352
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,390
How does it feel to live again?

353
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,250
Good?

354
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,510
Good.

355
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,510
Very good.

356
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,300
I feel very good too,

357
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,530
because you're living again.

358
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,110
Shin Ji Hyun, what were you doing
for forty-seven days?

359
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,350
Sleeping?

360
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,100
Or did you have any dreams?

361
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,200
Even if I did, must I talk to
you about them?

362
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,780
In those dreams, did I ever appear?

363
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,640
Why would you appear in my dreams?

364
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,920
I would like to go inside now.
I want to rest.

365
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,230
I understand.
I'll listen to your orders.

366
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,610
Ji Hyun, she...

367
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,540
Has awoken?

368
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,850
You must have been hoping that
she would never awaken,

369
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,870
but as soon as she woke up,
she has been asking for you.

370
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,390
Ji Hyun keeps demanding to see you,

371
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,220
so you must go with mother to see her.

372
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,220
Why do you want me to go see Ji Hyun?

373
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,210
Ji Hyun knows nothing about what's going on
between you and Min Ho, and the company.

374
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,300
Just say that I've left the country.

375
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,470
It's not an opportunity to
apologize to Ji Hyun.

376
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:35,660
Just treat her as you always have.
Just temporarily.

377
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,820
Can you not do even that?

378
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,280
I cannot go.

379
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,430
- I will not go.
- Why can you not go?

380
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,440
These past 2 years, haven't you been acting,
completely keeping Ji Hyun in the dark?

381
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,530
All you have to do is act
as you always have.

382
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,900
- Mother.
- Who allowed you to address me as Mother?

383
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:54,460
Shin In Jung. If you have even an ounce
of conscience, then go.

384
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,250
After you've gone, just treat Ji Hyun
as you had before the accident.

385
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,280
Let's go.

386
00:29:00,315 --> 00:29:03,190
Mother, I was wrong.

387
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,700
I was wrong.

388
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,780
Therefore, please don't make me see Ji Hyun.

389
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,190
I'm sorry, but I cannot face seeing Ji Hyun.

390
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,960
Han Kang,

391
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:23,480
have you really decided to forego your
responsibilities and come here every day?

392
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:26,810
Yes. I'm coming here every day and
spending the entire day here.

393
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,840
I'd hoped that you would seriously
work on your designs.

394
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,390
Did you draw this one?

395
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,450
I really like it.

396
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,970
You have a talent no one else has.

397
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,900
Why are you burying it?

398
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,340
There is no one to appreciate it
and I have no one to share it with.

399
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,690
If I were to seriously focus on designing,
would you be willing to look at my designs?

400
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,950
Why are you always like this?

401
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,330
Ji Hyun, In Jung has come.

402
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,820
Can you let In Jung and I
talk alone for awhile?

403
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,820
Just the two of you?

404
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,040
Han Kang, take my mom out
for a cup of coffee.

405
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,790
Mother, let's go.

406
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,880
Ji Hyun.

407
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,640
Shin In Jung.

408
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,960
I slept for a long long time,

409
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,650
and then had a dream.

410
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,190
The day of the engagement ceremony,

411
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,350
didn't my heel break?

412
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,340
I watched you take off your leather
shoes and give them to me.

413
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,110
That time, you unconsciously

414
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:21,990
removed your leather shoes,
and ran away barefooted.

415
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,890
In that moment, you removed
your leather shoes for me.

416
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,230
What...

417
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,410
are you trying to say?

418
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,800
The leather shoes represent a woman's pride.

419
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,970
Yet, in that moment,

420
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,510
you gave up your pride for my sake.

421
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,100
Forgetting the engagement ceremony,

422
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,010
and putting me first.

423
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,790
Because I was

424
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,800
your friend.

425
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,180
Ji Hyun.

426
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,330
I'm tired.

427
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,340
Leave.

428
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:35,410
Aish! Because of that penalty,
there's still another week.

429
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,810
That old woman!

430
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,290
<i>Hey kid!</i>

431
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,890
<i>Kid!</i>

432
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,980
- Kid.
- What?

433
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,880
What? In order to avoid a penalty,
I haven't done anything.

434
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,880
You fool.

435
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,210
Did you think, just because the term's over,
you can show off in front of your elders?

436
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,920
It was because I was upset.

437
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:09,530
Even though the term has ended,
I'm not allowed to become human.

438
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,920
Your memory has already returned,

439
00:34:11,921 --> 00:34:14,920
but you can't stand not being
able to appear before her, right?

440
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,990
Stop talking.
I'm so tired I could die.

441
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,130
How can someone who has already
died once die again?

442
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,480
Even if you were to die, you must still
see Song Yi Kyung before you leave.

443
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,810
- What?
- Isn't today the day your term ends?

444
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,700
I got a penalty,

445
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,910
so I have another week to do.

446
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,250
It's to allow you to be a scheduler
for another week.

447
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,320
It doesn't say that you can't see
Song Yi Kyung after it.

448
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,740
Oh! Oh! Really?

449
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,980
Why didn't I ever go confirm it?

450
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,890
Then...

451
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:54,090
Tomorrow, I can go see Yi Kyung?

452
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,240
[Wishing you a happy birthday.
With love, Yi Soo.]

453
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:30,070
[An invitation from Song Yi Soo.]

454
00:37:27,734 --> 00:37:30,546
<i>My throat so closed up,</i>

455
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,750
<i>I cannot even speak</i>

456
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:40,810
<i>Staring absent-mindedly at the sky,
tears falling from my eyes</i>

457
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:48,400
<i>Reminding myself to forget,
that I must forget, all alone</i>

458
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:55,060
<i>Telling myself to just give up</i>

459
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:03,130
<i>The pain of my heart leaving me wretched,
the pain of being burned by flames</i>

460
00:38:03,212 --> 00:38:10,780
<i>{\a6}I told myself that there is only
non-existent love for me</i>

461
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:09,246
Song Yi Kyung.

462
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,810
It's been a while.

463
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,890
You haven't changed one bit.

464
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,860
Yi Soo.

465
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,480
It's really you.

466
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:06,420
<i>After laughing and crying for so long,
I finally fall into a slumber</i>

467
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:10,640
<i>Murmuring your name, all alone</i>

468
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,020
<i>Just like a fool</i>

469
00:39:12,051 --> 00:39:14,140
<i>Like an average fool</i>

470
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:17,656
<i>Remaining like this for several days</i>

471
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:21,070
<i>Yearning to see you is driving me crazy</i>

472
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:25,230
<i>Wanting to forget so badly
I'm nearly driven insane</i>

473
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:28,940
<i>{\a6}It's so tiring. I'm just so tired</i>

474
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,400
How... How can this be?

475
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,270
<i>{\a6}These tears are obscuring my vision</i>

476
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,590
How can this be?

477
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:37,320
<i>{\a6}Your figure appearing
and haunting my life</i>

478
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,000
Why have you only come now?

479
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,730
Why have you only come now?

480
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,020
This is the time I was meant to come.

481
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,380
I could only come now.

482
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:55,950
<i>{\a6}Now apparently the time
has come to forget you</i>

483
00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:00,130
<i>I no longer have to waste
my strength persisting</i>

484
00:40:00,153 --> 00:40:01,490
<i>Like a fool</i>

485
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,790
<i>Just like a fool</i>

486
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,750
<i>Simply unable to forget</i>

487
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,420
<i>Unable to even ask you to come back</i>

488
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,310
<i>I...</i>

489
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,110
Let's go.

490
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,340
There's somewhere we have to go.

491
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,690
Where?

492
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,490
Today,

493
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,160
just do as I say.

494
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,900
During that time,

495
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,820
I felt as though I was suffocating.

496
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,570
On one hand, writing music,

497
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,660
on the other,
experiencing a brand new world.

498
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,330
For me,

499
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,830
that lifestyle occasionally drew
my hatred of it.

500
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,580
You must have been tired,
having to be my protector.

501
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,140
You were still so young.

502
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,230
You were young too.

503
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,690
The misunderstanding between
us was too great.

504
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,680
I thought that there was no way it
could be resolved through words,

505
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,950
so I could only think to behave recklessly.

506
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,200
I once said that I would let you
see my heart unhindered.

507
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,130
Even though I once played with a
girl while I was writing music,

508
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,340
you were still my home.

509
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:13,440
So, I bought a ring to propose.

510
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,270
Your hand.

511
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,510
So, you've accepted it.

512
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,490
Why have we come here?

513
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:24,790
Haven't we never come to the
amusement park together?

514
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:26,910
Because we didn't have the money for it.

515
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:29,940
Even so, you want to go inside now?

516
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:33,480
Of course. It's your birthday.
Didn't we agree to come here together?

517
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,940
You'd made a date with Song Yi Soo.

518
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:44,490
<i>As always I am watching you</i>

519
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:50,230
<i>As always I am watching only you</i>

520
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,960
<i>Even if that love</i>

521
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:59,470
<i>Is not my love</i>

522
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,540
<i>Even now, all those unspoken words</i>

523
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:07,070
<i>That I long for you,</i>

524
00:44:07,263 --> 00:44:12,130
<i>Those words that are impossible to wipe away</i>

525
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,794
<i>I love you</i>

526
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:20,030
<i>Please, I beg you to return to my side</i>

527
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:24,962
<i>Like a fool, my tears kept falling</i>

528
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,529
<i>No matter how I beseech you</i>

529
00:44:27,868 --> 00:44:32,690
<i>I know that nothing will change at all</i>

530
00:44:32,905 --> 00:44:36,497
<i>I just simply cannot let you go</i>

531
00:44:36,532 --> 00:44:42,873
<i>I can't let you go</i>

532
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,470
Where will we go now?

533
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,940
Constantly asking about everything,
you're the same as always.

534
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,640
Our Song Yi Kyung.

535
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,550
I've already told you. Don't ask,
and don't get angry.

536
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:58,860
Just follow me unconditionally.

537
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,110
This is my house.

538
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,080
Go buy some groceries.

539
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,270
I want to eat your cooking.

540
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,630
You want me to go buy groceries by myself?

541
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,820
This time, I definitely will not disappear
without a word.

542
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:18,000
Then what will you do here all alone?

543
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,880
There are still some things I have to do.

544
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,720
I'll be finished by the time you get back.

545
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,380
Have the occupants of this apartment moved?

546
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,170
No.

547
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,070
They're only papering the walls.

548
00:45:49,105 --> 00:45:52,280
Then where's Miss Yi Kyung?
No... the occupants?

549
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,610
On an errand.

550
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,280
Excuse me, but have we met somewhere before?

551
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:03,460
I'm busy working, why do you
keep asking me questions?

552
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:07,820
Do not come here today and tomorrow.

553
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:11,020
Wait another few days before you come back.

554
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,140
Then you must let her know that someone
named Noh came looking for her.

555
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:18,130
If you leave now, I'll relay that.

556
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,860
Stand here any longer and I won't.

557
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,680
That guy, his eyesight's not bad.

558
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,740
Doctor?

559
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:40,110
But you, I can't let you have her
because you're a widower.

560
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:43,730
What does he think our Yi Kyung is?

561
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,900
Yi Soo.

562
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,590
Yi Soo.

563
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,370
Song Yi Soo.

564
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:13,820
I'm over here.

565
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:17,670
After whitewashing everything,
I was covered in dust.

566
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,380
You did all this?

567
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,550
I once worked as a painter,
so my skills aren't too bad.

568
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:28,350
That's not what I meant.

569
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,080
I'm asking why you've done
all this to the room

570
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,800
since I'll be leaving with you.

571
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:36,090
Since we'll have to stay here for another
day, I wanted to stay in a clean place.

572
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:42,290
What does this room matter?
Was it this clean and tidy before?

573
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:48,300
All that's left, can be rearranged
as you like them to be.

574
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:04,490
<i>I try to feel you, on the tips of my fingers</i>

575
00:48:04,824 --> 00:48:08,660
<i>For I always forget, forget every time</i>

576
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,750
<i>That I'm unable to touch you</i>

577
00:48:12,832 --> 00:48:15,910
<i>Not knowing if you are aware</i>

578
00:48:16,015 --> 00:48:19,654
<i>That there is a single room within my heart</i>

579
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:27,650
<i>That houses you,
where no one else may enter</i>

580
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:38,600
<i>Now, even if the memories are lost,
even without any warmth</i>

581
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:45,711
<i>I'm a scarecrow standing upon one foot</i>

582
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:54,080
<i>A scarecrow whose heart aches,
in your absence</i>

583
00:48:54,113 --> 00:48:58,733
<i>Amid the cold harsh winds,
I cannot stand still</i>

584
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:02,234
<i>Even while my swaying scatters my body</i>

585
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,920
Did I wake you?

586
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:08,130
<i>{\a6}If you come to me someday,</i>

587
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,800
I'm awake.

588
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:07,800
Then...

589
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:15,350
<i>{\a6}I'll open wide my arms and, embrace you</i>

590
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,250
Let's go on a walk.

591
00:49:15,351 --> 00:49:19,910
<i>{\a6}I'll wait for you</i>

592
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:25,020
What is it?

593
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,880
It's too miraculous.

594
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,160
Yesterday felt like a dream,

595
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,910
and you were by my side all night
until the next morning.

596
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:34,730
Beneath the fierce rays of the sun,

597
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:37,650
I can still see you, feel you.

598
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,990
But I am still someone who has died.

599
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:48,060
In order to see you, I waited five years.

600
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,260
In order to give you...

601
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:58,330
this ring.

602
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,550
"I loved you."

603
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:05,550
"I never thought of another
for even a moment."

604
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:08,200
"Let's get married."

605
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:12,580
In order to say that to you.

606
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:18,600
However,

607
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:23,690
now I cannot.

608
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,740
Now, the words I wanted to say have changed.

609
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,000
Until that time, I loved you.

610
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,640
From now on, I will love you no more.

611
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:48,870
I don't want to leave you with
a scar and then leave.

612
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:53,510
So that you can forget me and experience
your happiness,

613
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:56,060
I waited five years.

614
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,970
No.

615
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,970
Don't be like this, Yi Soo.

616
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:02,910
I'll come with you.

617
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,910
We cannot leave together.

618
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:08,110
Even if you chose death in
order to come with me,

619
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,830
it will only be a goodbye.

620
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:15,860
That is what death means.

621
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,340
Here,

622
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:21,450
it is so hard to be alone.

623
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,530
Insufferable.

624
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:25,750
Suffer it for me.

625
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,830
Only by letting you go,

626
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,960
can I find my own happiness in a new life.

627
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:36,160
If you are unhappy,

628
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:41,060
my heart will not be at rest.

629
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,610
My heart will never find peace.

630
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:48,260
I came into this life with a
terrible temper,

631
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,410
as a selfish man.

632
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,160
Unable to feel love,

633
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,960
unable to love another.

634
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:01,100
An unfortunate life.

635
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:06,550
Throw away that ring.

636
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:08,880
- No.
- Throw it away.

637
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:11,550
It is already a meaningless object.

638
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:14,100
Only to resolve your misunderstanding,

639
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,870
did I keep it.

640
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:22,740
Don't be like this! Don't do this!

641
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:36,180
You already know the importance
you hold for me.

642
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,400
This isn't throwing away my existence,

643
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:42,280
but acknowledgement that

644
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:45,680
you are the most important person to me.

645
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:48,120
An impressive person.

646
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,450
That's why...

647
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:53,800
I will also become another person.

648
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,790
Another important person.

649
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,660
You'd promised me that for me,
you would find happiness.

650
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:08,120
Let me leave this life without regret.

651
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:11,260
In order for me to...

652
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,800
find a new beginning in my next life.

653
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:20,880
Yi Kyung.

654
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:27,060
Find your happiness for me.

655
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,340
Meet the person...

656
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:59,630
you are thankful for...

657
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,570
and can find happiness with.

658
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,040
I...

659
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:14,900
only feel sorry.

660
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:18,580
Always accepting your love,

661
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,320
yet never repaying it.

662
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,910
Go find the person who loves you.

663
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,550
Replace me,

664
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:34,060
with that person.

665
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:41,506
<i>My heartbeat pulsing</i>

666
00:54:41,741 --> 00:54:45,090
<i>You are walking straight</i>

667
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,560
<i>Into my heart</i>

668
00:54:51,924 --> 00:54:59,330
<i>My thoughts upon you,
since the first moment we met</i>

669
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:03,977
<i>You breathing me in</i>

670
00:55:11,423 --> 00:55:14,865
<i>I am always shedding tears</i>

671
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:18,536
<i>Crying frigid tears</i>

672
00:55:18,621 --> 00:55:25,450
<i>My heart in pain, hurting for you</i>

673
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:31,650
<i>Every day that I think of you,
longing to see you</i>

674
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:34,633
<i>Those days that I am missing you</i>

675
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:38,913
<i>My tears fall again</i>

676
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:42,923
<i>Tears are always falling</i>

677
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,920
<i>It is you they're leaking from now</i>

678
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:53,660
<i>My heart is overflowing,
you're overflowing in my heart</i>

679
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:56,615
<i>Those tears becoming droplets of pain</i>

680
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,050
<i>Tears of painful longing</i>

681
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:07,590
<i>Within my heart, you are thus living on</i>

682
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,010
<i>I am always shedding tears</i>

683
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:15,023
<i>Crying frigid tears</i>

684
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:16,967
<i>For my love of you</i>

685
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:21,890
<i>These are teardrops of my love for you</i>

686
00:56:21,953 --> 00:56:24,583
<i>By my side</i>

687
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,114
<i>When you were by my side</i>

688
00:56:28,205 --> 00:56:31,065
<i>The words I couldn't speak</i>

689
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:35,480
<i>Were, I love you</i>

690
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:53,460
<i>Mother.</i>

691
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,300
<i>After I've found success,
I will take you from here.</i>

692
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,850
<i>I am sorry.</i>

693
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,240
<i>Mr. Kang Min Ho.</i>

694
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,660
We are now arresting you on the
grounds of misappropriation.

695
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:14,490
Arrest? They said it was just a petition...

696
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:19,300
- Bring him in.
- Wait one moment.

697
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,940
Please let me see my mother once
before taking me away.

698
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,940
Just for a short while.

699
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:29,180
Mother, have you hidden away the
documents Jin Young brought you?

700
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,450
Who are you?

701
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:37,010
The ones that cannot be given to anyone
else before I come for them.

702
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:39,700
Look at me.

703
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:42,080
Other than to this face, you cannot
give them to anyone else.

704
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,080
Understand?

705
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,200
Min Ho!

706
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,450
My child.

707
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:04,030
Have you returned after studying
for that MBA abroad?

708
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,920
Why didn't you give me any
notice before coming back?

709
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:13,360
No matter how sick I am, I would have
wanted to come pick you up from the airport.

710
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:15,040
Mother.

711
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,850
Did you receive the money I sent?

712
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:22,100
Was it far from enough?

713
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,070
Of course not.

714
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:29,110
Aigoo! You're worried that
mother would be troubled,

715
00:58:29,111 --> 00:58:31,250
so you're saying those lies.
You haven't changed one bit.

716
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,265
Now that...

717
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:40,770
You've gotten the MBA, are
you addressed as Doctor now?

718
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:48,070
I knew you would become an impressive man.

719
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,060
You've never given me any bother.

720
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:57,720
Not everyone can be the top
student of the entire school.

721
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,340
Moth-Mother.

722
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:05,200
I knew you would be different
from your father.

723
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:08,910
Aigoo, my amazing child.

724
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,350
Thank you, my child.

725
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:07,100
Min Ho has been arrested.

726
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,230
From his mother's hospital room.

727
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,560
According to the victim,

728
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:23,400
the president's secretary,
Shin In Jung is your accomplice.

729
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,000
No.

730
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:27,320
The one who provided information on the Shin
family's finances

731
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,770
was not Miss Shin In Jung?

732
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:31,820
No.

733
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:39,830
<i>Suffer it for me.</i>

734
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,920
<i>Only by letting you go,</i>

735
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:45,390
<i>can I find my own happiness in my new life.</i>

736
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,280
<i>Yi Kyung,</i>

737
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:23,730
<i>find your happiness for me.</i>

738
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:28,930
I want to cry.

739
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:34,820
<i>When you get tired, think back to days
like this when you regretted it.</i>

740
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:39,650
Think of the days you treasure.

741
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:43,440
<i>Receive strength from it and live on.</i>

742
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,630
<i>That girl,</i>

743
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,340
<i>completely forgetting everything
of the past.</i>

744
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:11,340
<i>I fear that she doesn't even remember you.</i>

745
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:30,960
Unni.

746
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:45,300
Yi Kyung.

747
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,930
Ji Hyun.

748
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:50,410
Has Unni come to see me?

749
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,470
Do you remember me?

750
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:56,470
Unni.

751
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:16,180
You can remember me, yet
you cannot remember Han Kang?

752
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,750
You remember him too.

753
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:28,500
Since you do,

754
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:30,560
why do you pretend that you don't?

755
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:34,530
Because...

756
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:39,200
I'm on the verge of dying again.

757
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:09,970
<i>Your today, is the tomorrow someone
is very much looking forward to.</i>

758
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:11,520
<i>Shin Ji Hyun, what are you doing here?</i>

759
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:14,820
<i>Han Kang, can you spend a day with me?
As my boyfriend?</i>

760
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:17,440
<i>Oppa, let's not be foolish any longer.</i>

761
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,550
<i>I won't let this rest. Even if I'm going
to be destroyed, I won't back down.</i>

762
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:22,520
<i>You're the Scheduler!</i>

763
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:23,780
Have you forgotten me already?

764
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:27,320
I remember you.
Why do I remember those forty-nine days?
