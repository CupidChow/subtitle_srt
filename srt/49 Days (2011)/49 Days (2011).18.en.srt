Episode 18

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,650
I'm not going to give up on Ji Hyun
until the moment she leaves.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,640
Actually, I can't give up.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,080
I beg you, please don't talk
to Ji Hyun like that.

7
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,580
Song Yi Kyung?

8
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,470
Just a little... a little longer.

9
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,370
Are you Ji Hyun?

10
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,980
Please tell Ji Hyun...

11
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:43,620
to say the things she wants to say
to me right now... when she wakes up.

12
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,870
That I want to hear it.

13
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:55,020
And, to not leave without saying goodbye.

14
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,400
To not leave like my mom did.

15
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,610
<i>This woman is not possessed right now.</i>

16
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,311
I got rid of that girl
before coming back,

17
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:49,370
what's wrong with me acting like
Shin Ji Hyun?

18
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,500
[D-8 Met with Oh Sunbae in the office. Under JC Consulting,
Hyuk San Industries trends; Shin Ga San Up shares fall.]

19
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,510
Thank you, Yi Kyung.

20
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,470
If I could exchange your life
for mine, I'd really want to.

21
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,400
I would follow Yi Soo,

22
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,630
and you can stay behind with Han Kang.

23
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,720
Don't even say that.

24
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,860
You have Yi Soo waiting for you.

25
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,780
He's not someone who can return to me.

26
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,320
Did you let me borrow your body
to throw yourself away?

27
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,570
I thought that you...

28
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,010
I thought you did it because you
cared for me like I cared for you.

29
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,740
It was partly because I cared and
also because I was abandoning myself.

30
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,130
I don't want to leave Kang...

31
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,800
and you want to follow after Yi Soo.

32
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,730
What's wrong with us two?

33
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,230
In Jung.

34
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,280
<i>If I was Shin Ji Hyun, I'd follow you
for the rest of my life.</i>

35
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,860
<i>Why do you think that I'd
only use Song Yi Kyung's body?</i>

36
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,110
<i>I could use someone else's body and even if
I didn't, I could wander like a spirit.</i>

37
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,100
<i>Min Ho, I'm scared.</i>

38
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,550
<i>Can't you come to my house?</i>

39
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,400
This is too cruel.

40
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,060
Thank you for coming.

41
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,690
I was scared to death because of Ji Hyun,

42
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,140
- I thought you weren't coming.
- You were right.

43
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,020
Ji Hyun's returned.

44
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,280
It wasn't Song Yi Kyung.

45
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,860
I told you, I was right.

46
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,550
Song Yi Kyung was Shin Ji Hyun
and Shin Ji Hyun was Song Yi Kyung.

47
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,470
Ji Hyun told me that she'd follow
me for the rest of my life.

48
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,810
She said she could follow me
even without Yi Kyung's body like a ghost.

49
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,520
She appears in my dreams, I feel like
I'm going to die from being so scared.

50
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,110
If you're scared, don't let it be scary.

51
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,440
How?

52
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,670
Turn off Ji Hyun's life support.

53
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,240
Min Ho, what are you talking about?

54
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,100
Ji Hyun's not a ghost.

55
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,520
She's only able to wander around,
because her physical body is intact.

56
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,140
<i>Like you said, to take revenge on us.</i>

57
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,020
No, to make our blood run cold.
She's planning on doing that forever.

58
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,130
Min Ho...

59
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,851
I can't go back to the hospital because
President Shin knows everything.

60
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,790
- So you do it.
- Are you crazy?

61
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,560
Then do you want to let her
follow you forever?

62
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,240
Still...

63
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,180
I can't just let her do that forever.

64
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:21,090
Fine, since you started it,
you should end it too.

65
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,500
There's 4 days left.

66
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,310
Did you look at the calendar all night?

67
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,750
But why did you wake up so early?

68
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,550
Because I can sleep during
the day and at night.

69
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:26,270
Do you by any chance remember everything
I did while in your body during the day?

70
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,780
Why are you laughing?

71
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,830
I remember what happened last night.

72
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,340
Sorry, I couldn't help it.

73
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,570
Don't you be like that too.

74
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,600
I'm already having trouble figuring
out how to face Kang.

75
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,150
Oh! I think you just laughed.

76
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,700
After I told you that you could
use my body, I must sleep through it.

77
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,900
I don't remember things well.

78
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,760
I wake up when we plan it, like when
we went to Min Ho's house.

79
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,880
Are you not scared of me anymore?

80
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,170
From a human's point of view, I am a ghost.

81
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,310
But since you're so cool about it,

82
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,870
I sometimes forget that I'm a spirit.

83
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,480
Well Yi Soo's not a human either
and he's coming to see me.

84
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,880
That too.

85
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,800
Even though I talked about Yi Soo,

86
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,620
You haven't asked me about what happened,

87
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,100
or why he's come or anything like that.

88
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,870
I know why he's coming so why should I ask.

89
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,160
You know why?

90
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't even specifically know why.

91
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,070
He's coming to get me.

92
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,260
He's coming to get you?

93
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,990
<i>Song! Song!</i>

94
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,260
I think he's calling for you.

95
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,590
<i>Song!</i>

96
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:52,560
What's he doing so early?

97
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,330
Good morning, Song.

98
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,770
What bad manners!
You should answer a greeting!

99
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,790
- Let's go.
- Where?

100
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,100
I'm going to the market and I
need someone to carry my groceries.

101
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,490
- Which one looks better?
- Both are spinach.

102
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:26,590
You need to pick spinach that's short,
leafy, with a deep shade on the bottom.

103
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,880
Ahjumma, please wrap this for me.

104
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,460
You know how to do things like this too?

105
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,045
Do you think that a man
living in America

106
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:34,790
keeps this appearance and
health with no effort?

107
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,690
Are you possessed by Min Ho right now?

108
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,690
You're acting so conceited.

109
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,740
I was going to prepare breakfast for you,
but now I'm not going to!

110
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,660
You were going to prepare breakfast for me?

111
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,670
Has your hearing gone bad? I was
going to, but now I'm not going to!

112
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,200
Well then, I saw a ddukbokki house on the
way here. I'll just eat there then.

113
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,290
Why won't you listen to
someone till the end?

114
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,590
I was going to, and I thought about
not doing it, but then I decided to.

115
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,860
Why is this so good?

116
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,360
Maybe because I've been awake
and moving around so early?

117
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,920
What excuses, it's your talent to eat a lot.

118
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,640
I'm not eating because I want to,

119
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,330
This body is a body I need to eat a lot for.

120
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,340
It's probably really deficient in vitamins
and minerals for having not eaten well.

121
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,480
That's just an excuse,
it's just really tasty.

122
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,960
Going to a market early in the morning
for groceries, eating breakfast together,

123
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,170
and then running a business
all day together.

124
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,560
It must be nice for a couple
to live like this.

125
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,120
- What are you going to do today?
- I'm going to work.

126
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,810
On a beautiful day like this?

127
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,740
Go shop for a couple designer outfits,
3 or 4 pairs of shoes,

128
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,360
and just one handbag.

129
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,480
...don't dream of doing that.

130
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,470
This is your paycheck.

131
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,420
I calculated it to the dime so go
get something good to eat.

132
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,800
I'm going to go to the hospital today
to meet with Ji Hyun's dad.

133
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,750
Why, did something happen with the company?

134
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,830
No, nothing like that.

135
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,188
With all the documents I've collected,

136
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:46,440
I'm planning on filing the lawsuit with
the police to investigate Min Ho's dealings.

137
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,360
Oh submitting a petition was an option too!

138
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,360
Why didn't I think of it sooner?

139
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,350
Since we've gotten over the bankruptcy and
he is getting out of the hospital soon,

140
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,980
don't worry about the company
and use your time well.

141
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,170
Of course I will! I'm going to go have
so much fun with my time.

142
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,540
The safe, the double accounting, you have
to forget about everything okay?

143
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,180
I will.

144
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,850
Even if I die, I can face Ji Hyun
without any regrets now.

145
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,480
You don't know how proud I am to block
Ji Hyun's family's company from bankruptcy.

146
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:24,370
It did take some time, but I saved the
company, so I have no regrets.

147
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,630
It's to the point you have no regrets?

148
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,540
What do you mean Hae Mi Do's
worrying you too?

149
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,790
In exchange for selling
Ji Hyun's property,

150
00:14:42,891 --> 00:14:46,270
I invested my last funds on Hae Mi Do
in JC Consulting.

151
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,310
The repayment day is in a week.

152
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,770
What happens if you're unable
to pay it back?

153
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,880
I promised to give over 20% of the shares,

154
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,140
so we effectively lose control of Hae Mi Do.

155
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,400
Min Ho was supposed to take over,

156
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,940
and I'm sure he concluded it
secretly with Hyuk San Industries.

157
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,940
We barely stopped the bankruptcy.

158
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,560
Do you think you can get $7,000,000 again?

159
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,470
I can go around and try to take care of it.

160
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,950
Anyway, I think I have to go to
the office today.

161
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,990
Hello, Mr. President.

162
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,800
- Is everyone here?
- Yes, they're waiting for you.

163
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,370
- I'll see you later
- Yes sir.

164
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,710
Let's talk.

165
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:06,340
I don't know what Min Ho's thinking
but make him stop everything now.

166
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,780
Kang, I can't stop Min Ho.

167
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,610
So don't ask me something like that.

168
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,050
Min Ho can be cold-hearted
in front of Ji Hyun,

169
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,130
But you were her friend.

170
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,500
I was her friend, but I did
something like that.

171
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,820
Min Ho is someone who can't be stopped,

172
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,790
And I'm someone who can't get away from him.

173
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,340
As long as Min Ho's at this company,
I'll be here too,

174
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,390
Wherever he goes, I'm going to go
with him all the way.

175
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,430
I have no choice but to do that.

176
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,850
It's too late.

177
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,860
There's no such thing as too late,

178
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,860
unless you're dead.

179
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,170
I'm asking you one last time.

180
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,010
Your plans have all been uncovered.

181
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,620
Why wasn't the director of planning called
to an emergency preparation meeting?

182
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,635
Bring me your resignation letter.

183
00:17:26,736 --> 00:17:29,140
Do you have any grounds to ask me
for my resignation letter?

184
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,380
I have no grounds to fire you.

185
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,999
Are you saying that since
this will become your company anyway,

186
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,810
there's no point in submitting a letter?

187
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:43,030
I won't ask you questions like, why did
you do this to me? Why did you deceive me?

188
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,620
I blame myself for trusting
you like a human being,

189
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,840
and I'll suffer the consequences of it.

190
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,520
Is it a party of 1 or 2?

191
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,780
I want her to take my order.

192
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,270
What?

193
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,530
Isn't she pretty?

194
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,530
My Song Yi Kyung.

195
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,140
Hi!

196
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,730
Did you see that? I unwillingly get
showered with attention around this area.

197
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,150
- What are you doing here?
- Why do you think I'm here?

198
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,530
I came to see your face.

199
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,530
My face?

200
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,690
I told you to stop treating
me like Song Yi Kyung!

201
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,210
Then what am I supposed to do?

202
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,400
You possess her during the daytime so
I only get to see her sleep at night.

203
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,300
Oh and even at night.

204
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,790
You were filming your own movie last night.

205
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,730
I warned you.

206
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,480
Who told you to film a melodrama
in my Yi Kyung's body?

207
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,220
I got permission from Yi Kyung already!

208
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,850
Yi Kyung told me I could do it first!

209
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,460
I can imagine how much you
begged her to say yes.

210
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,590
I was wondering,

211
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,030
was your earnest wish to take away Yi Kyung?

212
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,220
What's that supposed to mean?

213
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,720
Yi Kyung thinks you're here
to take her away.

214
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,530
And how you act,

215
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,820
Managing everything she does
like she's your woman.

216
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,930
That's what Yi Kyung's thinking right now?

217
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,220
Is that really why you asked
to be a Scheduler?

218
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,170
I'm leaving.

219
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,970
Why isn't Kang here?

220
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,880
I thought you were just going
to the hospital.

221
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:45,330
<i>Hang Kang's calling! The Han Kang you've
been waiting for is calling.</i>

222
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,360
Why aren't you here yet?

223
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,930
You can't come?

224
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,250
Ji Hyun's dad's going home today, so I'm
going to stay beside Ji Hyun tonight.

225
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,270
So you're spending the night
at the hospital?

226
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,460
Let's take our money and leave.

227
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,350
You've told me this before.

228
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,270
And you heard my answer then.
Why are you asking me again?

229
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,440
The situation's different now.

230
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,540
We've been discovered.

231
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,180
If it was for money, I wouldn't have
done something like this.

232
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:22,100
President Shin and Kang aren't stupid.

233
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,850
They're not going to just let
their company go like this.

234
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,220
Yeah, go ahead.

235
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,740
Kang did?

236
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,660
Okay.

237
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,270
Kang took Ji Hyun's parents home.

238
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,860
Who is he to be doing things like that?

239
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,080
Why are you acting so unlike yourself?

240
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,960
Is this the time to be overreacting
over news about Kang?

241
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,790
What's that supposed to mean?

242
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,450
Does it make you angry
that two women you like,

243
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,270
Ji Hyun and Yi Kyung, are both next to Kang?

244
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,930
<i>The thing you can't do, Kang can?</i>

245
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,920
- Two women?
- Isn't it?

246
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,015
It's not that you don't know
which one you loved,

247
00:22:11,016 --> 00:22:12,870
you seem like someone who loved
both of them!

248
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,680
Do you really want to apologize and propose
to Ji Hyun who's inside of Yi Kyung,

249
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,970
But can't do it because you're
scared of rejection?

250
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,550
You're right. I'm going crazy
worrying about Ji Hyun.

251
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,080
As long as Ji Hyun lives as Yi Kyung,
living with Yi Kyung,

252
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,430
I can't do anything.

253
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,750
As long as Ji Hyun's here,
you can't be by my side.

254
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,205
Whether you're In Jung,

255
00:22:38,206 --> 00:22:42,720
or In Jung with Ji Hyun's spirit inside,
I wouldn't know for sure.

256
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,450
<i>As long as Ji Hyun's here,
you can't be by my side.</i>

257
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:49,070
Shin In Jung. You're still coming here?

258
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,180
Shin In Jung.

259
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,990
Why are you like that?

260
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,830
What are you trying to do?

261
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,340
Shin In Jung!

262
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,620
Are you out of your mind!?

263
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
How can you do something like this?

264
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,800
You were going to, going to...

265
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,090
Are you even human?

266
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,150
How can you do something like this!?

267
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,240
Do you want to go this far?
Do you want to go this far?

268
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:40,430
What has Ji Hyun done?
What has she done to you guys?!

269
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,120
You guys really aren't human.

270
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,460
Go.

271
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,010
I might end up killing you.

272
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,620
So leave.

273
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,980
What's going on so early in the morning?

274
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,990
I wanted to tell you what
kind of person you are.

275
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,710
What?

276
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,570
You're just a disgraceful person.

277
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,610
To say you got screwed over by God
so you're going to screw over other people.

278
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,960
To say that you're challenging the God
who gave you such a miserable fate.

279
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,175
You're hiding behind that wall
of excuses

280
00:27:29,176 --> 00:27:31,670
and doing things that are worse than
your father.

281
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,290
What?

282
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,080
Do you know why you're a disgrace?

283
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,190
Because you have a mother who educated
you until you got your MBA.

284
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,190
Don't talk about my mother.

285
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,980
Do you know the kind of mother I heard
about through you in America?

286
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,430
She's the mother who hit you,

287
00:27:48,431 --> 00:27:50,110
and made you go to school when
you would insist on working.

288
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,060
Stop it!

289
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,090
I'm saying, don't become like your father!

290
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,520
But you.

291
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:02,510
You did something worse than your father who
stole from your innocent mother and gambled.

292
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,800
I told you to stop.

293
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,380
You're the man who made
the person who loves you,

294
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,090
someone you once loved,

295
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,350
lay a hand on her friend's respirator.

296
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,970
You trampled all over the sacrifices
of the mother,

297
00:28:24,971 --> 00:28:26,900
who told you not to become
like your father,

298
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,230
to act even more feverishly
after getting rich quick.

299
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:34,340
And you, you're someone who has all the
talents to succeed on your own.

300
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,730
And that's why you're disgraceful.

301
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,540
I hope you know you're an embarrassment
to your mother.

302
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,770
What are you going to do with
me when Ji Hyun's gone?

303
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,130
I can use my healthy body, my soul,
my talents, and stay by your side forever.

304
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,000
Seeing someone who used to be so lazy
get so excited,

305
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,990
This is the power of Ji Hyun?

306
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,910
Don't try to act like you're strong.

307
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,440
It won't work anymore.

308
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,135
The original owner of Hae Mi Do,
Park Seung Jae,

309
00:29:13,136 --> 00:29:15,680
was the former chauffeur
at JC Consulting.

310
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,835
Jun Sae Company's representative,
Seo In Woo,

311
00:29:16,836 --> 00:29:19,230
is the brother-in-law of the lawyer
working for Hyuk San's President Oh.

312
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,155
Are they sure about this?

313
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,320
The president's sunbae was absolutely sure
and asked for it to be brought quickly.

314
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:27,110
If we include all the pictures Jun Hee took,
the answer comes out clear!

315
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,010
This is good. With this, submitting
the petition will start the investigation.

316
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:17,800
<i>Then please say something to Ji Hyun,
who you might never see again.</i>

317
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,090
<i>Oh no, what do we do, Ji Hyun.</i>

318
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,520
What is this?

319
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,910
What kind of friend was Shin Ji Hyun?

320
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,590
<i>She was almost annoyingly nice.</i>

321
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,450
But honestly, she was being conceited.

322
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,560
<i>If you tell her how much you love her,</i>

323
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,210
I think Ji Hyun might feel the
motivation to keep living.

324
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,990
<i>But, I guess the tears won't come out.</i>

325
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,500
<i>So this is what you've been going
around doing.</i>

326
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,980
<i>You did everything already.</i>

327
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,840
Kang, it's weird if you stare like that.

328
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:55,460
Ahjussi, I want to save Ji Hyun.

329
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,680
I want to save her.

330
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,200
I wish she would live.

331
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:06,070
I know, what are we going to do?

332
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,520
She's so pitiful.

333
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,340
So pitiful.

334
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:49,140
I want to, at least once, want
to live as Ji Hyun for Kang.

335
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,320
<i>I want to hear him call me Ji Hyun.</i>

336
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,030
And I want to answer Kang.

337
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,010
I'm going to die in 3 days,

338
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:01,250
but dying like this isn't fair!

339
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,290
I understand Shin Ji Hyun's heart.

340
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,400
Seeing, but unable to acknowledge
that you know,

341
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,570
Unable to say that it's you.

342
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,220
I don't know why I've remembered my past,

343
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,090
and it's causing such pain too.

344
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,090
Can't I really just meet Kang as
Ji Hyun just one time?

345
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,840
Isn't there some trade-off where I can trade
in my 3 days and spend 3 hours with Kang?

346
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,040
No there isn't! Do you really lack
that much confidence to keep living?

347
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,040
Even if I wake up,

348
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,230
you said I can't remember anything
that happened during the 49 days.

349
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,430
Then I can't remember these feelings!

350
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,660
Of course!

351
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,610
How is that fair?

352
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:53,180
You said everyone else, Kang, Min Ho,
In Jung will remember.

353
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,000
It doesn't matter if they do.

354
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,740
People around here always say they saw
someone possessed, or saw a ghost.

355
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,400
They're all over the place!

356
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,350
Those people can tell me, then!

357
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,500
What's the point? It's going to sound
like a bunch of nonsense to you.

358
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,800
Then what am I doing?

359
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,750
49 days is nothing but a chance
to regain your life,

360
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,220
It's definitely not an extension
of your life.

361
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:18,920
I've heard that there are always some
49'ers who turn melodramatic in the end.

362
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,700
49 days is too cruel.

363
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,790
Hyuk San Industries got the contract
for Hanoi.

364
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:35,850
What do you mean by that?

365
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,515
Hyuk San Industries had conflicts with the
Ho Chi Minh construction,

366
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:39,510
which led them to give up on Hanoi.

367
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,770
Didn't you confirm
the Ho Chi Minh construction?!

368
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,150
That... was confirmed by Manager Kang.

369
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:11,780
Kang, what's wrong? Is everything okay?

370
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,460
I'm sorry about the other day.
You felt bad huh?

371
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,750
It's okay, I have no right to feel bad.

372
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:24,920
I just wanted Ji Hyun to know
she lived being loved.

373
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,250
- What does that mean?
- It's just what I said.

374
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,540
Ji Hyun loved both of you,

375
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,240
but In Jung wants her to die, and you...

376
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:38,420
You treat her as if she was a living person.

377
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,510
So did she become nothing to you because
you thought her dead?

378
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,230
It's not like that,

379
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,370
It's just the hospital said there
was no hope.

380
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,430
That's right, scientifically
Ji Hyun is dead.

381
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,620
But just because Ji Hyun dies,

382
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,390
doesn't mean our bond breaks.

383
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,480
Mother, it's me, Kang.

384
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,150
<i>Something bad's happened, Kang.</i>

385
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,140
<i>The contract, Hyuk San Industries got it.</i>

386
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,610
What? I understand, I'll make my way over
to the hospital right now.

387
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,590
Where are you wandering around by yourself?

388
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,010
Remember, I was going to have fun?

389
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,370
You're the one that's busy,
now that I'm not.

390
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,880
Preparing for the petition was
getting complicated.

391
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,930
You think I'm just idly wasting my time?

392
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,260
Let's go.

393
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,340
There's not that many days left, why are you
going to go to America and back?

394
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,970
Just give him a call.

395
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,090
My dad's a businessman, Ahjussi.

396
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,590
He's not one to just invest, from
being happy his son called.

397
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:37,030
I don't even know if he'll do it even if I
go, beg, and try to convince him in person.

398
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,250
But there's only 5 days left!

399
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,020
If I go and rush back I still have 2 days.

400
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,750
She's the one who said she'd have no
regrets if she could save her dad's company.

401
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,280
I can't just let her be defeated
by Min Ho in the end.

402
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,280
What if you go and nothing happens here?

403
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,720
Hae Mi Do is a project Min Ho headed.

404
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,710
There's a big chance he'll win.

405
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,240
Even still,

406
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,110
you thought of going all the way to
America just to get funding for Hae Mi Do?

407
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,630
Because this is the only option right now.

408
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,530
You can't get weak now.

409
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:14,080
Kang's going through all of this for us,
but I haven't seen In Jung at all.

410
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:18,650
Honey, meet up with Seo Woo and
find out about In Jung.

411
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,760
It's under my name, but it's yours.

412
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,170
The password is your birthday.

413
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,670
Why are you giving this to me?

414
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,000
Don't be scared of Ji Hyun and
go abroad for a while.

415
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,480
I'll contact you when everything's done.

416
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,780
Min Ho, no.

417
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,630
I can't leave by myself.

418
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,920
You wanted to escape with the money before.

419
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,740
Don't stay by my side and go crazy as well.

420
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,580
Min Ho, no. I don't need this money.

421
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,620
When did I say I needed money?

422
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,830
Piece of trash-

423
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,330
It's fine.

424
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,110
It's my fault for not smelling
the trash sooner.

425
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,030
Go ahead, Oppa.

426
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,510
Have a seat.

427
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,300
How could you, in front of me?

428
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:13,760
It's embarrassing even asking
how you could do this.

429
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,850
What did I come to say to someone who
pushed her man to her friend.

430
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:27,070
Fine, I knew from before
that you were the covetous type.

431
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,240
Yes, I've known it all along too.

432
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,830
That you weren't pleased with me.

433
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:39,120
I had a lot of heartache living
with you while knowing that.

434
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:42,380
- What?
- You don't think you let me know?

435
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,200
Whenever relatives or friends came,

436
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,290
you purposely sat me down in
front of them to greet them.

437
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:53,320
You had your fun being the
best mother in the world.

438
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,580
I did that because I thought
of you as my own family.

439
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,580
Own family?

440
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,420
Do you remember what you said
the day I got kidnapped?

441
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,370
Oh no, what about Ji Hyun?

442
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,890
Are you sure they didn't kidnap you
thinking you were Ji Hyun?

443
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,660
It's a relief Ji Hyun came in early.

444
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,170
You never once asked if I was okay.

445
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,790
Back then...

446
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,990
It's human nature for the mother
to worry about her own child.

447
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,810
Is that why you did this to us?

448
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,620
Yes! That's why I did it.

449
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,300
You provoked me and Ji Hyun
stepped on my pride.

450
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,100
Try hitting rock bottom.

451
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,690
So why did you accept a kid like me?

452
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,860
If you didn't like me, why didn't you just
say so from the beginning?

453
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,100
Why did you accept me in?

454
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,030
Why didn't you not take me in?

455
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,460
I only received things from Kang.

456
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,010
I want to do something for him in return.

457
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:09,390
What did you do for him?

458
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:14,410
I rolled kimbap and went on
a picnic with him.

459
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:18,290
Because Yi Soo liked the kimbap
I used to make.

460
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:24,090
Just laying around and resting;
reading books, listening to music.

461
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:27,090
It must've been so nice.

462
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:32,150
I've never been on a date like that.

463
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:36,570
But where can I make the food secretly?

464
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,520
<i>I'll be back Ji Hyun.</i>

465
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,540
<i>Stay safe.</i>

466
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,870
<i>2 Days 4 hours 29 minutes left.</i>

467
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:04,310
You're leaving already?

468
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,740
On my way to the airport, I'm going to
the prosecutor's office to file the lawsuit.

469
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:08,740
Why don't you at least say bye to Ji Hyun?

470
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,100
If I say I'm going to America,
she'll ask why.

471
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:15,060
Then if she notices anything, the rest
of her time will be a nightmare.

472
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,960
So what should I say if she asks?

473
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,750
Just think of some excuse.

474
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,240
And make sure to tell her I won't be late.

475
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,380
Ahjussi, if Kang looks for me,

476
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,570
tell him I have some business
to take care of.

477
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:43,480
Whew, I'm thankful that you didn't ask me.

478
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:01,810
Oh my god!

479
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,900
You were scared I would catch you
so you fled to Kang's house.

480
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,410
You've willingly come back
to the lion's den.

481
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:19,390
That's Kang Min Ho's strength,
that you think you're awesome.

482
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,220
That's your weakness too.

483
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:25,930
You think so highly of yourself that
nobody else comes into view.

484
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:31,630
You're Ji Hyun, but why are you not
Ji Hyun when you meet me?

485
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,720
You know the answer to that already.

486
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,660
I brought it here.

487
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:45,320
Oh? You're back already?

488
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,790
- Excuse me-
- Here's the contract.

489
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,750
What contract?

490
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:55,530
What's going on with him?

491
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:58,790
He told me to write up a contract in your
name, what's wrong with him?

492
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:00,580
What?

493
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,050
You cannot get involved in human affairs.

494
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:11,140
This rule, make sure to memorize it.

495
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,780
Ugh and these clothes!

496
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,400
Can we at least keep the tastefulness
and grace of a scheduler?

497
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:20,400
Yes, sir!

498
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,090
Oh! Ah, this sound is telling you
to download your schedule.

499
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,990
It's sent every 10 days so...

500
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:40,010
Wow look at how packed my
schedule is until the end.

501
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:47,360
Who's the human who will be taking the
elevator with me for the very last time?

502
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,220
Ahjussi! Has Kang gone somewhere?

503
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,220
His phone seems to be turned off.

504
00:45:56,470 --> 00:46:00,220
Uh, Kang went to America.

505
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:03,850
- What's that...
- His dad suddenly called for him.

506
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,270
Don't worry! He'll be back the
day after tomorrow!

507
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,200
The day... after... tomorrow?

508
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,550
No!

509
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,250
Kang!

510
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:27,060
Kang!

511
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,490
I'm not here by then.

512
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:42,360
By then, I'm not going to be here.

513
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:52,950
Kang!

514
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:04,970
Kang!

515
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,410
Kang!

516
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:23,440
He said not to leave without saying goodbye.

517
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:27,750
He said not to leave like his mom did.

518
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:31,310
You might be able to see him in 2 days.

519
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,370
I won't be able to see him.

520
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,850
When Kang comes back,
I probably won't be here.

521
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:46,560
In 2 days, you're leaving too...

522
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:53,650
Do you not need me to go anywhere today?

523
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,890
Then, I'll be right back.

524
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:16,640
You're really living on for that soul?

525
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:21,070
I know you might not understand.

526
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,910
How could you do that?

527
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,170
You said before...

528
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,950
There's pain that you'll never know
until you've experienced it.

529
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,470
It's like that now.

530
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:38,340
You probably won't know why I did it.

531
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:42,960
So you couldn't trust me,
because I told you to leave.

532
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:46,920
From your point of view, it's a given
that you would tell me to leave.

533
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,230
I thought I had become your friend.

534
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:54,260
But I guess not.

535
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,560
I kept thinking only from my perspective,

536
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,680
I was wanting for you to be free
from that no matter what.

537
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,740
I know.

538
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:11,480
That's why I came to say bye.
Thank you for everything.

539
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:13,680
Are you going somewhere?

540
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:16,060
I decided to go somewhere.

541
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,960
Hey! Traveler Ji Hyun!

542
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,670
There's no need to make me feel better.

543
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,180
I'm not here to make you feel better.

544
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:28,430
This is your final notice so listen up.

545
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:44,030
Traveler Shin Ji Hyun,
as it is now midnight,

546
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:47,610
You have 16 hours and 55 minutes left.

547
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,450
You will, at 4:55pm tomorrow,

548
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,510
at the time of your accident,

549
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:54,640
finish your 49 day travels.

550
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,265
You are not allowed to leave behind
anything that reveals your identity,

551
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:01,290
nor can you leave letters.

552
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,030
I can't even leave behind a letter?

553
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:08,580
A letter left behind in your
name will evaporate.

554
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,830
As the scheduler in charge of you,

555
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:16,730
I will officially appear before you
5 minutes before the end of the trip.

556
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:21,000
The end.

557
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,830
I wish you luck.

558
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:52,780
Serves you right.

559
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:54,430
Whatever you have to say,
just say it and leave.

560
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:59,000
Ji Hyun's mom came and asked me
about you two so I told her.

561
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,000
She wouldn't budge an inch.

562
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,880
Seeing as he left you like this
since yesterday,

563
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,190
are things over with Min Ho too?

564
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:13,010
Your man and your friends, I feel
bad for you Shin In Jung.

565
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,910
He and I.

566
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,740
We're not finished.

567
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,580
Kang treats Ji Hyun as if
she was still alive.

568
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,160
When you said Kang liked Ji Hyun,

569
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:49,840
I thought about why it made me sad.

570
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:55,740
I had believed what the doctor had said and
thought Ji Hyun was gone already.

571
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:00,170
Dying doesn't break our fate.

572
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:10,980
Us three...

573
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:14,340
Why did we become like this?

574
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,630
You're so pretty.

575
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:51,250
For everything...
Thank you everyone.

576
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:08,160
Seo Woo!

577
00:54:09,602 --> 00:54:13,250
Can you pick a cake for me?
One that's the prettiest and most delicious.

578
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:15,140
Is today something special?

579
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:17,840
It's Ji Hyun's parent's anniversary.

580
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:23,210
You said you were Ji Hyun's friend,
you're better than I am.

581
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,670
<i>- Wrap this one for me.
- Yes</i>

582
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,150
- How much is it?
- I'm going to pay for it.

583
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,490
- No it's okay!
- I'm Ji Hyun's friend too!

584
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,930
Actually I'm the closer friend.

585
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:40,110
We're best friends.

586
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:41,960
I know.

587
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:45,770
Ji Hyun told me after her mom and
dad, she liked you the best.

588
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:48,290
Did she?

589
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,000
She said you were like
the shade from a big tree.

590
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:57,200
Although you may not think so,
Ji Hyun liked you very much.

591
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,210
Hearing that makes me
really want to see her.

592
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:13,430
Every year, Ji Hyun would sing us
a song for our anniversary.

593
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:18,630
I know, so I prepared this CD instead.

594
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:38,480
<i>Unni, please push me out now.</i>

595
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:41,350
<i>Whoever it is, will probably be so happy.</i>

596
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:48,370
<i>Whoever it is, is going to be so happy.</i>

597
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:55,680
<i>I am endlessly envious</i>

598
00:56:56,270 --> 00:57:02,760
<i>of the boy who met that girl.</i>

599
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:08,880
<i>Beneath her unlit windows,</i>

600
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:16,580
<i>Today I hovered...</i>

601
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:23,830
<i>My hovering self was so sorrowful</i>

602
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:29,940
<i>that I returned without a word.</i>

603
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,380
Some parents are like that,

604
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,500
And other parents abandon their children.

605
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:51,700
It might not have been abandonment.

606
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:54,190
She might have lost you.

607
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:59,385
After my younger brother was born,

608
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:04,860
I still have memories of her
getting annoyed and mad at me.

609
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,810
Oh my!

610
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:11,800
I think that's why instead of parents,
they sent me Yi Soo.

611
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:25,260
That's why I told you to wait.
Why did you leave by yourself?

612
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:27,290
Everybody keeps teasing.

613
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:30,120
Song Yi Kyung and Song Yi Soo -
that the siblings are dating.

614
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,280
- Then say that we're dating.
- What?

615
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:34,280
They'll tease even if we say no.

616
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:37,400
It's true that we're not siblings.

617
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,160
- Is there a reason we can't date?
- Song Yi Soo!

618
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,380
I'm not saying let's date.

619
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,530
Since we're going to get teased anyway.

620
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,210
It's all because you named me.

621
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:52,840
Okay fine, when I grow up and earn money,

622
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,100
I'll just find your real name for you.

623
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:57,270
Come here.

624
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:00,650
What?

625
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:08,310
What are you doing?

626
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,420
You said you're my mom,

627
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:15,710
And my dad.

628
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,230
And you said we were friends.

629
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:22,500
I'm Song Yi Soo, I can do anything!

630
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:33,060
You're living like this because
you lost someone like that.

631
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:39,540
Ji Hyun, I'm really sorry.

632
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:42,900
I'm really sorry.

633
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:44,460
Unni, what's the matter?

634
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:49,260
To have made you leave parents
like that, because of me.

635
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:52,890
- I'm really sorry.
- Unni

636
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,880
I knew I couldn't die,

637
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,390
But because I wanted to die so badly...

638
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:03,090
For 5 years after Yi Soo left,
I tried cutting my wrist,

639
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:05,670
Taking medicine,

640
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,980
Hanging myself.

641
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,980
It's not just your fault.

642
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:13,920
But, I wouldn't die.

643
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:18,120
When I would cut my wrist,
the landlady would come.

644
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:20,910
When I took the medicine, I would throw up.

645
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,380
When I hung myself,

646
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,730
the rope fell.

647
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,430
So that day,

648
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,220
because it was the day Yi Soo died.

649
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:38,290
I'm really sorry.

650
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:43,210
If you're sorry, live well for me.

651
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:50,370
When you get tired, think back to days
like this when you regretted it.

652
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,500
Receive strength from it and live on.

653
01:01:57,710 --> 01:02:02,050
Okay! Scheduler's special service
for the last day.

654
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:07,090
You have 7 hours and 55 minutes left,
what do you want to do?

655
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,940
Anything you want to do,
I'll take you there.

656
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:11,980
There's nothing I want to do.

657
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,380
Call the elevator for me.

658
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:15,790
What?

659
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:20,360
I don't want to use the rest of
my time waiting anxiously.

660
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:23,310
I'll go now.

661
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,300
Okay.

662
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:26,930
Scheduler!

663
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,040
Thank you so much for everything.

664
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,550
Let's say our goodbyes in front
of the elevator.

665
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,420
What are you saying?

666
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,320
Are you telling us...

667
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:48,600
to give up on Ji Hyun?

668
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,740
I'm telling you this because I know what
President Shin's going through.

669
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:58,000
Scientifically, there's no
hope left for Ji Hyun.

670
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,740
<i>Don't be surprised, Yi Kyung!</i>

671
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:25,190
<i>I'm cleaning in exchange for everything
you've done for me.</i>

672
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:28,460
<i>And don't be scared.</i>

673
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:31,460
<i>I won't come back again.</i>

674
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:41,190
<i>I was a pitiful soul that
grew attached to you.</i>

675
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,420
<i>Do me a favor,</i>

676
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,890
<i>and don't just eat ramen.</i>

677
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:54,140
<i>I really hope you eat rice.</i>

678
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,370
Okay.

679
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,300
For our goodbyes.

680
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:25,410
