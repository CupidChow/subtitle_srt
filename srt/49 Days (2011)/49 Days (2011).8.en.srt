Episode 8

4
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,990
How come you're here?

5
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,830
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,870
I accepted Kang Min Ho's request to
help with some house chores.

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,070
House chores?

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,090
You're here as a housekeeper?

9
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,120
So, why did you come here?

10
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,550
I...

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,740
I'm here from Manager Kang Min Ho's
company's secretary's office.

12
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,610
Aunt asked me to bring these here.

13
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,860
What is it?

14
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,740
It's beef bone soup.

15
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,540
Nowadays, secretaries have to do deliveries?

16
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,630
I'll pass it on for you.

17
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,250
Do you want to come in?

18
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,720
No. I don't.

19
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,650
How did you know this house's password?

20
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,710
That...

21
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,790
It seems to be none of my business.
Please take care.

22
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Aunt told me.

23
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,960
Kang Min Ho will return after 11.

24
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,470
Then I'm leaving.

25
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,180
Awful girl!

26
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,340
Cooking beef bone soup all day...

27
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,270
My mom asked her?

28
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,690
Lying to my face...
doesn't surprise me anymore.

29
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,100
Thank you.

30
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,610
I never liked cooking for Kang Min Ho
anyway.

31
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,450
Can't I just let him have this?

32
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,680
- What is that?
- Oh, my!

33
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,850
What's this?

34
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,820
It's beef bone soup.

35
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,330
I didn't have this in my house.
Where did it come from?

36
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,510
Shin In Jung brought it over.

37
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,450
Who?

38
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,040
Shin In Jung.

39
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,450
She just left. You didn't see her?

40
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,670
Did Secretary Shin come here?

41
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,910
She even knew your house's password.

42
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,340
[Secretary Shin]

43
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,320
You're not picking up?

44
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,600
<i>What document is that?</i>

45
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,170
<i>What is so important that
he had to bring it home?</i>

46
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,370
Oh, In Jung. What's the matter?

47
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,350
Min Ho oppa, what exactly is going on?
Why is there...

48
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,990
Good timing! The meeting just ended.

49
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,780
It's over?

50
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,130
You're at home, right? Come out.

51
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,200
I'll be right there.
Let's go out for dinner.

52
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,700
<i>I have to check what those documents are.</i>

53
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,290
I'm going out for awhile.
You can get off work.

54
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,260
- What about these?
- Put them away.

55
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,050
We'll discuss things tomorrow.

56
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,420
Then you can leave first.
I'll leave right after I've cleaned up.

57
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,380
How many times do you want me to say it?

58
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,380
Song Yi Kyung, enough already!

59
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,980
<i>Did he leave all the documents at home?</i>

60
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,670
Where did those documents go?

61
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,910
Did he hide them?

62
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,960
Where could it be?

63
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,040
You look angry.

64
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,560
Min Ho oppa, what's wrong with you?

65
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,560
Why is Song Yi Kyung at your house?

66
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,720
I heard you asked her
to be your housekeeper.

67
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,830
You went to my house? Why?

68
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,840
Didn't I say that casually going to my house
is very risky?

69
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,590
I thought because of the meeting,
you won't be able to eat properly.

70
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,420
Is that important right now?

71
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,420
How did you get in?

72
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,970
Did Song Yi Kyung open the door for you?

73
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,730
Did you open the door yourself?

74
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,080
Are you out of your mind?

75
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,890
She used to worked at Kang's restaurant.

76
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,380
If she tells them, then what do we do?

77
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,970
Then, why did you bring
that kind of a woman to your house?

78
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,110
Didn't you say
she treated you very impolitely?

79
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,550
What exactly were you thinking?

80
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,570
Shin In Jung.

81
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,200
The question now is
what exactly are you thinking?

82
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,700
Oppa, are you interested
in Song Yi Kyung?

83
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,850
Is she a woman worthy of my care?

84
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,290
Is she?

85
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,410
That type of woman.

86
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,950
What do you think of me?

87
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,060
Because I don't understand.

88
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,590
She's only a housekeeper.

89
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,400
It just happened that I needed one
and she was fired by Kang.

90
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,710
That's why I hired her.

91
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,380
I thought compared to a stranger,

92
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,030
I'd be more at ease
with someone I already know.

93
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,280
Then, why didn't you tell me?

94
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,870
I've hired numerous housekeepers
over the years.

95
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,430
When have I ever informed you?

96
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,190
- But she's different.
- How is she different?

97
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,240
Just as you said, bringing someone
who is close to Kang to your side,

98
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,000
is unlikely what you'd do.

99
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,830
The two years I've been with Ji Hyun,
did I ever fall for her?

100
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,840
Answer me. Did I?

101
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,030
No.

102
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,010
Then, let's end the discussion here.

103
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,980
When you're like this over that type
of woman, it only makes me unhappy.

104
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,010
Then, have her quit tomorrow.

105
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,650
I have to let her work a couple of days,
at least.

106
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,300
Recently, I have no time to do anything
because of the Hae Mi Do project.

107
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,620
I'm preparing other matters, as well.

108
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,860
It's nothing serious.
Don't be too sensitive.

109
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,480
Working as a house keeper is great.
I always have plenty of time.

110
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,220
Dad!

111
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,900
That's right! You should run that fast!

112
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,410
It was you.

113
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,990
Hey! You almost scared me to death.

114
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,130
You're a spirit too,
but you're scared of your own kind?

115
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,050
What's the matter? Why come
without me looking for you?

116
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,060
I want to complete my five year
term smoothly so I'm on patrol.

117
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,990
Speaking of which, what are you doing?

118
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,770
I want this unni to get some exercise.

119
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,890
She only eats ramen every day.
Her body is so weak.

120
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,050
So you're trying to improve this woman's
physical condition?

121
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,030
This unni... has no one caring for her.

122
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,640
Also, I've been bothering her, but
there's nothing I can repay her with.

123
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,320
I can only let her eat well and
make her healthy.

124
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,920
Right now, you might not
even regain your life...

125
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,900
You're really odd!

126
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,890
Tears aren't something I can obtain
by running here and there.

127
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,130
That's right! There's no one
willing to cry for you!

128
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,960
Shin Ji Hyun's friends are all
very busy this week, right?

129
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,110
They don't even know the
situation I'm in right now.

130
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,110
They don't know that I've become like this.

131
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,130
If they knew, they would
definitely act differently.

132
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,530
Oh! So you're saying that you might as
well be unoccupied with the remaining time?

133
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,850
So you'll go to Kang Min Ho's house to work
and get information at the same time.

134
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,140
Killing two birds with one stone.

135
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,350
Yo... you getting what you want,

136
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,460
working to get what you need,
picking up everything to eat.

137
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,270
Sweeping the front door, wiping your mouth to
erase all evidence. Then getting paid while at it?

138
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,090
Can it really turn out the way you want?

139
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,230
Have you ever tried to sit and
think about your life for four whole days?

140
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,680
Why would I?

141
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,370
I'm not a person who needs
to think about that.

142
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,130
When I was locked in for four days,

143
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,530
I finally understood the length of one day.

144
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,340
The amount of things that can
be done in one day.

145
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,050
I finally understood how precious
the 33 days I have left.

146
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,950
Of course!

147
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,520
I will treasure my remaining days
and use it wisely.

148
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,040
You definitely made a decision
worthy of a queen.

149
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,020
This is something that needs a celebration.
But don't overdo it. I'll get in trouble.

150
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,120
Thank you for worrying about me.

151
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,890
It's me, I'm worried about!

152
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:12,470
You're my last assignment for the remaining
34 days of my five year term, troublemaker!

153
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,670
Hmph.

154
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,730
Bye, bye! See you later!

155
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,730
I'll call you!

156
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,000
She actually takes the Scheduler
as her friend.

157
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,010
<i>Just as you said, bringing someone
who is close to Kang to your side,</i>

158
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,160
<i>is unlikely what you'd do.</i>

159
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,600
<i>Then, have her quit tomorrow.</i>

160
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,550
Here you go.

161
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,350
Is Song Yi Kyung off work already?

162
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,180
She's off work forever!

163
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,180
She's been fired.

164
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,580
Didn't you say that Kang
likes Song Yi Kyung?

165
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,390
Why did he fire her?

166
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,200
When she made a move on Ji Hyun's fiance,
she was caught by the President.

167
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,240
<i>Did he fire her because she
was involved with oppa?</i>

168
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,930
Nowadays, secretaries have to do deliveries?

169
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,710
<i>Kang's consideration for Ji Hyun
actually goes to this extent?</i>

170
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,010
<i>I thought he hated Ji Hyun.</i>

171
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,590
<i>It's a bar!</i>

172
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,880
If you're worried, then go take a look.

173
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,470
What? Go look at what?

174
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,470
This is this month's accounts.

175
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,960
Aren't you worried that Song Yi Kyung
is working in a bar?

176
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,770
With her poor health,
she still went to work in a bar.

177
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,280
So go see her. Isn't there an address?

178
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,820
Why should I go? I don't want to
care about her business.

179
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,340
It's not caring about her
business, it's human nature.

180
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,320
Why was your mother so caring to me?

181
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,530
Towards someone not related to her.

182
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,910
At that time, I was still naive.

183
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,620
And I know nothing about life in this world.

184
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,070
If I didn't have your mother,

185
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,790
it'd be impossible for me and Hwa Joon
to set foot in this world.

186
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,610
I'm different from my mother.

187
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,710
But you are your mother's son.

188
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,500
I'm getting off work now!

189
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,650
How can I be the same as my mother?

190
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,590
Thank you again for today, unni.

191
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,340
Today, your body might feel a bit sore.

192
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,880
It'll get better in two or three days.

193
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,740
Please give me a cup of Americano.

194
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,350
I seem like a stalker, right?

195
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,890
I'm not a stalker.

196
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,860
But because I'd seem like a stalker,

197
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,660
I initially planned to leave right away.

198
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,920
But I saw you working here again
and I was so happy.

199
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,320
A cup of Americano is 4000 won.

200
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,970
Doctor.

201
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,260
Yes?

202
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,980
Doctor, at that time,
you've tried your best.

203
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,410
It's not your fault.

204
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,170
You don't need to come again.

205
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,030
I know.

206
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,180
As a doctor, I always try to do my best.

207
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,440
When Yi Kyung came to see me,

208
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,240
I've been married for only 3 months.

209
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,780
At the happiest point of my life,

210
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,080
I met a person in depths of despair.

211
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,910
After being married for 3 years,

212
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,670
I caused a car accident due to weariness.

213
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,330
My wife died before my eyes,

214
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,460
and I survived.

215
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,590
Only then did I learn that
if we don't personally experience it,

216
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,790
we cannot fathom the feeling.

217
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,650
If you never forget...
then just grieve for him.

218
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,410
That's what I'm doing.

219
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,370
Even though my wife would hate me,

220
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,530
but I still grieve for her.

221
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,930
<i>There's still 32 days, 4 hours
and 59 minutes left.</i>

222
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,420
<i>I'm fed up with you!</i>

223
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,770
Song Yi Kyung. Song Yi Soo?

224
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,560
Is he unni's younger brother?

225
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,950
Unni was scalded?

226
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,400
Why is this unni so uncaring of herself?

227
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:55,640
From 11:00 am to 3:00 pm,
just pay me the minimum wage.

228
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,550
4320 won an hour.

229
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,440
The standard working hours
is from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm.

230
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,600
When I need you, the time will be extended.

231
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,210
The salary will be calculated
according to labor rules.

232
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,230
Didn't you let me go back and think
about my salary and working conditions?

233
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,960
It's just for you to think about it.

234
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,520
I never said that I'll follow your demands.

235
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,820
The one who asked me to work here was you.

236
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,200
The one who agreed to do it
was Song Yi Kyung, right?

237
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,520
I don't plan to spend all my time here.

238
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,110
In the afternoons, there are
matters I must attend to.

239
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,890
I only need someone who
can do the house chores well.

240
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:31,990
Four hours a day for this house is enough.

241
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,460
Yesterday, did you boil the bath towels?

242
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,420
Why do I have to boil the towels?

243
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,670
Boiling the towels and under wears
are the most basic tasks.

244
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,430
Cleaning the kitchen, mopping the floors,

245
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,820
dusting windows and under the bed...

246
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,140
did you do all those chores?

247
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,580
Plus ironing clothes, buying groceries,
cooking for dinner,

248
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,680
and also the clothes
that needs to be hand washed.

249
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,610
All of those need to be hand washed?

250
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,050
I know how to use the vacuum
and the washing machine, too!

251
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,050
I ironed the clothes yesterday.

252
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,670
I checked the fridge,
and I intended to make fried rice...

253
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,940
You're really laughable, Song Yi Kyung.

254
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,140
I thought the worker that Kang fired
was pitiful so I offered you the job.

255
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,610
I don't want an arrogant, hourly
worker like you. What should I do?

256
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,590
Then, why don't you just fire me?

257
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,520
I can't bring myself to do it
because you seem so pitiful.

258
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,140
I personally asked you to work for me.

259
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,480
<i>Are you trying to force me to say I quit?</i>

260
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,320
<i>But I need to find the document.</i>

261
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,790
Forget it. I'm not doing your housework.

262
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,480
Your ID.

263
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,420
Last time the factory's equipment
was replaced.

264
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,400
The financial statement
have not been submitted, yet?

265
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,400
Yes, President.

266
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,400
I got it.

267
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,400
Then I'm leaving first.

268
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,680
Yesterday, Seo Woo gave Ji Hyun a manicure.

269
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,080
Yes.

270
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,780
Look at her.

271
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,560
She left without seeing Ji Hyun.

272
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,240
In Jung is probably busy.
She seems very tired.

273
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,390
She has always been a complicated child.

274
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,980
Just because she didn't see Ji Hyun,
you're picking on her weaknesses?

275
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,270
They've been together since grade 7.
How many years has it been?

276
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,980
She wasn't like this when she was little.

277
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:19,960
The older she gets, the more
she became inscrutable.

278
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,160
She's completely different from Seo Woo.

279
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,760
In Jung.

280
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,360
- Oppa, where...
- I'm in a meeting with Director Jung.

281
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,170
I'll call you when it's over.

282
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,700
Hello.

283
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,280
I'm from the President's office.

284
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,740
Did Manager Kang go out for lunch?

285
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:43,000
He's feeling a bit sick. He cancelled
his afternoon schedule and went home.

286
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,000
Went home?

287
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,240
Oh you came!

288
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,160
Kang's in the office, right?

289
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,060
What brings you here?

290
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,640
I passed by on the way from
settling the accounts at the hospital.

291
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,350
Is Shin Ji Hyun still doing well?

292
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,860
Is your work going smoothly?

293
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,600
Isn't your first meeting with the
design team the day after tomorrow?

294
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,190
Didn't I say that I'm not going?

295
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,710
What are you talking about? Manager Kang
always thought you're participating.

296
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,190
You're really not going to
design district A?

297
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,650
Would I joke around with business matters?

298
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:35,940
If you're not doing it, then you
have to pass it on properly.

299
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,610
Every time Manager Kang comes over
and you refuse to do it,

300
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,670
- he thought you were just in a bad mood.
- Bad mood?

301
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,580
Have you ever stopped by the
company or Manager Kang's house,

302
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,750
and formally told him that
you're not doing it?

303
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,040
Do I have to do that?

304
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,120
Can't I just mention it when I see him?

305
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,830
Then, what should we do?

306
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:55,390
Manager Kang was over fatigued,
he left early.

307
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,240
Left early?

308
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,240
If you're really not going to do it,

309
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,560
Why not quickly finish it. At least,
turn in a sketch of the design's concept.

310
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,590
Then there'll be a reference.

311
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,590
Then, is hyung at home right now?

312
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,310
Probably. I heard he went home to rest.

313
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,870
Is it my imagination?

314
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,310
Exactly where could he be hiding it?

315
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,270
He wouldn't have something like a
secret safe like in the movies, right?

316
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,110
He probably wouldn't have
a secret safe, right?

317
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,080
If he did have one, then in this room...

318
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,720
You scared me!

319
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,780
I didn't know you were in here.

320
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,770
If I wasn't in the living room,
of course I'm in the bedroom.

321
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,520
Did you forget something?

322
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,980
This a special ointment for burns.

323
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,130
After you disinfect the area, apply it.

324
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,590
You came just to give me this?

325
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,080
So what?

326
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,600
The burn isn't that serious.

327
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,310
I already said I'm fine!

328
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,780
Well, I don't think it's okay!

329
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,830
I don't have the heart to watch
someone with a burn on their hand

330
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,030
wash dishes and clean, so I brought it.

331
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,640
Don't be fussy.

332
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:11,590
I understand. So please let go of your
hand and give me the ointment.

333
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,020
What's that smell?

334
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,350
Be careful.

335
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,770
Hyung, you knew I came?

336
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,770
Kang.

337
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,120
Is the smoke detector broken?

338
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,110
Why did you come?

339
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,940
Hyung, right now...

340
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,700
This...

341
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,210
Song, why are you here?

342
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,020
Why are you at Min Ho hyung's house?

343
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,050
I'm working here.

344
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,880
Is there something wrong?

345
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,680
It's you who fired her.

346
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,900
She got fired because of me
so I offered her a job.

347
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,350
The new job you talked about is
at Min Ho hyung's house?

348
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,270
Are you crazy?!

349
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,270
Calm down, Kang.

350
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,890
Hyung, what are you doing?

351
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,690
Come out immediately.

352
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,120
Why are you getting angry?

353
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,260
The person who fired me was you.

354
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,200
You don't know why I fired you?

355
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,010
This is my friend's fiance's house.

356
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,320
- What does that have to do with me?
- What?

357
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,390
President's friend's fiance's house,

358
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,090
What does that have to do with me?

359
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,330
I take back firing you. Okay?!

360
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,440
Quit this job immediately.

361
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,480
- Kang.
- I want to stay here.

362
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,740
What?

363
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,400
<i>I'm sorry, Kang. I can't go back.</i>

364
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,150
<i>I still have unfinished business here.</i>

365
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,500
What did you just say?

366
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,350
I said that I will stay here.

367
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,680
Was it like this all along?

368
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,360
You've been pretending it wasn't,
but in the end it is?

369
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,660
Look, look!

370
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,440
That hurts!

371
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,510
It's so funny!

372
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,540
That hurts!

373
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,390
Hey, Ma Soon Jung! Ki Joon Hee!

374
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,380
Manager...

375
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,110
Not saying a word is the scariest.

376
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,340
<i>I'll say it firmly one last time.</i>

377
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:55,070
<i>I have absolutely no interest in
your friend's fiance.</i>

378
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,600
<i>Why isn't he leaving?</i>

379
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,460
No, I just hate you.

380
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,460
I want to stay here.

381
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,150
What are you doing tonight? I'm going
to buy some groceries, give me money.

382
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,600
Let's go out to eat.

383
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,320
What?

384
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,820
You can't get your hands wet.

385
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,810
You can come back after you eat.
I'll leave after I clean up.

386
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:10,060
Didn't you agree to work until 6?
If I need it, the time will be extended.

387
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:14,240
<i>Why do you want to go out
for dinner with me?</i>

388
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,990
Hello.

389
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,420
Manager Kang, you haven't come
for such a long time.

390
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,920
I'm too busy with work.
You're still doing well?

391
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,620
Of course. Please sit over here.

392
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,770
- I'll have two bowls.
- I got it.

393
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,340
<i>I've never been to this shop before.</i>

394
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,310
You seem to be a regular customer.

395
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,990
My mom likes this restaurant.
So do I.

396
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,380
It's the only restaurant we ate at.

397
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,760
You probably came here too
with your fiance, right?

398
00:36:00,795 --> 00:36:02,070
It's okay to come here
with someone else?

399
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,740
Not all women are the same.

400
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,950
I don't want to be treated by you
as any other woman.

401
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,550
Then, why didn't you leave with Kang?

402
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,030
He re-offered you the job.

403
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:13,890
My not going with him doesn't mean
I'm interested in you.

404
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:20,090
I don't believe an impoverished woman's
and poor people's pride.

405
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,700
I heard that you desperately
begged Kang to get the job.

406
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,730
But with me, that's not going to work.

407
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,850
<i>Bear it. I have to bear with it.</i>

408
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,960
<i>I can't be fired.</i>

409
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,780
The tone you use to talk to me,
you think that's respectful?

410
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,770
That's impolite.

411
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,300
I understand.

412
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,950
Starting tomorrow,
use this to open the door.

413
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,510
Here's your wages for today's hard work.
The overtime pay is included, as well.

414
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,060
I'm going back.

415
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,630
Get in the car. I'll take you.

416
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,830
No need.

417
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:17,190
An hourly worker must act
like an hourly worker?

418
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:20,300
Why ask me to get in the car?
Why go out to eat with an hourly worker?

419
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:23,430
And it's even a place he frequents
with his mom.

420
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,450
<i>He never took me to that place before.</i>

421
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,380
<i>A place that holds memories of his mom...</i>

422
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,690
<i>and he took Song Yi Kyung there?</i>

423
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,840
Get in the car.

424
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,710
You look like you're in pain.
Get in the car.

425
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,010
I'll give you a ride.

426
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,010
This a special ointment for burns.

427
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,720
After you disinfect the area, apply it.

428
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,590
Kang Min Ho.

429
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,590
What is this?

430
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,560
Kang Min Ho...

431
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,990
Do you like Song Yi Kyung?

432
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,980
No... you like me?

433
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,310
Unni, does it make sense?

434
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,630
Kang Min Ho likes me.

435
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,450
No.

436
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,740
Does he like unni?

437
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,400
Unni, let's go together!

438
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,130
Why isn't he here yet?

439
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,110
Hey! What kind of scheduler are you?
How come you have no sense of time?

440
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,930
You're lucky that I even came to meet you.
What are you fussing about?

441
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,660
What do you mean by lucky
that you came to meet me?

442
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,510
What's your reason for calling me here?

443
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,050
Didn't you tell me not to ask you
to go to unni's house?

444
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,960
Here, there...

445
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,410
Say it quickly. There's a club party
today in Hongdae.

446
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,460
Help me find Song Yi Soo.

447
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,750
What is Song Yi Soo?

448
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,020
What, is it like boiled mushroom water?

449
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,850
It's a person's name.
Song, Yi, Soo.

450
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,690
I think he's that unni's brother.

451
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,550
That woman's brother?

452
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,230
Find out whether Song Yi Soo
is actually dead or alive,

453
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,230
where he is, what he does. Huh?

454
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,160
Why should I look into such trivial matters?

455
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:34,440
I'm a scheduler! I'm not a help center.

456
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,950
I just want to help that unni.

457
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,950
The one who wants to help should do it.

458
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,630
My time is more precious than gold.
Why do you always drag me along?

459
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,110
Do you know how many things I
have to do in the remaining 33 days?

460
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,200
There's a long list of death scheduled.

461
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,680
So you can't do it?

462
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,990
It's not that I can't do it.
I refuse to do it.

463
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,990
Coldhearted bastard!

464
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,510
What?

465
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,510
Weren't you once a person, too?

466
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:08,930
When you were still living,
you must've loved somebody.

467
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,170
Of course, you would.

468
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,320
Or I could've never
had the chance to love anyone.

469
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,950
I died too early.

470
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,780
I was 23.

471
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,610
Shin Ji Hyun.

472
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,910
Have you tried dying at 23?

473
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,990
What do you think it would
feel like, to die at 23?

474
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,630
Why wouldn't I know?

475
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,150
It feels terrible.

476
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,960
No. It feels incomplete.

477
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,480
Crazily incomplete.

478
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,530
I just felt terrible.

479
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,270
Someone else feels incomplete. While
you enjoyed to your heart's content,

480
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:59,310
until you got backstabbed,
then you felt terrible.

481
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,700
Didn't you say that you don't
remember anything at all?

482
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:05,010
Even though my memories disappeared,

483
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,060
but the feeling is still the same.

484
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:12,390
Do you think I'm being a scheduler
for nothing?

485
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,130
I died too young, so I want to experience
the life I didn't get to live.

486
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,200
You're really too pitiful.

487
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:25,230
If you know, then don't ask me again to
use my precious time on a woman like that.

488
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,200
In the future, don't call me
to a place with this woman.

489
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:16,160
<i>Then, is hyung at home right now?</i>

490
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,450
<i>Probably. I heard he went home to rest.</i>

491
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,400
<i>Since I'm already out,
I'll go to his place and check him out.</i>

492
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,840
I really don't know what's going on.

493
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,890
Oppa was never late before.

494
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,710
What's the matter?

495
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,100
When are you going to Kang's pub today?

496
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,100
Isn't today Kang's birthday?

497
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,950
You're not going?

498
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,260
Didn't you buy a present for Kang?

499
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,410
I'll go with you. Decide on a time.

500
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,080
I have to go if I bought a present?
Forget it.

501
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:55,650
I can give it to him anytime, later on.

502
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,650
When is later?

503
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,310
You rarely go to Kang's place by yourself,

504
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:03,540
and you're going to wait until his
birthday's over to give him the present?

505
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:06,400
Before, Ji Hyun always went with me.

506
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,500
Since Ji Hyun can't, I'll go with you.

507
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,070
Don't be angry.

508
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,530
Because of Ji Hyun's situation,
do we have to live like this?

509
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:20,330
Ji Hyun's already in that state,

510
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:23,310
yet wanting to celebrate Kang's
birthday, makes me feel apologetic.

511
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,900
If you continue like this,

512
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:30,500
what are you going to do in case
Kang finds a woman he likes?

513
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:32,150
Does Kang have a woman?

514
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,380
No matter how much he pretends
to have no interest in women,

515
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,590
can he not have one forever?

516
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:15,310
What's the correct password?

517
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,540
Mr. Park.

518
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,840
How's the investigation about
World Spa company coming along?

519
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:22,840
It's almost complete.

520
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,650
Please expedite the process.

521
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,130
Just a second.

522
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,090
Yes?

523
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,820
Min Ho, the president is on his way
to the company right now.

524
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:39,430
Right now?

525
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,680
He didn't contact me at all.

526
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,700
He's leaving now.
I'm hanging up.

527
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:57,110
President. Why come without
telling us beforehand?

528
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,060
Ask Director Song and the *CFO
to come here. (*Chief Financial Officer)

529
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:01,870
Yes, President.

530
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,000
<i>[He called for Director Song and the CFO.]</i>

531
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:23,540
What's going on?

532
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,760
You came.

533
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,760
How come you're here?

534
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,200
I heard you came to the company.
I wanted to greet you.

535
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,960
What's the matter?

536
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:40,850
Since when did the President report
his hours to the Planning Section Chief?

537
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,890
I'm sorry.

538
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,090
I was just going see Ji Hyun
at the hospital.

539
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:49,780
If you're going to the hospital too,
I'll take you there.

540
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:51,450
Okay then.

541
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,490
You've worked hard.

542
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:55,200
Please take care.

543
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:11,080
<i>Why did he suddenly come to the company?</i>

544
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,190
<i>He didn't mention a word to me.</i>

545
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,560
<i>Why did he call for Director Song
and the CFO?</i>

546
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:29,890
- You came together?
- Yes.

547
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,980
We were both at the company
so we came together.

548
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:36,340
Is there anything going on at the company?

549
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,370
You, go...

550
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,420
Honey.

551
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,170
Honey?

552
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,170
Honey...

553
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,720
What's the matter with him?

554
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,790
Why is father like that?

555
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,740
Did he eat something bad for lunch?

556
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,000
Father.

557
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,040
Wait a moment.

558
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,570
<i>I'm saying, why are you so stubborn?
Why don't you listen to what I say?</i>

559
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,240
This is my life!

560
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,240
Why do I have to listen to you?

561
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,480
Hey. Hey, Il Shik.

562
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,620
Brain tumor?

563
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:54,280
Father... has a brain tumor?

564
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:56,720
That good for nothing fellow.

565
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,260
He was discovered this easily.

566
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,460
I... also... this...

567
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,680
How is his condition?

568
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,160
Tell me his precise condition right now.

569
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,510
Here, near the skull, he has a brain tumor.

570
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,010
Because it's fairly big, it increased the
*intracranial pressure. (*in or into the skull)

571
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:18,945
It is compressing the brain tissue.

572
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,350
We can't tell what will happen after that.

573
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,940
The surgery will be difficult
to perform, as well.

574
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:27,640
It can be considered as very
critical right now.

575
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:31,250
Then, not even surgery can help?

576
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,250
Even though the success rate is low,

577
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:35,690
That is the only treatment of choice.

578
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,140
President Shin won't listen.

579
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,530
Why?

580
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:44,960
Originally, he planned to undergo
surgery 2 days after the wedding.

581
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,780
After what happened to Ji Hyun,

582
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,860
he said that before Ji Hyun wakes up,

583
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,960
he definitely won't go for surgery.
He's so stubborn.

584
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:59,080
Assessing Ji Hyun from a medical standpoint,
the chance of her waking up is low, too.

585
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:02,180
Then, if he doesn't decide
to undergo surgery,

586
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:04,690
what will happen?

587
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,120
He won't be able to live much longer.

588
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:29,860
If the password is 6 digits, then
there are 1 million combinations.

589
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,080
If there are 1 million combinations...

590
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:37,840
Then, I have to enter 32,258 a day...

591
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,160
No, I can't do that.

592
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:42,100
I have to try other methods.

593
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:47,480
There's only 32 days left.

594
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,450
Seaweed soup?

595
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,910
This is his first birthday since
returning from America.

596
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:59,940
Of course, you have to make seaweed soup.

597
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,600
Of course!

598
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:04,600
I'm pretty good at all the other soups...

599
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:07,290
It's just seaweed soup
that I can't make well.

600
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,870
Then, I'll make the seaweed soup,

601
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:13,730
and honey can help prepare some side dishes.

602
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,110
Okay.

603
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:20,610
Oh, ahjumma!

604
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,490
Yi Kyung, why are you here?

605
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,670
What are you doing?

606
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,300
Go eat.

607
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,070
I don't want to.

608
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,650
You have to eat. Get up.

609
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:22,930
Whose birthday is it today?

610
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,520
Isn't it your birthday?

611
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:27,510
My birthday?

612
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:30,230
You're young, why can't you even
remember your own birthday?

613
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,150
You have to be grateful for being born.

614
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,280
Otherwise, how would you know
that it's your birthday?

615
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:44,270
You even prepared this?

616
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,620
- What?
- Mussels.

617
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,790
There's mussels in the seaweed soup.

618
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:50,460
Did my mom tell you?

619
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,600
No.

620
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,070
Then, how did you know to make it like this?

621
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,280
Oh this... Song Yi Kyung brought this.

622
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,320
Song Yi Kyung?
How did she know it's my birthday?

623
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,780
She made too much so she brought it.

624
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:25,380
What? What's the matter?

625
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:28,850
This is seaweed soup and a boxed lunch.

626
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:31,480
I already said it's enough,
but you still came to school.

627
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,790
It's your birthday.
You have to eat seaweed soup.

628
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,920
Which of my birthday did I eat seaweed soup?
It's not necessary!

629
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,180
Mom was busy at that time...

630
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:43,040
I added what you like to eat.

631
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:45,250
Eat it, my son.

632
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,030
No.

633
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,850
Go inside. Mom's leaving.

634
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:57,620
Kang!

635
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,140
Kang!

636
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:10,190
I can make this bottle cap disappear.

637
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:13,300
If anyone can guess where it went,

638
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,440
I'll invite that person to eat
ddeokbokki.

639
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:16,850
Here! Try it, try it!

640
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,450
- Me!
- Me!

641
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,430
Han Kang, you're not playing?

642
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:23,430
It's so childish.

643
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,860
Hey, if you don't have self confidence,
then say it.

644
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,360
You think I don't know your little tricks?

645
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:33,160
Little tricks?

646
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:37,060
Hey, you guys don't have to guess.
Han Kang.

647
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,240
Let's have a one on one competition.

648
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:46,190
The loser will have to do
whatever the winner says.

649
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:51,370
<i>- Do it!
- Hurry up.</i>

650
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,080
Why? You're not confident?

651
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:56,780
If you don't, then forget it.

652
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:59,080
Who says I don't have confidence?
Let's do it.

653
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,670
Then, let's start!

654
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:08,060
Look carefully.

655
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,190
Han Kang! Take a guess!

656
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,730
Hey, put down your arm.
Isn't it hidden in your sleeve?

657
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,750
Is it?

658
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,970
<i>- It's not there.
- Where did it go?</i>

659
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:55,260
You lost.

660
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:57,350
Follow me!

661
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,580
Follow her. Follow her.

662
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:06,230
Follow her.

663
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:10,560
What is this?

664
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:13,250
Let's eat together.

665
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,290
Eat.

666
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,270
Not eating?

667
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,390
Did you see everything?

668
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,970
- Mmmm! It tastes delicious.
- I asked if you saw everything!

669
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:41,310
You're the size of a mountain
but you treat your mom like that?

670
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,680
Hey!

671
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,510
Don't you dare try.

672
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:48,010
School... no. At every street you pass,

673
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:51,490
I'll make them post your picture so that
you'll be so embarrassed to raise your head.

674
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,490
You think I'll eat this if you threaten me?

675
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,490
Who do you think you are, silly girl?!

676
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:58,200
I'm not threatening, I'm negotiating.
Dummy!

677
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:00,080
- You're as dumb as a donkey.
- What?

678
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,700
Will you eat this, or allow them to do that?

679
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:06,210
Turn around.

680
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,780
- What?
- Turn around while I eat!

681
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,110
Okay.

682
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,700
Don't leave one drop, eat all of it!

683
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,210
Han Kang?

684
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:50,210
Why can't I hear sounds of you eating?

685
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,310
Silly girl, so impatient.

686
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,070
You're finished?

687
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:03,600
Let me see.

688
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:18,220
Hey, Kang! What's the matter?

689
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,140
Ahjussi.

690
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,150
Did Song Yi Kyung really bring this over?

691
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,150
She did. Why?

692
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:30,380
The person who fired me was you.

693
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,480
I want to stay here.

694
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:39,460
I'm going crazy.
Why is this woman like this?

695
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:44,120
Are you angry because she made it at
Manager Kang's home and brought it?

696
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:45,390
It's not that.

697
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,120
Yi Kyung knew you'd react like this.
She told me not to tell you.

698
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:51,060
- She said to not tell me?
- Well, I can't lie.

699
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:53,280
But what's the matter?

700
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:55,180
It's my mom's seaweed soup.

701
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:57,600
What?

702
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:03,860
Ahjussi, I don't know what this
feeling in my heart is.

703
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:07,290
Is it because of Shin Ji Hyun,
or Song Yi Kyung?

704
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:11,040
I don't know.

705
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:18,540
Oh? It's Kang.

706
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,890
Kang!

707
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:25,140
Where is he going?

708
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,780
Kang.

709
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,820
Kang.

710
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:19,090
Song Yi Kyung!

711
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,060
Song Yi Kyung!

712
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,640
Song Yi Kyung!

713
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:31,880
Song Yi Kyung!

714
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:43,970
What... What's the matter?

715
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,470
I'll just ask one thing.

716
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:49,910
Song, why are you here?

717
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:53,250
That... I said it yesterday.

718
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:57,090
If you're staying here because of your
interest in Kang Min Ho, then say it.

719
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,150
And this will be the end of it.

720
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,800
If it's not...
then stop coming here doing this!
