How about my house?

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,811
Don't you urgently need money?

5
00:00:11,204 --> 00:00:14,021
Come work at my house.
I'll give you money.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,113
You should know how to clean.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,609
Do you know how to cook?

8
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:26,218
First... how much are you
going to pay me?

9
00:00:28,624 --> 00:00:30,574
Will you pay in advance?

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,828
Are you agreeing
to work at my house?

11
00:00:33,953 --> 00:00:35,746
You asked me to.

12
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:38,896
I'll do it.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,009
I can work from 11 A.M.

14
00:00:43,212 --> 00:00:45,182
How long will you need me?

15
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,871
Why... did you say you'll do it?

16
00:00:49,336 --> 00:00:51,916
Didn't you say you hated me
without reason?

17
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,081
You must have never suffered
because of money.

18
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:57,774
People who need money,
look at the wages to be paid...

19
00:00:57,948 --> 00:01:00,113
not the person.

20
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,395
By any chance,

21
00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:07,025

I would refuse?

Don't you go to work

25
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:28,723

33

Yes, Director Jung.

34
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:56,660

<i>Let's see, Song Yi Kyung...</i>

39
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:17,283
<i>how long will you be able
to stare at me with that look.</i>

40
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,690
<i>That scornful gaze.</i>

41
00:02:21,076 --> 00:02:24,664
<i>No one has ever looked
at me that way before.</i>

42
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:27,279
<i>So, you want to squash me...</i>

43

<i>Oppa, were you really that
kind of person?</i>

44

<i>You're someone who can't take it
if you're ignored even slightly.</i>

45
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:48,992
It seems like she's really
not coming back this time.

46
00:02:49,149 --> 00:02:51,918
- Huh?
- Miss Song Yi Kyung really left.

47
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:54,053
I sent her away.

48
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,027
Won't you regret it?

49
00:02:56,247 --> 00:02:57,877
Why would I?

50
00:02:58,087 --> 00:03:00,855
Ahjussi, why are you
asking me this?

51
00:03:00,902 --> 00:03:02,475
What is the reason?

52
00:03:02,537 --> 00:03:03,694
So you really don't care?

53
00:03:03,804 --> 00:03:05,019
Of course!

54
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:06,860
Oh! That's good.

55
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:09,409
What do you mean? What?

56
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:11,677
Do you remember that man who
saw this building

57
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,755
then asked you to
design for him?

58
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,310
Professor Oh or something,
from Saeyoung University.

59
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,688
- Ahjussi, perhaps...
- Yes.

60
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:21,581
He was asking if you were busy
these days, I told him you weren't.

61
00:03:21,627 --> 00:03:23,114
Why aren't I busy?!

62
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:25,736
You said you weren't going to work
on the Hae Mi Do Resort!

63
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:27,689
<i>You rejected the opportunity
to work on that project.</i>

So you'll sell wine and
pasta for the rest of your life?

65
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:32,642
Is that why you took over your
mother's restaurant?

66
00:03:33,222 --> 00:03:34,210
Who said I will?

67
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:35,428
Then why so aggressive?

00:03:35,444 --> 00:03:38,034

design buildings.

72
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:02,472
Did they leave already?

<i>Today I'm busy,

"It's not something urgent, right?"

91
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:50,626
It IS urgent!

00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:54,206

00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:14,506
I'm so hungry!

98
00:05:21,202 --> 00:05:24,128
How can I be so hungry
when my stomach hurts?

99
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:44,796
The serving's too small.

100
00:05:57,619 --> 00:06:01,030
When I was working at Kang's,
I never needed to pay for food.

108
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,691
Unni should rest so that
she can go to work.

109
00:07:20,158 --> 00:07:22,288
She must be tired.

110
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:28,899
This is a design we got from another
company after you initially declined.

111
00:07:29,086 --> 00:07:30,574
But, it's no good, don't you think?

112
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:32,469
<i>This design is very boring.</i>

113
00:07:32,546 --> 00:07:34,553
But this is a design for an arcade
shopping center.

114
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:37,102
Didn't you say you wanted a
gallery and cafe built?

115
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,449
And I don't think this was the location
you were looking at either.

116
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:43,304
Land prices in this neighborhood
were cheaper, so that's why we bought it.

117
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:45,798
The first floor will have the
gallery and coffee shop.

118
00:07:45,876 --> 00:07:49,876
Above that, up to the fifth floor
will be rental housing.

119
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:52,084
If you build a five-story
building here,

120
00:07:52,147 --> 00:07:54,534
the houses over there
won't receive any sunlight.

121
00:07:54,582 --> 00:07:55,858
What will you do
about that?

122
00:07:55,861 --> 00:07:59,055
After a few years,
they'll be gone anyways.

123
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:01,731
We can just give them
some money.

124
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,916
- What?
- Ah!

125
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,694
This place... is going
to be re-zoned.

126
00:08:06,757 --> 00:08:10,197
In the future,
that's going to be a highway.

127
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,800
Then I guess you can
just work off of these plans.

128
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,424
I'm just really
not satisfied with it.

129
00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:15,831
You must not know this,

130
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,438
but I don't design
shopping centers.

131
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,048
I didn't ask to meet
because of that,

132
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:21,303
but for the design award
you got in America?

133
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,559
That was a design for
an Art museum.

134
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,048
It doesn't matter.

135
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,891
We'll just use the
exterior design.

136
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:28,365
And your design fee...

137
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,368
will be twice as much.

138
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:31,179
Double?

139
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:33,149
Ah, a young man

140
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,318
dealing so hard.

141
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:37,577
Okay. Let's make it triple.

142
00:08:37,746 --> 00:08:38,483
Ahjussi!

143
00:08:38,515 --> 00:08:39,274
Ahjussi?

144
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:41,250
I hope your business
is successful,

145
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:43,270
but don't ever call me again!

146
00:08:44,903 --> 00:08:47,513
Don't even think about building
five-stories here.

147
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:09,242
Unni, why did you
wake up already?

148
00:09:09,552 --> 00:09:12,382
It's still a long way till
12 o'clock.

149
00:09:14,713 --> 00:09:17,773
Unni, I'm sorry.
It hurt a lot, right?

150
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:22,864
But it's so weird.
I usually eat two bowls of it.

151
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:24,830
So, why did I
get stomach pains?

152
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:27,771
How long did I sleep.

153
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:38,841
Unni!

154
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:45,629
Why is she like that?

155
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,980
People have no
conscience these days.

156
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:13,442
Yesterday, I was so sick that I
couldn't come to work.

157
00:10:13,577 --> 00:10:16,107
I won't be late tonight.

158
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:19,517
What?

159
00:10:24,176 --> 00:10:26,469
Where did she go without even
wearing her jacket?

160
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:28,990
I have to go out to
see my dad.

161
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,090
Unni! Where did you go to?

162
00:10:38,694 --> 00:10:40,643
Please don't eat instant Ramen.

163
00:10:40,729 --> 00:10:45,139
Until your body gets better,
I'll eat's lot of porridge for you.

164
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,660
I'll take the medicine
as well.

165
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,459
Sleeping again?

166
00:11:04,438 --> 00:11:06,668
It must be so hard.

167
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:18,584
<i>I'm just saying don't
take it to heart</i>

169
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:23,605
Never...

170
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:27,639
you must never take it
to heart.

171
00:11:28,311 --> 00:11:30,546
Because I'm really okay.

172
00:11:30,844 --> 00:11:32,012
Aigoo!

173
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:36,840
<i>Just the thought of you
being my friend</i>

174
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:39,750
is already enough.

175
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:44,357
Why did she say such
useless things?

176
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:48,459
Ahh!

177
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:55,698
<i>- 38 days, 3 hours, and 29 minutes.
- What to do, what to do, what to do?!</i>

178
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:57,585
Unni!

179
00:11:57,647 --> 00:12:00,453
Just because you slept all night
why can't you sleep now?

180
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:03,707
I have to go to
Kang Min Ho's house!

181
00:12:23,752 --> 00:12:25,361
Absence without notice?

182
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:28,357
Then, she lost her job at the
convenience store because of me?

183
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:29,811
That's right!

184
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,558
Fired for being absent just
one day? How inconsiderate.

185
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,913
Then, what are you
going to do?

186
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,879
I am already late.

187
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:42,002
It's all your fault that
Song Yi Kyung's been fired.

188
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,137
But you said I could use her body
for 14 hours every day.

189
00:12:45,175 --> 00:12:48,358
Ah, this is the reason why
I don't like humans!

190
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,529
They're absolutely shameless,
shameless!

191
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:51,759
Hey, Shin Ji Hyun.

192
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:56,247
This girl's body is hers,
and you're just borrowing it.

193
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:58,991
I know that too, but...

194
00:12:59,052 --> 00:13:03,221
Your 14 hours were given according
to Song Yi Kyung's schedule.

195
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:05,087
<i>So the life of the person whose
body is being borrowed</i>

196
00:13:05,238 --> 00:13:07,456
is more important than
the 49day traveler!

197
00:13:07,524 --> 00:13:10,237
That's right. I know that.

198
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:11,515
You know?

199
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:13,524
I know!

200
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:18,012
<i>So, if she doesn't sleep,</i>

201
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,726
then I can't do
anything either?

202
00:13:19,863 --> 00:13:20,568
Bingo!

203
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:21,978
How can there be
such a thing?!

204
00:13:22,036 --> 00:13:24,276
Who do you think
you're yelling at?!

205
00:13:24,364 --> 00:13:26,447
Didn't I say not to
make things hard for her?

206
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:29,317
Whose fault is that she got sick
and lost her job?

207
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:30,876
Was it me?!

208
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:33,933
I was wrong.

209
00:13:36,406 --> 00:13:38,214
<i>Regardless or whether you're
a human or a soul,</i>

210
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:40,618
what comes around goes around.

211
00:13:40,796 --> 00:13:44,199
I get it... sir.

212
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:45,795
Hey. If you know,

213
00:13:45,874 --> 00:13:48,429
then wait patiently until she
finally wakes up.

214
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:49,965
I'm leaving.

215
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:54,435
Oh! What to do, what to do,
what to do?!

216
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:57,273
Song Ki Young is not in the
right state of mind,

217
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:59,508
<i>I am not sure when she will
snap out of it.</i>

218
00:13:59,665 --> 00:14:02,965
So, it wouldn't be a good idea to
wander about.

219
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:17,567
Come here tomorrow by 11 A.M.

220
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:20,416
Don't you go to work
before 11 A.M.?

221
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:55,047
Are you just getting to
work now?

222
00:14:58,235 --> 00:15:00,944
I just went to the hospital
to get something approved.

223
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:02,754
You're working hard.

224
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:09,215
You haven't eat yet, right?

225
00:15:10,295 --> 00:15:12,396
I'll just give this to the director
and be right back.

226
00:15:12,514 --> 00:15:14,604
Let's eat lunch together, Oppa.

227
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:16,725
We're at work.

228
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:25,605
There's only the two
of us here.

229
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:27,412
No one can hear us,

230
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,856
but you're still worried about
the CCTV?

231
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:32,925
This what we've
always done.

232
00:15:56,965 --> 00:15:58,839
<i>Why do you keep
doing this?</i>

233
00:15:58,996 --> 00:16:00,468
Mom...

234
00:16:00,665 --> 00:16:02,626
If I have 3 part time jobs,

235
00:16:02,732 --> 00:16:05,350
when will I have time I study
for my exam?

236
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:09,538
Did I get any money from you
or dad to go to school?

237
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,780
Tell Oppa to do
whatever he wants!

238
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,520
Hurry!

239
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:15,269
Get her in, hurry,
quickly!

240
00:16:15,302 --> 00:16:16,517
Shove her in,
get her in.

241
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:17,861
Hey!

242
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,370
Stop, stop!

243
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,470
Aigoo, this girl!

244
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,199
<i>Hey! Let's go quietly,</i>

245
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:44,661
<i>Do you want to get
hurt more?</i>

246
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,329
We've hit the jackpot, man.

247
00:16:46,498 --> 00:16:50,958
Just drive, punk.
Before someone reports us.

248
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:53,401
<i>Be quiet!</i>

249
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,880
Hey, come here!

250
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,668
Get out!
Hurry, hurry!

251
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:32,822
Are you okay?

252
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:34,625
Are you hurt somewhere?

253
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:37,968
No, no, no, no.

254
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:41,835
No, I'm not on the same side
as those guys.

255
00:18:00,854 --> 00:18:03,870
Instead of hiding this from your parents
to prevent them from getting upset,

256
00:18:03,963 --> 00:18:06,143
how about
going home earlier?

257
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:09,175
<i>At night there's no one
around this neighborhood.</i>

258
00:18:09,984 --> 00:18:12,258
Do you live here?

259
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:15,516
About once a week,
I go through here on a hike.

260
00:18:15,624 --> 00:18:19,074
The best way to exercise...
is hiking.

261
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,000
You can drink it now.

262
00:18:32,693 --> 00:18:34,533
Thank you.

263
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,380
Here. Clean your face
and hands.

264
00:18:49,664 --> 00:18:51,344
And your lips.

265
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:57,697
Ah... Thank you.

266
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:27,929
Go on inside.

267
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:30,780
Where should I contact you

268
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:33,270
to repay this gratitude?

269
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,096
You want me to give my
contact details

270
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,144
to someone
I don't even know?

271
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:43,180
Oh... I'm Shin In Jung.

272
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:46,227
Shin In Jung.

273
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:49,728
Give me your cell phone.

274
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:04,371
Go on in now.

275
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,382
Excuse me...

276
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:19,409
What name should I
save on my phone?

277
00:20:19,641 --> 00:20:22,611
Oh, Kang Min Ho.

278
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,340
Oppa!

279
00:20:47,352 --> 00:20:49,689
I knew you would
be like this.

280
00:20:50,995 --> 00:20:52,365
<i>See?</i>

281
00:20:52,671 --> 00:20:54,723
That's why I didn't give you
an opportunity.

282
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:56,691
I thought you'd weaken.

283
00:20:57,643 --> 00:20:59,534
What's the matter,
Director Kang?

284
00:20:59,611 --> 00:21:02,203
Don't look at me with
those sad eyes...

285
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:04,049
It hurts.

286
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:06,653
<i>We're going to meet
Director Jung</i>

287
00:21:06,752 --> 00:21:08,930
and finish up the
new contract.

288
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:14,120
In about 3 or 4 days...
it will be all over.

289
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:16,439
You know what that
means, right?

290
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,128
I know.

291
00:21:19,284 --> 00:21:22,804
After we finish that up,
let's meet without worries.

292
00:21:23,698 --> 00:21:25,446
Is that what you
came to say?

293
00:21:25,581 --> 00:21:28,641
Until the most important step
is finalised

294
00:21:28,782 --> 00:21:30,764
give me a break.

295
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,176
President Shin.

296
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:47,602
You're really not going
to have surgery?

297
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,881
It's not that I'm not doing it, I can't.

298
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,549
Don't you know that the longer you
put it off, the worse it gets?

299
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,220
If I have the surgery,

300
00:21:55,102 --> 00:21:59,001
would there be 100 percent chance that
I would live? Trying to scare me...

301
00:21:59,096 --> 00:22:00,589
If you continue with this...

302
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:03,374
I will meet with Jung Suk.

303
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:05,765
What?

304
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,559
Why would you need to
meet with my wife?!

305
00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:10,679
Don't say a word.

306
00:22:11,424 --> 00:22:13,963
She's only just hanging on
for Ji Hyun.

307
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,396
There is no hope for
your daughter,

308
00:22:16,577 --> 00:22:18,918
so don't wait any longer.

309
00:22:19,111 --> 00:22:22,769
At least you can still be alive
to take care of your wife!

310
00:22:24,184 --> 00:22:25,754
What did you just say?

311
00:22:25,851 --> 00:22:27,625
President Shin!

312
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:30,268
What is this? Are you God?

313
00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:32,181
Who are you...

314
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,489
to tell me to give up
on my daughter!

315
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,190
I am your friend, punk!

316
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:40,379
- Oh!
- See?

317
00:22:40,572 --> 00:22:42,161
Please just get surgery, hmm?

318
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:45,109
It's just because you're making
my temper flare, punk!

319
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,870
What did Dr. Jo say?

320
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,662
Nothing much.

321
00:22:54,771 --> 00:22:56,572
Are you still massaging
her legs?

322
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,414
They say that when you are
lying down for so long,

323
00:22:59,473 --> 00:23:02,344
it's hard to move
when you wake up.

324
00:23:03,261 --> 00:23:06,044
Tell me what did
Dr. Jo say?

325
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,159
Hearing that your daughter complimented you,
you're all energy and vigor, my wife.

326
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,770
What did you talk with Dr. Jo about?
Why do you keep changing the subject?

327
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:18,157
Why? Was it
something bad?

328
00:23:18,348 --> 00:23:22,959
I got all of this talk...
'Hey, don't stay here and go to work.'

329
00:23:23,018 --> 00:23:25,377
That's what I keep
telling you.

330
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:28,254
So later, I'll go into
the office for a while.

331
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,573
You won't listen to
your wife,

332
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,981
but you'll listen to
your friend?

333
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,340
Ji Hyun...
look at your father.

334
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,420
<i>But honey,</i>

335
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,984
Min Ho...
what should we do?

336
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,119
What do you mean?

337
00:23:43,158 --> 00:23:45,347
The engagement.

338
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,487
<i>We don't know
when they will marry.</i>

339
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:53,149
Shouldn't we... be the ones
to say something first?

340
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:56,915
He thinks of Ji Hyun
without us asking him to.

341
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,445
He wanted to quit the company
to sit here keeping vigil.

342
00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:02,483
I barely talked him
out of it.

343
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,173
Really?

344
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:09,159
He comes...
to see Ji Hyun everyday.

345
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:15,134
They say when you're
too happy,

346
00:24:15,232 --> 00:24:17,416
<i>the ghosts will get jealous.</i>

347
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,430
It must be true.

348
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:27,998
This business... we finished this
a long time ago,

349
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:30,856
<i>just unable to register it.</i>

350
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:33,667
I'm sorry.
It's all because of me.

351
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,342
I'm just glad it didn't drag on
for too long a time.

352
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:39,172
<i>It's all done.</i>

353
00:24:39,581 --> 00:24:41,522
- Check it.
- Yes.

354
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:43,231
When the registration
is completed,

355
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:45,370
your work will be done.

356
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,328
All that's left is our part.

357
00:24:47,345 --> 00:24:50,012
Are you preparing as
originally planned?

358
00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:52,587
We had planned to drop the bomb
right before your wedding.

359
00:24:52,738 --> 00:24:54,516
We finished preparing
long ago.

360
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:55,148
{\a6}[ Land Purchase Contract ]

361
00:24:55,242 --> 00:24:56,556
[ Contract 1 ]
[ 5,000,000,000 Won ]

362
00:24:57,678 --> 00:24:58,929
[ Contract 2 ]
[ 8,000,000,000 Won ]

363
00:25:01,423 --> 00:25:02,646
It's correct.

364
00:25:04,307 --> 00:25:05,744
Immediately start the
registration work.

365
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:07,413
Yes, sir.

366
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:47,599
Having a rich mother and father,
you seem like their son.

367
00:25:52,737 --> 00:25:55,127
What's up this time?

368
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:59,131
Why are you looking so
pathetically miserable today?

369
00:26:04,051 --> 00:26:06,111
You fired Song Yi Kyung.

370
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,449
Yeah.

371
00:26:08,783 --> 00:26:10,513
Then, she's not
coming back here?

372
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,370
I said I fired her.

373
00:26:15,728 --> 00:26:18,457
Do you feel guilty because
I fired her?

374
00:26:18,631 --> 00:26:20,603
No. You did well.

375
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,523
Now I don't have to
be misunderstood by you.

376
00:26:22,757 --> 00:26:24,615
Hyung, I'm sorry if I
misunderstood you...

377
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:25,415
<i>Forget it.</i>

378
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,511
Let's talk about work.

379
00:26:26,531 --> 00:26:27,568
About work?

380
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:31,466
The A-area is the most important
private quarters at Hae Mi Do Resort.

381
00:26:31,714 --> 00:26:33,480
It has a distinctive concept.

382
00:26:33,524 --> 00:26:36,098
<i>That is why I need your
unique imagination.</i>

383
00:26:36,337 --> 00:26:38,265
Something that's not
a typical design.

384
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:39,471
Hyung...

385
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,649
I know you're mad at me
but do it for Ji Hyun,

386
00:26:41,794 --> 00:26:43,210
design the A-area.

387
00:26:46,053 --> 00:26:48,346
I trust you'll attend the
next meeting. I'm leaving.

388
00:26:48,452 --> 00:26:49,786
Sit down.

389
00:26:51,821 --> 00:26:52,966
You're leaving already?

390
00:26:53,043 --> 00:26:54,381
Yes, I'm busy.

391
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:09,533
The atmosphere between you two

392
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:11,523
seems to be getting worse
than before.

393
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,046
I guess it is.

394
00:27:13,144 --> 00:27:16,128
Because of him, I was able to
endure my time in America.

395
00:27:17,534 --> 00:27:19,702
Was I being too sensitive?

396
00:27:20,064 --> 00:27:22,173
Maybe you were
or maybe not.

397
00:27:22,232 --> 00:27:24,200
Ahjussi, you are
no longer a monk.

398
00:27:24,453 --> 00:27:26,731
So stop pretending
to be one.

399
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,017
Some people's hearts can be known
from just one glimpse.

400
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,741
As well as hearts that can be filled
with no boundaries or barriers.

401
00:27:51,023 --> 00:27:52,462
Kang Min Ho...

402
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,730
What did you want to confirm
by coming here?

403
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,877
<i>While borrowing
Song Yi Kyung's body,</i>

404
00:28:15,964 --> 00:28:18,910
<i>what do you think would happen
if she wakes up outside?</i>

405
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,144
She just fell asleep.

406
00:28:21,315 --> 00:28:23,354
I doubt she'll wake up soon.

407
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,502
<i>Once she figures you out,</i>

408
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,992
<i>you think she'll let you
continue using her body?</i>

409
00:28:46,821 --> 00:28:48,984
Song Yi Kyung unni...

410
00:28:49,515 --> 00:28:51,925
why exactly do you
live like this?

411
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:56,345
You have such a beautiful face.
Aren't you wasting it?

412
00:29:00,502 --> 00:29:02,445
<i>It's been 5 years for you.</i>

413
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:05,194
Living like this for 5 years...
you can't do that.

414
00:29:07,082 --> 00:29:10,554
That's right!
This unni has a reason.

415
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,832
<i>I don't like a doctor
who knows of that time.</i>

416
00:29:14,894 --> 00:29:17,967
What exactly happened?

417
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,529
Aren't there any
photo albums or something?

418
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:43,284
What's going on
with me?

419
00:29:43,444 --> 00:29:44,520
Father!

420
00:30:59,989 --> 00:31:01,580
<i>You told me to collect
the rent from you today.</i>

421
00:31:01,614 --> 00:31:02,378
<i>Why are you hiding
from me?</i>

422
00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:05,097
Just now you ran away
when you saw me!

423
00:31:23,711 --> 00:31:25,528
Unni, what's the matter?

424
00:31:34,534 --> 00:31:35,768
<i>I...</i>

425
00:31:36,413 --> 00:31:38,005
<i>What's happening
to me?</i>

426
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,410
Oh, what should I do
if she finds out?

427
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,439
What should I do?

428
00:32:06,438 --> 00:32:08,083
I'm tired of this!

429
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:12,842
Unni, what did you say?

430
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:16,272
Tired! Tired!

431
00:32:28,373 --> 00:32:30,386
What are you doing?

432
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,991
Unni, what are you
thinking?

433
00:32:46,438 --> 00:32:48,032
Unni, don't!

434
00:32:51,739 --> 00:32:53,207
You can't die!

435
00:32:58,218 --> 00:33:00,385
Hey! Hey! Hey!

436
00:33:00,574 --> 00:33:02,322
<i>Why? Why? Why?!</i>

437
00:33:02,853 --> 00:33:04,825
Hey, come quick!

438
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:06,943
Unni is going to commit suicide.

439
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,545
She.. she wants to
commit suicide.

440
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,568
Come stop her!

441
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,460
Again?

442
00:33:14,436 --> 00:33:15,273
Leave her alone!

443
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:16,153
What?

444
00:33:16,241 --> 00:33:18,499
<i>Whether she commits suicide
or not, is her choice.</i>

445
00:33:18,694 --> 00:33:20,538
It's not for us to
interfere in.

446
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:22,677
Don't be like this,
come now.

447
00:33:22,756 --> 00:33:24,767
Please, I beg you!

448
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:26,968
I have a schedule,
so I'm waiting.

449
00:33:27,192 --> 00:33:28,175
Even if I wanted to go,

450
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:29,447
I can't!

451
00:33:30,794 --> 00:33:32,223
Really!

452
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:37,853
What's Song Yi Kyung up to?

453
00:33:40,378 --> 00:33:43,641
Unni... don't be like this.

454
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:45,750
Don't be like this.

455
00:33:45,847 --> 00:33:49,041
I was wrong.
So please, I beg you.

456
00:33:49,066 --> 00:33:51,470
Please, Unni!

457
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:01,733
Yi Kyung,

458
00:34:03,154 --> 00:34:04,642
Yi Kyung!

459
00:34:06,386 --> 00:34:07,872
<i>Don't do anything silly.</i>

460
00:34:08,052 --> 00:34:10,742
<i>- Unni, someone's coming.
- Open the door.</i>

461
00:34:12,082 --> 00:34:14,067
Someone came to see you.

462
00:34:14,368 --> 00:34:15,860
<i>Yi Kyung!</i>

463
00:34:17,425 --> 00:34:18,910
<i>Yi Kyung!</i>

464
00:34:21,855 --> 00:34:23,805
<i>I'll break it down
if you don't open up!</i>

465
00:34:24,655 --> 00:34:26,085
<i>Yi Kyung!</i>

466
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:28,431
<i>Yi Kyung!</i>

467
00:34:34,481 --> 00:34:36,009
<i>Yi Kyung!</i>

468
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,849
<i>Yi Kyung!</i>

469
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:45,720
<i>Yi Kyung!</i>

470
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:54,563
What do you want?!

471
00:34:54,685 --> 00:34:55,842
Because you
weren't at work,

472
00:34:55,904 --> 00:34:58,568
I didn't know for sure
if you were safe or not.

473
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:04,061
I'm here...
to return this.

474
00:35:11,216 --> 00:35:14,072
It seemed pretty
important to you.

475
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,473
Doctor.

476
00:35:20,862 --> 00:35:22,765
Why are you
acting this way?

477
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:27,628
Because I want to see that
you're doing well.

478
00:35:28,968 --> 00:35:30,634
You're okay, right?

479
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,403
Fortunately...

480
00:35:38,195 --> 00:35:39,996
this has not withered.

481
00:35:51,224 --> 00:35:52,409
<i>Also...</i>

<i>Just hang on to it.</i>

Can't you even do this?

00:36:26,598 --> 00:36:30,003
<i>{\a6}I am all choked up</i>

489
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:32,899

<i>{\a6}I'm all by myself. So just stop it"</i>

494
00:36:48,037 --> 00:36:54,384
<i>{\a6}I told myself that again and again.</i>

<i>Unni, thank you.</i>

00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:11,679
Really, thank you for
not dying.

499
00:37:14,551 --> 00:37:16,282
But...

500
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,660
Although I don't know why
you wanted to die,

501
00:37:24,295 --> 00:37:26,936
I envy you.

502
00:37:30,745 --> 00:37:32,594
Unni, you...

503
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:39,378
don't know how precious it is
to have a body, do you?

504
00:37:42,655 --> 00:37:45,468
<i>Being able to touch...</i>

505
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:48,778
And feel warmth...

506
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:57,582
You have a voice
that someone else can hear...

507
00:38:00,002 --> 00:38:03,731
and have people to
hear your voice.

508
00:38:09,816 --> 00:38:12,500
You can look at someone...

509
00:38:13,051 --> 00:38:15,962
and smile together.

510

<i>You need to be strong</i>

<i>{\a6}...because after a little while</i>

517

<i>{\a6}I will eventually forget it</i>

<i>{\a6}Just like how the ice melts</i>

00:38:40,783 --> 00:38:45,474

00:52:00,209 --> 00:52:02,609
Plans? With who?

697
00:52:02,906 --> 00:52:04,146
Just plans.

698
00:52:05,027 --> 00:52:06,196
What time is the appointment?

699
00:52:06,372 --> 00:52:08,030
I have no time
to go to the hospital.

700
00:52:08,176 --> 00:52:09,986
Do you have a new boyfriend?

701
00:52:11,782 --> 00:52:15,217
I guessed right!
I knew it would be like this!

702
00:52:15,343 --> 00:52:19,138
No wonder at times you're dazed
and on occasions you sigh.

703
00:52:20,289 --> 00:52:22,490
I thought it was
because of Ji Hyun.

704
00:52:22,611 --> 00:52:23,975
Who is it?

705
00:52:25,134 --> 00:52:25,977
Later.

706
00:52:26,168 --> 00:52:28,015
What "later"?

707
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:31,077
Who is it, who?
What does he do?

708
00:52:31,301 --> 00:52:32,747
Later.

709
00:52:33,427 --> 00:52:34,961
Bad girl.

710
00:52:35,387 --> 00:52:38,118
Let's go see Ji Hyun together,
just for a quick visit.

711
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,087
If she knows you have
a person you like...

712
00:52:40,161 --> 00:52:42,438
Ji Hyun might wake up
because of happiness.

713
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,893
Stop speaking nonsense.

714
00:52:43,983 --> 00:52:44,790
Why?

715
00:52:44,884 --> 00:52:45,458
Hey!

716
00:52:45,575 --> 00:52:47,101
At Ji Hyun's
engagement ceremony

717
00:52:47,124 --> 00:52:48,799
didn't she say she wanted to
introduce Min Ho's friend...

718
00:52:48,807 --> 00:52:50,902
Don't bring up Ji Hyun again.

719
00:52:51,241 --> 00:52:54,192
Shin In Jung, why are you
being like this?

720
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:57,045
Ji Hyun is not everything
in our lives.

721
00:52:57,386 --> 00:52:59,513
All you talk about is
Ji Hyun, Ji Hyun.

722
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,852
I would be better if
you stopped.

723
00:53:01,939 --> 00:53:04,804
Is our relationship with Ji Hyun
an ordinary one?

724
00:53:05,457 --> 00:53:07,755
What if Ji Hyun stays
like that forever...

725
00:53:07,931 --> 00:53:11,149
will you continue to go to the hospital,
2 or 3 times a week?

726
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,706
<i>Because you feel sorry towards Ji Hyun,</i>

727
00:53:12,768 --> 00:53:16,012
you won't watch movies, eat tasty food,
date or get married?

728
00:53:16,099 --> 00:53:16,922
Just because of Ji Hyun?

729
00:53:16,959 --> 00:53:19,381
Her accident happened only days ago,
but you're already acting like this?!

730
00:53:19,406 --> 00:53:21,379
It's a matter of time.

731
00:53:22,028 --> 00:53:24,632
I don't know how long
you will continue to be like this.

732
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,065
But, I will do as I wish.

733
00:53:54,813 --> 00:53:57,073
[ 24th December, 2006 ]

734
00:53:57,927 --> 00:53:59,660
2006?

735
00:54:02,002 --> 00:54:04,211
They started meeting
back then?

736
00:54:09,862 --> 00:54:11,543
[ 16th July, 2007 ]

737
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:18,745
Before Min Ho Oppa went to
study abroad.

738
00:54:23,596 --> 00:54:25,789
Kang Min Ho, Shin In Jung...

739
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,959
you guys are really...

740
00:54:29,592 --> 00:54:31,333
too much.

741
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:51,642
Okay, I'll wait
until you come back.

742
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:14,600
So, he still uses my birthday
as his password?

743
00:55:20,139 --> 00:55:21,755
Ah, seriously.

744
00:55:22,126 --> 00:55:23,984
Ahjussi, why are you
like this?

745
00:55:24,137 --> 00:55:25,803
Come. Stretch your body.

746
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,452
Ahjussi, am I a child?

747
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,639
Why are you
treating me like one?

748
00:55:28,689 --> 00:55:29,987
Are you a bean sprout?!

749
00:55:30,224 --> 00:55:31,484
For 3 days, you have not
been out in the sun.

750
00:55:31,546 --> 00:55:33,473
Indoors all the time,
a young person like you!

751
00:55:33,942 --> 00:55:35,697
I come out
once in a while.

752
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,582
Stretch your body now.

753
00:55:44,165 --> 00:55:45,580
Oh my goodness!

754
00:55:48,785 --> 00:55:53,396
Ah, come on, and stretch this way
Good, stretch...

755
00:55:53,498 --> 00:55:58,545
Like this... Stre-et-tch...
and reach.

756
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,370
What are you doing
out here?

757
00:56:03,743 --> 00:56:04,369
Who is this?

758
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:06,990
Manager!
How are you?

759
00:56:08,336 --> 00:56:09,722
We haven't met for days!

760
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,215
Exactly.

761
00:56:11,728 --> 00:56:14,185
Oh! It feels like I'm back
in my hometown.

762
00:56:14,372 --> 00:56:16,346
Why... why are you
here again?

763
00:56:16,622 --> 00:56:19,354
I came to get my
last day's wages.

764
00:56:19,466 --> 00:56:21,607
Did you work on
your last day?

765
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,859
Oh, I didn't.

766
00:56:24,262 --> 00:56:26,351
I'm not here to cling to you
and ask for work.

767
00:56:26,475 --> 00:56:28,197
Then why did you come?

768
00:56:28,873 --> 00:56:32,103
Hey, Han Kang.
What do I look like to you?

769
00:56:32,225 --> 00:56:33,443
A part-time worker?

770
00:56:33,494 --> 00:56:34,340
Han Kang?

771
00:56:34,425 --> 00:56:35,097
That's right!

772
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,013
I don't have to address you as President
since I'm not your employee.

773
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:40,646
I came to eat pasta
as a customer.

774
00:56:40,807 --> 00:56:42,797
A paying and
eating customer.

775
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,884
<i>"I'm sorry, customer."</i>

776
00:56:45,117 --> 00:56:45,898
That's what you'd say.

777
00:56:45,984 --> 00:56:47,077
Ahjussi!

778
00:56:47,483 --> 00:56:49,149
It's alright, Manager.

779
00:56:49,224 --> 00:56:51,766
It's not like his bad
personality is unknown.

780
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,850
Oh, have you found
a new job?

781
00:56:59,043 --> 00:57:00,409
Of course!

782
00:57:00,603 --> 00:57:02,500
<i>If you haven't found one,
just say it.</i>

783
00:57:02,612 --> 00:57:04,135
I'll help you look for one.

784
00:57:04,222 --> 00:57:06,161
I really did find one.

785
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,748
The pay is higher and I can
go out whenever I want.

786
00:57:09,871 --> 00:57:12,902
There's only one person to serve,
so it's not tiring at all.

787
00:57:13,014 --> 00:57:14,673
You look tired.

788
00:57:14,755 --> 00:57:16,966
It's really not a
tiring job.

789
00:57:18,721 --> 00:57:21,171
It looks like you're
tired emotionally.

790
00:57:22,896 --> 00:57:26,831
Emotionally...
it's more comfortable here.

791
00:57:34,108 --> 00:57:35,379
Don't accept her money.

792
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:36,613
Ah, yes.

793
00:57:44,269 --> 00:57:46,209
Yi Kyung,
you'll come again?

794
00:57:46,308 --> 00:57:50,877
Of course. Maybe I'll come by
every 3 days to eat pasta.

795
00:57:51,212 --> 00:57:52,986
I have paid.

796
00:57:53,364 --> 00:57:55,176
Didn't I say not to
accept any money?!

797
00:57:56,326 --> 00:57:58,279
Am I a beggar? Why won't you
accept my money?

798
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,181
How can I
accept your money?

799
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:04,096
You fired me, and now you're
going to pretend to care?

800
00:58:04,805 --> 00:58:05,905
And also,

801
00:58:06,055 --> 00:58:08,301
I'm going to tell you this
one last time.

802
00:58:08,425 --> 00:58:12,244
I have absolutely no interest at all
in your friend's fiance.

803
00:58:12,389 --> 00:58:13,952
Are you feeling alright?

804
00:58:15,277 --> 00:58:17,942
Is your new work...
really okay?

805
00:58:23,487 --> 00:58:24,901
That's good then.

806
00:58:27,029 --> 00:58:28,459
I'm leaving.

807
00:58:36,796 --> 00:58:38,538
It's a nightclub!

808
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:40,309
It's high paying...

809
00:58:40,448 --> 00:58:41,730
<i>freedom to leave whenever.</i>

810
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:43,293
<i>You only have
to serve one guest...</i>

811
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:45,527
and you can wander
during the day.

812
00:58:45,738 --> 00:58:47,568
<i>It sounds like it.</i>

813
00:58:47,753 --> 00:58:50,649
Oh no, what do we do about
our Yi Kyung?

814
00:58:50,759 --> 00:58:52,263

go to you...</i>

This is the list of suppliers that
Hyuk San Industries has contacted.

Good work. But Jin Young...

840
01:00:57,257 --> 01:01:01,691
Didn't we agree... for you not to come
to my office during work hours?

841
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:03,755
You are the boss' chauffeur.

842

Sorry.

01:01:31,802 --> 01:01:33,302
Is there some problem

<i>No, but right now
I'm a little busy.</i>

<i>to celebrate the
closing of the deal.</i>

849

Did you forget?

No, I didn't.

851
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:49,691

It's still going on?

856

Weren't you
picking me up at 6?

857
01:02:02,965 --> 01:02:04,278
Because this is
a public issue,

858
01:02:04,342 --> 01:02:06,177
the problem is
kind of important.

859

Either way, having dinner tonight
will be difficult.

860

Why did the meeting
have to be today?

861
01:02:15,323 --> 01:02:17,098
What about your dinner?

862
01:02:17,524 --> 01:02:19,764
You'll probably just have a sandwich
during the meeting?

for tomorrow night.
