Episode 17

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,206
Ji Hyun!

5
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:17,879
Ji Hyun!

6
00:00:20,274 --> 00:00:22,416
You rascal, where
in the world are you?

7
00:00:23,392 --> 00:00:36,942
<i>{\a6}It's already been a day
since you've left</i>

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,650
Hello?

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,260
Excuse me, could I find out
the destination of a taxi?

10
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:46,330
<i>{\a6}I'm afraid I'll yearn for you again</i>

11
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:53,144
<i>{\a6}So I stand all night long
absent-mindedly</i>

12
00:00:54,751 --> 00:01:03,108
<i>{\a6}A day, as another day goes by...</i>

13
00:01:04,574 --> 00:01:07,312
Where do you think Song Yi Kyung
was going to run after her like that?

14
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:10,672
Seoul Station.

15
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:12,542
Seoul Station.

16
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:17,655
My wife has gone to die
after finding out she's terminally ill!

17
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:19,677
<i>That's why she left her handphone!</i>

18
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:22,265
If she finds out I'm going after her
and she gets out off of the taxi,

19
00:01:22,327 --> 00:01:24,017
are you going to take responsibility?

20
00:01:24,104 --> 00:01:25,834
It's a matter of life and death.

21
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,459
Please help me.

22
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:34,439
<i>{\a6}I know I'm unable to do it</i>

23
00:01:35,172 --> 00:01:41,322
<i>{\a6}I'm someone who cannot live without you</i>

24
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:50,646
<i>{\a6}I'm unable to walk even just one step</i>

25
00:01:50,722 --> 00:01:57,682
<i>{\a6}Not even one step</i>

26
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:52,495
[ Seoul -> Pusan ]

27
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:05,827
<i>{\a6}I know I'm unable to do it</i>

28
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,708
<i>{\a6}I'm someone who cannot live without you</i>

29
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:13,036
Okay.

30
00:02:13,204 --> 00:02:17,019
With sunbae's permission,
this is the most I can do for you.

31
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,740
Thanks.

32
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:20,942
Hey!

33
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,922
Yi Kyung... bring her back.

34
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:33,105
<i>{\a6}Choked up, I call out for you</i>

35
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:43,201
<i>{\a6}Without you in my heart, I cry out for you</i>

36
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:51,143
<i>{\a6}I know I'm unable to do it, I know</i>

37
00:02:51,323 --> 00:02:59,282
<i>{\a6}I'm someone who cannot live without you</i>

38
00:02:59,424 --> 00:03:06,793
<i>{\a6}I'm unable to walk even just one step</i>

39
00:03:07,057 --> 00:03:14,965
<i>{\a6}Not even one step</i>

40
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:20,396
<i>{\a6}I...</i>

41
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,679
Song Yi Kyung.

42
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,520
<i>I'm sorry to surprise you</i>

43
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:39,203
but I'm in such a hurry.

44
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:41,645
There's something I have to ask you.

45
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:47,999
My name is Han Kang.

46
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,459
How...?

47
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:53,197
I saw you getting in a taxi
in front of your house.

48
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,852
There's a person I have to find,
but I need you in order to...

49
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,029
<i>I don't know how to
explain this, but...</i>

50
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:04,228
I need you in order to
find that person.

51
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,933
I know.

52
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,909
What?

53
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,239
I know all about what you're saying,
and who you're looking for.

54
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:12,089
You know? How?

55
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:13,911
That person is not here.

56
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,589
She didn't come with me.

57
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,518
Then where is she?

58
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,093
I don't know.

59
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,940
<i>I'm leaving because of her.</i>

60
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,049
<i>You can't.</i>

61
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:26,863
Ji Hyun...

62
00:04:26,924 --> 00:04:29,309
without you
she can't live again.

63
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:31,918
I can't find her
and she can't find me either.

64
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,219
<i>You know this!</i>

65
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,480
<i>You're quite a strange person.</i>

66
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,829
Why do I have to live
so a ghost can borrow my body?

67
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,793
Unni, I was wrong.

68
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:47,720
<i>I'm sorry I got angry at you.</i>

69
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:49,582
I want...

70
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:53,906
it's because I wanted
to live so badly.

71
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,699
<i>Just for 10 days...</i>

72
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,539
<i>Please endure it for
just 10 more days.</i>

73
00:05:09,347 --> 00:05:12,033
If you don't help me,

74
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:16,505
I won't be able to do anything.

75
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:21,528
<i>I'll... have to die.</i>

76
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:28,310
What's wrong?

77
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:31,728
Is... Ji Hyun here?

78
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,899
Ji Hyun's... here?

79
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,940
<i>Ten days...</i>

80
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:39,824
I might die, but

81
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:41,910
just for 10 days...

82
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,298
<i>Just for 10 days...</i>

83
00:05:45,503 --> 00:05:49,090
I might be able to live.

84
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,068
<i>If not for 10 days then just one.</i>

85
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,290
Let me see my
mom and dad once more.

86
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,503
<i>And to this friend...</i>

87
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:13,865
let me have the chance to say
what I want to before I leave.

88
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,069
<i>Aigoo. With such a handsome man
running after her,</i>

89
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,629
why did she live like this?

90
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:30,939
A man?

91
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:36,729
After she left, some guy came looking for her
making such a ruckus.

92
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,480
You're certain they didn't meet?

93
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:41,553
Aigoo, might as well been waving
to a departing bus.

94
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:44,540
Ah! But when are you
going to move in?

95
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,535
I'll take care of the cleaning,
so you should leave.

96
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,117
Oh, all right.

97
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:02,800
<i>Then...</i>

98
00:07:02,878 --> 00:07:06,993
you're saying that you can see
and hear what she says?

99
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:10,903
Until now, it wasn't
always like that.

100
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:14,024
But today... it is.

101
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,756
You must have been
very shocked.

102
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,238
No.

103
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:19,883
During that time your friend's
memories and feelings

104
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,178
were left behind in me.

105
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:25,261
The situations she faced...

106
00:07:25,364 --> 00:07:27,083
the events she encountered...

107
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,009
To some extent I'm aware of them.

108
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:32,757
So you're saying you share...
Ji Hyun's memories?

109
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,095
Yes, but not all.

110
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:39,733
But if you don't go to Busan,

111
00:07:39,815 --> 00:07:42,096
Min Ho might come
looking for you.

112
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:44,103
Will it be okay to
go back to your house?

113
00:07:44,207 --> 00:07:46,077
<i>You said he made you leave.</i>

114
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:49,569
Ask your friend later,
if you want to know all the specifics.

115
00:07:49,632 --> 00:07:51,392
How is Ji Hyun right now?

116
00:07:51,611 --> 00:07:53,162
Is she better?

117
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:55,661
Tell him I'm okay.

118
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:59,252
She said to say... she's okay.

119
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:07,859
<i>Congratulations...</i>

120
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,192
for returning safely.

121
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:12,739
Kang has found out
about my relationship with Unni.

122
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,239
What do I do from
now on?

123
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,488
You just continue on
as you have.

124
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,889
Looks like this guy...

125
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:20,850
<i>will do well on his own.</i>

126
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:22,747
But Unni...

127
00:08:22,998 --> 00:08:24,874
can see me...

128
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:26,439
and hear my voice.

129
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:28,428
There have been
rare cases of that happening.

130
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:31,040
There are certain souls that
communicate well.

131
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,221
It's because...

132
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:35,269
she's particularly pure.

133
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,429
From now on don't think about
wandering around in the daytime.

134
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:42,729
You don't have the strength
to endure it.

135
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:46,689
Let's continue with this
discussion later.

136
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,156
I can't do it anymore
because of my nerves.

137
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,589
You said...
you were Miss Ji Hyun?

138
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:08,098
You... can drop the
formal speech.

139
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:11,884
First off, I'm sorry...

140
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:14,828
you had the accident
because of me.

141
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,219
I was the one
who wanted to die.

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,649
I was too rash.

143
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:23,433
It's not all your fault.

144
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:29,099
If I hadn't taken off my seatbelt,
while reaching for my handphone...

145
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,930
it wouldn't have come to this.

146
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:35,489
Is that why... you came to me?

147
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:37,960
That's not really why.

148
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:42,239
The specifics are a secret
so I can't tell you why...

149
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:45,760
I was sent to you.

150
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,459
You said 10 days, right?

151
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,819
The number of days left to you.

152
00:09:52,489 --> 00:09:53,868
Yes.

153
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:58,049
As a way to pay my debt,

154
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:00,619
I'll just let only you

155
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,388
use my body for 10 days.

156
00:10:03,849 --> 00:10:07,259
Just for... me?

157
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:15,941
What are they talking about
for so long?

158
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:48,775
You've waited a long time.

159
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,919
It's really good to see you.

160
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,049
Me too.

161
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,239
Drop the formalities, Song.

162
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:56,470
Didn't we decide
not to use honorifics?

163
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:59,508
No, I just...
as we always...

164
00:10:59,788 --> 00:11:02,509
If I relax I may make
a mistake.

165
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:05,049
All right, then...

166
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:08,587
Instead, let's shake hands.

167
00:11:19,229 --> 00:11:21,183
Thank you.

168
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,421
What have you decided to do?

169
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:29,428
Today there's something
I need to do at home.

170
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:31,439
I'll go to work tomorrow.

171
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:33,701
Did you decide to stay here?

172
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,399
Yes, I have.

173
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,599
Okay, it must've been very tiring
and difficult today.

174
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,859
I'll meet the landlord
and deal with the room issue.

175
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:41,970
Go rest.

176
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,819
No, you don't need to do that.

177
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,758
I can take care of it so go.

178
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,309
And how are you going to do that?

179
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:49,989
Hurry and go.

180
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,149
You go in first.

181
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:54,689
I want to see you leave first.

182
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,059
In return, don't forget to call me
tomorrow morning.

183
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:00,442
I'll come pick you up.

184
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:04,437
{\a6}<i>"I love you" ~</i>

185
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:08,304
{\a6}<i>are words I keep
shouting in my heart</i>

186
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,227
{\a6}<i>"I love you" ~</i>

187
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,554
{\a6}<i>are words I can only
whisper behind your back</i>

188
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:17,154
Thanks, Kang.

189
00:12:15,646 --> 00:12:19,146
{\a6}<i>"I love you" ~</i>

190
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:23,877
{\a6}<i>are words that I can't speak
for fear they'll disappear</i>

191
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:29,995
{\a6}<i>I love you so much it scares me</i>

192
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:33,986
{\a6}<i>"I love you"</i>

193
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:41,887
You came!

194
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:43,149
You see, unni...

195
00:12:43,152 --> 00:12:44,542
I know.

196
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:46,202
You know?

197
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:47,314
Then....

198
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:49,841
I can do as unni said?

199
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:52,299
They say it's all up to
the body donor.

200
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:56,046
What's up with these people
not looking after the donor more?!

201
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:56,976
That's right.

202
00:12:57,055 --> 00:12:59,749
You're on the side of
the body donor.

203
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,259
You're putting in whatever
you want!

204
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:05,026
No, no I'm not!

205
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,514
You need to finish the 49 days
without any accidents,

206
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:12,391
so that I can complete my
5 year tenure and get my wish.

207
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:14,821
Would I only be worrying
about Yi Kyung?

208
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,356
Do you know how thankful I am to you,
for bringing Yi Kyung back?

209
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:23,099
Right, you probably don't care
whether I die in 10 days or not.

210
00:13:23,206 --> 00:13:26,906
I can't do anything about it but
that doesn't mean I'm not invested.

211
00:13:27,394 --> 00:13:29,911
Even dead you can't
get rid of friendships.

212
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:34,184
Then... you're saying
I can do as unni said, right?

213
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:37,527
To show your thanks,
I guess you can buy Korean beef.

214
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:40,170
Hey! I can't spend more than
50,000 won!

215
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:43,825
There are no seasonings at unni's house
so that's why I'm buying all this!

216
00:13:44,405 --> 00:13:46,314
What is this? You're like a kid.
Put this back.

217
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:47,491
No!

218
00:13:50,584 --> 00:13:52,954
Let's just eat this today.

219
00:13:53,203 --> 00:13:55,713
What are you doing?
I'm Shin Ji Hyun!

220
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,279
Ah, really!

221
00:13:58,743 --> 00:13:59,808
This sunbae!

222
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:04,289
I'm positive she picked me
to test my patience as a Scheduler.

223
00:14:05,205 --> 00:14:06,708
Oh, that's right.

224
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:09,637
And you, Shin Ji Hyun....

225
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:13,689
you're acting like you're shooting
a melodrama with Han Kang.

226
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,448
Any touching with Yi Kyung's body
is strictly forbidden!

227
00:14:17,668 --> 00:14:20,832
Know that I barely allow you
to touch hands!

228
00:14:21,481 --> 00:14:23,080
What's with that expression?

229
00:14:23,118 --> 00:14:24,790
You want to do it?!

230
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,599
Don't I just need
to get permission from unni?

231
00:14:29,353 --> 00:14:30,873
Permission?!

232
00:15:08,686 --> 00:15:10,445
<i>While living with you,</i>

233
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:14,018
<i>the one thing I wanted to do most
was to have you eat well.</i>

234
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:16,854
<i>Although it's a waste,
I threw out the instant ramen.</i>

235
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:19,611
<i>Thank you so much for today.</i>

236
00:16:11,245 --> 00:16:13,941
Here, eat the spinach too.

237
00:16:33,071 --> 00:16:35,360
The soup is a bit salty, right?

238
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:37,106
It's okay.

239
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,587
It's okay if you eat a lot.

240
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:42,771
During all this time I prepared
your body to accept food.

241
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,842
Song Yi Soo... told me
which side dishes to make.

242
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,459
Don't be surprised.

243
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:56,408
You've talked before
about Yi Soo too, right?

244
00:16:57,126 --> 00:16:59,210
Yi Soo...

245
00:16:59,591 --> 00:17:01,462
How do you know him?

246
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,155
In order to...

247
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:06,923
meet you again he's been
waiting for 5 years.

248
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:09,398
What are you...

249
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:11,679
Yi Soo died 5 years ago.

250
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,862
You're a living person
so you probably don't know,

251
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:17,265
like me in front of you,

252
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:21,710
there are a lot of things
beyond this world that are inexplicable.

253
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,729
<i>You pretended you
liked spinach,</i>

254
00:17:26,885 --> 00:17:29,805
<i>but you made it
for Song Yi Soo to eat.</i>

255
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:34,678
<i>And Vienna sausages were something
you liked but were too expensive to eat.</i>

256
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:38,237
So he said, he pretended
to like them.

257
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,581
1... 2... 3... 4.

258
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:35,840
All right.

259
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,600
<i>While earning our tuition and
living expenses,</i>

260
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:44,008
<i>we attended classes.</i>

261
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,729
<i>Yi Soo...</i>

262
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:56,399
<i>also earned my tuition</i>

263
00:18:56,645 --> 00:18:59,225
<i>and barely got any sleep.</i>

264
00:19:01,972 --> 00:19:05,414
<i>But, he always packed lunch.</i>

265
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:15,262
<i>Ta-da!</i>

266
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:17,750
Song Yi Soo, are you really
going to continue like this?

267
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:20,016
I said that I would
pack our lunches.

268
00:19:20,155 --> 00:19:22,894
In a boarding house kitchen
teeming with guys,

269
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:24,477
you want me to
see you cooking?

270
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,708
I want you to sleep
while I pack the lunches.

271
00:19:26,726 --> 00:19:29,729
I can sleep forever
after I die.

272
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:31,610
Then quit your job at
the night club.

273
00:19:31,685 --> 00:19:34,102
Starting from next semester
I'll be receiving a scholarship.

274
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,523
Hey! I'll won't quit until I earn enough
for our own apartment!

275
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,199
With the tips I get,
there's no job better than that!

276
00:19:40,385 --> 00:19:44,355
Plus, I'm learning the guitar
from the band members.

277
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:47,471
What happens if you collapse
from a lack of sleep?

278
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:49,207
I'll never collapse!

279
00:19:49,245 --> 00:19:50,605
Who am I?

280
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:52,793
I'm... Yi Soo.

281
00:20:01,655 --> 00:20:03,310
Delicious.

282
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:10,207
Did you really see... Yi Soo?

283
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:15,606
<i>He said that picture you saw</i>

284
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,060
was taken without his knowledge.

285
00:20:22,326 --> 00:20:25,920
There was conflict between you
because of his music, but...

286
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:34,409
Unni... this is as much as
I can tell you.

287
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:38,689
The rest you can hear after
you meet Song Yi Soo in person.

288
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:42,244
Can I really...

289
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:44,656
meet Yi Soo?

290
00:20:44,805 --> 00:20:47,275
I don't know the exact date,

291
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,485
but it's not far away.

292
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:52,289
Until that time,

293
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:55,445
he can't appear in front of you.

294
00:20:56,898 --> 00:20:58,490
Wait for him...

295
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:00,738
for just a bit longer.

296
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:07,271
<i>{\a6}...and you called out to me</i>

297
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,814
<i>{\a6}Tears keep flowing</i>

298
00:21:11,014 --> 00:21:14,341
<i>{\a6}Cold tears are flowing</i>

299
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:21,617
<i>{\a6}My heart hurts,
and it hurts because of you</i>

300
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:27,954
<i>{\a6}I long for you in the day,
Oh how I long for you</i>

301
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:35,063
<i>{\a6}I miss you so much
and tears fall again</i>

302
00:22:20,843 --> 00:22:22,748
Song Yi Kyung didn't leave?

303
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:24,777
That's not possible,
I made sure of it.

304
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:28,358
<i>And I saw Kang parked
in front of her house.</i>

305
00:22:28,632 --> 00:22:29,791
What?

306
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,649
So, before the end destination
you came back?

307
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:35,921
I didn't know she'd
follow me all that way.

308
00:22:35,996 --> 00:22:39,240
So, half-way there
I got off the train.

309
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:40,552
Are you positive

310
00:22:40,647 --> 00:22:42,638
that the soul
didn't follow you?

311
00:22:42,748 --> 00:22:44,994
I made sure she
couldn't follow me.

312
00:22:45,258 --> 00:22:48,184
It was regretful
that you were leaving,

313
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:52,668
but I was, relieved you'd be able
to re-start your career.

314
00:23:06,248 --> 00:23:08,942
May I speak
with Song Yi Kyung?

315
00:23:13,703 --> 00:23:16,960
When you get off work,
stop by the hospital.

316
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:18,891
Good bye.

317
00:23:27,534 --> 00:23:28,823
What happened?

318
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:31,031
I got rid of that woman
and came back.

319
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:33,179
She followed me all the way
onto the train.

320
00:23:33,255 --> 00:23:34,937
Onto the train?

321
00:23:35,573 --> 00:23:38,474
Even without borrowing your body,
she can do that?

322
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,802
You were even able to
see her spirit?

323
00:23:42,862 --> 00:23:45,491
Even if I can't see it,
I can feel it.

324
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:47,645
Then how can I trust that you

325
00:23:47,749 --> 00:23:48,758
got rid of her?

326
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:50,960
From tomorrow
I'll be working in the day,

327
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:52,522
so come and check for yourself.

328
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,842
Where will you work
during the day?

329
00:23:54,061 --> 00:23:54,953
At Heaven.

330
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:56,504
Kang's place?

331
00:23:56,822 --> 00:23:59,397
Did Kang... tell you to
work there?

332
00:23:59,461 --> 00:24:02,279
He'll probably think it's
Shin Ji Hyun who's working.

333
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,039
Song Yi Kyung...

334
00:24:03,188 --> 00:24:05,464
Because I worked at night and
slept in the morning...

335
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:07,718
that woman was able
to use my body.

336
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:09,392
Now I'm too scared
to work during the night.

337
00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:11,368
So you're going to
act like Shin Ji Hyun.

338
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:13,917
You said the owner was
Han Kang, right?

339
00:24:14,024 --> 00:24:16,594
<i>He can't be 100 percent sure
that Shin Ji Hyun</i>

340
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,032
is using my body.

341
00:24:18,192 --> 00:24:21,985
Because... that woman cannot
reveal her identity.

342
00:24:23,614 --> 00:24:25,310
Shin Ji Hyun...

343
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:27,421
do you take me for a fool?

344
00:24:27,891 --> 00:24:29,783
<i>Do you think by telling
such a story</i>

345
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,354
that I'd just believe you?

346
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,979
Right now...

347
00:24:33,258 --> 00:24:35,657
do I look like
Shin Ji Hyun to you?

348
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:38,662
From when we shared bodies,

349
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:40,774
quite a few of her memories
remain with me.

350
00:24:40,884 --> 00:24:43,964
Even so, it doesn't make
any sense.

351
00:24:44,076 --> 00:24:46,197
So with nowhere else to work,
you'll work at Heaven?

352
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:47,496
You expect me to
believe that?

353

<i>That woman used my body
without my permission.</i>

355
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:56,777

endured because of that?

356
00:24:57,025 --> 00:24:59,265

What's the problem with me
acting like Shin Ji Hyun?

358
00:25:01,654 --> 00:25:04,144
You can you go work at the pension
I sent you to.

359
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,659
Who are you to tell me
where to go?

360
00:25:06,835 --> 00:25:10,779
I... didn't go because 
I was afraid of you.

361
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:13,286
I left because I was afraid
of Shin Ji Hyun.

362
00:25:13,351 --> 00:25:15,362

scared you?

363

365
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:21,968

was angry with me.

threatened me.

<i>So I left...</i>

369
00:25:30,346 --> 00:25:32,963

followed me.

370
00:25:33,526 --> 00:25:36,401
She saw the note
with the address of the pension.

371
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,218

came back.

384

I didn't ask this of her.

suggested it.

Of course!

387
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:27,303
Would such an idea come from
Shin Ji Hyun's head?

388

She said this was the only way
he'd be fooled.

389

really falling for it.

00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,430
What is it you want?

525
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,970
What are you going to do
if I'm Shin Ji Hyun?

526
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,905
And what are you going to do
if I'm Song Yi Kyung?

527
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,490
You know everything
so why didn't you speak up?

528
00:35:57,682 --> 00:35:59,713
Are you trying to take
revenge on us?

529
00:36:00,152 --> 00:36:01,129
Don't be like this.

530
00:36:01,232 --> 00:36:02,993
Just tell me what you
want to do!

531
00:36:03,102 --> 00:36:04,915
If I was Shin Ji Hyun...

532
00:36:05,074 --> 00:36:08,096
then I'd follow you
around forever.

533
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:11,829
<i>Do you think she can only use
Song Yi Kyung's body?</i>

534
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,411
<i>She can enter into any host body</i>

535
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:15,278
but even if she didn't...

536
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,820
she can wander around
as a spirit.

537
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:21,859
<i>And if Shin Ji Hyun
returns again,</i>

538
00:36:22,332 --> 00:36:23,892
most likely...

539
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,902
it'll be because of you.

540
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,475
So...

541
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:37,567
while I was in intensive care
you blocked a bankruptcy attempt.

542
00:36:37,652 --> 00:36:39,138
That's what happened?

543
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:43,490
Since we've blocked it,
you don't need to worry anymore.

544
00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:45,118
Father...

545
00:36:45,182 --> 00:36:49,484
how are HM Industries
and JC Consulting linked?

546
00:36:49,663 --> 00:36:51,310
They're companies that were

547
00:36:51,365 --> 00:36:54,643
introduced to me by a
former stock manager. Why?

548
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,300
Could I have his name?

549
00:36:57,553 --> 00:36:59,778
Why are you asking for that?

550
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:03,961
I sent Jin Young to observe her
for 3 days and 2 nights.

551
00:37:04,034 --> 00:37:06,150
The only person he saw there
was Song Yi Kyung.

552
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:09,722
Ji Hyun could've completely taken over
Song Yi Kyung's body.

553
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:12,398
She definitely felt like Ji Hyun.

554
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:14,820
You think I can't tell the difference
between Ji Hyun and Song Yi Kyung?

555
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:16,628
But you didn't.

556
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,114
You liked her without knowing
she was Ji Hyun.

557
00:37:23,299 --> 00:37:24,735
The one I liked wasn't Ji Hyun.

558
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:27,328
I'm not criticizing you.

559
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,010
I'm just afraid.

560
00:37:30,443 --> 00:37:32,683
We can't see Ji Hyun, but...

561
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,392
Ji Hyun is watching us.

562
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:36,548
Aren't you scared?

563
00:37:36,606 --> 00:37:38,114
Even so, what can she do?

564
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,170
Ji Hyun was able to find the seal
before we could 

565
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,379
and she was able
to block the bankruptcy.

566
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:46,359
There are definitely plans that
we aren't aware of.

567
00:37:46,423 --> 00:37:48,008
What do you mean?

568
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:53,427
The money they used to pay off
the bank promissory note

569
00:37:53,788 --> 00:37:56,410
it was from a loan
on Ji Hyun's land.

570
00:37:56,905 --> 00:37:59,240
Why are you only
telling me now?!

571
00:38:09,978 --> 00:38:11,531
Seo Woo!

572
00:38:14,108 --> 00:38:15,356
Seo Woo...

573
00:38:15,566 --> 00:38:17,476
there are people
moving our things out.

574
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:19,279
What's going on?

575
00:38:20,789 --> 00:38:23,228
They're not our things,
they're mine.

576
00:38:23,827 --> 00:38:26,227
I won't take even a toothpick
that's been bought with your money.

577
00:38:26,288 --> 00:38:27,577
What are you saying?

578
00:38:27,617 --> 00:38:31,004
I can't live with you because
you frighten me, so I'm running away.

579
00:38:31,187 --> 00:38:33,218
Ji Hyun's family's bankruptcy...

580
00:38:33,368 --> 00:38:35,514
I heard that's your work.

581
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:38,581
From this moment on
we're over.

582
00:38:42,108 --> 00:38:44,048
I know I was wrong.

583
00:38:44,268 --> 00:38:45,407
You know you were wrong?

584
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,085
It's not that I don't regret it.
I have, so many times.

585
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,647
Too bad.

586
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,766
They say that no matter how quickly
regret comes, it's always too late.

587
00:38:54,397 --> 00:38:57,001
I couldn't stop oppa.

588
00:38:58,217 --> 00:39:00,485
I was the one who...

589
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:02,637
first fooled oppa.

590
00:39:03,866 --> 00:39:07,026
When life in Seoul was
difficult to endure,

591
00:39:07,221 --> 00:39:09,473
I met Min Ho oppa.

592
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:12,351
It was love at first sight.

593
00:39:12,947 --> 00:39:15,037
I liked him so much.

594
00:39:15,717 --> 00:39:18,614
I didn't want to appear poor
in front of him.

595
00:39:20,297 --> 00:39:22,943
So I said that my father...

596
00:39:23,365 --> 00:39:25,809
was Shin Il Shik.

597
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,018
Shin In Jung!

598
00:39:31,097 --> 00:39:33,569
The hatred I felt for Ji Hyun,

599
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,206
combined with that lie...

600
00:39:36,898 --> 00:39:39,802
set into motion
something I can't undo.

601
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:42,954
You like Kang...

602
00:39:43,325 --> 00:39:45,554
so you should know how I feel.

603
00:39:46,407 --> 00:39:48,605
No matter how much you like a guy,

604
00:39:48,867 --> 00:39:51,397
you can't betray your friend
in order to catch him.

605
00:39:51,497 --> 00:39:54,137
There's only the two of us
left now, Seo Woo.

606
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:56,979
Even though I can't stop
Min Ho now,

607
00:39:57,567 --> 00:40:01,427
Ji Hyun's parents...
I won't leave them to misery.

608
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:04,217
Won't leave them in misery?

609
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:06,167
That's not what I mean!

610
00:40:06,808 --> 00:40:09,118
I have no choice right now.

611
00:40:10,238 --> 00:40:13,758
Then move in with Kang Min Ho who
doesn't leave you a choice!

612
00:40:13,857 --> 00:40:16,609
<i>Why are you whining to me?
Why can't you move in?</i>

613
00:40:31,237 --> 00:40:33,167
<i>In Jung is right.</i>

614
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:36,729
It won't be the end of it
because we've blocked the bankruptcy.

615
00:40:39,027 --> 00:40:41,576
I can't leave like this.

616
00:40:42,997 --> 00:40:45,316
You said you wanted to live,

617
00:40:45,798 --> 00:40:48,267
but you only worry about
your father's company.

618
00:40:48,347 --> 00:40:51,107
It's because it all happened
because of me.

619
00:40:51,287 --> 00:40:54,605
If I had thought about it even a little,
from In Jung's perspective...

620
00:40:55,777 --> 00:40:58,819
if I had just had more sense...

621
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,884
and not fallen for Kang Min Ho...

622
00:41:03,397 --> 00:41:06,266
my mom and dad
wouldn't have had to endure this.

623
00:41:06,503 --> 00:41:08,080
Parents...

624
00:41:08,492 --> 00:41:11,636
so that's what it's like
to have a family.

625
00:41:13,058 --> 00:41:15,825
Even in the face of death,

626
00:41:16,428 --> 00:41:19,535
you can't think about
just yourself.

627
00:41:20,527 --> 00:41:22,314
I'm sorry.

628
00:41:23,308 --> 00:41:25,407
Han Kang...

629
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,972
don't you think about him?

630
00:41:29,337 --> 00:41:31,527
<i>He's a good person.</i>

631
00:41:31,677 --> 00:41:33,308
You two...

632
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,227
seem like you like each other.

633
00:41:37,797 --> 00:41:39,874
If it was me...

634
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,520
if I had known about
the time that remained to us...

635
00:41:44,038 --> 00:41:46,900
I would've looked
upon his face more.

636
00:41:47,808 --> 00:41:50,113
Loved him more...

637
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:52,885
Treated him well...

638
00:41:53,748 --> 00:41:55,909
I think...

639
00:41:56,988 --> 00:41:59,585
that's what I would've done.

640
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:03,644
The more you do that, the more
you don't want to die.

641
00:42:04,278 --> 00:42:06,790
The more regret you'd feel.

642
00:42:07,387 --> 00:42:09,746
<i>That's why I'm afraid.</i>

643
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:13,279
I don't have any hope of living...

644
00:42:14,948 --> 00:42:17,803
and Kang will hurt even more.

645
00:42:24,549 --> 00:42:27,158
You've moved out of In Jung's house,
so where are you staying?

646
00:42:27,277 --> 00:42:29,847
For now I'm staying with
an employee here.

647
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:31,807
And I've left my things
at a storage facility.

648
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:33,027
Isn't it uncomfortable?

649
00:42:33,068 --> 00:42:34,978
Is comfort the issue?

650
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:37,396
I can't live in the
same house as her.

651
00:42:37,437 --> 00:42:40,876
It's such a relief that Ji Hyun
has a friend like you.

652
00:42:41,377 --> 00:42:44,999
Even just thinking of you,
she should wake up quickly.

653
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:46,870
Kang, you...

654
00:42:46,953 --> 00:42:49,851
really liked Ji Hyun a lot,
didn't you?

655
00:42:52,347 --> 00:42:54,172
<i>By any chance...</i>

656
00:42:54,423 --> 00:42:57,026
if like the doctor says, Ji Hyun

657
00:42:57,418 --> 00:43:00,423
doesn't wake up...

658
00:43:02,137 --> 00:43:05,676
How much time would you need
before you'd look at another woman?

659
00:43:06,077 --> 00:43:08,588
Wh... what... What do you
mean by that?

660
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:12,350
If there was another woman
who liked you...

661
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:16,546
how long would she
have to wait?

662
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:27,764
<i>Song Yi Kyung's birthday is
November 8, 1984.</i>

663
00:43:49,437 --> 00:43:52,836
<i>Unable to connect. Unable to connect!</i>

664
00:43:52,935 --> 00:43:54,735
<i>Impossible to connect!</i>

665
00:43:54,867 --> 00:43:56,636
Has something happened?

666
00:43:56,737 --> 00:43:58,407
I think I need to go
to her home.

667
00:43:58,507 --> 00:43:59,730
Hey.

668
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:01,325
Try that thing once before you go.

669
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,127
That locator tracker or something.

670
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:04,577
Ah.

671
00:44:07,207 --> 00:44:10,796
But, does this work
even when the phone is off?

672
00:44:12,437 --> 00:44:17,489
<i>The location of cellphone number 010-491-4949 is
Paradise Apartments, room 703.</i>

673
00:44:17,667 --> 00:44:23,007
<i>The owner of the Paradise Apartment room
is Kang - Min - Ho.</i>

674
00:44:27,222 --> 00:44:28,506
<i>The password needs to be</i>

675
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,894
<i>someone's anniversary date,
so that I won't forget.</i>

676
00:44:30,991 --> 00:44:32,333
I asked when your mother's
birthday is.

677
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:33,902
When is her birthday?

678
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:35,539
January 10th.

679
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:41,246
5... 2...

680
00:44:41,995 --> 00:44:44,253
0... 1...

681
00:44:44,462 --> 00:44:46,460
1... 0.

682
00:44:58,019 --> 00:44:59,789
Why is there nothing here?

683
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,559
He definitely pulled out files from here.

684
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,211
Shin Ji Hyun...

685
00:45:17,554 --> 00:45:20,036
you've fooled me convincingly.

686
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:22,158
Do you still see me as
Shin Ji Hyun?

687
00:45:22,249 --> 00:45:26,089
How can Song Yi Kyung come
into my house and out of my room?!

688
00:45:26,139 --> 00:45:27,510
I told you,

689
00:45:27,689 --> 00:45:30,089
I still have some of
Shin Ji Hyun's memories.

690
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:31,928
I was curious.

691
00:45:31,959 --> 00:45:34,029
Memories of this house
kept coming back to me.

692
00:45:34,749 --> 00:45:37,178
Should I tell you why
you are Shin Ji Hyun?

693
00:45:37,439 --> 00:45:38,558
I'm Song Yi Kyung.

694
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:41,509
Shin Ji Hyun could
never like Kang Min Ho.

695
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:43,809
<i>But you said you're interested.</i>

696
00:45:44,139 --> 00:45:45,712
Not only that,

697
00:45:46,054 --> 00:45:48,079
you even worked at my house.

698
00:45:48,289 --> 00:45:50,489
And without my knowledge
came in with a key.

699
00:45:50,919 --> 00:45:52,537
<i>What could be the reason?</i>

700
00:45:53,009 --> 00:45:57,649
You thought that I wouldn't figure it out
and came into my house again.

701
00:46:03,259 --> 00:46:05,741
That's the evidence
that proves you're Shin Ji Hyun.

702
00:46:25,989 --> 00:46:28,039
Simple and naive,

703
00:46:28,128 --> 00:46:30,638
<i>looking at things from her
own point of view.</i>

704
00:46:30,698 --> 00:46:32,518
That's who Shin Ji Hyun is.

705
00:46:32,628 --> 00:46:34,348
You loved that Shin Ji Hyun.

706
00:46:34,398 --> 00:46:36,790
The one I loved wasn't
Shin Ji Hyun!

707
00:46:36,939 --> 00:46:38,212
Then...

708
00:46:38,492 --> 00:46:40,128
is it me?

709
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:42,498
Don't fool around.

710
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,791
If you loved her when she was in
Song Yi Kyung's body,

711
00:46:44,933 --> 00:46:47,048
that means you loved
Shin Ji Hyun.

712
00:46:47,279 --> 00:46:48,594
<i>But...</i>

713
00:46:48,963 --> 00:46:51,468
you can't recognize whether
she's the woman you loved or not?

714
00:46:51,598 --> 00:46:53,397
I'm going crazy too.

715
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,108
I can't figure out who the woman
I fell in love with is and I'm going crazy!

716
00:46:59,689 --> 00:47:01,289
Unni!

717
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:08,584
No matter what you do,

718
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:13,318
Shin Industries will go bankrupt
and Hae Mi Do will come into my hands.

719
00:47:15,008 --> 00:47:17,029
I'll have to have that instead,

720
00:47:17,483 --> 00:47:19,618
in payment for
you driving me insane.

721
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:22,327
It seems that
you still love her.

722
00:47:26,049 --> 00:47:27,596
Come in!

723
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,158
Who is this person?

724
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:42,999
Is it her?

725
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,728
That's strange.

726
00:48:22,248 --> 00:48:24,498
There is no other spirit.

727
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:25,728
No spirit?

728
00:48:25,749 --> 00:48:27,329
<i>There isn't.</i>

729
00:48:27,929 --> 00:48:29,642
<i>Right now,</i>

730
00:48:29,726 --> 00:48:32,786
this person is not possessed.

731
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:37,304
That can't be.
Please try again.

732
00:48:42,407 --> 00:48:44,727
Let's look around your house.

733
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:18,807
Here she is.

734
00:49:33,047 --> 00:49:34,640
Song Yi Kyung!

735
00:49:37,087 --> 00:49:38,637
Kang Min Ho!

736
00:49:41,886 --> 00:49:43,417
Song Yi Kyung!

737
00:49:43,702 --> 00:49:45,110
Stay quiet.

738
00:49:49,112 --> 00:49:50,872
<i>This is the police.</i>

739
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,859
We've received a complaint
of unlawful confinement.

740
00:49:58,085 --> 00:50:00,168
I'd like to ask a few questions.

741
00:50:02,217 --> 00:50:03,832
It really is the police.

742
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:11,458
<i>I know you're inside, Hyung!</i>

743
00:50:11,533 --> 00:50:13,058
Hurry and open the door!

744
00:50:18,278 --> 00:50:20,418
What do you mean police?
Why have you come here?

745
00:50:26,033 --> 00:50:27,174
Don't get all angry.

746
00:50:27,212 --> 00:50:29,159
The one who came without
my knowledge is this woman.

747
00:50:30,607 --> 00:50:32,539
There was something
I left here.

748
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,240
I didn't see the policeman.

749
00:50:50,535 --> 00:50:51,707
What?

750
00:51:00,011 --> 00:51:01,574
What did you think you
were doing?

751
00:51:01,675 --> 00:51:03,244
Have you no fear?

752
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,219
Who do you think you're...

753
00:51:05,336 --> 00:51:07,041
Why are you getting angry
at my Yi Kyung?!

754
00:51:07,129 --> 00:51:08,556
Why did you go
to Min Ho's house?

755
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,150
What did you go there for?!

756
00:51:10,472 --> 00:51:12,232
I'm Song Yi Kyung.

757
00:51:13,255 --> 00:51:15,434
You don't think I know
that you're Song Yi Kyung?

758
00:51:15,535 --> 00:51:16,998
I'm sorry.

759
00:51:17,262 --> 00:51:19,540
You're friend is next to me.

760
00:51:20,647 --> 00:51:22,364
What to do?

761
00:51:25,052 --> 00:51:28,202
How can you...? It's daytime right now...
why are you...?

762
00:51:28,515 --> 00:51:31,130
Can the two of you go
around together?

763
00:51:31,799 --> 00:51:33,957
I suggested that
we do it like this.

764
00:51:34,042 --> 00:51:36,651
If so, then you should've
told me beforehand.

765
00:51:36,689 --> 00:51:38,844
Was there any time
to tell you?!

766
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:40,929
Why did you go to
Min Ho's house?

767
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,651
It seems there are some files

768
00:51:42,798 --> 00:51:44,444
kept there in his safe.

769
00:51:44,508 --> 00:51:45,476
A safe?

770
00:51:45,527 --> 00:51:47,354
It's a burden off my chest,

771
00:51:47,489 --> 00:51:49,464
you telling him everything.

772
00:51:50,257 --> 00:51:51,627
That's how it was.

773
00:51:52,222 --> 00:51:53,765
That's the reason why...

774
00:51:53,912 --> 00:51:55,772
you kept meeting Min Ho.

775
00:51:55,935 --> 00:51:58,925
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you.

776
00:51:59,397 --> 00:52:03,089
<i>Then you went in secretly
and was caught by Min Ho?</i>

777
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:16,342
Oppa!

778
00:52:18,561 --> 00:52:19,919
What happened?

779
00:52:20,045 --> 00:52:23,465
Jin Young said that Ji Hyun
wasn't in Song Yi Kyung's body.

780
00:52:23,587 --> 00:52:25,091
Is that true?

781
00:52:26,972 --> 00:52:28,566
They're playing with me.

782
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:30,757
What are you talking about?

783
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,880
Song Yi Kyung and Shin Ji Hyun
are the same.

784
00:52:36,615 --> 00:52:38,635
<i>Who was it...</i>

785
00:52:39,307 --> 00:52:41,515
that I loved?

786
00:52:48,127 --> 00:52:49,423
Lately...

787
00:52:49,515 --> 00:52:53,372
there's been a lot
going on, at the company.

788
00:52:53,815 --> 00:52:54,884
You've heard?

789
00:52:54,984 --> 00:52:57,249
The bankruptcy was a shock,

790
00:52:57,779 --> 00:52:59,666
but faulty products...

791
00:52:59,868 --> 00:53:02,592
I clearly remember I instructed
that the equipment

792
00:53:02,842 --> 00:53:04,770
at Jinan Factory be changed.

793
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:08,792
And the Hae Mi Do funds to be use for the
construction repayment, weren't even transferred...

794
00:53:08,817 --> 00:53:10,939
You've found all that out so,

795
00:53:11,225 --> 00:53:12,506
are you well enough now?

796
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:13,782
Min Ho...

797
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,821
I'm starting to get strange ideas.

798
00:53:17,885 --> 00:53:19,862
They're not strange ideas.

799
00:53:20,482 --> 00:53:22,613
What you're thinking is correct...

800
00:53:22,803 --> 00:53:24,080
President.

801
00:53:24,605 --> 00:53:25,586
What?

802
00:53:25,637 --> 00:53:27,599
But it's too late now.

803
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,020
<i>You said you couldn't find the seal.</i>

804
00:53:33,477 --> 00:53:36,837
And now... you've let them
block the bankruptcy with that land?

805
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:40,682
You wouldn't allow the bankruptcy,
putting it off day by day...

806
00:53:42,915 --> 00:53:44,420
What will you do now?

807
00:53:44,696 --> 00:53:46,901
They only found the seal by chance.

808
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,669
Chief Kang...

809
00:53:49,371 --> 00:53:52,879
you've always been well spoken,

810
00:53:53,197 --> 00:53:56,023
but do you know you
haven't done anything well?

811
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,170
Our terms were

812
00:53:58,396 --> 00:54:00,491
to turn Shin Industries
over to us.

813
00:54:00,542 --> 00:54:02,161
Although there's been a
change in the order,

814
00:54:02,511 --> 00:54:04,122
first we'll get Hae Mi Do,

815
00:54:04,245 --> 00:54:05,784
and then we'll get Shin Industries.

816
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:09,723
If you're thinking of stealing
Hae Mi Do from us,

817
00:54:10,142 --> 00:54:12,823
you won't be able to
die peacefully.

818
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,804
Don't threaten me.

819
00:54:15,055 --> 00:54:17,184
I'm not the type to die
by your hands.

820
00:54:19,187 --> 00:54:23,705
Now I can't just leave...
Shin Industries alone.

821
00:54:54,752 --> 00:54:56,114
Let's go.

822
00:55:09,887 --> 00:55:11,716
Welcome Yi Kyung.

823
00:55:11,779 --> 00:55:16,907
I've changed the sheets and bedding
so you can sleep comfortably.

824
00:55:17,095 --> 00:55:18,436
Thank you.

825
00:55:18,537 --> 00:55:20,222
Hurry and put her
things upstairs

826
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,886
and then have dinner.

827
00:55:21,974 --> 00:55:23,302
I'll leave it to you.

828
00:55:23,477 --> 00:55:24,932
Let's go.

829
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:50,681
Did Ji Hyun come in?

830
00:55:51,802 --> 00:55:54,336
<i>She's being delivered now.</i>

831
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,782
Unni, I came in.

832
00:56:05,007 --> 00:56:06,732
She's here...

833
00:56:07,055 --> 00:56:08,769
on the sofa.

834
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,969
Shin Ji Hyun, are you okay?

835
00:56:21,132 --> 00:56:23,602
I'm sorry for making
such trouble.

836
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,608
She says she's sorry
for making you worry today.

837
00:56:26,897 --> 00:56:29,528
Kiddo, if you were going to do
something like that,

838
00:56:29,575 --> 00:56:31,391
you should have told me
through Yi Kyung.

839
00:56:31,455 --> 00:56:34,695
She didn't tell me
what she was doing either.

840
00:56:36,949 --> 00:56:38,197
Oh...

841
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:41,936
I'm sorry. I made you come here
because of Ji Hyun.

842
00:56:42,012 --> 00:56:43,726
Why don't we
have dinner first?

843
00:56:43,814 --> 00:56:45,221
I'm okay.

844
00:56:45,272 --> 00:56:46,547
Please come down.

845
00:56:46,706 --> 00:56:48,477
I'll be waiting for you.

846
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,010
Are you okay?

847
00:56:57,187 --> 00:56:58,809
<i>How did you come up?</i>

848
00:56:58,897 --> 00:57:00,204
I didn't see you.

849
00:57:00,267 --> 00:57:02,915
I have a guardian angel.

850
00:57:03,137 --> 00:57:06,543
Hey! I'm the Grim Reaper!

851
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:09,709
I mean... Scheduler!

852
00:57:09,797 --> 00:57:13,525
Unni, you should go
and eat.

853
00:57:15,322 --> 00:57:17,547
The pasta here is really good

854
00:57:17,786 --> 00:57:19,622
<i>and so is the pizza.</i>

855
00:57:19,947 --> 00:57:22,283
Eat a lot in my stead.

856
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:29,053
<i>{\a6}Tears keep flowing</i>

857
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:32,639
<i>{\a6}Cold tears are flowing</i>

858
00:57:33,191 --> 00:57:40,077
<i>{\a6}My heart hurts,
and it hurts because of you</i>

859
00:57:40,269 --> 00:57:46,385
<i>{\a6}I long for you in the day,
Oh how I long for you</i>

860
00:57:46,473 --> 00:57:52,429
<i>{\a6}I miss you so much
and tears fall again</i>

861
00:57:52,807 --> 00:57:57,097
After Min Ho found out about everything,
you had no choice but to come here.

862
00:57:57,287 --> 00:57:59,786
But, I wish for your stay here
to be comfortable.

863
00:58:00,072 --> 00:58:02,081
It's not that unfamiliar to me.

864
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:05,545
I haven't had a chance yet
to properly thank you.

865
00:58:07,332 --> 00:58:08,806
Thank you so much.

866
00:58:08,895 --> 00:58:10,939
For giving Ji Hyun a chance...

867
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:12,985
Thank you.

868
00:58:14,205 --> 00:58:16,706
I saw how desperate
Ji Hyun was.

869
00:58:17,205 --> 00:58:19,688
I've wanted to die so badly.

870
00:58:20,435 --> 00:58:23,165
Although I want to throw away
this life so much...

871
00:58:23,882 --> 00:58:27,250
there is another
who desperately wants it.

872
00:58:28,352 --> 00:58:30,467
But going to such lengths,

873
00:58:30,658 --> 00:58:32,914
I realize how difficult
it is for you.

874
00:58:34,237 --> 00:58:38,187
Compared to the debts I owe,
it's nothing.

875
00:58:39,097 --> 00:58:40,505
Debts?

876
00:58:43,081 --> 00:58:45,330
Ah, no. Forget it.

877
00:58:45,677 --> 00:58:48,027
You don't need
to tell me anything.

878
00:58:52,541 --> 00:58:55,636
Thanks for saving me
from Kang Min Ho's house.

879
00:58:55,775 --> 00:58:57,895
I wasn't saving you!

880
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,560
I know you must've been trying
to help Song Yi Kyung,

881
00:59:01,755 --> 00:59:04,368
but because of that
I was helped too.

882
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,269
So thanks.

883
00:59:06,307 --> 00:59:08,093
If you're thankful...

884
00:59:09,593 --> 00:59:12,295
...try to avoid anything that
would make me see Yi Kyung's face.

885
00:59:12,394 --> 00:59:15,431
But you must've
received another penalty.

886
00:59:15,568 --> 00:59:17,244
The rules of a 49-day traveller,

887
00:59:17,295 --> 00:59:20,866
say that if the body donor is in danger,
I'm allowed to help them.

888
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:24,380
A Scheduler
only works within the rules.

889
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:26,686
<i>I regained this memory
for no reason.</i>

890
00:59:26,737 --> 00:59:28,765
Every day feels like a
thousand years.

891
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:31,267
Why would I get another penalty?!

892
00:59:32,105 --> 00:59:34,336
But...

893
00:59:35,013 --> 00:59:38,598
am I going to continue
to lose strength like this?

894
00:59:40,013 --> 00:59:42,349
It's not only during the daytime...

895
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,578
As you get closer to
completing your 49 days,

896
00:59:44,843 --> 00:59:46,872
it'll get worse.

897
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:09,200
I can't sleep because
of the anxiety.

898
01:00:25,487 --> 01:00:27,862
Unni, you can't fall asleep?

899
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:32,515
It's because the place you sleep in
has changed because of me.

900
01:00:32,889 --> 01:00:37,308
No. I've had plenty of sleep
because of you.

901
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:42,014
I'm going to get a breath of fresh air,
do you want to go together?

902
01:00:43,567 --> 01:00:46,874
I don't have the strength
so I can't.

903
01:00:47,274 --> 01:00:50,568
It's dangerous,
so don't go too far.

904
01:01:37,457 --> 01:01:39,992
Once today passes,
there's only 6 days left.

905
01:01:40,445 --> 01:01:42,665
How can time fly by so fast?

906
01:01:42,887 --> 01:01:45,375
And nothing's progressing
as it should.

907
01:01:55,947 --> 01:01:57,597
Is something the matter?

908
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,505
Ji Hyun told me to tell you
to go to bed.

909
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,976
Really?

910
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:08,185
She says that being under
the same roof as you is comforting

911
01:02:08,356 --> 01:02:10,510
and puts her at ease.

912
01:02:10,997 --> 01:02:12,399
It's not because of her.

913
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,260
It's because of Min Ho.

914
01:02:14,755 --> 01:02:17,425
She says that all she needs
is to sleep with the doors locked.

915
01:02:17,792 --> 01:02:20,122
Is Ji Hyun sleeping?

916
01:02:20,382 --> 01:02:22,233
Can she sleep?

917
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:24,830
I envy Ji Hyun.

918
01:02:25,285 --> 01:02:26,123
Why?

919
01:02:26,197 --> 01:02:29,596
But, don't get
too attached to her.

920
01:02:29,647 --> 01:02:31,524
Ji Hyun...

921
01:02:31,883 --> 01:02:34,012
doesn't have
that much time left.

922
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:37,000
What do you mean by that?

923
01:02:37,792 --> 01:02:39,865
I know because
I've experienced it.

924
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,770
The more you trust and
love someone,

925
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,990
when that person leaves,

926
01:02:45,265 --> 01:02:47,232
the harder it becomes
to endure.

927
01:02:48,282 --> 01:02:51,961
Song Yi Kyung, why do you speak
as if Ji Hyun is going to die?

928
01:02:52,037 --> 01:02:54,088
Ji Hyun herself believes

929
01:02:54,508 --> 01:02:56,090
that she won't be
able to live.

930
01:02:56,142 --> 01:02:57,363
That's not true.

931
01:02:57,462 --> 01:03:00,104
They say that God
made the world in 7 days,

932
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:01,945
why would you
throw away hope?

933
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,759
The more you think that way,

934
01:03:03,869 --> 01:03:06,075
the more difficult it is
for Ji Hyun.

935
01:03:06,594 --> 01:03:08,932
Think that it wasn't meant to be
in this lifetime,

936
01:03:09,075 --> 01:03:10,054
and throw away your hopes.

937
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,481
Song Yi Kyung.

938
01:03:11,607 --> 01:03:12,980
You're a savior to me but

939
01:03:13,145 --> 01:03:15,155
I'm about to get angry,
so let's stop this.

940
01:03:15,229 --> 01:03:16,114
Go back in.

941
01:03:16,152 --> 01:03:17,138
For you two...

942
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,256
I said that's enough!

943
01:03:21,092 --> 01:03:24,577
Until... Ji Hyun leaves,
I'm not going to give up.

944
01:03:24,727 --> 01:03:27,966
No! I can't give up.

945
01:03:33,899 --> 01:03:35,522
I'm asking you a favor,

946
01:03:35,862 --> 01:03:39,932
Please don't speak that way
to Ji Hyun.
