1
00:00:00,164 --> 00:00:01,515
(Kosol really was the one who hurt you.)

2
00:00:02,028 --> 00:00:03,706
If your friends hated me,

3
00:00:05,287 --> 00:00:06,404
would you hate me too?

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,903
You’re my first love, Oom.

5
00:00:08,866 --> 00:00:10,468
I don’t want to be Oom anymore.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,370
I know.

7
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,728
I know you’re not Oom.

8
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:20,605
Someone sent this email to my company.

9
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:21,889
2022

10
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,281
They also included the HR director’s
2022

11
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:23,292
2022

12
00:00:23,293 --> 00:00:24,627
and the company president’s emails.
2022

13
00:00:24,628 --> 00:00:25,607
2022

14
00:00:25,657 --> 00:00:26,382
It’s like…

15
00:00:26,742 --> 00:00:27,404
A threat.

16
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:31,625
What era are we even living in?

17
00:00:32,194 --> 00:00:33,971
Who gets threatened by stuff like this anymore?

18
00:00:34,782 --> 00:00:35,872
How annoying.

19
00:00:36,607 --> 00:00:37,720
You’re not the one being threatened.

20
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:41,103
I am.

21
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:45,074
He’s saying he’s watching us.

22
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:49,048
Who is he?

23
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,171
My father.

24
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:04,561
What does he want from you?

25
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:27,911
This is a premeditated attempted murder.

26
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:35,457
He’s my friend’s only son.

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,725
You must help him walk free

28
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,613
and minimize the compensation.

29
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:46,577
Even though the plaintiff is disabled for life?

30
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:49,671
Will you do it or not?

31
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,534
I have professional ethics.

32
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,619
You’re not on your own now.

33
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,808
Didn’t I already tell you

34
00:02:06,964 --> 00:02:08,560
I’m capable of far more than this?

35
00:02:10,314 --> 00:02:11,605
Leave Oom out of this.

36
00:02:18,874 --> 00:02:20,271
Maybe I will, maybe I won’t.

37
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:25,706
It depends on what you choose.

38
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,850
2023

39
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:43,711
May.

40
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:48,616
Did you represent Batman, the one who
chased down that motorpunk and left him disabled?

41
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:52,017
Um.

42
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:53,908
How could you do that?

43
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,663
Why are you coming at me?

44
00:03:01,672 --> 00:03:02,712
It’s my work.

45
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,777
Because I know him.

46
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:06,802
Don’t you know?

47
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,069
His mother took her own life to secure
insurance money for his medical treatment.

48
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,180
You’re way more cold-blooded than I thought.

49
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:29,804
I just wanted to protect you,

50
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,077
like how you protected me.

51
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:43,805
I protected you?

52
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:53,111
Oom.

53
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,008
We met back in high school days

54
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,383
at the Bangkok Planetarium.

55
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,662
You came to my rescue.

56
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:27,908
So it’s that Oom that you like?

57
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:37,746
I understand everything now.

58
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:49,065
Oom.

59
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,373
I told you to get out.

60
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:58,176
Get out!

61
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:00,912
Didn’t you hear? Step out!

62
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,810
OABOOM CAN NOW BE REACHED…
CALLING 191 EMERGENCY

63
00:05:05,617 --> 00:05:06,309
Great.

64
00:05:07,084 --> 00:05:08,309
You won’t get out, huh?

65
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:09,745
No?

66
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,238
CALLING OABOOM

67
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:10,850
Fine.
CALLING OABOOM

68
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:14,613
Have it your way.

69
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:17,277
Oom, help me!

70
00:05:17,545 --> 00:05:18,537
Oom, help me!

71
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:19,174
Oom!

72
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:20,210
I said get out!

73
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:21,915
Help! Please help!

74
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:23,013
Not getting out?

75
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:25,622
Oom, help me!

76
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:26,922
I said get the hell out!

77
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:28,807
No?

78
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:30,306
Get out!

79
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:31,967
Oom, help me.

80
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:35,207
Get out.

81
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,462
Get out.

82
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:44,767
Get out.

83
00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:50,315
I told you to get out!

84
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:07,357
Anybody, help!

85
00:06:07,445 --> 00:06:08,308
Help me!

86
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,413
Help!

87
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:11,145
Anybody, help!

88
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:13,488
Help!

89
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:14,712
Help me!

90
00:06:16,365 --> 00:06:17,220
Help!

91
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,244
Help!

92
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:19,069
Don’t come any closer.

93
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:20,379
Because of you,

94
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,920
my friend’s mother killed herself.

95
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,508
My friend is disabled for life.

96
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,180
It’s all because of you.

97
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:28,531
Don’t come any closer.

98
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:29,462
Go away.

99
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:30,712
Go away!

100
00:06:31,903 --> 00:06:33,216
I said get away from me.

101
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:34,774
No!

102
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:35,514
Don’t!

103
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:36,860
Come here.

104
00:06:36,954 --> 00:06:37,478
Help!

105
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,213
Go away.

106
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:05,808
Oom?

107
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:08,374
Is that you?

108
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,779
Oom?

109
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:12,038
Oom.

110
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,007
Where are you?

111
00:08:15,906 --> 00:08:16,447
Oom.

112
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:18,503
Are you here?

113
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,007
Oom.

114
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:21,139
Oom.

115
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:23,106
Oom.

116
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:24,715
Oom.

117
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,281
Oom, where are you?

118
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,940
Oom!

119
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:29,715
Oom.

120
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:31,804
Oom!

121
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,607
Yes, I am Oaboom.

122
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,100
But I’m not the one you love.

123
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,106
The person you love…

124
00:09:09,936 --> 00:09:10,814
is Ai-oon,

125
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:17,807
my twin sister.

126
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:47,217
May.

127
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:49,114
You’re awake?

128
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:51,222
Yes.

129
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:53,365
Sorry, I got up in the afternoon.

130
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,466
I was dead drunk last night.

131
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:05,515
I know.

132
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:08,705
I was the one giving you a sponge bath.

133
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,786
You keep surprising me, May.

134
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,666
You can paint too?

135
00:11:22,023 --> 00:11:22,674
How amazing.

136
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:29,305
Close your eyes, Oom.

137
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,180
Can you feel it?

138
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:56,509
The texture of the paints?

139
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:58,802
Yes.

140
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,604
Once you touch them, you know their form.

141
00:12:07,574 --> 00:12:08,911
These paints have scents too.

142
00:12:20,478 --> 00:12:21,019
Right.

143
00:12:22,197 --> 00:12:23,711
They don’t smell like I expected.

144
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:33,367
They’re paints made for the blind.

145
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:41,219
They’ve been developed so the scents
correspond with the colors.

146
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:47,605
What are you painting?

147
00:12:50,056 --> 00:12:51,211
Some feeling…

148
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,570
I can’t describe with words.

149
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,072
Can you feel it?

150
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,423
(Why do you love me?)

151
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,568
I love you.

152
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:26,871
You’re my first love, Oom.

153
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,574
I fell in love with you at first sight.

154
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,371
Let’s head back to Bangkok.

155
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,000
I’m gonna take these bags to the car.

156
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:19,717
The easel looks broken.

157
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:21,717
I’ll get it fixed

158
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:23,717
and have it sent to your place.

159
00:14:25,226 --> 00:14:25,761
Um.

160
00:14:26,401 --> 00:14:27,069
Thank you.

161
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,885
Can you do me one more favor?

162
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:32,014
We’ve long passed the point of asking.

163
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:34,531
Don’t ask—just tell me what you need.

164
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,167
Find something out for me.

165
00:14:41,158 --> 00:14:42,608
What happened to Ai-oon last night,

166
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,208
and who did she talk to?

167
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:46,773
Why is she acting differently?

168
00:15:07,402 --> 00:15:07,939
Oom.

169
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,508
Can you open the car window for me?

170
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:20,819
The weather is nice today.

171
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,324
It’s a shame I can’t see it.

172
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:27,038
Sure.

173
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,804
Did May ask you to bring me these?

174
00:16:14,063 --> 00:16:15,176
Why would you think that?

175
00:16:16,598 --> 00:16:21,010
You wouldn’t come bearing gifts on your own.

176
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,977
May asked me to ask you about Ai-oon.

177
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,660
Last night,

178
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,505
did you talk to May’s girlfriend about anything?

179
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:55,471
We talked about several things,

180
00:16:56,554 --> 00:16:58,674
but I don’t think I revealed May’s secret.

181
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:01,177
Is there a problem?

182
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:05,004
Last night, after they got back to the hotel,

183
00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:07,004
Ai-oon got so wasted.

184
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:10,780
May told me she murmured that
she didn’t want to be Oaboom.

185
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,071
Oaboom?

186
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,605
That’s right.

187
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,820
So something did happen.

188
00:17:20,231 --> 00:17:23,509
I just wanted her to know that
she’s May’s first love,

189
00:17:24,571 --> 00:17:28,007
but I forgot that she came here as Oaboom,

190
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,204
not Ai-oon.

191
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:35,801
So Ai-oon really thought

192
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,272
Oaboom was May’s first love.

193
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:52,309
Ah.

194
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,217
I got it now.

195
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:58,773
Thank you, Ton.

196
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:23,106
May.

197
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,651
Let’s go see the sunset.

198
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:30,525
Sure.

199
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:38,408
The sun is getting low.

200
00:18:42,357 --> 00:18:44,204
The sky is painted in a soft red glow.

201
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:49,014
The clouds scatter everywhere.

202
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:56,868
(What should I do?)

203
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,207
(Telling Ai she was my first love is like
admitting I’ve known her identity all along.)

204
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:06,408
(But she thinks I’m still hung up on my first love.)

205
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:09,265
May.

206
00:19:12,229 --> 00:19:13,798
I met my first love at the Bangkok Planetarium.

207
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:15,962
Huh?

208
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:17,917
(This is the only way.)

209
00:19:18,795 --> 00:19:20,376
(Ai must remember the story herself.)

210
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,115
Why are you telling me about your first love?

211
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,974
I just want you to know the story.

212
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,903
I went to school in Korat.

213
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:55,567
I had a chance to join a science competition
at the Bangkok Planetarium.

214
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:01,659
There, I met someone.

215
00:20:02,694 --> 00:20:04,266
We came all the way here.

216
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:06,508
What a shame.

217
00:20:08,093 --> 00:20:09,111
If May hadn’t gotten that one wrong,

218
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,607
we wouldn’t have lost.

219
00:20:13,223 --> 00:20:14,608
I’m…

220
00:20:15,927 --> 00:20:16,915
I’m sorry.

221
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:19,866
You’re completely useless.

222
00:20:20,277 --> 00:20:21,352
You’re just lucky because

223
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:23,373
your dad’s a big shot and your family’s rich.

224
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:25,173
But you really suck.

225
00:20:26,554 --> 00:20:27,105
Ugh!

226
00:20:33,017 --> 00:20:33,971
Hello, Ton.

227
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:36,136
Can you come pick me up?

228
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,385
I don’t want to go back with the others from school.

229
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:42,474
You’re so rich, aren’t you?

230
00:20:42,835 --> 00:20:44,102
Why don’t you give us some money?

231
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,651
Give me back my phone.

232
00:20:48,362 --> 00:20:48,834
Ouch!

233
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:51,377
Ow!

234
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:53,328
Search her bag. See what’s inside.

235
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,077
It’s my bag. Don’t.

236
00:20:58,681 --> 00:20:59,721
Open it.

237
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:03,219
Give it back!

238
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:05,271
You two, grab her.

239
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:12,669
Don’t resist, little rich girl.

240
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,506
I still remember.

241
00:21:24,343 --> 00:21:26,219
She was in a long-sleeved school uniform,

242
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:28,817
with a ribbon around her hair.

243
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,290
AI-OON INGSAMUG

244
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,210
OABOOM INGSAMUG

245
00:21:54,894 --> 00:21:55,714
That’s enough, May.

246
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,868
I don’t wanna hear it.

247
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,800
But Oom…

248
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,328
The sun has set.

249
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,311
There’s nothing to see now.

250
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:07,103
Let’s go.

251
00:22:08,554 --> 00:22:09,585
If we stay,

252
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,352
all that’s left is darkness.

253
00:22:23,296 --> 00:22:24,611
Just like my life. Don’t you think?

254
00:24:06,648 --> 00:24:07,177
Ai.

255
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,515
What were you doing, pretending to be Oom

256
00:24:10,877 --> 00:24:12,117
and hanging out with May?

257
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,909
I can never replace Oom, Grandma.

258
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:20,773
What?

259
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,383
Why would you want to replace her?

260
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:28,961
Oom is Oom.

261
00:24:29,954 --> 00:24:31,426
Ai is Ai.

262
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,560
2022

263
00:25:31,594 --> 00:25:32,315
Let go.

264
00:25:32,788 --> 00:25:33,508
Let go of me.

265
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:35,105
I said let go.

266
00:25:35,623 --> 00:25:36,324
Come with me.

267
00:25:42,448 --> 00:25:42,924
Let go.

268
00:25:43,053 --> 00:25:43,531
Ow!

269
00:25:44,016 --> 00:25:45,127
You’re hurting me.

270
00:25:45,154 --> 00:25:46,170
I said let go.

271
00:25:50,242 --> 00:25:51,318
What are you doing?

272
00:25:51,911 --> 00:25:54,388
I came here with you to say no,

273
00:25:54,404 --> 00:25:55,807
not to let you do this to me.

274
00:25:56,242 --> 00:25:57,580
Stop playing hard to get, Oom.

275
00:25:58,029 --> 00:25:59,404
I know your family is struggling.

276
00:25:59,837 --> 00:26:01,712
I can provide you with a comfortable life.

277
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:03,611
I don’t want it.

278
00:26:04,352 --> 00:26:05,272
You don’t?

279
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:08,256
What are you doing?

280
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,000
Help!

281
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,903
Let go of me.

282
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:10,850
Help!

283
00:26:10,908 --> 00:26:12,410
Help!

284
00:26:12,456 --> 00:26:13,414
Please turn this way.

285
00:26:16,382 --> 00:26:17,220
Show your face more,

286
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,069
so the police won’t get the wrong guy.

287
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:21,017
What are you doing?

288
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:23,822
Do you think I’m stupid enough to walk here alone?

289
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:28,783
Unlawful deprivation of liberty.

290
00:26:29,102 --> 00:26:30,106
Physical assault.

291
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,906
Non-compoundable criminal offenses.

292
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,626
What the heck is this?

293
00:26:48,411 --> 00:26:49,266
Are you alright?

294
00:26:49,914 --> 00:26:50,874
I am.

295
00:26:52,151 --> 00:26:53,037
Thank you for helping.

296
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:54,525
Miss…

297
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:56,380
Metawee. I’m an attorney.

298
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,074
Thank you, Miss Metawee.

299
00:26:59,613 --> 00:27:00,605
I am Oaboom.

300
00:27:13,368 --> 00:27:14,908
Once again, thank you.

301
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:21,762
May!

302
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:22,951
May!

303
00:27:24,598 --> 00:27:26,096
I got accepted into a different airline.

304
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,370
And my new boss is a lot nicer.

305
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,642
Great job. I’m happy for you.

306
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,567
What are you doing?

307
00:27:34,635 --> 00:27:35,260
Are you busy?

308
00:27:41,454 --> 00:27:42,571
Can you help me with something?

309
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,967
Hm?

310
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,530
Could you help read through this case file?

311
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,805
The one for suing that captain? Of course.

312
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,970
OOM, WILL YOU BE MY GIRLFRIEND?

313
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,231
You became quiet.

314
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,500
Anything wrong with the case file?

315
00:28:18,828 --> 00:28:19,515
Nothing is wrong.

316
00:28:21,647 --> 00:28:22,408
Everything is right.

317
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,845
What about my answer?

318
00:28:27,475 --> 00:28:28,404
I love you, May.

319
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:40,405
Hello, there.

320
00:28:43,277 --> 00:28:43,920
Hi.

321
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:48,905
This is Miss Pang, my client.

322
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,471
- This is Oab—
- I’m Oaboom,

323
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,905
May’s girlfriend.

324
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,280
Ah, sure.

325
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:09,005
Thank you so much for coming
to speak with me in person.

326
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,705
I’ll make sure to consider the offer from your firm.

327
00:29:19,623 --> 00:29:21,174
What was that about this time, Oom?

328
00:29:21,632 --> 00:29:22,605
I saw it.

329
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,238
I saw the way she looked at you.

330
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:30,160
Miss Pang is one of the stakeholders
of many hospital chains.

331
00:29:30,257 --> 00:29:31,829
She is going to be my client.

332
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:34,001
No, May.

333
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,062
From the way she looks at you, I can tell she’s not.

334
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,512
What kind of look?

335
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,668
May, do you really love me at all?

336
00:30:23,028 --> 00:30:23,515
Oom.

337
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:25,595
Oom.

338
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:26,561
Grandma.

339
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:28,321
What’s wrong, dear?

340
00:30:28,838 --> 00:30:29,974
What’s going on?

341
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:33,663
Why, Grandma?

342
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,912
Why does no one love me?

343
00:30:38,022 --> 00:30:39,000
Grandma.

344
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:44,771
I don’t get it.

345
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,090
Why?

346
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,722
Why?

347
00:30:52,782 --> 00:30:55,257
Oom loved that girl May so much.

348
00:30:56,131 --> 00:30:57,376
That’s why I was shocked

349
00:30:57,711 --> 00:31:00,303
when she told me she would marry Paul.

350
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,204
All she said was that May didn’t love her.

351
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,626
But when I went to see her as Oaboom,

352
00:31:14,894 --> 00:31:16,702
she seemed to really love Oom.

353
00:31:18,496 --> 00:31:22,008
Didn’t Oom tell you to break up with May for her?

354
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:23,527
Yes.

355
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:27,804
Then everything is up to you now, isn’t it?

356
00:31:32,213 --> 00:31:33,140
I’m scared.

357
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,776
I’m scared that if she knows I’m Ai-oon, not Oaboom,

358
00:31:40,617 --> 00:31:41,714
she’ll hate me.

359
00:31:43,223 --> 00:31:43,834
Ai.

360
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,708
You can’t be Oaboom forever, dear.

361
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,214
If one day Oom wakes up and breaks up with May,

362
00:31:52,574 --> 00:31:54,614
May will be heartbroken, anyway.

363
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,269
But I don’t want her to be heartbroken.

364
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,164
When did my granddaughter
become such a good person?

365
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,408
Oh, come on, Grandma.

366
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,176
The person you love…

367
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:29,435
is Ai-oon,

368
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:32,216
my twin sister.

369
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,705
If you want to leave me because I’m blind,

370
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,724
you don’t have to do this.

371
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,201
You love her so much, don’t you?

372
00:32:58,899 --> 00:32:59,616
That girl, I mean.

373
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,709
Don’t you want to see her at least once in your life?

374
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:07,207
What do you want, Oom?

375
00:33:14,054 --> 00:33:14,768
I want you to fight.

376
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,869
Don’t let yourself become weak like this.

377
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:24,171
Be the Metawee you once were.

378
00:33:27,124 --> 00:33:27,921
If you can do that,

379
00:33:28,305 --> 00:33:29,411
I’ll step aside and break up with you.

380
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,300
If you’re really not that person,

381
00:33:34,757 --> 00:33:36,014
break up with me now.

382
00:33:45,894 --> 00:33:47,804
We may not love each other that much,

383
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,311
but I’m not cruel enough to
hand someone like you over to my sister.

384
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,207
And that’d be too easy for someone like you.

385
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:16,417
People like you, May,

386
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,174
must pay for what you did.

387
00:34:26,345 --> 00:34:26,930
Oom.

388
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,257
Oom!

389
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:56,829
Am I…

390
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,105
seeing things?

391
00:35:05,097 --> 00:35:07,934
The brain bleed has started to recover.

392
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,517
Your vision will improve gradually.

393
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:18,619
I thought I’d have to pay for
this karma for the rest of my life.

394
00:35:20,805 --> 00:35:24,103
Suffering for two years
is already unusually long.

395
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,903
That’s why I believe I’m paying the price.

396
00:35:30,988 --> 00:35:35,515
Then I think you’re about to pay it off.

397
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:37,724
Not yet.

398
00:35:40,674 --> 00:35:42,869
This thing with Ai still leaves me hopeless.

399
00:35:43,788 --> 00:35:45,312
You’re not that hopeless.

400
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,303
Don’t you know? While you’re here,

401
00:35:48,687 --> 00:35:50,008
she’s waiting for you outside.

402
00:35:52,263 --> 00:35:53,100
Ai is here?

403
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:54,619
Yes.

404
00:35:56,173 --> 00:35:59,570
You can’t let someone like that
slip through your fingers, May.

405
00:36:08,456 --> 00:36:09,899
I didn’t think you’d come.

406
00:36:17,752 --> 00:36:18,629
Have a seat right here.

407
00:36:31,103 --> 00:36:32,308
I’m sorry about the other day.

408
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:35,980
I suddenly got something to think about.

409
00:36:52,884 --> 00:36:53,914
I get you.

410
00:36:56,074 --> 00:36:57,764
It was gonna be our first time anyway.

411
00:37:04,145 --> 00:37:04,965
Our first time?

412
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:10,573
Just like I told you,

413
00:37:12,336 --> 00:37:14,376
I’ve never given in to anyone
as much as I did with you.

414
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:23,007
Not even the old Oom.

415
00:37:24,914 --> 00:37:25,711
What about…

416
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:28,607
Your first love?

417
00:37:30,543 --> 00:37:31,608
(I’m sorry, Ai.)

418
00:37:32,548 --> 00:37:34,176
(I want to see you more clearly.)

419
00:37:35,493 --> 00:37:37,321
(Once I can see how you look at me,

420
00:37:38,063 --> 00:37:39,302
(I’ll tell you everything.)

421
00:37:40,611 --> 00:37:42,108
How should I say this

422
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,308
so you’ll understand how I feel?

423
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:19,976
You called me here right after my shift,

424
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:23,416
just to eat the congee sold near my apartment?

425
00:38:24,496 --> 00:38:26,500
Well, I wanted you to see something
you like once you got here.

426
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:28,225
By that, I mean the congee...

427
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,834
Since you don’t like me yet.

428
00:38:36,122 --> 00:38:37,103
What kind of joke was that?

429
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:46,404
Hey, I had my fortune read.

430
00:38:46,954 --> 00:38:51,219
It said my soulmate was already
present in my life these days.

431
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:03,911
Hello.

432
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:08,117
Yes, you can come in.

433
00:39:12,407 --> 00:39:13,191
Who’s coming?

434
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:16,007
I ordered some plants.

435
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,173
I’ll be right back.

436
00:39:18,112 --> 00:39:18,730
I’ll go with you.

437
00:39:33,857 --> 00:39:34,641
Hey, you.

438
00:39:37,597 --> 00:39:38,158
Pang.

439
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,207
What a coincidence.

440
00:40:00,453 --> 00:40:01,500
But I’m glad.

441
00:40:03,962 --> 00:40:05,711
You told me yourself that

442
00:40:06,017 --> 00:40:08,160
we should be true to our feelings.

443
00:40:09,651 --> 00:40:11,404
Let me know if there’s any problem with the plants.

444
00:40:12,954 --> 00:40:14,171
You have a good memory.

445
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:24,472
Are you guys thirsty?

446
00:40:25,002 --> 00:40:26,404
I’ll go get you some water.

447
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,973
Sure. Thank you.

448
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,808
It’s obvious.

449
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,511
Pim still has feelings for you.

450
00:40:51,521 --> 00:40:53,308
Pim might seem composed,

451
00:40:53,982 --> 00:40:55,903
but she’s actually quite clingy.

452
00:40:56,844 --> 00:40:59,004
And she loves congee so much,

453
00:40:59,588 --> 00:41:01,607
especially the type with lots of ginger.

454
00:41:02,447 --> 00:41:04,115
Just like how old people like it, don’t you think?

455
00:41:06,065 --> 00:41:07,401
What are you trying to tell me?

456
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,011
Are you saying you still have feelings for her?

457
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,653
I guess I’m just the third wheel,

458
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,305
just like Oom.

459
00:41:20,167 --> 00:41:21,623
Hold that thought about Oom.

460
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,168
Let me explain myself first.

461
00:41:24,355 --> 00:41:28,207
I told you all this because
I don’t have feelings for Pim anymore.

462
00:41:30,597 --> 00:41:31,807
Pim is a nice person,

463
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:34,712
and I’m happy she has you.

464
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:39,580
Like you said,

465
00:41:40,195 --> 00:41:42,711
love and love should be together.

466
00:42:07,788 --> 00:42:09,071
Damn. What a small world.

467
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,121
And how small is our country’s population, really?

468
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:16,011
Your girlfriend met Jan

469
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,528
because she works on Oom’s case.

470
00:42:18,589 --> 00:42:19,420
Ex-girlfriend.

471
00:42:20,435 --> 00:42:21,577
Yeah, that.

472
00:42:24,216 --> 00:42:25,318
But what a coincidence.

473
00:42:26,705 --> 00:42:29,069
You like Jan,

474
00:42:29,711 --> 00:42:32,871
but Jan likes your ex-girlfriend.

475
00:42:35,118 --> 00:42:36,040
Dammit.

476
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:39,367
A series of broken hearts.

477
00:42:43,819 --> 00:42:44,906
Look on the bright side.

478
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,712
At least you moved on.

479
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,804
You didn’t get stuck with me.

480
00:42:50,745 --> 00:42:51,520
Gosh.

481
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:53,558
What about you?

482
00:42:54,127 --> 00:42:55,808
You did so much for her.

483
00:42:56,112 --> 00:42:58,422
I bet she’s head over heels for you by now.

484
00:42:59,081 --> 00:43:00,705
Tell her the truth already.

485
00:43:01,921 --> 00:43:03,011
I don’t think she loves me.

486
00:43:06,485 --> 00:43:07,327
She loves Oom

487
00:43:08,217 --> 00:43:09,798
because Oom is her first love.

488
00:43:10,823 --> 00:43:11,620
Look at me.

489
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,268
How could I fight someone
who’s got her heart for that long?

490
00:43:19,008 --> 00:43:20,872
But Jan told me

491
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,767
that Oom didn’t love Paul.

492
00:43:25,045 --> 00:43:27,760
And Oom was the third wheel.

493
00:43:29,081 --> 00:43:30,718
If she was,

494
00:43:31,565 --> 00:43:33,265
then who exactly is May’s first love?

495
00:43:34,503 --> 00:43:35,314
Is it you?

496
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:38,111
Me?

497
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,368
Back in the day, you liked wearing
Oom’s uniform just to mess with her.

498
00:43:42,551 --> 00:43:43,600
Are you nuts?

499
00:43:43,628 --> 00:43:45,157
The chances are close to none.

500
00:43:45,669 --> 00:43:47,102
Then Jan lied to me.

501
00:43:47,131 --> 00:43:48,216
And why would Jan lie to you?

502
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,570
Damn it!

503
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,515
You shoot down every suggestion I make!

504
00:43:54,742 --> 00:43:55,611
- Holy shit.
- Shit.

505
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,428
You’re so clever, Panita.

506
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,284
But your hair stinks. You should wash it.

507
00:44:04,302 --> 00:44:04,933
Hey.

508
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,303
Where are you going? You’re drunk.

509
00:44:07,998 --> 00:44:08,835
I’ll call a cab or something.

510
00:44:13,314 --> 00:44:14,377
It doesn’t stink.

511
00:44:19,946 --> 00:44:21,802
Ai, your house is spinning.

512
00:44:26,871 --> 00:44:29,001
Benjapol’s case is going back to trial?

513
00:44:29,881 --> 00:44:31,308
The case was almost two years ago.

514
00:44:31,863 --> 00:44:33,574
I had an attorney friend help Ben.

515
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:37,416
He’s now pursuing a civil suit
to get more compensation

516
00:44:38,964 --> 00:44:41,616
because what he received before
was completely unfair.

517
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:43,808
What exactly are you doing, May?

518
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:46,724
I’m trying to redeem myself.

519
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,571
But you were the defendant’s attorney.

520
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,709
Don’t you think it’s a little funny?

521
00:44:52,284 --> 00:44:53,973
I did my duty as an attorney back then,

522
00:44:55,705 --> 00:45:00,777
but now, I’m helping him out of moral duty.

523
00:45:04,462 --> 00:45:06,202
But what about the trouble you might face

524
00:45:06,773 --> 00:45:08,619
for going up against that jerk, Batman?

525
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:10,429
I’m not going up against him.

526
00:45:13,022 --> 00:45:14,426
I’m going up against my dad.

527
00:45:17,395 --> 00:45:18,671
After these past two years,

528
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:22,509
I won’t let him have the upper hand anymore.

529
00:45:25,065 --> 00:45:26,005
Can you drive me?

530
00:45:27,342 --> 00:45:28,917
Leave your car here and use mine.

531
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,177
My car’s in the shop anyway.

532
00:45:31,928 --> 00:45:32,914
We’ll take yours.

533
00:45:45,071 --> 00:45:46,706
May left with Dr. Ton for Korat?

534
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:48,111
That’s right, ma’am.

535
00:45:48,518 --> 00:45:50,515
I saw them off just now.

536
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,712
I heard they’re working on some case.

537
00:45:55,081 --> 00:45:56,106
Then I’ll just leave…

538
00:46:03,662 --> 00:46:04,211
Well.

539
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:05,808
I’d rather stay a little longer.

540
00:46:05,979 --> 00:46:08,131
I’m a bit drunk.

541
00:46:08,148 --> 00:46:09,020
Don’t wanna leave now.

542
00:46:13,235 --> 00:46:14,607
Oom, are you so drunk?

543
00:46:15,985 --> 00:46:17,917
I’m not that drunk, May.

544
00:46:18,028 --> 00:46:19,013
Don’t exaggerate.

545
00:46:21,413 --> 00:46:22,500
(If you weren’t, )

546
00:46:22,795 --> 00:46:24,168
you would’ve told me before coming.

547
00:46:24,933 --> 00:46:26,314
But instead, you showed up unannounced.

548
00:46:27,828 --> 00:46:28,508
Right.

549
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:31,629
May.

550
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,977
I’m sorry for not listening to
the story of your first love before.

551
00:46:38,037 --> 00:46:39,816
Can you tell me the story again?

552
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:42,555
Well, then.

553
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:45,820
Get up and grab my photo album.

554
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,405
(You’ll find pictures of me from 10th grade.)

555
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:58,014
(I met my first love…)

556
00:46:59,391 --> 00:47:00,517
at the Bangkok Planetarium.

557
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,312
Don’t resist, little rich girl.

558
00:47:21,546 --> 00:47:22,102
Mint,

559
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:24,970
when will you stop extorting people for money?

560
00:47:29,779 --> 00:47:31,066
Don’t you dare butt in.

561
00:47:33,997 --> 00:47:34,512
Ouch.

562
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:42,613
Now what?

563
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:45,410
Wanna come again?

564
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:46,540
Get up.

565
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,414
You will pay for this.

566
00:47:57,493 --> 00:47:58,416
Hey, Specs.

567
00:47:59,265 --> 00:48:00,056
Why didn’t you fight back?

568
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,216
How could I fight them?

569
00:48:11,571 --> 00:48:13,872
People have their own ways of fighting.

570
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:15,875
How else would they get through life?

571
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,228
Are you just gonna let yourself
be bullied forever?

572
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:26,308
Here.

573
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:48,570
(Do you remember now, Oom?)

574
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:51,351
Y–yeah.

575
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,762
That’s great.

576
00:48:58,414 --> 00:48:59,327
And…

577
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,457
See the mug my housemaid gave you?

578
00:49:05,522 --> 00:49:06,112
Ah-huh.

579
00:49:07,894 --> 00:49:09,114
The one you like to use.

580
00:49:10,851 --> 00:49:14,161
I bought it that day to represent you.

581
00:49:16,226 --> 00:49:17,084
(Now, )

582
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:21,120
you have no reason to deny me

583
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:22,906
when I want to hug you.

584
00:49:28,109 --> 00:49:28,712
Uh-hm.

585
00:49:30,442 --> 00:49:31,291
I’m gonna hang up now.

586
00:49:31,465 --> 00:49:32,567
See you back at home.

587
00:49:41,282 --> 00:49:43,420
Was I really May’s first love?

588
00:49:45,466 --> 00:49:46,029
Shit.

589
00:49:50,299 --> 00:49:51,002
Gosh.

590
00:49:54,299 --> 00:49:54,878
Jeez!

591
00:49:58,881 --> 00:49:59,417
Gosh!

592
00:50:06,422 --> 00:50:08,105
When will May come back?

593
00:50:09,216 --> 00:50:11,662
I want to hug her now. What should I do?

594
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:19,173
You couldn’t tell her directly,

595
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:21,776
so you had your housemaid plant
the photo album for her to find

596
00:50:22,072 --> 00:50:23,075
and remember on her own.

597
00:50:24,506 --> 00:50:25,285
You’re really something.

598
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:29,976
If Ai confesses about the pretense,

599
00:50:31,336 --> 00:50:32,825
I’ll be upset for a few days.

600
00:50:35,336 --> 00:50:36,611
But if she keeps it a secret,

601
00:50:37,807 --> 00:50:39,414
at least I’ll know she’s not turning me down.

602
00:50:40,528 --> 00:50:41,985
All I want is for her to be mine.

603
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,148
Then, when it comes to Ben,

604
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,721
his mother,

605
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,608
or Kosol,

606
00:50:48,848 --> 00:50:50,382
she'll overlook them all for me.

607
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,226
Don’t you think God is on your side a little too much?

608
00:50:59,635 --> 00:51:01,317
God already gave me a sign

609
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,465
by letting me see again.

610
00:51:09,813 --> 00:51:13,308
When are you going to tell Ai-oon
about your sight recovery?

611
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:19,311
When I can look her in the eye with my own eyes

612
00:51:22,047 --> 00:51:23,819
and clearly see that she loves me.

613
00:51:43,093 --> 00:51:43,899
Hello, Ko.

614
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:46,773
The ride I asked you to fix...

615
00:51:46,882 --> 00:51:47,610
Has it been done?

616
00:51:50,327 --> 00:51:52,503
Yes. I’ll use it to see my girlfriend.

617
00:51:53,823 --> 00:51:55,180
I’m going to have a girlfriend tomorrow.

618
00:52:25,373 --> 00:52:27,576
I want to make it up to you for being silly last time.

619
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,435
I didn’t take you on an overnight trip.

620
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,487
Overnight trip?

621
00:52:33,419 --> 00:52:35,133
On the surface of Pluto,

622
00:52:35,965 --> 00:52:37,506
there’s an area shaped like a heart.

623
00:52:38,417 --> 00:52:40,007
I’m giving you the heart of Pluto.

624
00:52:46,456 --> 00:52:47,514
I love you, May.
