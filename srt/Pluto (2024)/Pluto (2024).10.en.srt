1
00:00:00,364 --> 00:00:01,419
(This is the first time

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,171
I’ve ever been glad

3
00:00:04,413 --> 00:00:05,508
(that May can’t see.)

4
00:00:06,171 --> 00:00:07,619
I want to see May.

5
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:11,105
The doctor said Oom lost
her short-term memory.

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,663
You know I’m the reason she’s blind,

7
00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:16,687
yet you let me love her.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,068
2022

9
00:00:22,075 --> 00:00:25,007
I saw street racers tearing up the road.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,533
Then a white car crashed
into them and sped off.

11
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:31,090
I think they’re seriously injured...

12
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,114
or maybe even dead.

13
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:38,251
Ai-oon.

14
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:40,905
Gosh.

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,720
Grandma!

16
00:00:46,994 --> 00:00:47,546
Grandma.

17
00:00:47,703 --> 00:00:48,322
Ai!

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,257
Ai, where are you?

19
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:49,842
Ai.

20
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:51,125
Help!

21
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:51,896
Grandma!

22
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:53,091
Grandma.

23
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,410
How is she?

24
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,256
When will you stop
breaking Grandma's heart?

25
00:01:04,537 --> 00:01:07,777
Do you want her to die
before you stop acting like a maniac?

26
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:33,417
How’s your grandma?

27
00:01:33,908 --> 00:01:34,908
She’s better now.

28
00:01:37,905 --> 00:01:38,905
That’s good.

29
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,100
What about Ben?

30
00:01:47,577 --> 00:01:48,577
In a coma.

31
00:01:48,737 --> 00:01:49,737
It’s bad.

32
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,520
The doctor said we
should expect a grim result.

33
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:55,506
His mom cried so hard.

34
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,410
It’s all because of that f♪cking prick.

35
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:05,650
Just wait until I see him again...

36
00:02:05,672 --> 00:02:06,711
he’s gonna pay.

37
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,610
Count me in.

38
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:11,186
Guys.

39
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,579
What are we even doing?

40
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:38,653
Let go.

41
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,970
How much money do you want?

42
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,610
I know...

43
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:46,351
you're trying to make money
to continue your studies,

44
00:02:47,915 --> 00:02:49,114
pay for your motorbike,

45
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,281
and support Grandma.

46
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,580
You're doing all this because

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,724
you want to change your life, right?

48
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:03,099
But can you at least not change it
in such a stupid way?

49
00:03:03,254 --> 00:03:04,254
You take any job offered.

50
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:06,232
You come home late at
night, smelling like alcohol.

51
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:08,216
Grandma's worried about
you, don’t you know that?

52
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:11,191
I didn’t have much choice like you, did I?

53
00:03:11,717 --> 00:03:13,856
So here I am, helping you find a way out.

54
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:17,226
I’ll give you money.

55
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:19,899
Go back to your studies.

56
00:03:20,755 --> 00:03:21,970
Don’t take any risky jobs

57
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:23,686
or any job that requires getting drunk.

58
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,051
Don’t make Grandma worry.

59
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,205
Then, after you graduate,

60
00:03:29,278 --> 00:03:30,717
you can pay me back.

61
00:03:33,294 --> 00:03:33,877
But I don’t...

62
00:03:33,891 --> 00:03:35,226
If you refuse,

63
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,308
I’ll tell Grandma everything,

64
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,789
including your bar hostess job.

65
00:03:39,798 --> 00:03:41,410
CHERRY

66
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,823
Okay?

67
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,150
Do we have an understanding?

68
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:51,414
Go home. Grandma’s waiting for you.

69
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,490
What about you?

70
00:03:58,285 --> 00:03:59,285
I have a date.

71
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
I already told Grandma.

72
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,597
Go home.

73
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,620
Hello.

74
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:12,986
I’m at the location I shared with you.

75
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:28,965
Did I keep you waiting?

76
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,610
I can wait, no matter how long.

77
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:34,797
Get in.

78
00:04:53,112 --> 00:04:54,112
Ugh!

79
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,490
Here.

80
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,419
You should eat something.

81
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,010
Your housemaid said you didn’t eat much.

82
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,127
I don’t want to.

83
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,460
Eat, and you’ll stay looking pretty.

84
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:25,921
Don’t get on my nerves.

85
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,680
Instead of being sad and gloomy,

86
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,183
you should do something.

87
00:06:32,874 --> 00:06:34,594
I told you to call Ai-oon, but you refused.

88
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,830
You don’t go see her.

89
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:38,028
I did everything I could.

90
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,586
It all depends on Ai now.

91
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,207
What if she decides to leave you?

92
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:45,872
Will you accept that?

93
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:50,782
Can I not accept that?

94
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,269
May.

95
00:07:05,722 --> 00:07:06,722
Oom!

96
00:07:11,102 --> 00:07:12,481
I thought you’d disappear.

97
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:17,438
I’m here now.

98
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,257
There’s only one way out for you.

99
00:07:22,937 --> 00:07:24,503
Tell Oom and May the truth.

100
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:27,576
Someone will end up hurt no matter what.

101
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,260
But, at least,

102
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,506
the truth will help them understand you.

103
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,511
I have something to talk to you about.

104
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:44,219
I’ve also got something to say.

105
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,835
I’ll just freeze this for you then.

106
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
You guys can talk.

107
00:08:06,724 --> 00:08:08,205
I have something for you, May.

108
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,512
I think I know what it is.

109
00:08:36,074 --> 00:08:37,706
You’ve got a nose like a cat’s.

110
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,510
Meow.

111
00:09:04,884 --> 00:09:05,884
How is it?

112
00:09:08,074 --> 00:09:09,074
Very good.

113
00:09:11,408 --> 00:09:12,820
But this is my favorite.

114
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,040
I made it for you once,
and you copied my recipe?

115
00:09:17,997 --> 00:09:18,997
That’s right.

116
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,514
It’s become my favorite now.

117
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:24,460
And it will always be.

118
00:09:44,432 --> 00:09:45,912
The thing you wanna talk to me about,

119
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:48,127
what is it?

120
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,207
About your favorite food.

121
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:02,586
But I think we have
something else to talk about.

122
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:07,005
There’s nothing else to talk about.

123
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,862
But...

124
00:10:11,888 --> 00:10:13,180
Tomorrow will be better, May.

125
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:17,023
I will make you happy like you once were.

126
00:10:20,014 --> 00:10:21,014
Trust me.

127
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:29,525
Mm.

128
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,407
If you want me to trust you,

129
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,650
I’ll trust you.

130
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,674
Starting with obeying me then.

131
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:49,128
Let me feed you.

132
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:51,613
Yum.

133
00:10:58,709 --> 00:10:59,709
Wow.

134
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:03,505
This is even better than the one I made.

135
00:11:13,146 --> 00:11:14,146
Meow.

136
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:18,533
Meow.

137
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,310
Meow.

138
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:46,533
Meow.

139
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,644
Here.

140
00:11:47,877 --> 00:11:48,877
Eat more.

141
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:00,786
Yum.

142
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:05,703
Is it good?

143
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,311
Do you promise not to peek?

144
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,970
Yes, I promise.

145
00:12:25,148 --> 00:12:26,148
May?

146
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,524
Are your eyes closed?

147
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,789
They are.

148
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,868
Actually, you don’t have to surprise me.

149
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:39,882
A heart so in love can’t
be stopped by anything.

150
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,180
Haven’t you heard?

151
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:44,284
Who said that?

152
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:45,565
I did.

153
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:48,214
So don’t bother trying to stop me.

154
00:12:49,915 --> 00:12:50,915
Can I open my eyes now?

155
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,280
Yes, you can.

156
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,854
Surprise!

157
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,666
Here it is,

158
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:13,605
something couples should have.

159
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:19,521
Couples?

160
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:30,555
You can open it now.

161
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,580
Whoa.

162
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:46,251
Are they cute?

163
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:47,564
I handpicked them myself.

164
00:13:50,202 --> 00:13:51,202
They’re so cute.

165
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,059
You handpicked them yourself?

166
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:09,211
Yes.

167
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:13,087
I touched them

168
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,014
and knew it’s a star.

169
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:20,508
It reminded me of you.

170
00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:32,238
I want this star to orbit close to me.

171
00:14:35,401 --> 00:14:36,401
How lovely.

172
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,835
Thank you.

173
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:46,591
Since I’m so lovely,

174
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,220
I should get a reward.

175
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:53,179
How about…

176
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,630
we wear these couple slippers
for the rest of our lives?

177
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:18,829
One, two.

178
00:15:19,637 --> 00:15:20,637
One more.

179
00:15:23,114 --> 00:15:24,114
Okay.

180
00:15:24,262 --> 00:15:25,746
Ah, my legs.

181
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,080
Here, let me give you a massage.

182
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
You cheeky.

183
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:33,044
What?

184
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:34,797
What are you thinking?

185
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:36,330
I was just offering you a leg massage.

186
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,620
Thinking of cheeky stuff.

187
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,626
Gotcha! You wicked thing.

188
00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:55,804
Hey.

189
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,204
Will I still be this happy tomorrow?

190
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,991
Whether it’s tomorrow...

191
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,564
or any other day,

192
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:38,933
I just want you to be happy every day.

193
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:43,743
But my happiness

194
00:16:48,662 --> 00:16:50,705
comes from us being together, forever.

195
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,405
I wish we could be like that too.

196
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,374
♪ I believe every tale
is by fate’s design ♪

197
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,721
♪ Like our life paths are predestined ♪

198
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:22,400
♪ Time keeps us apart,
though our souls intertwined ♪

199
00:18:23,531 --> 00:18:27,001
♪ I know storms may come
to unleash their wrath ♪

200
00:18:27,457 --> 00:18:31,238
♪ But I beg that they succumb to our love ♪

201
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:36,955
♪ No obstacles, big or
small, can intimidate us ♪

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:45,364
♪ May destiny bring us together tight ♪

203
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:53,029
♪ I plead with the stars
and the moon’s gentle light ♪

204
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:57,832
♪ Though shadows may
fall in the depths of the night ♪

205
00:18:57,939 --> 00:19:00,709

♪ Forever beautiful, never fade away ♪

208
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:54,515
Can I come in?

209
00:19:56,508 --> 00:19:57,508
Mm.

210
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,650
Falling asleep gets harder
when you’re old, huh?

211
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:13,388
Should I tell you a ghost story?

212
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:15,207
I’m your grandma.

213
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,902
I raised you since you were a baby.

214
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:20,377
Do you think I don’t know how you feel?

215
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,530
I’m sorry for asking you

216
00:20:33,311 --> 00:20:36,700
not to tell Oom about you and May.

217
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,727
Your little sister really needs May.

218
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:44,911
Wait until she remembers everything,

219
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:47,946
then I’ll help talk to
her about you and May.

220
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,943
I can’t go back to May anymore, Grandma.

221
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,401
I can never tell her the truth anymore.

222
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:00,594
Why not?

223
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:10,585
2023 AFTER THE COURT’S VERDICT

224
00:21:10,626 --> 00:21:11,976
Hello. What is it, Ko?

225
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:13,586
I need to get to the exam room now.

226
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,700
(Listen.)

227
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,278
(Ben’s mom just passed.)

228
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,117
His mom committed suicide

229
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,760
just to get the insurance money
for Ben’s treatment.

230
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:24,056
I’d like to know.

231
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,400
Who the hell is that attorney?

232
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:28,468
I’ll get payback for Ben and his mom.

233
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,817
I did it, Grandma.

234
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,468
If I hadn’t wanted to
know who the attorney was,

235
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:47,908
if I hadn’t wanted payback
for Ben and his mom,

236
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,665
Ko wouldn’t have done what he did.

237
00:21:54,451 --> 00:21:55,451
Ai.

238
00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:59,336
But you didn’t want any of this to happen.

239
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:00,819
No.

240
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,804
No, Grandma.

241
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:06,112
I did it.

242
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,604
I helped Ko hurt May.

243
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,605
MR. PAINT’S GARAGE

244
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:17,671
Hello.

245
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:20,017
You’re stopping by?

246
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,734
Let me check for a moment if I have it.

247
00:22:27,885 --> 00:22:28,885
Okay.

248
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:30,382
You can stop by.

249
00:22:32,124 --> 00:22:33,124
Ko!

250
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:35,517
Ko!

251
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,303
Where the hell are you going?

252
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,213
A customer is coming.

253
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:41,829
Let him go, sir.

254
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,274
I’ll take his shift tonight.

255
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:45,909
What are you doing, Ai?

256
00:22:45,974 --> 00:22:47,554
He must have something to handle.

257
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,005
Come on. I’ll work instead.

258
00:22:50,198 --> 00:22:51,198
Please.

259
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:52,819
Fine. Let’s do what you said.

260
00:22:53,911 --> 00:22:55,071
I’ll leave the garage to you.

261
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,462
People like that deserve it.

262
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:03,757
Ai!

263
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,554
I did it, Grandma.

264
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:13,342
I’m the reason May’s blind.

265
00:23:16,122 --> 00:23:18,320
Grandma. It was my fault.

266
00:23:19,477 --> 00:23:22,668
She’s blind because of me.

267
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,685
Grandma.

268
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:36,081
I did it.

269
00:23:36,693 --> 00:23:39,557
I freaking did it, Grandma.

270
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:12,398
May.

271
00:25:15,063 --> 00:25:16,558
Gosh, I missed you so much.

272
00:25:44,103 --> 00:25:46,358
The results show no sign of abnormalities.

273
00:25:49,451 --> 00:25:50,451
Congratulations.

274
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,300
You get to see your
girlfriend’s face more clearly now.

275
00:25:57,922 --> 00:25:58,922
I already did.

276
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,060
But she was not Ai-oon.

277
00:26:09,145 --> 00:26:10,145
She was Oaboom.

278
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,850
Are you happy

279
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,407
to see my face more clearly, May?

280
00:26:26,435 --> 00:26:27,435
Of course, I am.

281
00:26:29,008 --> 00:26:30,154
Besides me,

282
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:32,376
what else do you wanna see?

283
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:36,063
I will take you anywhere.

284
00:26:47,511 --> 00:26:49,669
I want to eat our favorite dish.

285
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:57,721
Our favorite dish?

286
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:05,440
Don’t tell me you forgot already.

287
00:27:09,881 --> 00:27:11,016
How could I forget?

288
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:15,419
Minced shrimp omelet with holy basil.

289
00:27:16,675 --> 00:27:18,420
I made one for you yesterday.

290
00:27:19,094 --> 00:27:20,420
But if you want it again,

291
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,370
I’ll make it for you again.

292
00:27:41,466 --> 00:27:43,407
Why do we need to talk so late at night?

293
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,400
Can’t it wait until tomorrow?

294
00:27:46,518 --> 00:27:48,351
If it could, I wouldn’t have woken you up.

295
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,500
Grandma said you wanted to see May.

296
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,310
Definitely.

297
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,155
But Grandma said I needed to wait
until May came back from overseas.

298
00:28:02,045 --> 00:28:03,103
She’s not overseas.

299
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
What?

300
00:28:07,106 --> 00:28:08,106
How come?

301
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:09,699
Does that mean Grandma lied?

302
00:28:10,804 --> 00:28:13,186
Then where is May now?

303
00:28:15,677 --> 00:28:17,437
There’s something
important you should know.

304
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:21,789
May became blind

305
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,710
before you got into the accident
and lost your memories.

306
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,300
Grandma sent me to
take care of May for you.

307
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,280
She was afraid May’d get stressed.

308
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,200
Now it’s time for you to go back
and take care of May yourself.

309
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,084
Thank you so much, Ai,

310
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,949
for taking care of her for me.

311
00:29:06,887 --> 00:29:08,807
I’ll tell you everything that happened

312
00:29:08,862 --> 00:29:10,182
during your time in the hospital.

313
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:14,657
But you can’t let her know

314
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:16,678
that I disguised myself as you.

315
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:19,722
This morning,

316
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:25,174
I saw you didn’t wear
the slippers I gave you.

317
00:29:26,768 --> 00:29:27,768
Don’t you like them?

318
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,216
I like them very much.

319
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,120
As for the slippers,

320
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:37,644
tell her you took them
back to wear at home.

321
00:29:39,075 --> 00:29:40,195
They will remind you of her.

322
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,450
Okay.

323
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,284
Where are the slippers though?

324
00:29:48,362 --> 00:29:49,362
I wanna wear them.

325
00:29:54,115 --> 00:29:55,115
Well…

326
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,198
I’m not sure where I put them.

327
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:00,266
I don’t remember.

328
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:03,703
I’ll give them to you once I find them.

329
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:09,011
This morning, when
you were still sleeping in,

330
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:12,811
I went back home to Grandma
to give food offerings.

331
00:30:13,554 --> 00:30:15,321
I took the slippers with me.

332
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,900
So when I wear them
at home, I’ll think of you.

333
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:24,438
Should we hit a supermarket?

334
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,422
Let’s buy the ingredients
to make our favorite dish.

335
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,401
Celebrate your sight recovery.

336
00:30:34,512 --> 00:30:35,512
May.

337
00:30:38,484 --> 00:30:39,484
May.

338
00:30:40,324 --> 00:30:41,324
May!

339
00:30:41,558 --> 00:30:42,145
Are you okay?

340
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:43,319
I got something urgent to do.

341
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:44,274
I need to go now.

342
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:44,832
What?

343
00:30:45,174 --> 00:30:46,174
May.

344
00:31:21,374 --> 00:31:22,505
Hi. Hi. Hi.

345
00:31:22,893 --> 00:31:24,303
You can see me now, can’t you?

346
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,580
I’m so happy. How wonderful.

347
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,976
Once I knew, I went out to buy you
every flavor of macarons.

348
00:31:30,374 --> 00:31:31,476
Which should be our starter?

349
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,500
How about this?

350
00:31:37,471 --> 00:31:38,471
Hey, what’s wrong?

351
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,608
Ai gave everything we shared to Oom.

352
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:51,549
She left me.

353
00:31:58,805 --> 00:31:59,872
Ai left you?

354
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,875
She's a bit too good of a
big sister, don’t you think?

355
00:32:08,697 --> 00:32:10,114
She disguised herself as Oom,

356
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,840
made you fall in love with her,

357
00:32:12,905 --> 00:32:14,524
and then left you after Oom woke up.

358
00:32:19,078 --> 00:32:20,628
I think there’s a reason behind this.

359
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:37,379
Did you come with Ton?

360
00:33:23,674 --> 00:33:24,674
How are you?

361
00:33:28,601 --> 00:33:29,601
I’m all good.

362
00:33:30,912 --> 00:33:31,924
Seriously.

363
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:34,890
Yes, I’m okay.

364
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,802
If I’m not, you’ll be the first to know.

365
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:49,862
Ai,

366
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,602
you know there’s another way, don’t you?

367
00:33:57,105 --> 00:33:59,077
You don’t have to do this.

368
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:06,472
I’ve already made my choice.

369
00:34:08,392 --> 00:34:09,392
The choice I made

370
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:11,555
will save everyone’s feelings.

371
00:34:12,568 --> 00:34:13,568
Everyone?

372
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,823
Are you included?

373
00:34:24,047 --> 00:34:26,148
It’s settled. This is the best solution.

374
00:34:57,201 --> 00:34:58,674
You found the guy who injured you,

375
00:34:59,428 --> 00:35:00,712
but you did nothing?

376
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,626
He might’ve hurt me,

377
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,620
but I’m the reason his friend is disabled

378
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,420
and...

379
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:22,192
the reason his friend’s
mom committed suicide.

380
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:36,096
After I got back from
your restaurant’s opening,

381
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,866
I met up with Kosol.

382
00:35:41,379 --> 00:35:44,164
Yes, I was the one that hit you.

383
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,130
What are you doing?

384
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:57,111
I’m ready.

385
00:35:57,534 --> 00:35:59,164
You can call the police on me.

386
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,779
After seeing you pass out,

387
00:36:10,697 --> 00:36:12,517
I’ve felt like the biggest piece of shit.

388
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:16,059
I’m a coward.

389
00:36:17,192 --> 00:36:19,182
I don’t have the guts to turn myself in,

390
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,718
but I can’t run away either.

391
00:36:23,887 --> 00:36:25,127
All I can do is wait like this.

392
00:36:27,994 --> 00:36:29,408
I was a coward too.

393
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:34,002
But today I have the courage.

394
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,030
Can you help me with something?

395
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:42,900
Can you please take me to Ben?

396
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,376
He’s right in front of you.

397
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,869
I realize my apology
won’t make a difference,

398
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,275
but it’s the only way

399
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:58,004
to express how deeply regretful I am.

400
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,616
I’m sorry.

401
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:15,148
You don’t have to forgive me.

402
00:38:15,214 --> 00:38:16,214
I forgive you.

403
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,790
Mom didn’t know suicide
wasn’t covered by the insurance.

404
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,080
But wasn’t it you

405
00:38:25,765 --> 00:38:27,205
who sent people to fix up the house,

406
00:38:28,426 --> 00:38:29,602
a nurse to take care of me,

407
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,480
and even...

408
00:38:33,785 --> 00:38:34,970
this wheelchair?

409
00:38:37,004 --> 00:38:39,431
At first, I didn’t want
to accept any of it,

410
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,700
but then I realized that
Mom gave up her life

411
00:38:46,897 --> 00:38:48,422
so I could live.

412
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,967
So I’ll live on

413
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,890
and give you back your life.

414
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:07,004
It’s time we both live our lives now.

415
00:39:45,991 --> 00:39:46,995
Why did you ask me here?

416
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,179
Did you change your mind
and want to turn me in?

417
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,320
I want to know...

418
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:56,702
why Ai-oon left me

419
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,028
and had Oaboom take her place.

420
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:01,183
You knew about Ai?

421
00:40:07,663 --> 00:40:08,663
Wait.

422
00:40:08,755 --> 00:40:09,755
Your eyes...

423
00:40:11,454 --> 00:40:12,454
I'm fully recovered.

424
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,602
And I’ve always known that Ai-oon
disguised herself as Oaboom from the start.

425
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:25,634
I just don't get why Ai-oon left me

426
00:40:26,997 --> 00:40:28,305
when she knew

427
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,357
Oaboom wanted to break up with me.

428
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:41,568
Because Ai thinks she’s
the reason I hurt you.

429
00:40:43,985 --> 00:40:45,213
She thinks...

430
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,871
she's the reason you're blind.

431
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,450
HENG CHAROEN

432
00:41:18,094 --> 00:41:19,094
May.

433
00:41:19,786 --> 00:41:20,786
May!

434
00:41:21,029 --> 00:41:21,619
Are you okay?

435
00:41:21,634 --> 00:41:22,794
I got something urgent to do.

436
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:23,829
I need to go now.

437
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:24,346
What?

438
00:41:24,605 --> 00:41:25,605
May.

439
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,321
Ai, can I talk to you?

440
00:42:28,432 --> 00:42:29,432
Ai.

441
00:42:34,872 --> 00:42:35,872
Have you gone to bed?

442
00:42:41,256 --> 00:42:42,256
Ai.

443
00:42:43,537 --> 00:42:45,367
Ai, get up and talk to me.

444
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:48,746
I have something to ask you.

445
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,300
I want to know something about May.

446
00:42:52,451 --> 00:42:53,764
I can’t seem to figure it out.

447
00:42:55,287 --> 00:42:57,057
Ai, wake up and talk to me.

448
00:43:00,023 --> 00:43:01,023
Ai.

449
00:43:08,444 --> 00:43:09,659
Fine. We can talk later.

450
00:44:52,767 --> 00:44:53,767
Ai.

451
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,847
I got you pork skewers with less fat...

452
00:44:57,874 --> 00:44:59,870
just how you like them.

453
00:45:00,226 --> 00:45:01,226
Come out and eat.

454
00:45:04,448 --> 00:45:05,448
Ai.

455
00:45:14,419 --> 00:45:15,419
Oh?

456
00:45:18,308 --> 00:45:19,308
Where did she go?

457
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,466
Oom, it’s time to eat.

458
00:45:26,213 --> 00:45:27,213
Oh?

459
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,480
Hey.

460
00:45:28,758 --> 00:45:30,106
Big sis and little sis are gone.

461
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:32,078
Where did they go?

462
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,872
I know something isn’t right

463
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,497
between May, my sister, and me.

464
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,300
Can you tell me everything
that happened, Jan?

465
00:45:43,804 --> 00:45:45,820
It’s just like your sister said.

466
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,320
Jan,

467
00:45:48,905 --> 00:45:50,214
we’ve been friends for so long.

468
00:45:51,205 --> 00:45:53,505
I know your eyebrows twitch when you lie.

469
00:45:57,592 --> 00:45:59,805
I don’t know the deal
between you and my sister,

470
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:02,768
but please don’t lie to me.

471
00:46:02,921 --> 00:46:05,096
Don’t leave me in the dark, looking stupid.

472
00:46:05,635 --> 00:46:06,703
We’re friends.

473
00:46:07,745 --> 00:46:09,229
I don’t want you to look stupid,

474
00:46:09,622 --> 00:46:10,622
but it’s hard to say.

475
00:46:11,678 --> 00:46:13,798
I think it’s better if your
memories come back first.

476
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:17,031
And if they don’t?

477
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,530
Am I supposed to stay stupid forever?

478
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,125
To be honest, I don’t want to lie to you.

479
00:46:24,408 --> 00:46:26,088
But I’m afraid you can’t handle the truth.

480
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:32,974
Whether I can handle it or not,

481
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:36,379
let me decide.

482
00:46:37,653 --> 00:46:38,653
Just tell me.

483
00:46:43,817 --> 00:46:44,817
Okay.

484
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:47,782
Then listen closely.

485
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:53,496
This is about you, Ai, and May.

486
00:47:56,019 --> 00:47:57,019
May.

487
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:34,874
You can see now?

488
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:42,100
You told me you talked to
your sister about everything.

489
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:47,370
Didn’t she tell you?

490
00:48:54,503 --> 00:48:56,543
Or were you too busy
thinking of a way to leave me?

491
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,200
Didn’t you say we’d be
happy together forever,

492
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,660
Ai-oon?

493
00:49:14,645 --> 00:49:15,881
When did you find out?

494
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:19,610
If I told you,

495
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,800
would you come back to me, Ai?

496
00:49:32,445 --> 00:49:34,014
I don’t deserve to be with you, May.

497
00:49:39,925 --> 00:49:40,925
Oom loves you.

498
00:49:43,912 --> 00:49:44,912
I…

499
00:49:49,022 --> 00:49:50,622
You think you’re the reason I was blind.

500
00:49:55,232 --> 00:49:56,232
You knew that too?

501
00:49:59,109 --> 00:50:00,109
I did.

502
00:50:01,503 --> 00:50:02,614
I talked to Kosol.

503
00:50:12,493 --> 00:50:13,820
It’s not that.

504
00:50:15,951 --> 00:50:17,617
It’s not just that.

505
00:50:21,945 --> 00:50:24,367
I didn’t just give Ko
the idea of hurting you.

506
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:35,189
I helped him.

507
00:50:37,402 --> 00:50:40,028
I helped him do it.

508
00:51:03,485 --> 00:51:05,905
I never wanted to hand you back to Oom,

509
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:13,115
but how could I be with you

510
00:51:14,235 --> 00:51:16,816
knowing I caused your blindness?

511
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,468
Ai, don’t forget.

512
00:51:41,072 --> 00:51:42,912
I’m responsible for
ruining your friend’s life

513
00:51:47,031 --> 00:51:48,798
and for your friend’s mother’s suicide.

514
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,419
No, May.

515
00:51:56,871 --> 00:51:58,287
I know you well.

516
00:51:58,607 --> 00:52:00,216
I know you didn’t mean to.

517
00:52:00,928 --> 00:52:02,168
I know you well, too.

518
00:52:04,765 --> 00:52:06,071
If you could go back in time,

519
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:09,490
you’d never have done what you did.

520
00:52:24,014 --> 00:52:25,014
May.

521
00:52:26,417 --> 00:52:27,417
Wouldn't you say,

522
00:52:30,838 --> 00:52:31,838
if, on that day,

523
00:52:33,936 --> 00:52:35,576
we'd known we were going to fall in love,

524
00:52:40,717 --> 00:52:42,619
we wouldn't have hurt each other?

525
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:51,318
May.

526
00:53:08,155 --> 00:53:09,155
Today,

527
00:53:11,672 --> 00:53:13,050
we know we love each other.

528
00:53:16,278 --> 00:53:17,671
Why should we be apart?

529
00:53:21,225 --> 00:53:23,154
I can forgive you for everything.

530
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,580
What about you?

531
00:53:30,651 --> 00:53:32,170
Will you forgive me?

532
00:54:06,637 --> 00:54:07,637
I…

533
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:11,813
I love you, May.

534
00:54:19,305 --> 00:54:20,589
I love you, May.

535
00:54:31,617 --> 00:54:34,222
May, I’m sorry.

536
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,401
I’m sorry.

537
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,081
I’m sorry.

538
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,268
What I regret most is that

539
00:54:57,605 --> 00:55:01,000
I never told you I never hated you.

540
00:55:01,413 --> 00:55:02,751
Ai, will you promise me

541
00:55:03,602 --> 00:55:04,602
we'll love each other?

542
00:55:05,137 --> 00:55:06,567
Should we start over properly?

543
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:08,330
My name is Ai-oon.

544
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:09,625
Ai-oon Ingsamug.

545
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:11,980
I’m Metawee.

546
00:55:12,882 --> 00:55:14,222
My novel is soon to be published.

547
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,779
I haven't given you your reward yet.
