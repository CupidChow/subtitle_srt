1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:02,371
Your vision will improve gradually.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,311
I met my first love...

3
00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:06,703
at the Bangkok Planetarium.

4
00:00:06,884 --> 00:00:09,004
Was I really May’s first love?

5
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:12,616
When are you going to tell Ai-oon
about your sight recovery?

6
00:00:12,974 --> 00:00:14,376
When I can look her in the eye

7
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:16,631
with my own eyes.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:17,860
2004

9
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:20,378
The prince promised the princess
2004

10
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:20,819
2004

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,776
he would protect her 2004

12
00:00:22,777 --> 00:00:22,918
2004

13
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:25,130
and make sure no one hurt her—
2004

14
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:26,826
physically or emotionally.

15
00:00:32,637 --> 00:00:33,171
Hm?

16
00:00:33,512 --> 00:00:34,936
Are you about to finish another one?

17
00:00:35,471 --> 00:00:37,071
I’ll buy you a new book later.

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,808
Mom, how can someone be hurt emotionally?

19
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:49,471
This is why your grades are dropping.

20
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:53,105
Stop letting her read this nonsense.

21
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:56,059
But I haven’t even finished it, Dad.

22
00:00:57,983 --> 00:00:58,537
May.

23
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:04,167
And there it was...

24
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,561
Hurting someone emotionally.

25
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,490
2014

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,379
If you still want my
financial support for your studies,

27
00:01:15,253 --> 00:01:17,474
you need to cut off everything else.

28
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,407
My friend didn’t break up
with Ton as you instructed,

29
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,278
so now you’re forcing him instead?

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,318
May.

31
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:33,004
Don’t stick your nose
into other people’s business.

32
00:01:35,026 --> 00:01:36,669
Focus on surviving your own problems.

33
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:39,903
I’m not even sure

34
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:44,219
what I’m supposed to survive.

35
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:47,604
Should I study harder?

36
00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:52,066
You’ll never say it’s enough.

37
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:59,108
Do I need to take better care of myself?

38
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:05,564
You’ve never allowed me to, anyway.

39
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,770
You told me to choose my friends wisely,

40
00:02:14,248 --> 00:02:16,111
but you’re cruel to them.

41
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:27,071
If you think you’re so tough,

42
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,558
then get the hell out of my house!

43
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,084
Honey.

44
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,825
Honey, please.

45
00:02:33,226 --> 00:02:34,315
Don’t hurt our daughter.

46
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:35,324
Let go of me.

47
00:02:35,842 --> 00:02:37,303
If you can’t even do that,

48
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,100
don’t ever talk back to me.

49
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,548
Honey.

50
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:43,280
- I said let go.
- Mom!

51
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:44,016
Where are you going?

52
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:46,005
I’m not done talking to you.

53
00:02:48,226 --> 00:02:48,906
Uncle,

54
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,308
I will break up with Ploy.

55
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:57,408
I will focus on med school.

56
00:02:59,377 --> 00:03:01,299
I will do anything you want.

57
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,002
Ton.

58
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:08,826
May.

59
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,811
Apologize to your father.

60
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:54,370
I am...

61
00:03:57,582 --> 00:03:58,474
sorry.

62
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:31,404
May.

63
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:41,010
Have you ever thought about fighting back?

64
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,767
Why are you meddling in Ton’s issues?

65
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,038
I just wanted to know

66
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,805
if I was fighting alone.

67
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,604
But I will fight anyway.

68
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:16,325
I will make my own life.

69
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,607
Send me the courage to fight,

70
00:05:47,893 --> 00:05:48,511
Oom.

71
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,225
My Pluto.

72
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:08,607
Here.

73
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:10,782
I already checked in for you.

74
00:07:13,054 --> 00:07:14,422
I will walk you to your door

75
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,309
and pick you up early in the morning.

76
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:17,567
Mm.

77
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:26,105
Can you see more clearly now?

78
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:29,708
So clearly I’m starting to get scared.

79
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:32,957
This time, you don’t have to be scared.

80
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:35,011
Why?

81
00:07:35,684 --> 00:07:36,922
Because you’ll take my side?

82
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:40,204
Yes, that too.

83
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:43,711
But I don’t think you need me that much.

84
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:48,047
You’re great enough to find your own Pluto.

85
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,697
There’s nothing for you to worry about.

86
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,807
I’LL PICK YOU UP TOMORROW.

87
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:03,970
GOOD NIGHT, MY FIRST LOVE.

88
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:05,902
Yes, I found her,

89
00:08:07,097 --> 00:08:08,305
my Pluto.

90
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,911
When I was messing around in your uniform,

91
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,134
I ran into some bullies
extorting money from a girl.

92
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,028
So, I helped her.

93
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:43,331
Who would’ve thought

94
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,857
it’d make her fall in love with the wrong person?

95
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,405
I’m sorry, Oom.

96
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:04,312
And thank you

97
00:09:06,158 --> 00:09:07,534
for giving me the chance to meet May.

98
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:30,915
What’s up?

99
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,371
(Your ride’s been fixed up real nice.)

100
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:33,915
(Full tank of gas.)

101
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:35,320
(Ready to hit the road.)

102
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:36,442
Thanks a lot.

103
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:37,668
I’ll go get it soon.

104
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,662
Carnations are a symbol of new beginnings,

105
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,210
and an apology from me.

106
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:16,008
So you already know?

107
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:19,825
Know what?

108
00:10:52,191 --> 00:10:52,912
Um...

109
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:56,037
I think I’ll just leave.

110
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,102
If I don’t have congee tomorrow,

111
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:03,008
will you still come?

112
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:09,004
Is there anything else here you like?

113
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:12,908
I’m sorry.

114
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:17,308
The moment I saw Pang,

115
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,521
all those feelings came rushing back.

116
00:11:31,496 --> 00:11:32,659
Even though it’s not Pang,

117
00:11:33,937 --> 00:11:35,105
I guess it’s still not me, huh?

118
00:11:36,854 --> 00:11:38,214
Not right now.

119
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:45,330
Right.

120
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,511
Get home safe then.

121
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,250
Maybe you should moonbathe more, Janista.

122
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,936
You’re not very accurate these days.

123
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:26,219
(You said my soulmate was coming.)

124
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:30,805
Actually, I didn’t know about that.

125
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:34,709
I came here to apologize

126
00:12:34,995 --> 00:12:36,308
if I caused you any trouble yesterday.

127
00:12:37,014 --> 00:12:40,041
I also wanted to congratulate you

128
00:12:40,948 --> 00:12:42,493
on starting a new beginning with Pim.

129
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:50,260
Can they be a housewarming gift instead?

130
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,866
I’d really like to see it that way.

131
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:56,320
Hm?

132
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:10,509
If you didn’t start a new beginning with Pim,

133
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,364
would you like to start one with me instead?

134
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:14,014
What?

135
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:42,558
May,

136
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,503
how’s your sight?

137
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,562
Did you come back because
you have nowhere else to go?

138
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,205
Hello, sir.

139
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:13,014
May has something to discuss with you.

140
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:26,607
Batman—or Marut,

141
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:29,607
the guy you forced me to represent in the DUI case,

142
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,037
is being sued for stock manipulation.

143
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,915
How are you involved?

144
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,205
Are you a deceived investor

145
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,610
or one of the manipulators?

146
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:42,613
May!

147
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:47,250
Whatever it is,

148
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,303
I can recommend a good attorney.

149
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,400
Her name is Metawee.

150
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:11,007
She’s quite busy, though,

151
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,976
as she’s handling another Marut’s case.

152
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,866
If you want her team to help,

153
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,608
I can talk to them for you.

154
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:24,610
May,

155
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:27,148
you have to help your dad.

156
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,259
Don’t beg her.

157
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,377
Miss May, your guest is here.

158
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:44,471
How dare you come here?

159
00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:49,171
Oom.

160
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,317
She came to make it clear to you

161
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:05,702
which is more embarrassing:

162
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:11,511
my girlfriend who’s always stood by me,

163
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:14,807
or someone with a good reputation

164
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:16,902
who manipulated you.

165
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:19,600
Do you think I’ll back down because of this?

166
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:20,573
Huh?

167
00:16:20,893 --> 00:16:22,081
Because of this ridiculous case?

168
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,718
I just came to tell you myself

169
00:16:28,345 --> 00:16:30,297
that I will never represent Marut again,

170
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,314
whether you want me to or not.

171
00:16:35,365 --> 00:16:37,002
Not because his case made me blind,

172
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:42,364
but because it made you blind.

173
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,102
We’re different.

174
00:16:51,814 --> 00:16:52,503
Let’s go, Oom.

175
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,605
About your case,

176
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:16,517
if you want May’s team to take it,

177
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:18,208
please let me know.

178
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,042
What price do I have to pay?

179
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,016
Consider it my way of
repaying all of your kindness.

180
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:29,814
And from now on,

181
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,937
please let me live my own life.

182
00:18:01,684 --> 00:18:02,402
I’m sorry.

183
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,000
My ride might not be very comfortable.

184
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:08,108
Anything that gets me out of here

185
00:18:08,874 --> 00:18:09,903
is more than splendid.

186
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,176
Right after I paid off my motorbike,

187
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:14,642
I made a down payment for this van.

188
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:16,669
Then I asked Ko to fix it up.

189
00:18:17,342 --> 00:18:19,180
It’ll be useful for moving things,

190
00:18:19,503 --> 00:18:20,837
taking my grandma to the doctor,

191
00:18:21,413 --> 00:18:23,005
and even going camping somewhere far.

192
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,214
But it was in pretty bad shape when I got it,

193
00:18:25,223 --> 00:18:26,137
so it took time to fix.

194
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:28,505
Now, I finally have the chance to use it.

195
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:32,965
I’m so happy I’m your first passenger.

196
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:39,579
I’m happy too, to be your first love.

197
00:18:42,108 --> 00:18:42,921
You know,

198
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:45,585
before I met you,

199
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:48,805
I used to ask myself,

200
00:18:51,022 --> 00:18:54,508
‘How will I get out of this life?’

201
00:18:58,045 --> 00:19:01,371
Then one day, someone told me to fight.

202
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,164
I knew right then what I must do.

203
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,869
I worked hard to get a scholarship to study abroad.

204
00:19:12,915 --> 00:19:14,561
I did everything to succeed,

205
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,155
so I could break free from my dad’s control.

206
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,440
My May is the most capable girl in the world.

207
00:19:30,591 --> 00:19:31,582
Let’s go already.

208
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,417
You still haven’t told me

209
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,973
where you’re taking me

210
00:19:35,573 --> 00:19:36,976
after asking Ton to leave us.

211
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,671
Come on.

212
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,422
Watch your step right here.

213
00:20:24,244 --> 00:20:24,773
Okay.

214
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,376
This is...

215
00:20:50,877 --> 00:20:53,108
I want to make it up to you
for being silly last time.

216
00:20:53,897 --> 00:20:56,008
I didn’t take you on an overnight trip.

217
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:00,314
Overnight trip?

218
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:02,531
Yes.

219
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,140
I’d like to pick up where we left off.

220
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,774
Watch the stars with me tonight?

221
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:19,275
Yeah.

222
00:21:57,204 --> 00:21:58,204
That looks yummy.

223
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:02,840
What?

224
00:22:03,725 --> 00:22:04,542
What did you just say?

225
00:22:07,564 --> 00:22:11,004
When are you going to tell
Ai-oon about your sight recovery?

226
00:22:11,937 --> 00:22:13,402
When I can look her in the eye

227
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,681
(with my own eyes.)

228
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,623
I meant...

229
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,407
it smells good.

230
00:22:22,894 --> 00:22:23,823
It’s mouth-watering.

231
00:22:25,325 --> 00:22:25,957
Ah.

232
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,321
Here.

233
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,305
This is for you.

234
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,574
Careful. It’s still hot.

235
00:22:44,211 --> 00:22:45,019
Place one hand on top,

236
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,555
and the other at the bottom.

237
00:23:07,715 --> 00:23:08,379
So?

238
00:23:09,048 --> 00:23:09,709
Whoa!

239
00:23:12,194 --> 00:23:13,179
Hot and savory.

240
00:23:14,463 --> 00:23:15,068
Very yummy.

241
00:23:16,217 --> 00:23:17,564
Your cooking is the best.

242
00:23:17,842 --> 00:23:18,699
Oh, please.

243
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:20,767
What an overstatement.

244
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,189
Why don’t you try it?

245
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:40,069
It’s tasty, indeed.

246
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:44,223
I guess you’ll have to make this for me more often.

247
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,777
Would the rest of my life be enough?

248
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:49,444
I don’t know.

249
00:23:50,118 --> 00:23:50,980
I guess we have to find out.

250
00:23:53,148 --> 00:23:53,952
Have to find out, huh?

251
00:23:53,964 --> 00:23:55,607
What? Did I make you blush?

252
00:23:57,032 --> 00:23:58,574
Just eat, you wicked thing.

253
00:24:04,185 --> 00:24:05,000
It really is savory.

254
00:24:05,305 --> 00:24:06,711
You’re all sweating.

255
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:09,620
Good?

256
00:24:10,447 --> 00:24:11,217
Very good.

257
00:24:13,463 --> 00:24:14,222
Eat up.

258
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:15,909
Ah.

259
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:24,237
I won't let go, I'll hold on strong

260
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:28,669
Have you seen how beautiful Pluto is

261
00:24:29,174 --> 00:24:33,011
Though it's not part of the solar system

262
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:35,368
Like me, I'm holding onto our memories

263
00:24:35,512 --> 00:24:39,577
Waiting for you, my feelings remain the same

264
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:44,312
I am waiting for you right here

265
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:48,743
Longing for those three words, baby

266
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,641
Love's sweet fragrance lingers still

267
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:52,962
In my heart, it always will

268
00:24:52,962 --> 00:24:53,607
To the left.
In my heart, it always will

269
00:24:53,608 --> 00:24:55,525
In my heart, it always will

270
00:24:56,914 --> 00:25:01,182
Let's just say I'm waiting right here

271
00:25:01,445 --> 00:25:05,903
Let me be the safe space you need

272
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:09,844
Can you hear the sound of my heart?

273
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:12,951
Calling out for you to touch, to touch

274
00:25:13,118 --> 00:25:16,450
My true love

275
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:34,555
I am waiting for you right here

276
00:25:34,626 --> 00:25:39,435
Longing for those three words, baby

277
00:25:39,518 --> 00:25:42,917
Love's sweet fragrance lingers still

278
00:25:42,952 --> 00:25:46,642
In my heart, it always will

279
00:25:52,696 --> 00:25:55,177
Try to remember what coffee our customers like.

280
00:25:56,533 --> 00:25:57,656
Hey, Ton.

281
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,139
Where is May?

282
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,210
I came on my own this time.

283
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,102
May didn’t ask me to come.

284
00:26:09,847 --> 00:26:10,583
Well, then.

285
00:26:11,198 --> 00:26:12,080
Welcome.

286
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:23,917
In the past,

287
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,351
I used to think I was Pluto.

288
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,708
Once part of the solar system, but cut off.

289
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,974
And I always thought it was pitiful.

290
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:41,709
Until you said your first love was like Pluto.

291
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:46,909
And do you have any idea

292
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:53,909
how beautiful Pluto is to me?

293
00:27:00,568 --> 00:27:03,709
Whether humans categorize
it in the solar system or not,

294
00:27:06,749 --> 00:27:08,629
it keeps spinning.

295
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:16,223
It never cares about others' judgment.

296
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,514
On the surface of Pluto,

297
00:27:44,385 --> 00:27:45,908
there’s an area shaped like a heart.

298
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:00,197
But for me,

299
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:12,610
this is my heart.

300
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,463
I’m giving you the heart of Pluto.

301
00:28:22,582 --> 00:28:23,706
Should I put it on for you?

302
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:05,977
I love you, May.

303
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,850
GRANDMA

304
00:32:37,642 --> 00:32:39,371
Based on the initial checkup,
everything looks fine.

305
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:42,605
Tomorrow, we will conduct a detailed examination.

306
00:32:43,142 --> 00:32:44,571
If nothing unusual comes up,

307
00:32:44,742 --> 00:32:46,509
we can move her out of the ICU.

308
00:32:47,112 --> 00:32:48,357
Thank you so much, Doctor.

309
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:55,668
You’ve finally come back to me, Oom.

310
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:57,491
My dear.

311
00:32:57,992 --> 00:32:58,777
Where is...

312
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,173
Where is this place?

313
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,322
Hm?

314
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:03,465
What?

315
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:04,814
Well, you...

316
00:33:05,434 --> 00:33:06,303
May.

317
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:07,605
May.

318
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:08,908
Where is May?

319
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:12,805
Oom.

320
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,447
What do you remember, child?

321
00:33:15,877 --> 00:33:16,414
May.

322
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:18,659
Hold on.

323
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:21,859
- Where is she? I want to see May.
- Don’t get up yet. Lie down.

324
00:33:21,896 --> 00:33:22,771
Don’t get up yet.

325
00:33:23,242 --> 00:33:24,570
I want to see May.

326
00:33:30,804 --> 00:33:31,899
Where is May?

327
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,268
I wish I could see you more clearly.

328
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:28,250
You woke up early.

329
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,537
So that I can spend more time with you.

330
00:34:37,037 --> 00:34:38,025
Do you know?

331
00:34:39,915 --> 00:34:40,773
At first,

332
00:34:42,185 --> 00:34:44,712
I didn’t know how my novel would end.

333
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,565
But now I do.

334
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,152
Are you asking for your reward?

335
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,708
Yes, that too.

336
00:35:00,322 --> 00:35:01,019
But...

337
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,204
I also have a request I’d like to make.

338
00:35:07,749 --> 00:35:08,373
What is it?

339
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:12,906
I will tell you after I take a shower.

340
00:35:14,638 --> 00:35:15,170
Sure.

341
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,371
10 MISSED CALLS FROM ‘GRANDMA’.

342
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:39,957
Oh?
10 MISSED CALLS FROM ‘GRANDMA’.

343
00:35:39,957 --> 00:35:40,650
10 MISSED CALLS FROM ‘GRANDMA’.

344
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:45,718
Hello, Grandma.

345
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,240
What is it?

346
00:35:47,351 --> 00:35:48,122
Did something happen?

347
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:49,811
(Ai!)

348
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,577
(Oom has woken up!)

349
00:35:52,663 --> 00:35:53,216
Gosh!

350
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:54,820
Are you serious?

351
00:35:55,365 --> 00:35:56,382
Is it for real?

352
00:35:57,225 --> 00:35:58,114
(How is she now?)

353
00:35:58,124 --> 00:35:59,217
(Can she be discharged immediately?)

354
00:36:00,748 --> 00:36:01,317
Ai.

355
00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:03,002
It seems like

356
00:36:03,951 --> 00:36:06,309
she can’t remember anything about Paul.

357
00:36:08,154 --> 00:36:09,648
(All she can remember is May.)

358
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,875
(She keeps calling her name.)

359
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:35,309
May.

360
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:36,308
Oom.

361
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,721
- May.
- Oom.

362
00:37:29,308 --> 00:37:30,232
Are you okay?

363
00:37:35,274 --> 00:37:35,982
I am.

364
00:37:39,616 --> 00:37:42,214
What is it that you want to tell me, Oom?

365
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,961
I’m sorry, May.

366
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,562
Can you please wait a little longer?

367
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:16,571
No problem.

368
00:38:22,693 --> 00:38:23,619
I’ll wait.

369
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,026
I’ll wait for my Pluto.

370
00:38:58,568 --> 00:39:02,204
(This is the first time I’ve ever been glad

371
00:39:04,828 --> 00:39:06,102
(that May can’t see.)

372
00:39:42,322 --> 00:39:43,474
How’s she doing?

373
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,422
She’s all fine now,

374
00:39:46,137 --> 00:39:48,505
but she just regained consciousness,
so she still needs time to rest.

375
00:39:57,911 --> 00:39:58,980
Ai.

376
00:40:03,456 --> 00:40:04,013
Oom.

377
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,066
How are you?

378
00:40:09,297 --> 00:40:11,023
Don’t you hate me?

379
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,121
Are you nuts?

380
00:40:14,773 --> 00:40:15,761
How could you say that?

381
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:17,020
I never hate you.

382
00:40:20,235 --> 00:40:21,011
I know.

383
00:40:25,182 --> 00:40:29,678
Well, maybe I despise you a bit sometimes.

384
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:31,613
Ai, stop it.

385
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,813
The doctor said you need to
strengthen your muscles,

386
00:40:38,091 --> 00:40:39,973
and then you can return to a normal life.

387
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,379
It’s good we’ve been keeping up
with your physical therapy.

388
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:48,466
Thanks to Paul’s parents.

389
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:49,571
Ai.

390
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,770
Who is he?

391
00:40:57,213 --> 00:40:58,143
It’s nothing.

392
00:40:58,724 --> 00:41:00,687
Recover fast. Alright, Oom?

393
00:41:01,022 --> 00:41:03,102
You know, ever since you’ve been here,

394
00:41:03,362 --> 00:41:05,028
Grandma’s been nagging at me every day.

395
00:41:09,078 --> 00:41:10,306
I wanna get better.

396
00:41:12,188 --> 00:41:13,915
I want to see May.

397
00:41:25,094 --> 00:41:27,737
The doctor said Oom lost her short-term memory,

398
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:34,168
likely due to experiencing severe mental trauma.

399
00:41:38,385 --> 00:41:39,259
It’s Paul.

400
00:41:41,645 --> 00:41:42,505
Somehow that’s good.

401
00:41:43,173 --> 00:41:45,677
If she woke up and remembered

402
00:41:46,389 --> 00:41:48,906
that her husband died on their wedding day,

403
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,118
how devastated would she be?

404
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,041
I can’t bear to see her suffer like that again.

405
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,662
So, when Oom said she remembered May,

406
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,620
what kind of memory was she referring to?

407
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,616
Let’s wait until she gets better.
She might recall more.

408
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,909
For now, everyone should just...

409
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:20,974
avoid mentioning Paul.

410
00:42:47,714 --> 00:42:48,580
Oaboom woke up.

411
00:42:51,709 --> 00:42:52,710
Then she will tell Ai.

412
00:42:55,694 --> 00:42:56,290
But...

413
00:42:56,971 --> 00:42:58,168
she lost her memories.

414
00:42:59,765 --> 00:43:00,943
She can’t remember anything about Paul.

415
00:43:01,408 --> 00:43:02,374
She only remembers you.

416
00:43:07,931 --> 00:43:09,204
What will Ai-oon do now?

417
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,583
Oom is ridiculous.

418
00:43:16,496 --> 00:43:17,269
Before the accident,

419
00:43:17,817 --> 00:43:18,933
she asked Ai to break up with May.

420
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:20,705
After the accident,

421
00:43:20,922 --> 00:43:21,931
she keeps asking for May.

422
00:43:22,795 --> 00:43:24,075
The problem lies with Ai now.

423
00:43:27,232 --> 00:43:29,715
Do you think Oom wants May back?

424
00:43:32,303 --> 00:43:35,105
You asked me why I helped Ai with May.

425
00:43:36,702 --> 00:43:37,611
Still want to know why?

426
00:43:41,554 --> 00:43:43,410
Oom asked Ai to break up with May

427
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,915
because she hoped the two of them would meet.

428
00:43:47,202 --> 00:43:50,065
And May has always known Ai isn’t Oaboom.

429
00:43:50,499 --> 00:43:51,108
What?

430
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,168
As we all know,

431
00:43:59,202 --> 00:44:01,114
May’s first love is Ai-oon.

432
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,865
When Oom found out, she was heartbroken.

433
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,465
If she has to learn it all over again,

434
00:44:11,734 --> 00:44:14,312
who do you think we should feel sorry for here?

435
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:32,902
Pim.

436
00:44:41,204 --> 00:44:42,306
How come you two are together?

437
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,100
I’VE FINISHED MY NOVEL, MAY.

438
00:44:56,112 --> 00:45:00,010
PREPARE YOUR REWARD
AND GET READY TO HEAR MY REQUEST.

439
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,210
COME QUICKLY. I’LL BE WAITING FOR YOU.

440
00:45:12,665 --> 00:45:13,423
You’re smiling.

441
00:45:17,573 --> 00:45:18,628
It’s nothing.

442
00:45:22,685 --> 00:45:23,614
Ai.

443
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,416
I must tell.

444
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:33,872
What are you telling me?

445
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:36,709
Don’t get mad.

446
00:45:37,377 --> 00:45:38,423
Sure. Just tell me.

447
00:45:42,131 --> 00:45:43,189
My girlfriend...

448
00:45:46,635 --> 00:45:47,617
was the attorney

449
00:45:50,549 --> 00:45:52,500
representing Batman.

450
00:45:54,733 --> 00:45:55,368
What?

451
00:45:58,162 --> 00:45:58,909
Don’t be mad.

452
00:46:03,537 --> 00:46:04,503
You mean Ben’s case?

453
00:46:06,725 --> 00:46:07,607
Don’t be angry.

454
00:46:10,891 --> 00:46:12,179
Forgive May

455
00:46:14,437 --> 00:46:15,712
for me, please.

456
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,810
SOMSRI CHAN-IMNUAN
FEB 6, 1978 - APR 18, 2023 AGE: 45

457
00:46:45,899 --> 00:46:46,605
Hey, what’s up?

458
00:46:50,385 --> 00:46:51,047
Hey.

459
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,700
You look better.

460
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,114
Since I didn’t die, I should live well, right?

461
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:03,068
Ko said someone’s been helping you.

462
00:47:04,234 --> 00:47:04,777
Ah.

463
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,602
It's Batman's attorney.

464
00:47:07,376 --> 00:47:09,674
I hated her guts at first.

465
00:47:09,968 --> 00:47:10,862
I didn’t want any association.

466
00:47:12,712 --> 00:47:14,207
But Ko said you took revenge for me,

467
00:47:14,754 --> 00:47:15,517
so I accepted the help.

468
00:47:17,882 --> 00:47:18,868
I took revenge for you?

469
00:47:22,014 --> 00:47:22,604
Well,

470
00:47:24,154 --> 00:47:27,017
Ko said you told him to hit her in the head,

471
00:47:27,397 --> 00:47:28,506
and she ended up blind.

472
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,360
NO JAIL FOR BATMAN: SUSPENDED SENTENCE.
NETIZENS CALL HIM ‘HERO’ FOR TAKING DOWN MOTORPUNK.

473
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:36,030
MEET MARUT, A HIGH-SOCIETY FIGURE
WHO LIKES TO DRESS UP AS BATMAN.

474
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,183
Batman, my ass.

475
00:47:37,205 --> 00:47:38,131
2023

476
00:47:38,132 --> 00:47:39,284
Just an evil jerk.
2023

477
00:47:39,285 --> 00:47:40,490
2023

478
00:47:41,509 --> 00:47:43,004
What’s wrong with people these days?

479
00:47:43,465 --> 00:47:44,376
Do they worship bad people now?

480
00:47:45,936 --> 00:47:47,354
Because he’s good-looking and wealthy.

481
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,902
Is that all it takes to judge someone?

482
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:01,767
Ben told me the defendant’s lawyer managed to

483
00:48:02,561 --> 00:48:05,357
reduce the compensation to almost nothing.

484
00:48:09,674 --> 00:48:11,300
So his mom committed suicide

485
00:48:11,706 --> 00:48:13,419
just to get the insurance money
for Ben’s treatment.

486
00:48:14,238 --> 00:48:18,105
She had no clue that suicide
wouldn’t qualify for the insurance payout.

487
00:48:20,653 --> 00:48:21,520
I’d like to know.

488
00:48:22,222 --> 00:48:23,670
Who the hell is that attorney?

489
00:48:24,542 --> 00:48:25,974
I’ll get payback for Ben and his mom.

490
00:48:26,714 --> 00:48:27,512
Stop it.

491
00:48:28,758 --> 00:48:29,762
If you do anything,

492
00:48:30,131 --> 00:48:31,293
it will only shock your grandma more.

493
00:48:45,488 --> 00:48:46,143
Dammit.

494
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:50,174
How can life be so unfair?

495
00:48:56,586 --> 00:48:59,170
The attorney must have felt really guilty.

496
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,760
Ko said she didn’t even
call the police when she saw him.

497
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:12,810
Ai!

498
00:49:20,268 --> 00:49:21,891
Your grandma said you came to see Ben.

499
00:49:24,358 --> 00:49:25,425
Have you always known?

500
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:34,414
I’m sorry.

501
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:40,607
You know I’m the reason she’s blind,

502
00:49:42,414 --> 00:49:44,134
and you let me love her.

503
00:49:45,748 --> 00:49:46,364
Ai.

504
00:49:49,294 --> 00:49:50,315
It’s not like that.

505
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:51,717
I was the one who assaulted her.

506
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,216
But if I hadn’t initiated it,
you wouldn’t have done it.

507
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,214
You told me to hit on her

508
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:09,862
and follow my heart.

509
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:15,306
And you know what?

510
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,474
I love her.

511
00:50:20,102 --> 00:50:21,911
Ko, I love her so much.

512
00:50:22,385 --> 00:50:24,663
And now I know I’m the reason she’s blind.

513
00:50:24,678 --> 00:50:26,140
How can I live with myself?

514
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,149
Hey, what should I do now?

515
00:50:28,155 --> 00:50:28,801
Ko!

516
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:29,808
Take it easy, okay?

517
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:33,109
Ko! How can I live now?

518
00:50:43,684 --> 00:50:45,583
I’ve fallen in love with her.

519
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,468
What should I do now, Ko?

520
00:50:50,499 --> 00:50:51,802
Just calm down, Ai.

521
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,882
What am I going to do now?

522
00:51:18,613 --> 00:51:20,380
I’ll make you happy as you were before.

523
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:21,725
Trust me.

524
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,094
If you want me to trust you, I’ll trust you.

525
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,271
May.

526
00:51:27,819 --> 00:51:28,619
Congratulations.

527
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:31,109
You’ll see your girlfriend’s face
more clearly soon.

528
00:51:31,804 --> 00:51:32,610
I already did.

529
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,441
But she was not Ai-oon.

530
00:51:35,037 --> 00:51:35,979
She was Oaboom.

531
00:51:36,373 --> 00:51:37,706
I love you, May.

532
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,416
I love you.
