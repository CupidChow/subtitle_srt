1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,598
Can you promise me

2
00:00:02,457 --> 00:00:03,537
that we’ll love each other?

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,868
Will you choose me…

4
00:00:06,777 --> 00:00:08,641
or the person who ruined my life?

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,040
Ai.

6
00:00:11,201 --> 00:00:12,398
Ai.

7
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:14,398
Ai!

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,850
A YEAR LATER

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:26,703
This book is dedicated to a love so valuable that we’re willing to let go.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,954
I promised myself that

11
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:40,905
I’d be Pluto in May’s definition,

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,047
which doesn’t mean being abandoned

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,700
or forgotten,

14
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,010
but means that,

15
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,665
whether or not it’s in the solar system,

16
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,662
it will keep orbiting beautifully and steadily in its own way.

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,379
(Oaboom received treatment for PTSD

18
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:32,099
(as her condition worsened after that night.)

19
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:36,555
Ai!

20
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:37,611
Goodness!

21
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:40,299
Ai, are you okay?

22
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,158
I almost died!

23
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,453
Who spilled the damn oil?

24
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:47,040
Ai!

25
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:48,336
Ai!

26
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:49,487
Ai!

27
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:50,727
Ai.

28
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:52,960
You scared me.

29
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,722
Oom, why are you crying, dear?

30
00:01:58,669 --> 00:01:59,976
Oom, what’s the matter?

31
00:01:59,988 --> 00:02:00,988
Calm down, okay?

32
00:02:01,112 --> 00:02:02,379
I’m fine, Oom.

33
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:04,004
Look. Don’t be scared.

34
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:06,465
No.

35
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:07,936
That’s not true.

36
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,293
I’m scared.

37
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:12,877
I’m scared you’ll die and leave me.

38
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,197
Ai!

39
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:15,920
Oom, easy.

40
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:16,810
Don’t cry.

41
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:17,834
Just breathe.

42
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:19,010
Take a breath slowly, Oom.

43
00:02:26,117 --> 00:02:27,303
How is Oaboom doing?

44
00:02:28,183 --> 00:02:31,515
After some occupational therapy activities,

45
00:02:31,648 --> 00:02:34,502
our occupational therapist observed that

46
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:37,804
the patient’s emotions have become more stable.

47
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,491
She is determined to participate in the activities

48
00:02:40,847 --> 00:02:43,979
and remains focused on completing them,

49
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,315
unlike when she first arrived.

50
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:52,293
Here.

51
00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:53,394
Eat more.

52
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:58,417
Here.

53
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:00,629
You should eat more too.

54
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:04,402
Stop giving each other’s food.

55
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,416
You both need to eat more.

56
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,930
I made plenty, so make sure to finish it all.

57
00:03:10,134 --> 00:03:11,134
Got it?

58
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,463
It’s you who should eat more.

59
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,041
Here.

60
00:03:14,197 --> 00:03:15,197
Eat up.

61
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:16,952
Or would you prefer me to feed you, dear?

62
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:19,182
You rascal.

63
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:20,902
Here. Eat my smack.

64
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:22,019
Nope.

65
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:23,130
I won’t eat that.

66
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:24,502
Not yummy.

67
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:28,430
Oh, Ai.

68
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,177
Your new novel,

69
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,697
when will it be released?

70
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,714
Soon, Grandma.

71
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,297
My editor said there’ll be a book launch event soon.

72
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:42,394
Wow,

73
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,789
that makes you sound like a superstar.

74
00:03:44,805 --> 00:03:46,896
You even have your own launch event!

75
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,094
Right?

76
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,478
Congratulations, Ai.

77
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:55,173
I have an announcement too.

78
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,910
What announcement?

79
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,330
One moment.

80
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,306
She’s being secretive again, Grandma.

81
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,183
What is she talking about?

82
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,219
Surprise!

83
00:04:17,945 --> 00:04:18,945
Wow.

84
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,640
I’ll be a flight attendant once again.

85
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:22,377
Grandma, look.

86
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:24,576
Oom’s been keeping it a secret.

87
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:27,100
She applied and got the job without us knowing.

88
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:31,906
Grandma.

89
00:04:32,694 --> 00:04:34,918
Oom, you’re making grandma cry.

90
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,521
Oh.

91
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,041
Grandma.

92
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:39,462
Grandma.

93
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,271
Grandma, why are you crying?

94
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,302
I’d hoped you would get back on your feet.

95
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:55,900
I wanted you to be the same Oom we knew.

96
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,314
I’m so happy.

97
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:08,002
I’m sorry for always making you worry.

98
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:10,487
You’re my granddaughter.

99
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,371
Of course, I worry about you.

100
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,410
When does your new job start, Oom?

101
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:22,198
Soon.

102
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:26,434
But before I start,

103
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,700
I want to make a stop somewhere.

104
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:31,072
Will you take me, Ai?

105
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,807
This is the place Paul loved most

106
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,180
because it’s where I agreed to marry him.

107
00:05:53,837 --> 00:05:56,312
He said he’d do anything to make me love him.

108
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:00,146
No matter how long, he would wait for me.

109
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:05,994
Paul, you’ve finally succeeded.

110
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:10,134
I love you.

111
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:15,700
Right now, I have Ai

112
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,057
and Grandma who love me.

113
00:06:21,274 --> 00:06:23,071
Rest up there and don’t worry about me.

114
00:06:25,691 --> 00:06:27,303
I wish you great happiness.

115
00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:32,020
I’m sure Paul is happy

116
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,910
knowing you’ve been doing so much better.

117
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,860
What about you?

118
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,065
Are you happy at all?

119
00:08:05,974 --> 00:08:06,974
Ouch!

120
00:08:07,374 --> 00:08:08,503
You think I don’t know

121
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:10,408
you had your friend helping Ben sue me?

122
00:08:12,312 --> 00:08:13,801
It’s not something I want to hide.

123
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:16,782
And I’m glad that you know.

124
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,779
Keep talking back and I’ll come for you.

125
00:08:21,647 --> 00:08:22,647
I will sue you.

126
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,302
Sir, you can’t do this.

127
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,860
Why don’t you stop her from running her mouth first?

128
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,202
You know exactly who I am,

129
00:08:32,937 --> 00:08:34,137
yet you decided to provoke me.

130
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:36,700
The case was closed,

131
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,565
but you helped him sue me again.

132
00:08:40,294 --> 00:08:41,294
You won’t get a penny.

133
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:43,223
Instead, you’ll get into trouble, Lawyer.

134
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:44,247
Sir, please stop.

135
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,200
I can have you thrown in prison just for slandering me.

136
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:53,102
And whatever you try,

137
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,060
I’ll show you that

138
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:58,700
the law isn’t opposed to justice.

139
00:08:59,902 --> 00:09:02,900
Those who do wrong must be punished.

140
00:09:08,785 --> 00:09:09,826
I’ll be the one punishing you here.

141
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,416
Sir, don’t.

142
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,420
Don’t do that.

143
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,210
Do it if you dare.

144
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,944
This time, we won’t have to wait for the court to judge.

145
00:09:15,968 --> 00:09:17,688
People will see how evil you are right now.

146
00:09:24,217 --> 00:09:25,217
Damn it!

147
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:33,795
You did great.

148
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:34,985
Yeah!

149
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:43,496
Yeah!

150
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,711
Sorry.

151
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:51,300
Oh, I almost forgot.

152
00:09:51,706 --> 00:09:54,102
This is Ai’s new book.

153
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,254
And the writer's autograph?

154
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:13,300
About that, you must ask for it yourself.

155
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,823
As if she will sign it if I ask.

156
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,610
A YEAR AGO

157
00:10:40,677 --> 00:10:41,677
Ai.

158
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,860
May, wait.

159
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:46,568
Where are you going?

160
00:10:46,837 --> 00:10:47,651
I’m going to see Ai.

161
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:48,856
I must talk to her.

162
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:49,903
Calm down, May.

163
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:52,903
I must change her mind.

164
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,630
Wait.

165
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,020
Stop. Take it easy.

166
00:10:57,334 --> 00:10:58,334
Stay here.

167
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,510
Read this first.

168
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:06,842
It’s Ai-oon’s diary.

169
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,400
She left it with me for you.

170
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:12,761
She said you’d understand everything after finishing it.

171
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,485
(She pulled me close,

172
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,605
touching her small forehead to mine,

173
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:50,309
(then the tip of her small nose.)

174
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:55,902
(Our quiet breathing felt so loud,

175
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,700
(as if it were confirming that we truly existed.)

176
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:03,903
(May, you’re my princess,

177
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:06,857
my novel,

178
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:09,899
(and my everything.)

179
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,230
(May, you’re a competent person,

180
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:15,628
a strong Metawee,

181
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,300
(but Oaboom isn’t.)

182
00:12:20,954 --> 00:12:24,800
(If our love causes Oaboom pain,

183
00:12:26,238 --> 00:12:29,500
(then we can’t be together right now.)

184
00:12:32,674 --> 00:12:34,322
(But please know this, May.)

185
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:36,801
(I love you.)

186
00:12:39,711 --> 00:12:40,711
(I love you…

187
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,580
so much,

188
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,524
(as much as a human heart can love a person.)

189
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:57,463
(If I had one wish,

190
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,822
it would be for our story

191
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,743
(to end just like the novel you helped create.)

192
00:13:08,536 --> 00:13:11,499
(Two hands, gently holding each other.)

193
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:17,699
(All their challenges make them realize that

194
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:24,398
the value of love isn’t just about being together,

195
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,426
but about having hearts strong enough

196
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:33,577
(to protect each other.)

197
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,170
If I would weave a certain story

198
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,257
I'd write one of only you and me

199
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,100
Nothing else could compare, It's always been you

200
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:57,350
My heart belongs to you, forever true

201
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,568
Every word of my novel would be all about you

202
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,539
If granted one wish, a single desire

203
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,689
FROM NOW…UNTIL FOREVER.
It’d be you, nothing else I would acquire

204
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:25,832
It’d be you, nothing else I would acquire

205
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:31,320
As long as it’s you, I’d do anything

206
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,887
To make our story sing

207
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,204
It’s as if fate planned it from the start

208
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:43,722
That you’re the answer to my heart

209
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,354
You’re the piece that makes me whole

210
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:51,148
Without you, I’d be miserable

211
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:54,028
I’ll hold on to us, never be apart

212
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:59,205
You’re in my embrace and my heart

213
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:05,097
If I would weave a certain story

214
00:15:05,494 --> 00:15:09,208
I'd write one of only you and me

215
00:15:09,946 --> 00:15:14,300
Nothing else could compare, It's always been you

216
00:15:14,382 --> 00:15:20,334
My heart belongs to you, forever true

217
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:25,515
Every word of my novel would be all about you

218
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:52,680
If I would weave a certain story…

219
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,321
From now…

220
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,268
until forever.

221
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:07,705
My heart belongs to you, forever true

222
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:13,179
Every word of my novel would be all about you

223
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,880
“THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED TO A LOVE
SO VALUABLE THAT WE’RE WILLING TO LET GO.”

224
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,000
You haven’t read it yet?

225
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,210
Not yet.

226
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
You don’t have time,

227
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,680
or you don’t have the courage to read it?

228
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,580
I don’t have time.

229
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,820
We’ve been through so much...

230
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,610
there’s nothing I don’t have the guts to do.

231
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,130
What about you?

232
00:17:36,352 --> 00:17:37,457
You don’t seem surprised.

233
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:40,626
Did you already know that I own this place?

234
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
When I was sick,

235
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:55,614
Ko urged me to get my treatment here.

236
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,180
He said it's a one-stop service.

237
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,730
How did someone like Ko
know about this kind of place, right?

238
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,998
But I knew he was working for you

239
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,088
to make up for the blindness he caused you.

240
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:17,804
Since you knew everything,

241
00:18:18,856 --> 00:18:20,718
then I should be asking you

242
00:18:23,183 --> 00:18:26,311
why you chose to get treatment here.

243
00:18:28,877 --> 00:18:30,817
Because I wanted to know if you were happy.

244
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:38,776
All I knew was that Ai’s never been happy.

245
00:19:07,823 --> 00:19:11,208
I came here to spy on you quietly.

246
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,268
I asked Ko to keep an eye on you.

247
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:20,053
You don’t seem happy yourself.

248
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,034
I don’t get it.

249
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:31,000
Why is everyone so honest with me?

250
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:35,130
You and Ai could’ve just met behind my back.

251
00:19:38,232 --> 00:19:39,804
Why are you giving in to me so much?

252
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,699
Because I promised Ai

253
00:19:50,952 --> 00:19:52,500
that I wouldn’t bring her pain.

254
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,608
If our love means hurting you,

255
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:04,712
how could Ai ever be happy?

256
00:20:14,602 --> 00:20:15,602
Exactly.

257
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:19,918
But it’s still weird.

258
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,792
Everything is going as I hoped.

259
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:29,706
I should be the happiest.

260
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,977
But why am I not?

261
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,066
What is your happiness, Oom?

262
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,032
‘Do I love enough to let go?’

263
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,771
I kept asking myself that

264
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,389
after finishing Ai’s latest novel.

265
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,524
The one where the prince and princess

266
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:19,074
part ways to fulfill their duties,

267
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:21,872
even though they’re still in love.

268
00:21:30,758 --> 00:21:32,001
Sorry for the spoiler.

269
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,100
You should finish it.

270
00:21:37,102 --> 00:21:38,602
Then you’ll know what I want.

271
00:22:11,268 --> 00:22:12,299
Welcome to…

272
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:19,108
Pim.

273
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,680
PICK A LUCKY PLANT TAILORED TO YOUR ZODIAC SIGN.

274
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,053
I’m helping Pang with the promotion.

275
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:31,247
Are you looking for a plant?

276
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:33,428
I’ll go get Pang.

277
00:22:34,322 --> 00:22:35,322
No need.

278
00:22:36,342 --> 00:22:37,598
I came today to see you.

279
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,250
There you go.

280
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:48,792
Thank you.

281
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,000
And thank you so much
for helping me find an attorney.

282
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:56,431
May is incredibly skilled.

283
00:22:56,706 --> 00:22:58,722
I feel much better about the case now.

284
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,200
You didn’t come just to say thanks, right?

285
00:23:11,653 --> 00:23:13,037
It’s still on my mind,

286
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,299
and I want to hear from you directly

287
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,016
why you chose Pang.

288
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:20,866
You know,

289
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,900
I became a fortune teller

290
00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:24,388
because I wanted to know the future.

291
00:23:25,924 --> 00:23:27,805
I hate uncertainty.

292
00:23:29,362 --> 00:23:32,497
At least I should know which way I’m leaning.

293
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:35,211
But with you,

294
00:23:37,595 --> 00:23:40,776
I had no idea how long I should wait to win your heart,

295
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,810
or if your future even included me at all.

296
00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:48,768
But with Pang,

297
00:23:50,939 --> 00:23:53,054
even though I didn’t like her that much at first,

298
00:23:55,244 --> 00:23:56,789
she never made me worry

299
00:23:56,804 --> 00:23:58,360
about what would happen tomorrow.

300
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:03,361
If I were to take a risk with someone,

301
00:24:04,662 --> 00:24:06,306
I’d want it to be Pang.

302
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:17,320
You and Pang have more in common than I thought.

303
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,764
You remind me of when Pang broke up with me.

304
00:24:22,957 --> 00:24:24,416
When she realized her own heart,

305
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:26,588
she told me honestly

306
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,459
and outright, just like you did.

307
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,179
I think you’ve found the one for you.

308
00:24:36,056 --> 00:24:38,100
I hope you find the one for you as well.

309
00:24:38,887 --> 00:24:39,887
Thank you.

310
00:24:45,487 --> 00:24:46,487
Hey there, Pim.

311
00:24:47,635 --> 00:24:48,635
Hey, Pang.

312
00:24:51,205 --> 00:24:52,382
How is it going with you?

313
00:24:56,034 --> 00:24:57,410
Everything is fine.

314
00:24:57,906 --> 00:25:00,594
Today, I just came to thank Jan.

315
00:25:02,438 --> 00:25:04,229
Well then, it’s time for me to go.

316
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,037
See you.

317
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:19,685
What?

318
00:25:20,063 --> 00:25:21,103
Why are you staring at me?

319
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,601
I’m checking if there’s any spark in your eyes.

320
00:25:26,497 --> 00:25:29,500
If there were, I wouldn’t be here
working at your shop, would I?

321
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,909
By the way, look at the shop owner.

322
00:25:32,605 --> 00:25:33,533
How messy you look.

323
00:25:33,554 --> 00:25:34,554
Gosh.

324
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:37,521
So messy.

325
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,127
Messy, huh?

326
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,287
Yes.

327
00:25:40,325 --> 00:25:41,325
So dirty.

328
00:25:41,597 --> 00:25:42,597
Get this.

329
00:25:42,728 --> 00:25:43,728
There you go.

330
00:25:44,189 --> 00:25:45,299
Now we’re messy together.

331
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,736
Here. Get this.

332
00:25:47,832 --> 00:25:48,626
You, messy girl.

333
00:25:48,854 --> 00:25:50,496
Get messier.

334
00:25:51,456 --> 00:25:52,456
Don’t.

335
00:25:53,598 --> 00:25:54,598
Where are you going?

336
00:25:55,023 --> 00:25:56,131
I won’t be messy like you.

337
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:56,728
No!

338
00:25:57,072 --> 00:25:58,072
Pang!

339
00:25:59,044 --> 00:26:00,044
No.

340
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,640
Come here.

341
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,906
Don’t. No.

342
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:04,010
You get this.

343
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,057
Stop!

344
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,899
I’m too lazy to take a shower again.

345
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:12,485
Want me to shower you then?

346
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,688
Gosh!

347
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,380
The one on the right.

348
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:29,703
But the editor sent me that one.

349
00:26:30,537 --> 00:26:32,502
They said I needed to dress formally.

350
00:26:32,881 --> 00:26:34,903
But it’s your book release.

351
00:26:35,645 --> 00:26:37,525
You don’t have to follow anyone's instructions.

352
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,517
Just choose what you like.

353
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:44,979
Okay, if you say so.

354
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,564
Do you want any gifts?

355
00:26:49,022 --> 00:26:50,022
No.

356
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,090
Your and Grandma’s presence is enough.

357
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,000
Thank you, Ai.

358
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,600
I’ve always wanted to be the little sister
that her big sister loves.

359
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Thank you for...

360
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,198
letting me know how good it feels to be loved.

361
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,373
You’re sweet and clingy. It’s weird.

362
00:27:21,877 --> 00:27:22,877
I love you, Ai.

363
00:27:24,903 --> 00:27:26,819
Yeah, yeah. I love you, too.

364
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,440
(The mountain range along Panthitpura’s border was uneven in height,

365
00:27:46,328 --> 00:27:50,601
(providing the ideal cover to keep the kingdom hidden from those passing by.)

366
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,540
(At the same time,

367
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:57,165
it kept the princess’s sorrowful, yearning gaze hidden

368
00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:01,413
(as she watched her love slowly walk away.)

369
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:09,703
(As pain took over her body, making her feel as if her heart had shattered into pieces,

370
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,922
she wondered...

371
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,654
if she cried out for her prince to stay,

372
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,914
(would he return?)

373
00:28:24,906 --> 00:28:29,001
(Yet, love... told her to let go.)

374
00:28:37,161 --> 00:28:38,850
Because we promised each other

375
00:28:41,274 --> 00:28:47,182
that our love would cause no pain to anyone.

376
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,503
MEET THE AUTHOR ‘OON-AI’
AI-OON INGSAMUG, AUTHOR OF ‘THE STORY OF YOU’

377
00:29:07,524 --> 00:29:08,995
I’m so happy for you.

378
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:11,320
I wish you great success.

379
00:29:11,797 --> 00:29:14,497
May your novel become a bestseller,

380
00:29:14,831 --> 00:29:15,831
gain fame,

381
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:18,688
and be reprinted again and again.

382
00:29:19,878 --> 00:29:21,096
Sadhu.

383
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,776
A wish from beautiful ladies always comes true.

384
00:29:26,154 --> 00:29:27,154
Sign it already.

385
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:30,822
Here.

386
00:29:30,914 --> 00:29:31,914
Thanks.

387
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,715
Sign it for me too.

388
00:29:34,582 --> 00:29:35,702
One day, when you’re famous,

389
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,179
I will sell it.

390
00:29:40,235 --> 00:29:41,305
You’re exaggerating.

391
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:43,179
I’m not.

392
00:29:43,205 --> 00:29:44,205
Look.

393
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,311
So many fans of your books have come.

394
00:29:48,074 --> 00:29:50,071
Today must be the happiest day for you.

395
00:29:52,272 --> 00:29:52,779
Here.

396
00:29:52,831 --> 00:29:53,831
Thank you.

397
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:56,309
Come on.

398
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:00,696
Hello.

399
00:30:00,752 --> 00:30:02,035
Your book is awesome.

400
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,180
Thank you.

401
00:30:03,687 --> 00:30:04,687
Thank you.

402
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:06,638
Hi.

403
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:07,814
I really like you.

404
00:30:08,035 --> 00:30:09,299
Really? Thank you.

405
00:30:11,568 --> 00:30:12,568
Thank you.

406
00:30:18,868 --> 00:30:20,120
Your book is amazing.

407
00:30:24,717 --> 00:30:25,902
But I think…

408
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:29,749
you should change the ending.

409
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,875
I’d love to see a happy ending.

410
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,700
What do you think?

411
00:31:00,841 --> 00:31:01,841
Hey.

412
00:31:02,508 --> 00:31:03,758
Please don’t do anything rash.

413
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:04,813
Stay calm.

414
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:10,598
What did you just say?

415
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,034
The ending is too sad.

416
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,712
Can it be changed?

417
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:26,703
Too late for that.

418
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:38,619
You’d better start writing a new one.

419
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:42,060
Choose the ending you want

420
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:48,217
because I want to see the author finally happy.

421
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:05,979
I’m sorry, Ai, for making you choose.

422
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:09,386
All this time,

423
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:12,549
I’ve received enough love from you.

424
00:32:14,931 --> 00:32:17,103
Now it’s time for me to return that love.

425
00:32:19,477 --> 00:32:21,096
Do what your heart desires, Ai.

426
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:37,614
You did well there.

427
00:33:39,023 --> 00:33:40,023
You saw that?

428
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:41,816
Mm.

429
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,080
I came just in time,

430
00:33:43,677 --> 00:33:45,277
but too late for the author’s autograph.

431
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,057
She disappeared so quick.

432
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:55,074
I’ve just realized today

433
00:33:57,041 --> 00:34:00,400
how letting go is an act of love.

434
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,125
Why looking at me with those eyes?

435
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,040
Don’t even start it. I’m so done.

436
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,681
People who got their hearts broken by Ai and turned to me.

437
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,447
You’re so wrong.

438
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,500
I’m just the opposite.

439
00:34:25,613 --> 00:34:27,097
When we were kids, I liked you first.

440
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,740
But I greeted the wrong girl.

441
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:31,860
That’s how I got to know Ai.

442
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,601
Funny, now that I think about it.

443
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:38,125
Gosh. How ridiculous.

444
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,112
You haven’t told me

445
00:34:58,509 --> 00:34:59,669
what brought you to my event.

446
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:05,497
Well, I really like your novel.

447
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,712
I came to get my favorite writer’s autograph.

448
00:35:13,724 --> 00:35:14,724
Was it Oom?

449
00:35:25,065 --> 00:35:26,185
If she hadn't been involved,

450
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,670
you wouldn't have had the courage to come.

451
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,880
Just like how I didn’t have the courage to ask you to wait.

452
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,780
Because I didn’t know when Oom would forgive me.

453
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:46,400
Deep down,

454
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,662
I’d hoped one of my books

455
00:35:50,961 --> 00:35:52,150
would bring you back to me.

456
00:36:01,277 --> 00:36:02,377
I am back now,

457
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,111
Miss Famous Writer.

458
00:36:13,357 --> 00:36:14,383
Welcome back.

459
00:36:19,063 --> 00:36:20,133
Now that you’re here,

460
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,742
don’t disappear again.

461
00:36:24,862 --> 00:36:25,862
Got it?

462
00:36:27,225 --> 00:36:29,007
After experiencing your love,

463
00:36:31,595 --> 00:36:36,730
it hasn’t been easy living without you.

464
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:45,743
If this were in a novel,

465
00:36:48,776 --> 00:36:51,801
this scene would be when the prince and the princess kiss.

466
00:36:54,832 --> 00:36:55,832
I’m glad that,

467
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,522
right here, we have a princess and a princess.

468
00:38:07,748 --> 00:38:09,925
I know it’s hard for you

469
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,066
to let Ai and May love each other.

470
00:38:15,161 --> 00:38:18,048
I’m so proud of you for being able to do it.

471
00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:21,800
You’re so great,

472
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,177
my precious girl.

473
00:38:29,195 --> 00:38:31,260
I didn’t think I could do it either, Grandma.

474
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,548
But after everything we went through,

475
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,157
seeing Paul heartbroken because of me,

476
00:38:43,711 --> 00:38:47,278
seeing Ai sad because she couldn’t be with May,

477
00:38:50,379 --> 00:38:51,580
I came to realize that

478
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:54,262
love…

479
00:38:56,915 --> 00:38:59,202
is about seeing the people you love happy.

480
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:06,899
Sometimes, it’s sad and difficult,

481
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,665
but there’s a sense of happiness in it.

482
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:18,277
It’s still better than seeing the people you love hurt.

483
00:39:19,551 --> 00:39:23,168
If that’s the case, we wouldn’t be happy at all.

484
00:39:25,672 --> 00:39:28,780
Whenever you feel unhappy, just let me know.

485
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:32,038
I’ll come to you right away.

486
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,370
Grandma.

487
00:39:35,115 --> 00:39:36,607
I love you.

488
00:39:36,882 --> 00:39:38,706
I love you too, Oom.

489
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,717
I’m starving.

490
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:50,875
Is it ready?

491
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:52,602
If you want to eat fast,

492
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,125
help me cook.

493
00:39:56,253 --> 00:39:57,253
Yes, chef.

494
00:40:05,368 --> 00:40:06,368
Whoa.

495
00:40:06,668 --> 00:40:07,945
Ready?

496
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:09,823
Be careful.

497
00:40:17,758 --> 00:40:19,601
Wow, it smells so nice.

498
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:26,659
Wait!

499
00:40:28,395 --> 00:40:29,395
Not yet.

500
00:40:30,005 --> 00:40:31,014
But I’m hungry.

501
00:40:34,084 --> 00:40:35,219
Add this first.

502
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:44,791
This.

503
00:40:48,974 --> 00:40:50,268
And…

504
00:40:52,591 --> 00:40:54,315
this.

505
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:55,951
Wow.

506
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,020
It looks so yummy.

507
00:40:57,397 --> 00:40:58,397
Right?

508
00:41:03,325 --> 00:41:04,783
Yum, yum.

509
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,542
Ah.

510
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:17,619
Um.

511
00:41:17,813 --> 00:41:18,813
Well?

512
00:41:19,296 --> 00:41:21,300
Fantastic, like something a chef would make.

513
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,002
Chef May.

514
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,874
Chef May.

515
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:23,616
Chef May.

516
00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:24,457
Chef May.

517
00:41:24,485 --> 00:41:25,183
Chef May.

518
00:41:25,311 --> 00:41:25,936
Chef May.

519
00:41:26,063 --> 00:41:26,856
Ai!

520
00:41:26,905 --> 00:41:27,482
Chef May.

521
00:41:27,548 --> 00:41:28,795
Stop it right now.

522
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,471
Here. Feed me.

523
00:41:30,608 --> 00:41:32,248
I’ll see if it’s as yummy as you claimed.

524
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:35,837
If you don’t believe me, you have to try it.

525
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,994
How is it?

526
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,533
See? I told you.

527
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,299
It’s so good, like it’s made by a chef.

528
00:41:55,226 --> 00:41:56,700
Wow, I’m quite skilled.

529
00:42:00,828 --> 00:42:01,828
You want more?

530
00:42:26,408 --> 00:42:28,539
It’s just like I said—chef-level good.

531
00:42:30,346 --> 00:42:31,069
Chef May.

532
00:42:31,277 --> 00:42:32,277
Chef May.

533
00:42:34,435 --> 00:42:35,435
May,

534
00:42:35,962 --> 00:42:38,000
did you buy my novel again?

535
00:42:38,331 --> 00:42:39,691
You already have, like, 20 copies.

536
00:42:40,994 --> 00:42:43,001
I saw it on the shelf and just couldn’t resist.

537
00:42:43,321 --> 00:42:45,302
Actually, I wanted to buy them all.

538
00:42:46,343 --> 00:42:47,343
Why?

539
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,960
Don’t you like me buying your books?

540
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,431
Am I not being sweet?

541
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,028
You are,

542
00:42:57,525 --> 00:42:58,896
but it's a waste of money.

543
00:43:00,762 --> 00:43:02,899
For you, the word 'waste' doesn't really apply.

544
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,739
Don’t ever say that to anyone.

545
00:43:09,771 --> 00:43:10,771
Why is that?

546
00:43:12,493 --> 00:43:13,669
Because it’s cute.

547
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,770
HELLO. HAPPY MONDAY.

548
00:43:30,145 --> 00:43:31,145
What is it?

549
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,124
My dad just sent me a message.

550
00:43:41,979 --> 00:43:43,174
“Hello. Happy Monday.”

551
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:46,977
It’s normal for people this age.

552
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:49,823
Grandma always sends this kind of stuff to me and my sister.

553
00:43:49,863 --> 00:43:50,863
No.

554
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,100
My dad isn’t like other dads.

555
00:43:58,991 --> 00:44:00,671
He’s never done anything like this for me.

556
00:44:03,413 --> 00:44:05,333
He always thinks he’s better than everyone else.

557
00:44:07,973 --> 00:44:09,585
He doesn’t approach people

558
00:44:11,527 --> 00:44:13,068
unless they’re beneficial to him.

559
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:19,868
Since you've fully recovered,

560
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,200
you haven’t seen your dad once, right?

561
00:44:24,589 --> 00:44:26,029
Only your mom comes by to visit you.

562
00:44:27,382 --> 00:44:29,320
Maybe your dad misses you.

563
00:44:31,631 --> 00:44:32,631
No way.

564
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,232
For someone like him,

565
00:44:38,422 --> 00:44:40,232
if he doesn't want something,

566
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,680
he'd have to be so ill that his brain malfunctions.

567
00:44:47,306 --> 00:44:49,506
Otherwise, he wouldn't have sent me something like this.

568
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,672
Do we really have to go?

569
00:45:08,814 --> 00:45:09,814
We could just call.

570
00:45:10,487 --> 00:45:13,180
If you could, you wouldn’t have gotten in the car with me.

571
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:15,948
You need to go see for yourself

572
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:17,733
to know what’s going on with him.

573
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,105
May.

574
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,754
You came to visit me and your dad?

575
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,180
What do you want to eat?

576
00:45:37,352 --> 00:45:38,592
I’ll cook it for you right now.

577
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:41,800
I was just passing by

578
00:45:42,066 --> 00:45:43,106
so I stopped to visit you.

579
00:45:43,509 --> 00:45:45,570
I should make you something delicious.

580
00:45:46,915 --> 00:45:47,915
That’s okay, Mom.

581
00:45:48,616 --> 00:45:49,703
I won’t stay long.

582
00:45:52,623 --> 00:45:54,383
There are some Chinese pears in the kitchen.

583
00:45:54,931 --> 00:45:56,371
They’re from your favorite merchant.

584
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:58,103
I bought them this morning.

585
00:45:59,494 --> 00:46:00,494
That’s nice.

586
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:02,798
I remember how much you loved Chinese pears when you were a kid.

587
00:46:02,822 --> 00:46:03,903
I'll peel some for you,

588
00:46:04,106 --> 00:46:05,502
and box them up for takeaway.

589
00:46:06,317 --> 00:46:07,317
All right, honey?

590
00:46:14,962 --> 00:46:16,004
I saw your message.

591
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:17,718
Did you want something?

592
00:46:21,158 --> 00:46:22,158
Wasn’t it pretty?

593
00:46:23,939 --> 00:46:24,939
What?

594
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The flower photo.

595
00:46:29,026 --> 00:46:30,219
I thought it was pretty,

596
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:32,550
so I sent it to you.

597
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:42,404
Your friend doesn’t have to wait in the car.

598
00:46:42,428 --> 00:46:43,428
It’s hot.

599
00:46:44,531 --> 00:46:45,576
Tell her to come inside.

600
00:46:59,308 --> 00:46:59,915
Mom.

601
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:01,195
Hm?

602
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:03,179
This is a serious question.

603
00:47:05,662 --> 00:47:06,800
Is Dad doing okay?

604
00:47:08,417 --> 00:47:10,714
Is he sick and not telling me?

605
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,349
Why would you think that?

606
00:47:15,346 --> 00:47:17,407
He sent me a photo of flowers.

607
00:47:19,013 --> 00:47:20,903
He sends them to me too.

608
00:47:21,146 --> 00:47:23,800
He's been into planting flowers lately.

609
00:47:24,038 --> 00:47:25,718
Maybe he just wanted to share it with you.

610
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,597
When was the last time he had a health check-up?

611
00:47:29,017 --> 00:47:30,648
I wondered the same thing at first.

612
00:47:30,965 --> 00:47:33,774
But your dad is healthy, really.

613
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,776
I don’t know what changed him.

614
00:47:37,442 --> 00:47:42,300
But remember when you once said someone made him blind?

615
00:47:42,816 --> 00:47:45,509
I think he’s been cured now.

616
00:48:16,813 --> 00:48:17,420
Do you like them?

617
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,670
Oh!

618
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:20,660
Hello, sir.

619
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,880
You’re a girl,

620
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:28,730
so I assume you like flowers.

621
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,040
I don’t think May does, though.

622
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:37,605
She does.

623
00:48:47,816 --> 00:48:48,816
If that’s so,

624
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,440
can you help plant this at May’s house?

625
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:02,200
Take good care of it.

626
00:49:12,493 --> 00:49:13,493
Of course.

627
00:49:14,594 --> 00:49:15,594
Thank you.

628
00:49:26,706 --> 00:49:27,718
Your flower...

629
00:49:29,201 --> 00:49:30,413
I’ll take good care of it.

630
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:39,262
Will you excuse us then?

631
00:49:41,591 --> 00:49:42,591
Goodbye.

632
00:49:51,044 --> 00:49:52,500
You seem happier.

633
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:22,511
What are you doing?

634
00:50:23,642 --> 00:50:24,642
Writing a novel.

635
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:29,771
(I’m writing my new novel,

636
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,402
(just like everyone else who is starting their new chapter.)

637
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,197
Mr. Benjapol is here to talk about the rights of people with disabilities

638
00:50:37,216 --> 00:50:39,720
that everyone should be aware of and uphold.

639
00:50:43,312 --> 00:50:44,312
Wow.

640
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:45,697
You’ve become a serious writer.

641
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,800
THREE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY:
FREE FORTUNE READING PLUS AUSPICIOUS TREE.

642
00:50:49,284 --> 00:50:51,216
(I learned that every time one story ends,

643
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,903
(the next begins—and it’s more fun…)

644
00:50:54,914 --> 00:50:55,969
I HAVE REFLECTED ON MY WRONG DOING

645
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,279
(...better, )
AND DEEPLY REGRET MY ACTIONS.

646
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:57,888
I OFFER MY SINCERE APOLOGIES TO

647
00:50:57,889 --> 00:50:59,107
(and happier.)
I OFFER MY SINCERE APOLOGIES TO

648
00:50:59,108 --> 00:51:00,202
POLICE CAPTAIN PIMPAKORN DECHA-ANEK.

649
00:51:00,226 --> 00:51:01,890
Down the hatch, guys!

650
00:51:05,081 --> 00:51:06,980
Aw, look.

651
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:08,790
How sweet.

652
00:51:09,779 --> 00:51:10,908
Too sweet.

653
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,616
Ai, what are you doing?

654
00:51:23,607 --> 00:51:25,238
May’s been waiting for you.

655
00:51:25,405 --> 00:51:26,885
Oom called and said you should hurry.

656
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,102
I know, Grandma.

657
00:51:44,746 --> 00:51:45,746
May.

658
00:52:02,198 --> 00:52:04,567
My bride is beautiful.

659
00:52:07,025 --> 00:52:10,477
No, my bride is the most beautiful.

660
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,260
You’ve got such a sweet tongue.

661
00:52:27,459 --> 00:52:28,459
Of course.

662
00:52:28,705 --> 00:52:29,705
You’ve tasted it before.

663
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:33,807
You’re so full of yourself,

664
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:36,878
Miss Famous Writer.

665
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:39,225
I’m not a writer right now.

666
00:52:41,632 --> 00:52:43,108
Right now, I’m just your Ai.

667
00:52:50,189 --> 00:52:52,124
I finished You’re My Charon.

668
00:52:57,573 --> 00:53:01,100
You named your book You’re My Charon.

669
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,840
What does it mean?

670
00:53:14,088 --> 00:53:18,499
Pluto always has Charon by its side.

671
00:53:20,844 --> 00:53:25,700
It’s the moon that stays with Pluto forever,

672
00:53:28,487 --> 00:53:30,106
regardless of whether Pluto...

673
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:34,222
is in the solar system or not.

674
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:40,374
So, it means we don’t have to be someone special to everyone...

675
00:53:47,771 --> 00:53:49,757
we just need to find our own Charon.

676
00:53:58,257 --> 00:54:01,502
Just like how I found you in the end.

677
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,240
Exactly.

678
00:54:05,096 --> 00:54:08,383
Just like how we found each other.

679
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,699
(As two galaxies intertwined,

680
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:30,709
(I'd be Charon—right by your side.)

681
00:54:31,765 --> 00:54:35,005
(I steer cross water, rippling at your door,

682
00:54:35,961 --> 00:54:39,398
(Whispering through vast space of forevermore.)

683
00:54:53,442 --> 00:54:54,728
Alrighty, the bride and the bride,

684
00:54:54,752 --> 00:54:56,201
please look at the camera.

685
00:55:16,671 --> 00:55:17,671
Grandma,

686
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:18,940
Oom,

687
00:55:19,371 --> 00:55:20,416
come take photos with us.

688
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,700
Yes. Thank you, dear.

689
00:55:27,936 --> 00:55:29,600
Wow, your dress is gorgeous.

690
00:55:30,346 --> 00:55:31,600
You’re gorgeous too, Grandma.

691
00:55:33,232 --> 00:55:34,512
Come on. Let’s snap some photos.

692
00:55:36,488 --> 00:55:37,539
Look this way, please.

693
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:40,441
One, two, three.

694
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:42,059
Beautiful.

695
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:43,266
Now, squeeze in a little.

696
00:55:44,394 --> 00:55:45,394
That’s great.

697
00:55:46,285 --> 00:55:46,877
Ready?

698
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,616
One, two, three.
