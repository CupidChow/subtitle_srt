1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,100
And from which star do you descend?

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,700
Your brightness lights the sky’s far end,

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,570
You’re a dazzling star within my eyes,

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,860
A spark of faith in love radiantly shines.

5
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,250
Hey!

6
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,570
And which planet does this sweet girlfriend of mine come from?

7
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,960
Pluto.

8
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:01,870
(That’s right.)

9
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:08,000
(Our story runs like Pluto’s longest journey.)

10
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,910
It starts with the Sun, then Mercury,

11
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,255
Venus, Earth…

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,180
2011
Venus, Earth…

13
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:25,640
2011

14
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:29,332
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, 2011

15
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,500
Uranus, and Neptune.

16
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,600
Ma’am.

17
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,670
Did you forget Pluto?

18
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,130
Pluto was taken out of the solar system in 2006.

19
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,970
That’s correct.

20
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,640
Very good, Oaboom.

21
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,180
You’re also good, Ai-oon.

22
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,700
You remember Pluto was in the solar system.

23
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,460
I like its name, Pluto.

24
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,920
It sounds like...

25
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,660
‘fat belly’.

26
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,450
Nonsense.

27
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,490
(I’ve always thought that,)

28
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,030
(instead of Pluto disappearing from the solar system,)

29
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,470
(it should be my little sister.)

30
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,240
Watch out!

31
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,440
No!

32
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,280
Ai-oon.

33
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,140
Ai-oon!

34
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,360
Grandma.

35
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,570
What’s going on?

36
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,390
What happened?

37
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,770
Oaboom got into a car crash.

38
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,930
A car crash.

39
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,200
Goodness!

40
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,850
Oom!

41
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,250
Please wait outside.

42
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,800
- Wait outside.
- Oom!

43
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,520
Oom!

44
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,700
(What must I do to bring Pluto back into the solar system?)

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,239
10 HOURS EARLIER

46
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,870
Good evening. 10 HOURS EARLIER

47
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:43,290
10 HOURS EARLIER

48
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:46,960
This way, please.

49
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,400
Ma’am, you can’t go in.

50
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,940
Why can’t a guest go in?

51
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,200
We welcome guests,

52
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,320
but it appears you came to cause a disturbance.

53
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,200
Oh.

54
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,170
Right.

55
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,500
I didn’t even want to come.

56
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,510
Keep it for me.

57
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,010
Goodness, Ai-oon.

58
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,320
Why are you so late?

59
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,210
Grandma, why are you complaining?

60
00:05:33,364 --> 00:05:34,920
I told you I had customers.

61
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,900
Look around.

62
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,505
All the guests are here.

63
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,860
And look what you’re wearing.

64
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,670
Go change right now.

65
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,170
Don’t embarrass your sister.

66
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,710
Will you stop nagging?

67
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,420
Excuse me.

68
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,110
I’m the bride’s grandmother.

69
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:48,790
Excuse me.

70
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,600
Sorry.

71
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,560
Excuse me.

72
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,770
First of all,
we’d like to extend our gratitude for your attendance.

73
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,200
Our meeting and falling in love,

74
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,000
I have no doubt it was destiny.

75
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,700
I must thank it for destining me

76
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,980
to be a flight attendant at your airline, Paul.

77
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,020
Thank you, Oom, for being my angel.

78
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,620
I fell in love with her at first sight

79
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,670
and my love grows stronger every day.

80
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,570
Thank you for opening your heart and accepting who I am.

81
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,400
Thank you for trusting your life with me.

82
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,860
I promise that...

83
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,270
I will love and take care of this woman for the rest of my life.

84
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,510
Even though our love hasn’t been that long,

85
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,770
I trust it will last forever.

86
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,370
Forever.

87
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,130
Hey.

88
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,340
- What?
- Look at your sister.

89
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,970
I’m looking, alright?

90
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,920
Don’t just look.

91
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,610
Follow what she’s doing.

92
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,910
It’s time you start looking for a decent job.

93
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,320
Then you’ll meet a good boyfriend

94
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,820
and start a nice family like Oom does.

95
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:39,850
You hear?

96
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,360
So I can stop worrying.

97
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,640
Kiss.

98
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,470
Kiss.

99
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,490
Kiss.

100
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,100
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

101
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,400
Couldn’t stand seeing me happy?

102
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,060
If you were truly happy,

103
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,700
you wouldn't come find me here.

104
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,960
You still think you know things so well.

105
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,370
I came

106
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,620
because I’ve got something to say.

107
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,560
What?

108
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,320
Do you remember

109
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,900
when you said you’d make up for pretending to be me?

110
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,160
AI-OON INGSAMAK

111
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,410
OABOOM INGSAMAK

112
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,890
OABOOM INGSAMAK

113
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,510
I think we’re the most different twin sisters.

114
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,900
It’s just a private school scholarship.

115
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,260
Don’t be snobbish, it’s ridiculous.

116
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,690
And you can’t deny the fact that

117
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,320
we look exactly alike.

118
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,410
Then I will show you

119
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,400
how much more different we can be.

120
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,460
Then I will show you how much we’re alike.

121
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,470
Starting from me attending your school.

122
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,900
Let’s see if people notice at all.

123
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,320
Hey, stop!

124
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,930
Give my uniform back right now.

125
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,770
What did you do while wearing my clothes and going by my name?

126
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,570
Who did that to you?

127
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,720
So it’s really you.

128
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,100
Damn it, those bullies.

129
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,410
I’m gonna make them pay.

130
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,120
Then what? They make me pay again?

131
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,770
What do you want me to do then?

132
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,210
What’s done is done.

133
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,300
Would you like to slap me instead?

134
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,350
You must make it up to me.

135
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,000
I’ll make it up to you one day.

136
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,610
I’ll do anything.

137
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,180
Don’t lie.

138
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,510
I’m not lying.

139
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,350
If I go back on my word,

140
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,370
I’ll bark like a dog in front of a temple.

141
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,840
Fine.

142
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,820
I’ll keep that in mind.

143
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,460
I don’t remember.

144
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,350
You do remember.

145
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,550
Don’t play dumb.

146
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,570
If you go back on your word,
you’ll bark like a dog in front of a temple.

147
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,530
Those are your words.

148
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,980
Would you do that instead?

149
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,020
Fine. What do you want me to do?

150
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,960
Can you break up with my other lover for me?

151
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,860
What the heck?

152
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,560
Are you two-timing?

153
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,180
You don’t need to know the details.

154
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,320
Just pretend to be me...

155
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,470
and end things with the person.

156
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,600
Gosh.

157
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,700
You’re unbelievable.

158
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,480
It's nearly your bridal bed ceremony,

159
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,960
yet you haven't broken up with your lover.

160
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,160
How disgusting.

161
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,000
I’m not asking you to scold me.

162
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,270
I’m asking you to end it for me.

163
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,700
Why should I do it?

164
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,520
To make it up to me.

165
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,300
This is how you do it.

166
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,900
Do you realize what you’re asking?

167
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,910
Pretending to be you was a silly joke.

168
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,820
It's not like I did anything evil.

169
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,700
Whatever bad shit you did,

170
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,810
fix it yourself.

171
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,510
Don’t drag me into your sickening cycle.

172
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,280
Ai, stop right now.

173
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,900
Ai, come back	and talk to me.

174
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,020
There’s nothing to talk about.

175
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,710
I’d rather bark in front of a temple

176
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,870
than do something horrible for you.

177
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,570
What if I’m asking as your little sister?

178
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,860
What are you doing out here?

179
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:56,960
Nothing.

180
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,210
Just came to get some fresh air.

181
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,200
You look stressed.

182
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,580
Something bothering you?

183
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,310
I hope we can talk openly about everything.

184
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,830
Sure.

185
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,900
I will tell you everything.

186
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,800
(I used to think people like Oaboom

187
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,010
were selfish and irritating.)

188
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,170
(But I forgot to realize that

189
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,900
she’s the only sibling I have.)

190
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,110
- How is our son?
- Doctor?

191
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,860
I’m so sorry.

192
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,250
Paul.

193
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,120
My son.

194
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,910
Doctor?

195
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,520
You’re Ms. Oaboom’s relatives?

196
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,600
- Yes.
- We are.

197
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,500
We removed the blood clot from her brain.

198
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,890
She’s still unconscious at the moment.

199
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,110
We’ll keep you updated with any news.

200
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,640
Thank you.

201
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,210
(Come back, Oaboom.)

202
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,200
(Give me a chance to fulfill my big sister's duties.)

203
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,500
Oom is out of the woods.

204
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,400
She just hasn’t woken up yet.

205
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,150
That’s why visiting isn’t allowed.

206
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,800
She needs to be monitored daily.

207
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,210
I just want her to recover fast.

208
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,220
I can’t believe it happened on her wedding day.

209
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,760
I feel sorry for her.

210
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,300
She found her partner for life,

211
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,210
but death took him away.

212
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,020
Jan.

213
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,110
You know everything about Oom, don’t you?

214
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,710
What do you mean?

215
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,980
Did you know Oom was with someone else

216
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,630
but got married to Paul anyway?

217
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,070
Why do you ask?

218
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,140
I’m asking because

219
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,970
it’s the only thing I can do for her.

220
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,500
Tell me.

221
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,300
Who’s she dating and where can I find this person?

222
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,480
Shit.

223
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,010
Damn it.

224
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,020
Hello, Ms. Oom.

225
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,510
It’s been a while.

226
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,170
May asked if you could wait in the reading room as always.

227
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,300
Sure.

228
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,620
This way.

229
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,150
Please.

230
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,500
Thanks.

231
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,110
What kind of guy is named ‘May’?

232
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,660
Oom.

233
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,610
Is that you?

234
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,020
May?

235
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,910
It’s really you.

236
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,870
Your face,

237
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,660
eyes,

238
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,410
nose,

239
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,850
and lips.

240
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,120
You really came back to me?

241
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,430
(She pulled me close,)

242
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,800
(touching her small forehead to mine,)

243
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,200
(then the tip of her small nose.)

244
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,620
(Our quiet breathing felt so loud,)

245
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,400
(as if it were confirming that we truly existed.)

246
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,600
(Her soft lips...)

247
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,900
(slowly tasted every part of mine,)

248
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,810
(as if savoring something delicious.)

249
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,610
(Each of her touches was gentle...)

250
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,200
(yet filled with longing,)

251
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,170
(deep yet tender,)

252
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,720
(as if she were afraid we might break.)

253
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,500
(The moment a sweet, tempting touch of love took over us,)

254
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,520
(I forgot that...)

255
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,810
(she was my little sister’s girlfriend.)

256
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,710
Hold on, May.

257
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,670
I’m sorry.

258
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,520
I guess you didn’t want to kiss me.

259
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,810
No!

260
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,860
So you wanted to kiss me?

261
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,770
Yes.

262
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,300
I mean… no.

263
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:11,980
I mean yes.

264
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,670
But May,

265
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,970
I think we should talk.

266
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,980
Let’s talk.

267
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,500
About what?

268
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,800
About you.

269
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,360
I just got back from Jammu the other day.

270
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,470
Didn’t think you’d come see me this soon.

271
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,360
Oom,

272
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,270
you’re still with me?

273
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,510
Oh.

274
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,220
Sorry.

275
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,880
I forgot.

276
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,800
I just nodded.

277
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,300
It’s alright. I get you.

278
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,000
You’re not used to it yet.

279
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,700
We haven't spent much time together since I went blind.

280
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,000
(Gosh, Oaboom.)

281
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,600
(Don’t tell me you ditched her because she’s blind.)

282
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,470
Don’t worry, May.

283
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,430
I’m here with you now.

284
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,840
Can you please not disappear on me again?

285
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,100
Can you?

286
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:42,830
Oom.

287
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,730
Oom.

288
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,420
Oops.

289
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,320
Dang it!

290
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,420
Oom.

291
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,300
Ouch.

292
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,340
Oom, are you hurt?

293
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,400
Stop, May.

294
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:00,670
Don’t move.

295
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,260
There’s glass scattered all over the floor.

296
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,910
Nid.

297
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,110
Yes, Ms. May?

298
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,700
Please bring me the first aid kit.

299
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,210
Right away, ma’am.

300
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,110
Your wound must be dressed.

301
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,410
I can do it myself.

302
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,790
You think I can’t dress your wound because I’m blind?

303
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,180
It’s not that.

304
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,960
I just think it’d be easier if I do it.

305
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,170
Don’t be stubborn.

306
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,630
My girlfriend’s hurt

307
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,290
and I’m dressing her wound.

308
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,900
Just tell me where it is.

309
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,720
Quickly, Miss.

310
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,130
Right here, Miss.

311
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,800
It’s gonna hurt a bit.

312
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,140
Ow.

313
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,850
Can you handle the pain?

314
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,150
Hold on.

315
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,700
All done.

316
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,580
Speedy recovery,

317
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,500
my brilliant girlfriend.

318
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,130
May.

319
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,900
I forgot something in the car.

320
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,600
Be right back.

321
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,420
Hey.

322
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,420
I’ve got a problem.

323
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,800
Besides your little sister’s car accident,

324
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,370
your mission to break up with her ex,

325
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,070
and letting your grandma attend Oom’s husband’s funeral alone,

326
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,910
there’s more problem to add?

327
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,610
A shocking problem.

328
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,800
May, Oom’s ex, is a girl.

329
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,100
How’s that shocking?

330
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,610
I date girls too.

331
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,820
You’ve always dated girls.

332
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,370
But Oom’s never told anyone she had a female lover.

333
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,410
She didn’t break up with her before getting married to a guy.

334
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,160
Damn. I feel bad for her.

335
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,160
Just suck it up.

336
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,660
It’s not like Oom could do the breakup.

337
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,020
You ended things with her,

338
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,310
so there are no more cliffhangers.

339
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,630
Think of it as atoning for your sister's sin.

340
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,770
- Don’t tell me you haven’t—
- No.

341
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,210
I haven’t broken up with her.

342
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,360
What?

343
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,010
I couldn’t.

344
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,210
She’s blind.

345
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,470
Holy shit.

346
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,810
Now that’s shocking.

347
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:08,770
Exactly.

348
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,450
And she seemed to love Oom so much.

349
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,000
You see, I got injured

350
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,610
and she band-aided me without seeing anything.

351
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,310
She could do that?

352
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,700
Damn, she’s smart.

353
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,860
How did she not know her girlfriend was cheating on her?

354
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,900
I just told you she’s blind.

355
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,200
Also, she just got back from abroad.

356
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,020
It’s a different country, not a different planet.

357
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,720
The internet should’ve worked.

358
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:41,860
Besides,

359
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,860
Oom didn’t get married to a nobody.

360
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,970
It’s Mr. Paul, an airline owner.

361
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,820
It should be news on social media.

362
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,060
And what about her family and friends?

363
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,560
No one told her at all?

364
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,430
It’s weird, don’t you think?

365
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,380
What are you saying?

366
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,230
Look.

367
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,810
These days, lots of people kill for love.

368
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,670
But she’s blind.

369
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,600
Damn right.

370
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,910
Oom left her to marry someone else because she’s blind.

371
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,970
Wouldn’t you be resentful if you were her?

372
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,210
What are you doing?

373
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,460
Checking Oom’s phone.

374
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,310
Looking for more info on May.

375
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,910
No chat history.

376
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,160
No phone number.

377
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,660
No photos.

378
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,720
There’s nothing about May in here.

379
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,570
Listen.

380
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,130
Oom must have deleted it all.

381
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,320
She was two-timing, wasn’t she?

382
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,670
She couldn’t risk Mr. Paul finding out.

383
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,040
What are you suspecting?

384
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,520
I don’t know.

385
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,500
I just can’t believe she’s Oom’s girlfriend.

386
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,000
You feel pity for her,

387
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,240
but not for your little sister?

388
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,070
What are you trying to tell me?

389
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:28,780
I just have…

390
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,410
some thoughts.

391
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,860
What kind of relationship is it

392
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,530
if one person doesn't even know the other has gotten married?

393
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,200
What if she knows

394
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,770
but pretends not to?

395
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,170
Why would she do that?

396
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,070
Listen to me.

397
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,750
Acting as if she knows

398
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:53,810
can reveal who is most affected by Oom's marriage

399
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,500
and who harbors the most resentment.

400
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,500
That’s her.

401
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:05,980
You’re accusing someone you haven't even met.

402
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,700
You’re protecting someone you’ve just met once.

403
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,570
Hey. Where are you going?

404
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,110
I’m pretending I’m Oom

405
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,010
and find out the truth about May.

406
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,210
Hello, Grandma.

407
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,970
The patient is stable.

408
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,250
Her vital signs are normal.

409
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:47,980
She just hasn’t regained consciousness yet.

410
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,010
When will she wake up?

411
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,060
I don't have an answer to that.

412
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,720
We need to continue monitoring.

413
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,670
Is she going into a vegetative state?

414
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,980
I don't have an answer to that, either.

415
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,460
But I’m afraid there’s a chance.

416
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,800
Please excuse me.

417
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,850
Oh, no.

418
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:10,920
No.

419
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,420
Ms. Oom, you’re back again.

420
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,650
Just like Ms. May said.

421
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,820
May said that?

422
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,510
You two planned to meet up, right?

423
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,170
Yes.

424
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,350
You went out the whole night to get your stuff.

425
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:55,560
A family issue came up.

426
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,460
I forgot to tell you.

427
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,010
Sorry.

428
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,000
By the way,

429
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,980
how did you know it’s me?

430
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,900
I recognize the sound of your walk.

431
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,260
Don’t you remember?

432
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,070
I do.

433
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,470
I was just rechecking.

434
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,820
Why are you not wearing our matching ring?

435
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,710
You can’t let me wear it alone.

436
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,200
You’re still wearing it?

437
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,650
I don’t believe you.

438
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:56,550
Here.

439
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:00,700
Believe me now?

440
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,170
Why are you still wearing it?

441
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,860
When we were fighting,

442
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,710
I ordered you out.

443
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,510
I thought you’d hate me

444
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,370
and never want to come back to me.

445
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,010
Actually,

446
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,210
I’d always waited for you.

447
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,660
(Shit.)

448
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,570
(What am I thinking?)

449
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,610
I’m gonna ask you again.

450
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,820
Can you not leave me again?

451
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,160
I want you, Oom.

452
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,180
Only you.

453
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,000
Why…

454
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,660
do you want to get back together with me?

455
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,300
Because I tried dating someone else,

456
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,200
but it didn’t work.

457
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,570
I must be you, Oom.

458
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,120
Just you.

459
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:33,910
Please.

460
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,180
What exactly happened between you and May?

461
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,940
Is May the reason you’re lying here?

462
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,530
Please. I’m begging you.

463
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,810
Oaboom is a nice kid.

464
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,410
She shouldn’t leave so soon.

465
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,900
Please.

466
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,740
Let her wake up and take my life instead.

467
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:33,770
Grandma.

468
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,470
Grandma!

469
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,030
Stop saying things like that.

470
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:39,700
Do you want me to just let your sister die?

471
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,950
So you’re willing to sacrifice your life for hers?

472
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,690
Tell me.

473
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,370
If it was me,

474
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,970
would you be this devastated?

475
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,520
You keep surprising me, Oom.

476
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,210
You came so late.

477
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,400
It’s either you miss me so much

478
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,200
or something is bothering you.

479
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,330
It’s okay.

480
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,210
I’m right here.

481
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,100
I’m okay now.

482
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,100
I’m sorry.

483
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,460
I didn’t mean to reject you.

484
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,190
It was alright.

485
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,300
But now, I’m not.

486
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:30,220
You don’t like being cuddled?

487
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:38,410
It’s not that.

488
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,410
It’s just…

489
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,200
we never slept in the same bed.

490
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,160
What?

491
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,250
Why do you sound so surprised?

492
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,050
Nothing.

493
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,970
I just realized it’s not my place,

494
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,180
and I’m worried I won’t be able to sleep.

495
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,540
(How ‘together’ were they?)

496
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,620
(How come they never shared a bed?)

497
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,410
Should I…

498
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,740
tell you a bedtime story?

499
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,160
I’m not a kid, May.

500
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,410
Then who was the crying child who came seeking my consolation?

501
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:28,141
Well…

502
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,070
It’s okay.

503
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,020
With me,

504
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:52,500
you can be as vulnerable or childish as you want.

505
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:01,320
Then…

506
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,200
tell me a story that will bring sweet dreams.

507
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,520
Once upon a time,

508
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:16,170
there was a land filled with all kinds of rabbits

509
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,000
who were smart,

510
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:21,210
nimble,

511
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:22,970
and agile.

512
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,910
One day,

513
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,720
a sloth wandered into their land

514
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:37,810
and jumped around their village.

515
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:46,310
Eventually, the rabbits and the sloth became friends...

516
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:15,880
Oh.

517
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,520
You’re awake?

518
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:21,570
Feeling better now?

519
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:31,610
No?

520
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:34,620
Well…

521
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,060
What can I do to help?

522
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,530
How’s that?

523
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:58,510
Better?

524
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:04,780
Not yet?

525
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:09,570
I’m feeling better.

526
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:11,970
I’m better now, May.

527
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:15,970
That was too fast.

528
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:17,970
I still want to comfort you.

529
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:19,870
Let me comfort you more.

530
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:20,790
Come here.

531
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:22,010
Hold on, May.

532
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:30,580
I'm sorry for ambushing you at night

533
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,900
and making you comfort me.

534
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,820
It’s all good.

535
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,200
I’m glad you thought of me.

536
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,180
Come to me anytime.

537
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,610
JAN

538
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:55,530
I need to answer that.

539
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,220
Hello.

540
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:12,330
What is it?

541
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:13,800
I’m busy.

542
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:15,110
(This is important.)

543
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:16,410
(You must be available.)

544
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,970
(The police said the car accident may have been intentional.)

545
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:21,410
What?

546
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,220
Intentional? How?

547
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,160
(An unfamiliar number called Paul's phone...)

548
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,600
just before they rushed out of the hotel.

549
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,030
The caller could be behind the accident.

550
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:33,400
But why would someone want them dead?

551
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:34,770
Gosh.

552
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:37,000
When did they even have an enemy?

553
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,420
Oom and Paul’s enemy?

554
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:15,020
I still think Metawe is the most suspicious.

555
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:18,620
We’ll eventually find out if Metawe is behind this.

556
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:19,860
As long as you're with me,

557
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,300
I’ll go anywhere.

558
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,310
There wouldn’t be disabled people

559
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:26,060
if places were universally designed.

560
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,090
I’m sorry.

561
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:30,700
I made going out a bad idea for you.

562
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,370
