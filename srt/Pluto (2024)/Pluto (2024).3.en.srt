1
00:00:00,112 --> 00:00:01,703
I want to see Pluto.

2
00:00:01,989 --> 00:00:03,507
You can’t see it with the naked eye.

3
00:00:03,694 --> 00:00:05,000
Even more reason to like it.

4
00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:06,310
Why's that?

5
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,067
Because…

6
00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:11,025
it makes me feel like I’m not the only one blind.

7
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:13,176
May, who did anything to you?

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,490
CALLING ALL TALENTED WRITERS AND CREATORS!

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,850
‘KAIHUAROR’ IS NOW ACCEPTING SUBMISSIONS FOR PUBLICATION.

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,250
DETAILS ON COMPENSATION BELOW:

11
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,130
KAIHUAROR

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,440
THE ACCIDENTAL TWINS

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,690
HERE’S SOMETHING FUNNY— I WAS BORN WITH TWO BODIES…

14
00:00:35,706 --> 00:00:37,408
I’m really happy for you, Duean.

15
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:43,728
I heard this school has a high college acceptance rate.

16
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:44,616
Hope that’s true.

17
00:00:46,207 --> 00:00:47,716
What about Ai-oon?

18
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:48,812
Got accepted to the same school?

19
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,713
Don’t even get me started.

20
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:56,266
I feel blessed enough that Ai-oon got accepted into her school.

21
00:00:56,978 --> 00:00:58,619
I feel bad for the teachers, though.

22
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:01,112
She’s definitely going to give them headaches.

23
00:01:01,502 --> 00:01:02,109
It’s alright.

24
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,504
Ai might be a handful,

25
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:07,002
but you can always count on Oom.

26
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:08,614
Right.

27
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,610
So how much is all this?

28
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:13,805
We’ve been chatting so much I forgot.

29
00:01:36,298 --> 00:01:37,360
Damn.

30
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:41,212
You’re worse than I thought.

31
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:46,473
Was it your precious grandma or your beloved twin sister this time?

32
00:01:47,562 --> 00:01:48,409
Piss off.

33
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,008
If you’re not addicted,

34
00:01:55,284 --> 00:01:56,381
you shouldn’t smoke.

35
00:01:57,138 --> 00:01:57,937
You’re wasting it.

36
00:02:00,313 --> 00:02:01,863
You might choke on it to death.

37
00:02:02,544 --> 00:02:03,201
Good!

38
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:06,310
Maybe I should just die and end it all.

39
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,908
You get this shit your whole life.

40
00:02:09,435 --> 00:02:10,505
Aren’t you used to it by now?

41
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,408
If someone keeps stepping on your foot,

42
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,520
do you stop feeling the pain?

43
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:19,706
Screw it.

44
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,774
I can never escape Grandma’s words.

45
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:24,872
What can I do?

46
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:27,411
I was born less smart than my sister.

47
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,574
Maybe I deserve the condemnation.

48
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:35,807
When you’re with friends,

49
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,567
you don’t have to act cool.

50
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:39,860
If you’re angry, say you’re angry.

51
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:44,709
Hell, yeah.

52
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,709
I’m angry.

53
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,221
I’m freaking mad.

54
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,210
Happy now?

55
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:50,409
I’m annoyed.

56
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,776
I’m so tired of being hounded. Damn it.

57
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:56,238
Hey.

58
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,873
I know a place

59
00:02:59,435 --> 00:03:03,400
that’s loud enough to drown out all the scolding you hear.

60
00:03:06,622 --> 00:03:07,300
Where?

61
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:14,509
Faster. Go pass them!

62
00:03:21,317 --> 00:03:22,487
What are you, turtles?

63
00:03:22,498 --> 00:03:23,306
Keep up.

64
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:24,668
You guys are slow.

65
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:26,384
Hey, go faster.

66
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:27,576
Let’s shut him up.

67
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,696
Let’s go.

68
00:03:30,897 --> 00:03:31,995
Go faster.

69
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:33,628
Bring it on.

70
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,628
Let’s race.

71
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:40,309
Shit.

72
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,234
The police.

73
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:42,713
Ko.

74
00:03:42,814 --> 00:03:43,375
Ko!

75
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,241
The police.

76
00:03:45,154 --> 00:03:46,138
Shit. The police.

77
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:49,182
Turn at the next corner.

78
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:54,712
We’re clear.

79
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:56,202
You’re pretty awesome.

80
00:03:57,877 --> 00:03:59,381
I guess it’s my escape instinct.

81
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:04,603
(With the wind blowing and the exhaust roaring,)

82
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:10,001
(I realized that the sound I liked best...)

83
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,504
(was the sound of my own heartbeat.)

84
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:17,805
(It was pounding so wildly)

85
00:04:20,235 --> 00:04:21,905
(when I found something I liked.)

86
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:35,248
(I just realized that something so beautiful in life...)

87
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,509
(was right before me.)

88
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:42,307
(Oom, you’re not as clever as you believe.)

89
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,461
(It was foolish of you to leave this woman.)

90
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,489
Oom, don’t tell me…

91
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,976
Argh!

92
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,805
Ouch!

93
00:06:03,902 --> 00:06:05,363
Oom, go catch it.

94
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,258
Oom.

95
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:07,556
Oom, hurry up.

96
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,201
It’s gone, May.

97
00:06:09,907 --> 00:06:12,768
But you’re the one killing me.

98
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:19,512
Are you hurt?

99
00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:23,312
I am, too.

100
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:26,506
Ow.

101
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:30,817
Is it really gone though?

102
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,210
Does it hurt a lot?

103
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:38,869
I’m sorry.

104
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:44,036
It’s alright. You couldn’t see.

105
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:46,942
And it doesn’t hurt that much.

106
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,502
I’m not only sorry for hurting you.

107
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,447
I’m sorry for interrupting you

108
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,212
from what you wanted to do.

109
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:01,617
May.

110
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:04,778
What do you think I wanted to do?

111
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:08,307
You know,

112
00:07:10,393 --> 00:07:11,811
when we lose our sight,

113
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:14,732
our other senses become sharper.

114
00:07:18,702 --> 00:07:20,821
I didn’t just hear the cockroach buzzing,

115
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,026
I also heard your swallowing,

116
00:07:27,505 --> 00:07:29,300
your labored breathing,

117
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,906
and the pounding of your heart.

118
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:48,214
There.

119
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:50,112
It goes again.

120
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:55,716
Now that the cockroach is gone,

121
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:01,405
you can do whatever you want.

122
00:08:05,974 --> 00:08:08,208
I really didn’t mean to hurt May.

123
00:08:08,307 --> 00:08:09,574
I know.

124
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:11,509
It’s a misunderstanding.

125
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:13,860
Leave now. I’m going to see May.

126
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,804
She’s waiting for me.

127
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:16,911
Don’t forget

128
00:08:17,198 --> 00:08:18,103
you’re Ai,

129
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:18,950
not Oom.

130
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,505
The one that May is waiting for isn’t you.

131
00:08:24,406 --> 00:08:25,810
Don’t get carried away.

132
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,376
Besides,
the one that will be most devastated is May.

133
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,510
I know, alright.

134
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,574
I don’t want to keep lying ot her.

135
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:39,802
May.

136
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,541
I’ve got something to tell you.

137
00:08:45,085 --> 00:08:46,709
I’ve got something to tell you as well.

138
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,202
I’m glad you came back to me.

139
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:12,279
I’m happier when I have you.

140
00:09:15,883 --> 00:09:17,706
I want you to stay for a long time.

141
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:22,506
Can you not disappear again?

142
00:09:28,075 --> 00:09:28,704
Please.

143
00:09:29,797 --> 00:09:30,765
Pretty, please.

144
00:09:31,623 --> 00:09:32,843
Please, Oom.

145
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:35,046
Yeah.

146
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,367
I’m so happy.

147
00:09:45,024 --> 00:09:46,522
You make me happy,

148
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,333
so I’m making you happy too.

149
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,415
May, what are you doing?

150
00:09:58,287 --> 00:09:59,289
Well…

151
00:10:04,443 --> 00:10:05,107
May.

152
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,134
Doing what you wanted just now.

153
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:11,109
May.

154
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:13,295
May, wait.

155
00:10:14,977 --> 00:10:16,018
May, don’t do it.

156
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:18,589
Why not?

157
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,227
Oom?

158
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,978
I’m… I’m hungry.

159
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,376
Let me go get…

160
00:10:27,992 --> 00:10:29,112
If you’re hungry, be still.

161
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,070
I’m going to feed you.

162
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:48,430
May.

163
00:10:49,311 --> 00:10:49,912
May.

164
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,123
Be careful.

165
00:11:26,756 --> 00:11:27,579
May.

166
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,501
Let me do it. It’s dangerous.

167
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:34,101
I can do things more dangerous than you imagine.

168
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:36,100
Huh?

169
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,086
Here.

170
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:55,620
Let me.

171
00:11:56,421 --> 00:11:57,422
I can handle it.

172
00:11:57,927 --> 00:11:58,778
It’s fine.

173
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,506
Just wait for the food.

174
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:01,429
Are you sure?

175
00:12:01,468 --> 00:12:02,164
Yes.

176
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:13,509
Can you get me the eggs?

177
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:18,266
Thank you.

178
00:12:18,597 --> 00:12:19,513
Hungry, aren’t you?

179
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:24,459
Sure you can handle it?

180
00:12:25,123 --> 00:12:25,799
Yep.

181
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:28,407
All you need to do is eat.

182
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,603
The pan is quiet today.

183
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:35,007
Normally, it goes ‘Zzzzt!’

184
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:37,016
It’s alright, May.

185
00:12:37,027 --> 00:12:38,312
This is the less-oil recipe.

186
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,703
Just wait a sec.

187
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,503
Did you secretly turn down my stove?

188
00:12:53,546 --> 00:12:54,167
Hm?

189
00:13:02,892 --> 00:13:03,665
It’s pretty enough.

190
00:13:08,964 --> 00:13:09,709
Wow.

191
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:11,217
Looking yummy.

192
00:13:14,072 --> 00:13:15,173
Try it.

193
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,167
I’m going to try it now.

194
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:26,814
Whoa.

195
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:29,825
Good, huh?

196
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,113
It’s hot.

197
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,011
I'm kidding.

198
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,229
So yummy.

199
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,159
Eat that.

200
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:40,908
Then eat me after.

201
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:46,906
I’m tastier than this omelet.

202
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,982
I’ll be right back.

203
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:12,928
Hello, Grandma.

204
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,472
I hope you called to tell me you won the lottery.

205
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:20,221
Ai.

206
00:14:21,148 --> 00:14:22,875
The doctor said Oom’s condition got worse.

207
00:14:27,356 --> 00:14:28,607
Oom’s getting worse.

208
00:14:31,043 --> 00:14:32,105
What’s happened?

209
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:33,720
I don’t know.

210
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:35,686
He’s examining.

211
00:14:35,698 --> 00:14:37,022
I’m not allowed inside.

212
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,930
(I don’t know what is happening.)

213
00:14:41,913 --> 00:14:43,568
(I’m scared.)

214
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:49,971
May.

215
00:14:52,382 --> 00:14:54,359
I’m sorry, but I gotta leave.

216
00:14:55,157 --> 00:14:56,014
My grandma is sick.

217
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,109
If I tried to stop you,

218
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,299
I’d be a terrible person, wouldn’t I?

219
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:19,816
Just kidding.

220
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,352
You can go.

221
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:27,574
On one condition, though.

222
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:29,509
What is it?

223
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:32,120
Today you leave me,

224
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:35,220
but if everything gets better tomorrow,

225
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,567
you have to come back to me.

226
00:15:37,576 --> 00:15:38,208
Deal?

227
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:41,708
Okay.

228
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,057
Deal.

229
00:15:44,294 --> 00:15:45,212
I’m off now.

230
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:49,930
Wait.

231
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,619
I have something for you.

232
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,530
BABE, CALL ME WHEN YOU CAN.

233
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:16,901
You need a hand?

234
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:19,176
The door is stuck somehow.

235
00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:22,901
- Officer!
- Miss!

236
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,209
Are you digging around at my place too?

237
00:16:27,876 --> 00:16:28,508
No.

238
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,164
I live here but can’t get into my room.

239
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:30,936
Can’t you see?

240
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:33,212
That was a joke.

241
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,679
Let me take a look.

242
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:45,014
I think the humidity is making the door swell.

243
00:16:46,186 --> 00:16:47,123
Should we join forces?

244
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:48,577
Come on.

245
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:51,112
One, two, three.

246
00:16:51,756 --> 00:16:52,341
Jeez!

247
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:04,603
(Slender, pretty, and clean hands.)

248
00:17:05,664 --> 00:17:06,415
(Checked.)

249
00:17:09,452 --> 00:17:10,414
What are you looking at?

250
00:17:11,232 --> 00:17:14,909
Your hands are strong.

251
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,976
They kept me from falling.

252
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,513
Thank you.

253
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:23,237
You’re welcome.

254
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:24,906
We’re neighbors after all.

255
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:26,202
Goodbye.

256
00:17:26,564 --> 00:17:27,403
Hold on.

257
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,578
This is my card.

258
00:17:33,656 --> 00:17:34,778
My name is Jan.

259
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:36,169
I’m a tarot reader.

260
00:17:36,563 --> 00:17:37,918
Whatever you want to know,

261
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,182
just contact me,

262
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,121
and you’ll get my special service.

263
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:44,710
Thank you,

264
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:46,520
but I don’t like having my fortune told.

265
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:52,127
Wait.

266
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,050
MISS YOU, BABE.

267
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,208
I HAVE TO WORK ON
A CUSTOMER’S GARDEN DESIGN TONIGHT.

268
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,779
TALK TO YOU LATER, BABE. GOODNIGHT.

269
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:06,638
Grandma.

270
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,201
Grandma.

271
00:19:12,707 --> 00:19:13,629
Don’t cry.

272
00:19:15,727 --> 00:19:16,826
The doctor is with her now.

273
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:17,626
She will be okay.

274
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,564
(There were times...)

275
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:26,500
(I thought I could replace Ooboom,)

276
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,469
(but it never happened.)

277
00:19:36,749 --> 00:19:37,325
Doctor.

278
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:41,333
How is she?

279
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:44,600
The patient had a bloodstream infection that led to hypertension.

280
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:47,501
We administered antibiotics and inotropes,

281
00:19:48,183 --> 00:19:49,609
and she has been improving since.

282
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,021
Her condition is now stable.

283
00:19:56,285 --> 00:19:57,254
What a relief.

284
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,805
May I visit her now?

285
00:20:01,949 --> 00:20:02,660
Yes, you may.

286
00:20:06,478 --> 00:20:09,574
Thanks to the Three Jewels of Buddhism,

287
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:11,068
the heavenly gods,

288
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,621
and the guardian angels for protecting Ooboom.

289
00:20:16,953 --> 00:20:18,510
I’m so grateful.

290
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,967
You forgot to thank the doctor.

291
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:22,970
Hey.

292
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:24,803
Stop bugging me.

293
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:26,379
You go home,

294
00:20:26,715 --> 00:20:29,416
light some incense sticks,
and thank all the divine beings.

295
00:20:29,617 --> 00:20:31,504
I’ll take care of Oom here. Just go.

296
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:32,569
No, Grandma.

297
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:34,622
You’ve been here long enough.

298
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,926
I’ll take turns.

299
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,065
No.

300
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,107
She just got better.

301
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:41,714
I want to take care of her myself.

302
00:20:41,905 --> 00:20:43,510
You can’t do anything.

303
00:20:43,687 --> 00:20:45,018
You should go home.

304
00:20:48,095 --> 00:20:49,703
Oops. I’m sorry.

305
00:21:17,405 --> 00:21:18,528
You said you’re hungry.

306
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,900
Don’t forget to eat while looking after your Grandma.

307
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,140
I care about you.

308
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:00,080
Oh gosh, you’re back, my angel.

309
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,500
I missed you so much, Grandma.

310
00:23:02,523 --> 00:23:03,960
Can I sleep in your room tonight?

311
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:05,800
Of course!

312
00:23:06,774 --> 00:23:09,816
Ai, come check the stock.

313
00:23:09,885 --> 00:23:11,320
I’ll make Oom something to eat.

314
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,320
What do you want, Oom?

315
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,012
It took you so long.

316
00:23:30,883 --> 00:23:32,803
I thought you wouldn’t answer.

317
00:23:33,656 --> 00:23:36,825
Actually, you could’ve just called.

318
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,102
It doesn’t need to be a video call.

319
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,504
I wanted you to see me.

320
00:23:42,345 --> 00:23:45,587
Wait–don’t you want to see me?

321
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:49,019
I can turn the camera off.

322
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:50,384
No.

323
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,308
You can leave it on.

324
00:23:56,525 --> 00:24:00,710
So how’s your grandma?

325
00:24:01,295 --> 00:24:02,208
Is she doing better?

326
00:24:02,538 --> 00:24:03,107
Yeah.

327
00:24:03,665 --> 00:24:04,710
She is.

328
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,061
Why are you sharing good news with that sad voice?

329
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,309
Did something happen?

330
00:24:11,152 --> 00:24:12,309
You can talk to me, Oom.

331
00:24:13,408 --> 00:24:15,579
Some stories aren't ready to be told.

332
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:17,309
Then…

333
00:24:18,803 --> 00:24:21,909
tell me the parts you want me to know.

334
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,714
You can share everything when you want to.

335
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,529
I will wait.

336
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:32,227
How about…

337
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:35,107
we start with something simple?

338
00:24:36,486 --> 00:24:38,305
Did you finish my omelet?

339
00:24:39,449 --> 00:24:40,453
I suppose not.

340
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,021
Why didn’t you?

341
00:24:42,977 --> 00:24:44,527
I did my best to cook it for you.

342
00:24:44,908 --> 00:24:46,509
Did you really do your best for me?

343
00:24:47,808 --> 00:24:49,305
Why are you asking?

344
00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:52,512
You saw how determined I was.

345
00:24:53,515 --> 00:24:55,112
Eat it now.

346
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:57,317
I might not see, but I can hear.

347
00:24:58,072 --> 00:24:59,573
I will listen to you eating.

348
00:25:00,447 --> 00:25:01,171
May.

349
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,861
Right now, Miss.

350
00:25:06,249 --> 00:25:07,308
Are you happy now?

351
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,324
I will be happier if you finish it all.

352
00:25:14,685 --> 00:25:16,307
Will you keep listening until I finish?

353
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:17,669
Seriously?

354
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:20,017
Not just when you eat.

355
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,904
I want to listen to whatever you do.

356
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:27,212
You’re exaggerating.

357
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,611
I’ll show you

358
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,110
that I’m not exaggerating.

359
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,571
From the sound of that,

360
00:25:46,652 --> 00:25:48,205
you’re definitely doing laundry.

361
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:51,309
I’m not.

362
00:25:52,277 --> 00:25:53,309
No?

363
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:56,073
Then my hearing radar might be broken.

364
00:25:58,484 --> 00:25:59,974
I guess I don’t pass for a fortune teller now.

365
00:26:03,352 --> 00:26:05,490
Are you really going to the bathroom with me?

366
00:26:08,498 --> 00:26:09,764
Why are you embarrassed?

367
00:26:10,476 --> 00:26:12,122
I can’t see you anyway.

368
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:18,075
You know,

369
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:23,025
today is the day I wish I could see more than ever.

370
00:26:26,663 --> 00:26:27,673
Come on, May.

371
00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:29,010
You’re making me blush.

372
00:27:09,198 --> 00:27:10,401
Grandma, time to eat.

373
00:27:12,114 --> 00:27:13,174
Eat first.

374
00:27:13,303 --> 00:27:14,105
Not hungry.

375
00:27:31,072 --> 00:27:31,957
Grandma.

376
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,907
I brought you food.

377
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:35,708
I made it myself.

378
00:27:35,973 --> 00:27:37,502
The new omelet recipe.

379
00:27:37,595 --> 00:27:39,717
I added minced shrimp and sweet basil.

380
00:27:40,185 --> 00:27:41,209
Delicious.

381
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,099
I’m not hungry.

382
00:27:45,225 --> 00:27:46,500
You can eat first.

383
00:27:48,112 --> 00:27:48,912
Jeez.

384
00:27:50,387 --> 00:27:52,914
Have you eaten anything all day?

385
00:27:55,088 --> 00:27:56,235
I’m not hungry.

386
00:27:56,272 --> 00:27:57,987
I don’t have the appetite.

387
00:27:58,003 --> 00:27:59,606
Just leave me alone.

388
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,212
If you were an old lady who actually took care of herself,

389
00:28:05,386 --> 00:28:07,109
I’d definitely leave you alone.

390
00:28:08,638 --> 00:28:10,309
I know you care about Oom,

391
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:14,506
but you need to care about yourself too.

392
00:28:16,492 --> 00:28:18,619
Come on, go home and rest.

393
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,614
I’ll take it from here.

394
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,506
You know how to take care of patients?

395
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:23,168
Huh?

396
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:26,018
If something happens,

397
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,507
you won’t know how to deal with it.

398
00:28:28,031 --> 00:28:29,471
I should do it.

399
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:31,109
You go and do whatever you want.

400
00:28:33,574 --> 00:28:36,265
Fine. You can look after her,

401
00:28:36,978 --> 00:28:38,429
but only after you eat first.

402
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,345
Hey.

403
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:41,027
What are you doing?

404
00:28:41,764 --> 00:28:42,883
Stop annoying me.

405
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:45,014
I said I’m not hungry. Can’t you hear?

406
00:28:45,861 --> 00:28:48,207
If you don’t go now, I’ll carry you out.

407
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:53,700
Let everyone know you’re too old to walk.

408
00:28:54,603 --> 00:28:55,308
Fine.

409
00:28:55,581 --> 00:28:56,263
I’ll eat.

410
00:28:57,695 --> 00:28:58,610
Be out soon.

411
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:02,814
I’ll get the food ready for you.

412
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,403
You must eat three square meals.

413
00:29:05,981 --> 00:29:07,719
Worry about yourself too, not just Oom.

414
00:29:08,153 --> 00:29:09,907
How can I not worry about her?

415
00:29:10,345 --> 00:29:13,708
She’s always led a careful, good life,

416
00:29:14,741 --> 00:29:16,685
and everything seemed to fall into place for her.

417
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,504
She had a decent job,

418
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,810
and got married.

419
00:29:22,781 --> 00:29:25,407
Everything was perfect.

420
00:29:26,705 --> 00:29:28,778
Why did this horrible thing have to happen?

421
00:29:29,907 --> 00:29:39,918
I don’t know if she can handle waking up
and finding her husband gone.

422
00:29:41,472 --> 00:29:42,806
I feel so much pity for her.

423
00:29:43,805 --> 00:29:48,914
This terrible thing shouldn’t have
happened to someone as good as Oom.

424
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,911
It should’ve happened to
a bad person like me instead, huh?

425
00:29:57,018 --> 00:29:58,690
This isn’t the time for sarcasm.

426
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:03,709
If you’re going to be like this, just leave.

427
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:27,683
You’re the only one I have

428
00:30:28,596 --> 00:30:30,018
when there’s no one else left.

429
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,908
I want you to feel the same.

430
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:38,291
It’s hard to believe that

431
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,612
someone as stiff as you has this kind of thought.

432
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,072
When have I ever been stiff with you?

433
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,622
I’m always cute!

434
00:30:49,803 --> 00:30:51,118
I didn’t mean it that way.

435
00:30:52,261 --> 00:30:53,581
I meant…

436
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,805
everything around you...

437
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:02,384
makes you seem stiff.

438
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:04,710
How?

439
00:31:05,684 --> 00:31:08,381
Like your home decoration.

440
00:31:09,262 --> 00:31:10,669
It seems luxurious,

441
00:31:11,898 --> 00:31:15,116
and everything is perfectly in order.

442
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,476
But it feels emotionless and lifeless.

443
00:31:22,163 --> 00:31:26,012
Like living in…

444
00:31:27,672 --> 00:31:29,621
a freezing ice cave.

445
00:31:31,003 --> 00:31:35,018
It sounds like you’re criticizing me,
and I should be mad,

446
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:42,709
but your voice makes my heart feel warm.

447
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:44,379
Huh?

448
00:31:45,082 --> 00:31:46,014
Makes you what?

449
00:31:48,004 --> 00:31:49,727
Makes my heart warm.

450
00:31:55,758 --> 00:31:58,007
It’s like I’m listening to a bedtime story.

451
00:32:05,697 --> 00:32:07,007
My heart is warm too...

452
00:32:08,255 --> 00:32:09,300
when I’m with you.

453
00:32:52,632 --> 00:32:53,598
It is good.

454
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,215
When did you even know how to cook?

455
00:32:59,614 --> 00:33:00,316
I just…

456
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:04,387
imitate what I see and try it myself.

457
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:07,615
Why do you let yourself starve?

458
00:33:09,794 --> 00:33:11,620
You do the same thing.

459
00:33:12,762 --> 00:33:14,084
I’m eating now, aren’t I?

460
00:33:14,094 --> 00:33:15,214
What more do you want?

461
00:33:36,378 --> 00:33:37,060
Grandma.

462
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,210
What’s wrong?

463
00:33:46,963 --> 00:33:48,301
Don’t say that again.

464
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,009
Say what?

465
00:33:51,461 --> 00:33:55,814
Don’t say it should’ve been you again.

466
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,364
Grandma.

467
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:08,658
Grandma.

468
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:10,509
I’m sorry.

469
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:25,609
My Ooboom.

470
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,204
(Sometimes I think...)

471
00:34:34,224 --> 00:34:36,400
(being a replacement isn’t so bad.)

472
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:42,409
(At least the one with the broken heart is you,)

473
00:34:44,448 --> 00:34:45,703
(not someone you love.)

474
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:52,517
From today onward,

475
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,124
you must bring offerings to this shrine

476
00:34:55,145 --> 00:34:56,810
every day until your sister recovers.

477
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,258
Wait.

478
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:00,103
Aren’t you going to come anymore?

479
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:02,244
I am,

480
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,410
but I need to make a living too.

481
00:35:05,989 --> 00:35:07,808
We have household expenses,

482
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:10,081
Oom’s medical bills,

483
00:35:10,555 --> 00:35:11,317
and…

484
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:13,178
I need to cook for you.

485
00:35:14,054 --> 00:35:16,409
Oh, please. I can handle that.

486
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,083
You mean cooking?

487
00:35:20,145 --> 00:35:22,912
No. I meant bringing food to offer.

488
00:35:23,516 --> 00:35:25,000
I figured as much.

489
00:35:26,643 --> 00:35:30,903
I’m heading home after this.

490
00:35:30,912 --> 00:35:33,079
The wholesaler is delivering the goods.

491
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,701
I’ll take you home.

492
00:35:37,383 --> 00:35:38,611
Aren’t you going out today?

493
00:35:40,029 --> 00:35:41,405
I can’t leave you.

494
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,014
Oom might get worried.

495
00:35:47,703 --> 00:35:48,490
Thanks.

496
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,410
SO HOW WAS MY OMELET RECIPE?

497
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,050
SO GOOD.

498
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,690
HENG CHAROEN

499
00:38:37,427 --> 00:38:40,109
(Metawe was a charming)

500
00:38:41,287 --> 00:38:42,208
(and mysterious girl,)

501
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,901
(so it wasn’t surprising that)

502
00:38:45,807 --> 00:38:49,319
(someone weak-minded like Ooboom fell head over heels for her.)

503
00:38:50,547 --> 00:38:52,423
(But I couldn’t fully condemn Oom)

504
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:57,107
(because what I was doing now wasn’t any better.)

505
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:01,907
(I had been deceiving May,)

506
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:06,709
(and I couldn’t keep doing it anymore.)

507
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,338
Hi, Pong.

508
00:39:19,573 --> 00:39:20,276
Hi, Granny.

509
00:39:20,843 --> 00:39:21,918
Your shop is open today?

510
00:39:21,973 --> 00:39:23,665
- Yes.
- You’ve been closed for days.

511
00:39:23,683 --> 00:39:24,720
What can I get you today?

512
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:27,518
- Same old stuff.
- Gosh, it’s very noisy.

513
00:39:27,643 --> 00:39:29,796
…and one canned fish.

514
00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:30,810
Sure.

515
00:39:35,521 --> 00:39:36,415
Noisy.

516
00:39:37,763 --> 00:39:38,376
Shit!

517
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:42,903
-	That’d be all.

518
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:44,704
How much are they?

519
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:45,907
45 baht.

520
00:39:48,862 --> 00:39:49,512
Grandma.

521
00:39:50,261 --> 00:39:51,574
Yes, it’s me.

522
00:39:51,584 --> 00:39:52,821
Why are you so loud?

523
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:53,727
I see you’re up.

524
00:39:53,738 --> 00:39:56,381
Take the offerings in the kitchen to that shrine.

525
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,406
- This is all I have.
- Let’s see. I need 45 baht.

526
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,242
Yes. This is it.

527
00:40:01,254 --> 00:40:01,802
Okay.

528
00:40:02,092 --> 00:40:02,734
Thank you.

529
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:05,029
We’re back in business.
Don’t forget to shop here again.

530
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:07,338
Sure. I’ll walk here every day.

531
00:40:18,831 --> 00:40:20,210
What’s with you now?

532
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:23,331
Take the offerings and go.

533
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,313
Let me brush my teeth first.

534
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:28,116
Haven’t brushed my teeth yet.

535
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,714
May, I’ll come see you soon.

536
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:58,713
(Leave me alone.)

537
00:41:00,029 --> 00:41:01,600
(Oom, don’t come here.)

538
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,002
(Is that her?)

539
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:06,320
(Why would I leave you alone?)

540
00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:09,614
(I have every right to interfere in your life.)

541
00:41:27,394 --> 00:41:30,208
Will you listen to me for once?

542
00:41:32,216 --> 00:41:33,579
I am your father.

543
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,510
I gave birth to you.

544
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,312
Can’t you be a good daughter like other people’s daughters?

545
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:44,905
Why don’t you ask yourself

546
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:48,222
if you’re a good father like some other fathers?

547
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,432
What part of me isn’t good?

548
00:41:56,061 --> 00:41:58,640
I came because I meant well.

549
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:01,338
I wanted to recommend good eye doctors,

550
00:42:01,344 --> 00:42:02,210
but you refused.

551
00:42:03,011 --> 00:42:06,380
Do you want to stay home and be blind for the rest of your life?

552
00:42:07,628 --> 00:42:08,759
Enough, honey.

553
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:10,603
Let our daughter make her own decisions.

554
00:42:20,026 --> 00:42:20,850
May, watch out!

555
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,029
Oom?

556
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:31,753
So this is your decision?

557
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:38,707
I think your lack of judgment comes from your blindness.

558
00:42:40,763 --> 00:42:42,409
I’ve told you this a million times.

559
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,028
You have a good life,

560
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,667
so spend it well.

561
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,447
And just stop with this…

562
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:52,280
same-sex thing.

563
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,877
Stop making me feel ashamed to call you my daughter.

564
00:43:07,303 --> 00:43:08,379
Well, I’m ashamed too

565
00:43:10,067 --> 00:43:11,167
to have you as my father.

566
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,222
I have nothing for you to be ashamed of.

567
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,131
You know who I am.

568
00:43:18,718 --> 00:43:20,911
May, come back and talk to me.

569
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:21,898
May!

570
00:43:22,288 --> 00:43:23,676
Let her be for now.

571
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:25,719
You know how she is when she’s angry.

572
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,778
Let’s wait until she calms down and come back.

573
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:29,985
Let’s go home.

574
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:34,108
All you do is run away from problems.

575
00:43:34,818 --> 00:43:35,829
You’re her mother,

576
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,709
yet you can’t even guide your child to be a decent person.

577
00:44:26,738 --> 00:44:27,612
You can lean on me.

578
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:30,955
We can go back inside once you feel better.

579
00:44:54,076 --> 00:44:55,749
Why are you so warm?

580
00:44:59,841 --> 00:45:02,061
I guess your family raised you really well.

581
00:45:04,566 --> 00:45:05,220
Not really.

582
00:45:06,114 --> 00:45:07,763
I was raised simply, just like any other kid.

583
00:45:12,901 --> 00:45:14,379
That’s my dream.

584
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:20,767
I just wanted to be raised in a simple way.

585
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,218
But in reality, I was born just to disappoint

586
00:45:29,664 --> 00:45:30,916
my dad and sadden my mom.

587
00:45:41,294 --> 00:45:43,206
My dad wanted a son so badly,

588
00:45:46,403 --> 00:45:47,513
but my birth was the reason

589
00:45:51,036 --> 00:45:53,033
my mom couldn’t bear more children.

590
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:59,270
I feel like their bad fortune.

591
00:46:02,428 --> 00:46:04,707
I’ve never known what 'family' feels like.

592
00:46:07,215 --> 00:46:08,374
You feel like an outsider,

593
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:11,838
like you’re in the wrong place.

594
00:46:13,865 --> 00:46:14,768
It’s so embarrassing

595
00:46:16,865 --> 00:46:18,417
to have parents like mine.

596
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:24,804
You know,

597
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:29,625
apart from being blind,

598
00:46:32,536 --> 00:46:34,202
I wish I could be deaf too

599
00:46:37,322 --> 00:46:39,110
just to shut myself off from everything.

600
00:46:44,774 --> 00:46:46,410
Actually, there’s a way

601
00:46:47,366 --> 00:46:49,515
to drown out the voices in your mind.

602
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:53,808
It’s whether you’re too scared to do it.

603
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,205
I’m not scared of anything...

604
00:47:11,753 --> 00:47:13,105
as long as I have you.

605
00:47:33,077 --> 00:47:34,414
These are my attorney fees for this case.

606
00:47:34,836 --> 00:47:36,514
Think of it as the price of my freedom.

607
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:38,384
Right now, all I want is...

608
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:40,120
to love someone.

609
00:47:40,614 --> 00:47:44,705
I want to know what it feels like to be loved.

610
00:47:45,392 --> 00:47:46,410
So, what’s it like?

611
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:49,181
Like the air in a balloon, I guess.

612
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,581
It makes us bigger,

613
00:47:52,966 --> 00:47:53,772
beautiful,

614
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:56,214
and floaty.
