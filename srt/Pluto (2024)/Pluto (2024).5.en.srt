1
00:00:00,065 --> 00:00:01,928
When I have too much on my mind,

2
00:00:02,205 --> 00:00:04,103
I like to go for a ride.

3
00:00:04,311 --> 00:00:08,290
Sometimes, the world’s noise
can drown out the noise of misery within.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,823
If you’re going to like girls,

5
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:11,365
why can’t it be me?

6
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:12,208
Who is she?

7
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:13,527
Her ex.

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,576
Her first girlfriend, the one she can never forget.

9
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:17,502
A "favorite ex," if you will.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,170
2019

11
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:47,106
Look how laid-back you are.

12
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,764
I’m up at 3,

13
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,708
preflight briefing at 4,

14
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:03,800
boarding at 5,

15
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:06,764
and flying quick turns from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,770
Damn, I’m exhausted.

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,308
I wish I could live like you, actually.

18
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:31,903
You graduated, but you don’t have to work.

19
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,303
You just go through life day by day.

20
00:01:40,117 --> 00:01:41,160
But I can’t do that.

21
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:45,008
I don’t want to worry Grandma.

22
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,016
Don’t beat around the bush.

23
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:53,708
If you want to yell at me, say it straight out.

24
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:56,619
You lousy sister.

25
00:01:58,117 --> 00:01:58,720
Oom!

26
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:03,300
Well, you asked for it, so here it is.

27
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:09,506
I don’t care if you’re reckless or jobless,

28
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:11,302
but Grandma does.

29
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:13,804
When are you going to stop making her worry?

30
00:02:14,445 --> 00:02:16,222
Do you think I want to?

31
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:18,828
You’re not me.

32
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:20,710
You don’t know what I have to put up with,

33
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,214
or what I’ve already done.

34
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,567
What have you done?

35
00:02:29,628 --> 00:02:30,666
Fought enemy gangs?

36
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:32,565
Run from the traffic police?

37
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:35,982
You just never understand anything.

38
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:39,580
And you don’t understand anyone.

39
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:42,111
Well, I’m just nobody.

40
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,508
Don’t lecture me.

41
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,014
I’m dumb,

42
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,308
not as clever as you.

43
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,425
Why don’t you try?

44
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:54,164
I can’t be you, no matter how hard I try.

45
00:02:57,475 --> 00:02:58,522
I’m good at nothing.

46
00:02:59,404 --> 00:03:00,311
Just mind your own business.

47
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:02,962
I’ll live my crappy life.

48
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:05,503
If you want that crappy life so much,

49
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,798
I hope you live it for the rest of your life.

50
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:11,380
Hello.

51
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:13,684
Yes, Mr. Christ.

52
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,168
Sure, I remember you. From NexComms.

53
00:03:18,506 --> 00:03:19,411
Not qualified?

54
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:23,318
Yes.

55
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:24,911
It’s alright. I understand.

56
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,201
Shit.

57
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,365
(If you want that crappy life so much, )

58
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,705
(I hope you live it for the rest of your life.)

59
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:07,102
(They say a parent's curse can come true.)

60
00:04:08,992 --> 00:04:14,706
(But I say a curse from a twin sister can, too.)

61
00:05:21,429 --> 00:05:22,774
You’re never allergic to flowers.

62
00:05:23,287 --> 00:05:23,908
Come here.

63
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:30,478
Who is she?

64
00:05:32,675 --> 00:05:33,401
Her ex.

65
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:37,468
Her first girlfriend, the one she can never forget.

66
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:40,577
A "favorite ex," if you will.

67
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:44,903
Thank you.

68
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:47,008
Have you been working a lot?

69
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,204
There are some daisies here.

70
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,733
May seems busy.

71
00:06:12,114 --> 00:06:13,173
I’ll just leave.

72
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:14,971
Who’s that?

73
00:06:16,437 --> 00:06:17,211
Oom?

74
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,066
I’ve been waiting for you.

75
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,047
Jeez.

76
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:08,758
I feel like I’m in a war.

77
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:11,321
How come?

78
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:15,222
Cause I’m caught in the crossfire.

79
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:16,608
Nonsense.

80
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:19,308
Oom.

81
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:21,013
Don’t listen to him.

82
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,813
Ploy and I broke up a long time ago.

83
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:25,318
We’re just friends now.

84
00:07:25,582 --> 00:07:26,468
Close friends.

85
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,336
My close friend just stopped by to visit.

86
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,602
She’s opening a new shop and meeting
her fortune teller for an auspicious time.

87
00:07:36,426 --> 00:07:39,210
So, there’s no war or crossfire here

88
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,709
because my girlfriend is only Oom, right here.

89
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,635
You have a girlfriend,

90
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:50,518
but none of your friends know about her?

91
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,785
Why’s that?

92
00:07:53,422 --> 00:07:54,690
Does this girlfriend of yours
have a lot of secrets?

93
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,102
I just didn’t want to tell anyone,

94
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,100
so no one stole her from me.

95
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:11,764
Are you guys hungry?

96
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:12,909
Should we order something?

97
00:08:12,945 --> 00:08:13,629
Sure.

98
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:18,300
How about that spicy salad place?

99
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:19,884
The one we used to go to for dates.

100
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,317
It’s really famous now and gets a lot of reviews.

101
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:24,620
Oh, I miss that place.

102
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:26,016
Haven’t been there in a long time.

103
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:28,706
I miss their corn salad,

104
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:30,151
cucumber salad,

105
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,800
and Korat salad.

106
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,023
They’re so good with
rice vermicelli and fried onions.

107
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:35,979
And…

108
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:39,425
the must-have.

109
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:40,905
- Grilled chicken!
- Grilled chicken!

110
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,619
May, you haven’t changed a bit.

111
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,709
Should we order a lot?

112
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,860
Let’s get everything that you want.
Bring back our old memories.

113
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:50,650
Don’t order it.

114
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:55,069
I think May should try something new.

115
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:58,020
I know a good place nearby.

116
00:08:58,531 --> 00:08:59,306
I’ll go get you something yummy.

117
00:08:59,432 --> 00:08:59,976
Sure.

118
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,808
Here’s everything you ordered.

119
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,280
1,200 baht.

120
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:26,110
What?

121
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,469
Did you raise your prices, sis?

122
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,157
Oh, please.

123
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:31,511
Damn right, I did.

124
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,416
Gas prices go up, gold prices go up,

125
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,214
so does my food, girl.

126
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,220
Fine.

127
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:37,915
I haven’t said anything.

128
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:38,715
Don’t be so whiny.

129
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:39,416
Hey, you.

130
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,920
Bring me more papaya.

131
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,709
I’ve been waiting.

132
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,302
What’s taking her so long?

133
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:49,174
When will my customer get to eat?

134
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,671
I only have 1,120.

135
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,014
Can I pay you 80 later?

136
00:09:58,035 --> 00:09:59,025
Stop.

137
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,931
I’m a good-looking girl with a good heart,

138
00:10:01,954 --> 00:10:03,407
but I don’t let people take advantage of me.

139
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:05,260
If you don’t have cash, you can transfer.

140
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:09,377
I can’t transfer, sis.

141
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:11,004
I haven’t gotten my wage yet.

142
00:10:12,008 --> 00:10:12,808
How about this?

143
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:16,134
Let’s skip the corn salad.

144
00:10:16,155 --> 00:10:16,936
Don’t!

145
00:10:18,823 --> 00:10:19,480
Grilled chicken, then.

146
00:10:19,497 --> 00:10:20,306
No!

147
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:24,965
I can’t take anything back at all?

148
00:10:25,515 --> 00:10:27,109
You can’t, or it won’t be impressive.

149
00:10:27,682 --> 00:10:28,462
She’s never tried food from here,

150
00:10:28,937 --> 00:10:31,302
so I’m not sure which one will win her over.

151
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,706
What nonsense are you rambling about?

152
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:40,269
Can I work for you instead?

153
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,411
Sis, it’s all done.

154
00:11:02,026 --> 00:11:02,700
Gosh.

155
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:07,503
Here.

156
00:11:08,512 --> 00:11:09,162
Your food.

157
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,219
Never seen anyone so fixated on food.

158
00:11:12,908 --> 00:11:14,625
I just want her to try something yummy.

159
00:11:15,463 --> 00:11:16,074
Give it.

160
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:17,080
Here.

161
00:11:17,392 --> 00:11:18,213
Great.

162
00:11:19,115 --> 00:11:19,834
Is this everything?

163
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:20,906
Are you sure?

164
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:22,614
Don’t scam me.

165
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,681
Ride safe.

166
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:24,505
Yes, ma’am.

167
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:45,705
Don’t you think she approached you
with a hidden agenda?

168
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:48,718
No thinking needed.

169
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,805
I just went out to get coffee

170
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,306
and saw her washing dishes at a spicy salad place.

171
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,460
I guess she didn’t have enough money to pay.

172
00:11:56,222 --> 00:11:56,900
What?

173
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,983
I might’ve implied that Ploy

174
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,505
is an ex you still miss.

175
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,862
If she has a hidden agenda,

176
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,339
other than winning over your heart,

177
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:08,805
it’s probably to leech money from you.

178
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:10,915
But seeing her do that,

179
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,506
I don’t think she’s clever enough to scam you.

180
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,405
What the hell are you guys doing?

181
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:32,373
May.

182
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:34,373
We have cucumber salad,

183
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:35,560
grilled pork neck,

184
00:12:35,894 --> 00:12:36,971
papaya salad with fermented fish,

185
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,050
minced pork salad,

186
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:39,379
spicy soup with pork cartilage,

187
00:12:39,577 --> 00:12:40,315
grilled chicken,

188
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:41,608
and corn salad.

189
00:12:47,294 --> 00:12:48,100
Thank you, Miss.

190
00:12:48,782 --> 00:12:49,308
Please.

191
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:52,117
It doesn’t look like a spicy meal anymore.

192
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,117
It looks more like a sweet meal to me.

193
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:55,712
Gosh, I hate this.

194
00:12:57,038 --> 00:12:58,460
What do you want to try first May?

195
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,509
Corn salad, of course.

196
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:02,509
I’ll get it for you.

197
00:13:10,946 --> 00:13:12,220
Corn salad is on your plate.

198
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,171
Sticky rice is on your left.

199
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:16,807
Thank you.

200
00:13:35,318 --> 00:13:36,705
How is it? Good?

201
00:13:44,397 --> 00:13:45,145
Is it too spicy?

202
00:13:46,362 --> 00:13:46,920
May?

203
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,777
It’s not spicy at all. I can handle it.

204
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:54,517
Why are you pretending?

205
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,059
You don’t like your food too spicy.

206
00:13:56,071 --> 00:13:57,204
You don’t like green beans.

207
00:13:57,605 --> 00:13:58,514
Just tell her.

208
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:03,063
Really, May?

209
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:11,805
It’s my fault for not telling you earlier.

210
00:14:12,197 --> 00:14:13,805
Why are you blaming yourself?

211
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:15,708
You are blind, May.

212
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:20,173
This is something your girlfriend should know.

213
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,834
Not knowing is not caring.

214
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:25,120
Stop it, Ploy.

215
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,220
No, you stop it.

216
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:28,468
Why do you put up with this?

217
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:31,568
You should be with someone
who can take care of you.

218
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:40,666
It’s okay.

219
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:42,207
I can eat it.

220
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:50,703
Excuse me.

221
00:14:52,204 --> 00:14:53,914
There is a food delivery for Miss Ploy.

222
00:14:54,223 --> 00:14:55,605
Please prepare it and serve it.

223
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,303
Yes, ma’am.

224
00:14:58,376 --> 00:15:00,979
When did you order it?

225
00:15:02,242 --> 00:15:04,205
Right after May’s girlfriend left the house.

226
00:15:05,062 --> 00:15:06,303
I knew she couldn’t make it.

227
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:08,102
And I was right.

228
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:16,620
It’s alright, May.

229
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,909
Let me take care of you.

230
00:15:29,874 --> 00:15:32,503
Papaya salad with no fermented fish
and corn salad from your favorite place.

231
00:15:32,894 --> 00:15:34,311
Mild and no green beans.

232
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,010
You didn’t have to order this, Ploy.

233
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:43,044
I can eat the food that Oom bought.

234
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,813
It’s alright, May.

235
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,059
You can eat what Ploy got for you.

236
00:15:49,937 --> 00:15:51,802
It’s my fault for not asking you first.

237
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:56,422
True.

238
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,903
Here. I’ll feed you.

239
00:15:59,531 --> 00:16:01,456
This is the corn salad with salmon.

240
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,702
It’s so yummy.

241
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:04,903
I don’t think I’ll eat anymore.

242
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:06,268
I’m still full.

243
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:08,380
I just snacked.

244
00:16:08,992 --> 00:16:09,715
You eat, Ploy.

245
00:16:20,488 --> 00:16:21,306
By the way, Ploy,

246
00:16:21,884 --> 00:16:23,509
when do you have to meet your fortune teller?

247
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:28,274
I have to leave soon.

248
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,872
They’re very strict about time.

249
00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:31,807
I can’t be late.

250
00:16:32,143 --> 00:16:33,674
I heard it cost a lot, right?

251
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:36,305
Not really.

252
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:37,965
Just 100K.

253
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,607
It’s all worth it if my shop is doing well.

254
00:16:41,785 --> 00:16:42,469
That’s true.

255
00:16:43,262 --> 00:16:45,000
When I opened my clinic,

256
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:47,469
I paid more than 100K for a feng shui master too.

257
00:16:47,844 --> 00:16:49,546
But it’s totally worth it.

258
00:16:52,754 --> 00:16:53,847
What are you talking about?

259
00:16:54,857 --> 00:16:56,051
It’s ridiculous.

260
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,742
You’re the one to talk.

261
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:01,300
Didn’t you give 10K as
a votive offering to pass the bar exam?

262
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,065
Wow, I thought you only used your brains.

263
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,065
Didn’t know you resorted to superstitions, too.

264
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,320
I didn’t wish for a pass.

265
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,176
I wish for love.

266
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,008
It’s the same thing.

267
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:18,506
You bribed holiness to get what you wanted.

268
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:19,177
Yeah?

269
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:20,696
Oh, by the way,

270
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:22,619
I just saw this package online.

271
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,411
A superstitious trip to Hong Kong,
three days and two nights, only 150K.

272
00:17:25,437 --> 00:17:26,102
Yeah?

273
00:17:26,124 --> 00:17:27,023
That’s a very good price.

274
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,284
Exactly, and it includes everything:

275
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:32,829
accommodation and three meals.

276
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,100
I think it’s a great deal.

277
00:17:34,225 --> 00:17:35,602
Interesting. Should we go together?

278
00:17:36,031 --> 00:17:36,805
It’s nonsense.

279
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:38,120
But I’m interested.

280
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,069
Call me nosy if you want,

281
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:06,908
but I really need to ask.

282
00:18:11,764 --> 00:18:13,023
Do you really love May?

283
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:15,231
You don’t believe it?

284
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,928
Honestly, it's so hard to believe
that someone like you

285
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,411
doesn’t want something from May.

286
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,666
We can see here that
May has everything except her sight.

287
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:27,804
But you…

288
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,377
clearly, you have nothing.

289
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:37,457
Tell me, what do you want from May?

290
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,068
I don’t need to answer you.

291
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,949
The feelings between May and me

292
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:49,302
are between May and me.

293
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,105
You don’t get a say in this.

294
00:18:55,808 --> 00:18:56,524
I do.

295
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,764
Because I’m her friend.

296
00:19:01,622 --> 00:19:03,318
I know May loves you

297
00:19:04,345 --> 00:19:07,010
but love alone is not gonna make it.

298
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,906
May is already having a hard time.

299
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:16,223
Stop dragging her down.

300
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:21,903
If you can’t take good care of her,

301
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:25,070
let her find someone better.

302
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,121
Everyone else left.

303
00:19:57,048 --> 00:19:57,570
Let’s…

304
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,715
I’m leaving too.

305
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:04,777
What’s wrong, Oom?

306
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:05,831
Tell me.

307
00:20:15,574 --> 00:20:16,709
I’m fine, really.

308
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:19,620
And I’m taking off.

309
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:21,958
I know you’re not fine.

310
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,506
Is it about Ploy?

311
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,807
Are you thinking you’re inferior to her?

312
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,976
You know you are.

313
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,208
First, it’s the food,

314
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,259
then the fortune teller.

315
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,080
That’s just how Ploy is.

316
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:01,957
She has high walls.

317
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,505
She’s not that nice and friendly.

318
00:21:08,545 --> 00:21:11,306
But I never think you’re inferior to anyone at all.

319
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,672
But someone else does.

320
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,863
Actually, I’m not a good match for you.

321
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:28,022
Oom.

322
00:21:30,074 --> 00:21:31,623
What other people think...

323
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:35,195
isn’t as important as what you think.

324
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,703
If you want to put yourself down and leave me,

325
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:52,311
then go ahead.

326
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:22,666
Ai-oon!

327
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:25,234
You think I own a money-making machine?

328
00:22:25,767 --> 00:22:28,235
I paid for that, but you’re wasting the water.

329
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:31,425
If you’re not gonna wash the bike, go home.

330
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:36,837
I won’t be able to sleep.

331
00:22:40,263 --> 00:22:42,171
Well, I smell something dramatic.

332
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:43,506
Huh?

333
00:22:44,324 --> 00:22:45,632
Is it about your sister’s girlfriend?

334
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,072
I’m not good at a damn thing

335
00:22:51,522 --> 00:22:52,875
but crazy enough to want a relationship.

336
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,605
Because your feelings for her are too intense.

337
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:02,161
What does that have to do with anything?

338
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:03,408
Come on.

339
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:05,808
When we have feelings for someone,

340
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,700
we see them as good,

341
00:23:09,537 --> 00:23:10,674
even above us,

342
00:23:11,154 --> 00:23:13,108
to the point where we end up looking down
on ourselves without realizing it.

343
00:23:17,691 --> 00:23:19,105
It’s not necessarily a bad thing.

344
00:23:20,042 --> 00:23:21,207
You used to tell me that

345
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,613
you didn’t know why you should have a good life,

346
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:25,308
do good things,

347
00:23:25,608 --> 00:23:28,220
or succeed.

348
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:31,817
You said Oom already did that for you.

349
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:33,250
But now you do.

350
00:23:34,357 --> 00:23:37,179
You have a reason to better your life.

351
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,106
Be successful for someone in a way that...

352
00:23:41,682 --> 00:23:43,808
Oom can’t do for you.

353
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:49,517
Damn, that’s wise.

354
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:53,321
I think our time together sparked your growth.

355
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,508
Holy shit, stop it.

356
00:23:55,819 --> 00:23:57,915
Don’t joke about the biggest mistake in my life.

357
00:23:57,928 --> 00:23:59,161
I’m getting goosebumps.

358
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:03,456
Hey!

359
00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:05,807
I know what I’m gonna do.

360
00:24:08,411 --> 00:24:09,659
Do you have a computer I can borrow?

361
00:24:11,448 --> 00:24:12,918
No. Why would I have a computer?

362
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:17,770
Where should I get one?

363
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:37,859
Ow.

364
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,650
HENG CHAROEN

365
00:25:31,118 --> 00:25:32,229
May I borrow yours, Oom?

366
00:25:33,392 --> 00:25:34,928
None of my friends have one.

367
00:25:45,733 --> 00:25:46,779
(I’m going to write a novel.)

368
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:49,614
(I believe you can do it.)

369
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,969
(Since you believe in me, I will make it happen.)
THE VALUE OF LOVE

370
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,130
THE VALUE OF LOVE

371
00:25:55,244 --> 00:25:56,665
(I will be good enough for you.)

372
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:39,010
Jeez.

373
00:26:39,795 --> 00:26:42,162
Ai is still up this late?

374
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,001
Gosh.

375
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,364
Why doesn’t she lie in bed properly?

376
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,902
This will give her back pain.

377
00:27:12,254 --> 00:27:14,011
Isn’t this Oom’s laptop?

378
00:27:14,795 --> 00:27:16,616
How come she has it?

379
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,154
You’re huge.

380
00:27:24,967 --> 00:27:27,405
I can’t carry you to bed, you know.

381
00:27:46,684 --> 00:27:48,120
Ai-oon.

382
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:54,114
When will you grow up and mature
so I can put my mind at ease?

383
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,810
[ARE YOU FREE? WANNA TALK TO YOU.]

384
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,810
[GHOSTING ME?]

385
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,090
[ARE YOU NOT GONNA READ MY TEXTS?]

386
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,072
Shit!

387
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,008
Damn it.

388
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,402
I can’t do this anymore.

389
00:29:42,231 --> 00:29:43,346
Can we meet?

390
00:29:49,431 --> 00:29:51,017
Thank you for coming.

391
00:29:53,865 --> 00:29:55,002
My girlfriend wanted to see me.

392
00:29:55,248 --> 00:29:56,474
Of course, I came.

393
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:01,305
Didn’t think you’d want to meet here.

394
00:30:02,117 --> 00:30:03,413
Recalling old memories?

395
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,202
Old memories?

396
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:11,717
Don’t you remember, Pang?

397
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,605
We met for the first time here.

398
00:30:23,242 --> 00:30:25,370
A double-shot iced Americano, please.

399
00:30:25,592 --> 00:30:26,714
Absolutely. Just a moment, please.

400
00:30:36,395 --> 00:30:37,413
Excuse me.

401
00:30:37,865 --> 00:30:39,831
What is this plant? It’s beautiful.

402
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,671
I’m not sure either, ma’am. Sorry about that.

403
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:44,026
It’s fine.

404
00:30:44,037 --> 00:30:45,850
May I take a picture? I’ll search online.

405
00:30:45,871 --> 00:30:47,108
Sure, ma’am.

406
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,908
It’s called an Indian Rubber Tree.

407
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,457
Plant lovers like to keep it indoors.

408
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:03,204
They believe it heals the mind
and boosts positive energy.

409
00:31:04,219 --> 00:31:05,404
It also helps purify the air.

410
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:06,903
It grows quickly and is easy to care for.

411
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:08,157
People like it a lot.

412
00:31:09,102 --> 00:31:12,108
Most importantly, it’s very beautiful.

413
00:31:14,862 --> 00:31:15,568
It is.

414
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:18,179
Very beautiful, indeed.

415
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:25,918
Well…

416
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,605
you seem to know a lot about plants.

417
00:31:32,315 --> 00:31:33,708
Any recommended place?

418
00:31:34,705 --> 00:31:35,920
I really want one.

419
00:31:39,801 --> 00:31:41,709
I’m going to a tree shop.

420
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,660
Do you wanna tag along?

421
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,219
It feels odd not seeing that
Indian Rubber Tree there anymore.

422
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:52,832
Things just aren’t the same.

423
00:31:57,488 --> 00:31:59,785
Pim, I’ve got something important to say...

424
00:31:59,802 --> 00:32:00,708
I don’t want us to break up.

425
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:06,717
Can I have one more chance, Pang?

426
00:32:07,853 --> 00:32:10,540
I’ll make you like me again.

427
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:13,008
Please don’t fall for Ai-oon yet.

428
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,174
I’m sorry for knowing this,

429
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,666
but I really want to be with you.

430
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:24,611
We were happy together, weren’t we, Pang?

431
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:31,151
I’m sorry, Pim.

432
00:32:33,472 --> 00:32:36,776
My feelings for Ai-oon aren’t something sudden.

433
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,017
Deep down, it’s always been her.

434
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:47,324
I don’t want to lie to myself

435
00:32:48,721 --> 00:32:50,604
or to you anymore.

436
00:32:55,622 --> 00:32:58,148
I feel guilty enough for coming this far.

437
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,376
Let’s break up.

438
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,072
You’re very straightforward.

439
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:16,170
You could have lied just a little.

440
00:33:17,183 --> 00:33:18,211
It hurts, you know.

441
00:33:20,808 --> 00:33:22,165
I really am sorry.

442
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,573
But I don’t want to lie to you anymore.

443
00:33:27,902 --> 00:33:29,117
You’re a good person,

444
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:33,207
and I don’t want you to be with
someone toxic like me.

445
00:33:35,657 --> 00:33:36,908
Let’s end things on good terms.

446
00:33:47,251 --> 00:33:48,808
I feel envious of Ai-oon.

447
00:33:56,391 --> 00:33:57,574
Does she have any idea

448
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,506
you cleared everything out because of her?

449
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:06,600
Don’t make it sound like I’m being selfless.

450
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,471
I’m just a selfish person.

451
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:14,825
She wouldn’t be happy if she knew I did this.

452
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,112
All you eat is eggs.

453
00:34:42,737 --> 00:34:44,349
Your face is going to turn into one soon.

454
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,518
You should eat some meat or other good stuff too.

455
00:34:49,268 --> 00:34:50,534
Well, I like eggs.

456
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,666
But you need to eat more than just eggs.

457
00:34:55,884 --> 00:34:56,915
Don’t be so stingy.

458
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,709
Jeez! You’re never stingy with your bike.

459
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,242
Ai, you’re a grown woman.

460
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,663
Stop being a motorpunk

461
00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:06,308
and get yourself a good job.

462
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,602
You have a bachelor's degree.

463
00:35:08,865 --> 00:35:11,130
Why don’t you make use of it?

464
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:15,160
I am looking for a job here.

465
00:35:18,613 --> 00:35:20,211
Using your sister's laptop?

466
00:35:23,306 --> 00:35:25,417
How's her place?

467
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,764
Is it all dusty now?

468
00:35:34,114 --> 00:35:37,004
Should I drop by and clean?

469
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:40,780
I thought you’d yell at me.

470
00:35:43,485 --> 00:35:46,011
Someone like you wouldn’t steal from others.

471
00:35:46,317 --> 00:35:48,108
You must really be in need to take it.

472
00:35:49,207 --> 00:35:52,007
I'll just wait until Oom wakes up
and yells at you herself.

473
00:36:18,561 --> 00:36:20,699
That’s mine. Grandma bought it for me.

474
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,608
But I want it. You have a problem with that?

475
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,557
Why do you want it? You can’t even read English.

476
00:36:24,973 --> 00:36:27,514
No, I can’t, so you can’t have it either.

477
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,106
Where are you taking it?

478
00:36:49,693 --> 00:36:51,094
Why are you doing this?

479
00:36:51,315 --> 00:36:52,663
I’m going to tell Grandma.

480
00:37:13,428 --> 00:37:14,602
Once you recover,

481
00:37:18,776 --> 00:37:20,374
I’ll give it back to you willingly.

482
00:37:34,413 --> 00:37:35,211
Pretty enough?

483
00:37:37,281 --> 00:37:39,903
Blush your left cheek a bit more.

484
00:37:42,503 --> 00:37:44,207
Just a little, or it’ll look too much.

485
00:37:46,957 --> 00:37:47,616
Good?

486
00:37:48,728 --> 00:37:50,226
Where’s your makeup artist?

487
00:37:50,877 --> 00:37:51,911
Working at a concert.

488
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,060
And you called me just in time.

489
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,143
Don’t forget, you have money.

490
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,016
You can hire anyone.

491
00:37:58,979 --> 00:37:59,856
For some things,

492
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:01,620
doing it yourself gives you more pride.

493
00:38:10,194 --> 00:38:12,226
What do you think of this dress?

494
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:14,007
Sexy enough?

495
00:38:17,952 --> 00:38:20,309
Yes, it’s sexy.

496
00:38:21,668 --> 00:38:23,306
But who are you being sexy for?

497
00:38:24,339 --> 00:38:25,571
My girlfriend, duh!

498
00:38:26,997 --> 00:38:28,703
The girlfriend who left you yesterday?

499
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:37,186
Did you just hang up on me?

500
00:38:38,248 --> 00:38:39,586
You only bother with me when I’m useful.

501
00:38:43,005 --> 00:38:43,620
Hey!

502
00:38:44,314 --> 00:38:45,860
You seriously came up to my room?

503
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:47,811
Yes, I did.

504
00:38:48,505 --> 00:38:49,760
Are you cutting ties with me for good?

505
00:38:54,616 --> 00:38:57,213
Are you unfriending me just because I like you?

506
00:38:57,851 --> 00:38:58,771
No.

507
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:02,109
There’s been a lot on my mind lately,

508
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,608
so I don’t have time to clear things up with you.

509
00:39:05,822 --> 00:39:07,013
Then don’t.

510
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,013
Let me clear things up for you.

511
00:39:10,038 --> 00:39:11,011
I broke up with Pim.

512
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,937
Even though you’re single,

513
00:39:19,254 --> 00:39:20,118
I still don’t like you anyway.

514
00:39:21,247 --> 00:39:22,110
I know.

515
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,014
I just really like you, Ai.

516
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:33,909
But if that’s going to end our friendship,

517
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,604
then fine, I won’t like you anymore.

518
00:39:40,502 --> 00:39:42,109
Let’s just go back to being friends.

519
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,903
We never stopped being friends.

520
00:39:48,605 --> 00:39:50,222
Actually, you didn’t need to
break up with your girlfriend.

521
00:39:51,762 --> 00:39:52,976
That’s not for you.

522
00:39:55,182 --> 00:39:56,208
It’s for me.

523
00:40:00,102 --> 00:40:01,509
I don’t want to lie to myself anymore.

524
00:40:05,173 --> 00:40:05,911
You too.

525
00:40:07,118 --> 00:40:08,205
Stop lying.

526
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,111
The more lies you tell,

527
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:16,314
the harder it is to tell the truth.

528
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,080
In the end, the ones getting hurt are you and May.

529
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,130
CALLING OABOOM

530
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,068
You really think you can hide from me?

531
00:41:16,771 --> 00:41:17,579
(I miss you.)

532
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:27,271
(I can’t believe such a simple word

533
00:41:28,088 --> 00:41:29,980
(can erase all the stress I’ve been carrying.)

534
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,302
(Maybe it’s because

535
00:41:37,515 --> 00:41:39,311
the word ‘miss’ that you sent

536
00:41:40,503 --> 00:41:42,214
(is the one my heart wants to say too.)

537
00:41:57,413 --> 00:41:58,462
I miss you.

538
00:41:59,776 --> 00:42:00,811
Miss you too.

539
00:42:01,397 --> 00:42:02,934
But you’ve been quiet.

540
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,106
I thought you’d run away from me.

541
00:42:06,736 --> 00:42:07,908
I want to, actually,

542
00:42:09,525 --> 00:42:10,868
but I just can’t seem to do it.

543
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:16,306
So I took a step back

544
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:19,909
and worked on self-improvement.

545
00:42:24,188 --> 00:42:24,915
How?

546
00:42:26,882 --> 00:42:27,871
You like novels,

547
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:33,308
so I decided to write one.

548
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,413
I want to read it.

549
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,702
I’m sure it’s going to be amazing.

550
00:42:40,426 --> 00:42:41,115
I’m not so sure.

551
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,973
At first, I was keeping up the pace,

552
00:42:46,748 --> 00:42:48,410
but now I’ve hit a block.

553
00:42:49,642 --> 00:42:53,032
When do you feel productive, then?

554
00:42:57,678 --> 00:42:58,771
When I’m with you.

555
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,211
Then come to me.

556
00:43:02,582 --> 00:43:05,502
I’ll always be here. I never go anywhere.

557
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,862
Come to me, pretty please.

558
00:43:10,502 --> 00:43:11,348
Please.

559
00:43:13,087 --> 00:43:14,121
Darling, please.

560
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:22,328
What?

561
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:25,022
If you want to cancel my order,

562
00:43:25,428 --> 00:43:26,810
do it yourself.

563
00:43:27,268 --> 00:43:29,525
And I promise to get you in so much trouble.

564
00:43:31,377 --> 00:43:32,971
Gosh, why did he hang up?

565
00:43:34,223 --> 00:43:35,131
Hello!

566
00:43:36,182 --> 00:43:37,576
You seem hangry.

567
00:43:40,928 --> 00:43:41,705
Yeah, that too.

568
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,059
But I’m more upset with
the rider’s lack of work ethic.

569
00:43:45,437 --> 00:43:46,708
Try to let it go if you can.

570
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:49,813
Stress can lead to strokes, you know.

571
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,225
You should focus on living happily
and long enough to enjoy your retirement money.

572
00:43:53,754 --> 00:43:56,822
Do fortune tellers with a strong work ethic

573
00:43:57,488 --> 00:44:00,155
usually jinx people like you just did?

574
00:44:01,949 --> 00:44:03,585
I’m not speaking as a fortune teller,

575
00:44:03,822 --> 00:44:05,213
I’m speaking as your neighbor

576
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:07,502
who just got her food delivery.

577
00:44:11,776 --> 00:44:13,066
It’s buy one, get one free.

578
00:44:13,558 --> 00:44:14,807
Want to join me?

579
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:38,977
May, I’m here.

580
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:45,170
What did you bring?

581
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:47,608
I can hear it

582
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:50,374
but can’t smell it.

583
00:44:51,976 --> 00:44:52,613
A laptop

584
00:44:53,837 --> 00:44:55,103
with my novel in it.

585
00:44:58,294 --> 00:44:59,370
I want to read it.

586
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,016
Even though it’s not well-written yet,

587
00:45:03,442 --> 00:45:04,703
I want you to read it.

588
00:45:09,712 --> 00:45:11,470
I’ll prepare a reading app for you.

589
00:45:12,518 --> 00:45:13,607
Let me know when you’re ready.

590
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,007
You know,

591
00:45:20,472 --> 00:45:23,611
the reason I’m sure your novel will be good...

592
00:45:25,405 --> 00:45:28,333
isn’t just because you can describe things so well.

593
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:31,666
It’s because you’re so caring,

594
00:45:33,685 --> 00:45:35,312
though you’ve never been a caregiver before.

595
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,071
Since we’ve got back together,

596
00:45:40,542 --> 00:45:41,980
the care you give has been spot on.

597
00:45:46,223 --> 00:45:47,709
You even prepared a program to help me read.

598
00:45:50,937 --> 00:45:52,348
Don’t compliment me so much.

599
00:45:52,925 --> 00:45:55,434
I’ll be so embarrassed if it turns out bad.

600
00:45:56,096 --> 00:45:58,117
I doubt that very much.

601
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:03,207
Ready?

602
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:10,771
Here.

603
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:13,370
Ready?

604
00:46:17,915 --> 00:46:18,642
I’m ready.

605
00:46:23,441 --> 00:46:26,383
(The sunlight warms the day, )

606
00:46:26,545 --> 00:46:28,419
(Lifting the world from dismay, )

607
00:46:28,451 --> 00:46:30,682
(All doubts are put to flight, )

608
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:32,819
(When love blooms so pretty inside.)

609
00:46:32,838 --> 00:46:37,718
(This is the journey of
a lonely boy in search of love)

610
00:46:38,057 --> 00:46:41,112
(His name is Noi, short for Nilnate,

611
00:46:41,985 --> 00:46:44,557
(which means 'big black eyes.')

612
00:46:44,585 --> 00:46:48,299
(Nilnate grew up in Bangkok,

613
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,724
(a vibrant capital city…)

614
00:46:55,339 --> 00:46:56,555
May, is it bad?

615
00:46:59,373 --> 00:47:00,408
It’s not bad.

616
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:03,961
It’s just different.

617
00:47:09,853 --> 00:47:10,964
Different from what?

618
00:47:12,426 --> 00:47:15,364
Different from how you describe things to me.

619
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:26,102
You’re the reason I wanted to write a novel,

620
00:47:27,856 --> 00:47:31,308
but when I actually wrote,
it just didn’t read as pleasing.

621
00:47:31,786 --> 00:47:34,013
Unlike when I describe things to you.

622
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,703
Or maybe I just can’t write a novel?

623
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,662
I think you’re wrong about me.

624
00:47:42,517 --> 00:47:44,712
I don’t think I am.

625
00:47:46,874 --> 00:47:50,530
The novel you wrote has characters,

626
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:52,703
elements,

627
00:47:53,856 --> 00:47:54,626
and scenes.

628
00:47:57,405 --> 00:47:59,103
It sounds too blunt.

629
00:48:02,263 --> 00:48:04,318
It’s very straightforward,

630
00:48:05,771 --> 00:48:07,610
like reading legal documents,

631
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,973
certificates,

632
00:48:11,967 --> 00:48:14,315
or biographies.

633
00:48:21,582 --> 00:48:22,514
This is difficult.

634
00:48:25,983 --> 00:48:28,786
When I describe things to you, there’s no plot at all.

635
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,602
And I can only do it when I’m with you.

636
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:35,506
Don’t worry.

637
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:41,822
You can do it, Oom.

638
00:48:50,988 --> 00:48:51,717
Come with me.

639
00:49:08,026 --> 00:49:10,414
Oh, I forgot to get you water.

640
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:13,413
No, it’s fine.

641
00:49:13,888 --> 00:49:14,771
I’ll get it.

642
00:49:15,317 --> 00:49:16,771
Your refrigerator is…

643
00:49:17,108 --> 00:49:17,727
Over there.

644
00:49:18,352 --> 00:49:19,010
Thank you.

645
00:49:43,518 --> 00:49:44,160
Hey.

646
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,302
Why are you crying?

647
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,718
Easy there.

648
00:49:51,773 --> 00:49:53,976
One year doesn’t mean anything.

649
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:57,521
Nothing does.

650
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,408
The place we first met.

651
00:50:01,179 --> 00:50:03,505
The first plant we bought together.

652
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,010
Everything is forgotten.

653
00:50:09,081 --> 00:50:10,339
Easy there.

654
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:20,903
Calm down.

655
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,376
I’ll be here with you.

656
00:50:49,065 --> 00:50:49,614
May!

657
00:50:52,102 --> 00:50:53,416
Sorry, I can’t see.

658
00:50:57,976 --> 00:51:00,402
You said you’d help me write a novel.

659
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:06,268
Why did you make me take a bath?

660
00:51:08,152 --> 00:51:09,386
You told me

661
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,306
you wrote well when you were with me.

662
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,405
This isn’t "with you."

663
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:27,914
This is what’s called "with you."

664
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:29,577
Hold on.

665
00:51:29,794 --> 00:51:31,020
I’m actually helping you here.

666
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:47,309
Lay it down, let your burdens fade,

667
00:51:49,445 --> 00:51:52,306
Release the worries, shade by shade,

668
00:51:54,171 --> 00:51:57,071
Let body and mind drift gently apart,

669
00:51:58,247 --> 00:52:01,186
Feel the water that warms your heart.

670
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,253
In stillness, Three Characteristics you’ll find,

671
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:11,770
A realization right before your eyes,

672
00:52:13,805 --> 00:52:17,877
Impermanence, selflessness, touches of dismay,

673
00:52:19,497 --> 00:52:22,773
Things come, linger, then slip away.

674
00:52:26,469 --> 00:52:27,677
That’s euphonious.

675
00:52:31,945 --> 00:52:32,946
A Dhamma poem.

676
00:52:33,878 --> 00:52:36,309
I recited it to help me get through
the first phase of being blind.

677
00:52:40,247 --> 00:52:41,408
Do you know what it means?

678
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:47,118
The Three Characteristics in Buddhism.

679
00:52:49,177 --> 00:52:51,509
The nature of all things in the world.

680
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:58,871
Impermanence, suffering, and non-self.

681
00:53:01,777 --> 00:53:02,463
That’s right.

682
00:53:04,078 --> 00:53:05,472
It’s like your poem.

683
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,377
It has meaning and euphony.

684
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,625
You just need to differentiate
what the meaning is

685
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:16,828
and what euphony is.

686
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:22,216
For poems, it’s called ‘euphonious’.

687
00:53:23,665 --> 00:53:26,922
For novels, it’s called ‘fun’.

688
00:53:28,783 --> 00:53:32,016
The way you describe things so well
when you’re with me

689
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:37,305
is because you add euphony, not a story.

690
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:41,305
So, my novel feels blunt...

691
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:46,970
because I haven’t added euphony to it.

692
00:53:49,865 --> 00:53:51,013
What should I do?

693
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:01,100
My instructor once taught me:

694
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:06,880
“Laws are like taking off our clothes.

695
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:13,825
Writing a case file is like taking a shower.

696
00:54:17,397 --> 00:54:21,582
Gathering evidence is like putting on makeup.

697
00:54:23,432 --> 00:54:28,225
Witness hearings are like getting dressed.

698
00:54:30,632 --> 00:54:34,022
In the end, you get your final look.”

699
00:54:38,312 --> 00:54:40,402
Your body is bare now, Oom,

700
00:54:43,103 --> 00:54:44,777
and you understand the clothes.

701
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,474
All that’s left is to wear them well.

702
00:54:59,619 --> 00:55:01,062
I’ve stripped it all down for you.

703
00:55:06,145 --> 00:55:07,405
Now, dress well.

704
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,617
(In one corner of the car,

705
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:19,605
(a man and a woman’s bodies intertwine,
neither yielding to the other.)

706
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,398
(His mouth finds the curve of her neck

707
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,668
(as a light scent of perfume fills the air.)

708
00:56:25,167 --> 00:56:29,405
(With each breath, they fall
deeper into a haze of affection.)

709
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:32,309
(The beautiful girl, who hadn’t offered her name,

710
00:56:32,825 --> 00:56:35,511
(slowly unbuttons her plaid pants…)

711
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,776
This is really fun.

712
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,924
One small problem, though.

713
00:56:42,251 --> 00:56:43,182
What is it?

714
00:56:49,703 --> 00:56:50,822
Is it the whole chapter?

715
00:56:51,786 --> 00:56:52,583
It’s too short.

716
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,007
Come on, May.

717
00:56:55,764 --> 00:56:57,509
I spent so much time on one chapter.

718
00:57:03,694 --> 00:57:04,868
Upload it to a website.

719
00:57:07,817 --> 00:57:10,515
You’ll get readers and comments.

720
00:57:13,185 --> 00:57:14,521
They’ll keep asking for more

721
00:57:15,143 --> 00:57:16,958
and encourage you to keep writing.

722
00:57:19,096 --> 00:57:21,663
But what if I’m too slow? They’ll get mad at me.

723
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,509
I’m scared just thinking about it.

724
00:57:30,271 --> 00:57:31,171
Then…

725
00:57:33,475 --> 00:57:35,213
To give you some positive energy,

726
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,739
I’ll give you one reward

727
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:43,109
after you finish each chapter.

728
00:57:45,588 --> 00:57:47,860
When readers yell or pester you for more,

729
00:57:48,337 --> 00:57:49,614
this will keep you going.

730
00:57:54,374 --> 00:57:56,911
What should the reward be?

731
00:58:01,808 --> 00:58:02,899
Should I cook for you?

732
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,303
Or…

733
00:58:05,551 --> 00:58:06,705
Boba milk tea?

734
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,306
It’s my reward.

735
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:13,912
I should be able to choose.

736
00:58:18,334 --> 00:58:20,002
I want…

737
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,305
What you gave me

738
00:58:28,682 --> 00:58:30,305
the day we met again.

739
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:34,717
Your kiss.

740
00:58:38,671 --> 00:58:39,805
Finish a chapter first.

741
00:58:42,472 --> 00:58:44,503
Come on, May.

742
00:58:53,198 --> 00:58:54,367
This is to boost your typing power.

743
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:03,577
I haven’t even finished one chapter,

744
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,010
yet my reward is this good.

745
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:12,114
I can’t imagine how amazing it’ll be
when I actually finish one.

746
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,028
If you knew now,

747
00:59:15,456 --> 00:59:17,752
I bet you’d want to finish it today.

748
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,117
How’s it going?

749
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,909
I’m done changing.

750
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,367
Have a seat.

751
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,607
But I didn't wear makeup today.

752
01:00:48,802 --> 01:00:51,714
Even without makeup, it was dusty outside.

753
01:00:52,137 --> 01:00:53,862
You have to clean your face anyway.

754
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:56,385
Come closer.

755
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,062
So the writing process starts with this?

756
01:01:12,882 --> 01:01:13,611
Yes.

757
01:01:15,469 --> 01:01:17,010
It starts with you.

758
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:29,075
How are you feeling?

759
01:01:36,398 --> 01:01:37,720
Thankful.

760
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,632
This Oom is trying to chase her dream.

761
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,970
You make me feel bigger again.

762
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,120
Well, I’ve been feeding you, haven’t I?

763
01:01:58,565 --> 01:02:00,499
Don’t let yourself become smaller again.

764
01:02:00,906 --> 01:02:02,912
No universal design in this country?

765
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:04,500
I’ll push for it.

766
01:02:05,177 --> 01:02:07,411
Don’t understand the abilities of the disabled?

767
01:02:09,219 --> 01:02:10,371
I’ll show the world.

768
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:12,462
I can do it.
