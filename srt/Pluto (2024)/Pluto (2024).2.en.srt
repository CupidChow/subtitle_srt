1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,890
It’s really you.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,610
You really came back to me?

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,500
Don’t tell me you haven’t...

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:05,770
No.

5
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,490
I haven’t broken up with her.

6
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,040
I couldn’t do it.

7
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,250
She’s blind.

8
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,410
Why do you want to

9
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,720
get back together with me?

10
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,720
I’ve been waiting for you, Oom.

11
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,020
And the prince and princess

12
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,740
live happily ever after.

13
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,690
Hey.

14
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,440
You’re still awake, Monkey?

15
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,160
I miss Oom.

16
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,700
I wish she could listen to the story with me.

17
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,730
Ooboom will get well soon.

18
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,530
You can tell her the story then, Ai.

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,740
(Ooboom has been sick frequently

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,520
(for as long as I can remember.)

21
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,290
(I always made it my goal

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,070
(to take the best care of my little sister.)

23
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,250
Get well soon.

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,820
(Until…)

25
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,080
Death took both of their parents.

26
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,400
I feel so bad for the twins.

27
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,390
I heard their car overturned

28
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,550
while taking their child to the hospital, right?

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,300
Yeah, the younger one isn’t very healthy.

30
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,170
She’s been in and out of the hospital a lot.

31
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,770
Oom.

32
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,740
It’s okay, child.

33
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,480
Grandma is right here.

34
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,860
It’s alright.

35
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,730
(...the day we let go of our hands.)

36
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,730
Oom!

37
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,050
Please wait outside.

38
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,050
Ma’am, please wait outside.

39
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,860
Oom and Paul’s enemy?

40
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,000
How did you come up with this?

41
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,250
I overheard the police

42
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,130
talking to Paul’s dad at the funeral.

43
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,130
What did Paul’s family say?

44
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,260
They didn’t say a word.

45
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,760
That’s why we need to start digging.

46
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,930
Jan, I gotta go.

47
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,020
I’ll text you.

48
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,490
MEET ME AT THE POLICE STATION

49
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,470
IF YOU STILL CONSIDER YOURSELF

50
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,390
OOM’S BIG SISTER.

51
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,420
May.

52
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,330
You weren't…

53
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,370
eavesdropping on my phone call,

54
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,590
were you?

55
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,330
Why would I do that?

56
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,130
Unless you’re hiding something from me.

57
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,380
Well?

58
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,560
Are you?

59
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,200
What about you?

60
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,200
Are you hiding something from me?

61
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,530
You caught me!

62
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,140
Caught what?

63
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,220
I secretly asked the maid

64
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,090
to prepare breakfast.

65
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,380
I was planning to tell you

66
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,500
that I made it myself.

67
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,230
That’s it?

68
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,140
That’s it.

69
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,620
Is this the only thing

70
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,890
you planned to lie to me?

71
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,320
I couldn’t even lie to you

72
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,630
about this small thing.

73
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,190
Don’t tell anyone I’m a famous lawyer.

74
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,560
- You wicked. - Ow.

75
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,330
Let’s go.

76
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,700
PIMPAKORN DECHA-ANEK

77
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,830
ACCIDENT REPORT

78
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,640
Not so fast.

79
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,560
You told me you were a relative.

80
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,340
I’m a friend who’s as close as family.

81
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,530
With that reasoning,

82
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,530
anyone could be considered

83
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,530
a close relative or family.

84
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,090
Then tell me

85
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,350
if there was an unknown number

86
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,730
calling Paul’s phone.

87
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,230
The police suspect someone lured

88
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,040
Paul and Ooboom out to meet them,

89
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,290
and that’s when the accident happened.

90
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,980
You knew?

91
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,360
Because I’m a relative.

92
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,680
Now…

93
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,400
will you give me the details of the case?

94
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,530
No, ma’am.

95
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,630
I must respect the rights

96
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,880
of the deceased and the injured.

97
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,870
People these days can do just anything

98
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,380
to get the latest information.

99
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:27,970
For them, it’s all about

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,970
views and engagement.

101
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,770
You must tell me then.

102
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,190
You.

103
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,130
Because I have the right to

104
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,130
know things about my family.

105
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,350
Took you long enough.

106
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,750
Just because an unknown number called

107
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,440
and Paul and Ooboom rushed out

108
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,030
doesn’t mean the caller is the culprit.

109
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,960
But they must’ve been important enough

110
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,240
to get them out on their wedding day.

111
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,700
How do you know

112
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,080
nothing happened after that?

113
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:33,880
What did you find

114
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,730
when you inspected the scene?

115
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,030
Did their car just drift off the road,

116
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,500
or did something cut them off?

117
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,900
Were there any other cars at the scene?

118
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,720
This case was an accident.

119
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,140
Maybe it really was an accident.

120
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,730
Paul’s parents are big names.

121
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,800
If it wasn’t, they wouldn’t let it slide.

122
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
But we should at least find out

123
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,090
who called them out.

124
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,290
Oh, did you catch the number?

125
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,880
Of course I did.

126
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,730
I knew it.

127
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,280
It can’t be reached.

128
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,400
What should we do now?

129
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,190
HENG CHAROEN

130
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,420
(I still think

131
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,440
Metawe is the most suspicious

132
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,010
(no matter how I look at it)

133
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,430
(If Metawe wasn’t responsible,

134
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,940
(we can just cross her off the list.)

135
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,890
(But if she was behind it,

136
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,890
(we will find out.)

137
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,200
Why don’t you use Oom’s car?

138
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,200
She might wake up and yell at me.

139
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,190
Where are you off to?

140
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,350
Hey.

141
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,200
I asked where you’re going!

142
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,770
May, watch it.

143
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,140
May!

144
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,070
Who are you?

145
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,250
What are you doing to her?

146
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,660
I’m her cousin.

147
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,500
It’s alright.

148
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,930
I can put them on myself.

149
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Thank you.

150
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,890
I’m sorry.

151
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,750
I…

152
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,640
I didn’t mean to...

153
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,660
This is why

154
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,760
I never let you meet Oom.

155
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,100
Why?

156
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,030
Were you afraid I’d tell your parents?

157
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,660
I trust you don’t do it then.

158
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,930
I’m sorry, Oom, for not mentioning

159
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,930
that I have an older cousin.

160
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,810
He’s just a distant relative.

161
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,120
How distant am I

162
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,850
that I get greeted by a glass dropping?

163
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,230
If someone hadn’t misplaced it,

164
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,910
I wouldn’t have knocked it over

165
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
You need to be more careful.

166
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,570
The world doesn’t just exist

167
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,850
within this house.

168
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,020
The world doesn’t just exist

169
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,380
in my parents’ house either.

170
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,590
Why do you want me to live there so badly?

171
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,650
If you go home,

172
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,000
there will be someone to take you out.

173
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,520
You don’t need to be cooped up inside all day,

174
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,540
obsessing over that stupid

175
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,850
International Lawyers Association.

176
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,190
Do you really think anyone would care

177
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,970
to take me out if I go home?

178
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,860
Dad wants me there because

179
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,500
he wants to hide his disabled daughter away.

180
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,410
Just like he always hides the fact that

181
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,950
his daughter likes girls.

182
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,740
He does what he does

183
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,670
because he doesn’t want to be embarrassed.

184
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:22,940
May.

185
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,190
You should leave.

186
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,540
Oom.

187
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Hey.

188
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,700
May.

189
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
May!

190
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,580
But we have an appointment

191
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,260
with the doctor here this afternoon.

192
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,950
May.

193
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,500
What’s the International Lawyers Association

194
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,610
that your cousin mentioned?

195
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,590
Am I useless?

196
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,810
Why would you ask that?

197
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,640
Because I’m blind.

198
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,360
May.

199
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,090
Nobody is born perfect.

200
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,150
But you’re rich.

201
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,180
Yes, I am.

202
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
I’m poor

203
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,320
and I can’t do lots of things.

204
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,080
Am I useless?

205
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,950
We think exactly alike.

206
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,050
Since I went blind,

207
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,400
I’ve been thinking about how to

208
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,240
reduce the challenges of disability.

209
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,570
Using money?

210
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,920
Aid?

211
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,760
Laws?

212
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,380
That’s why I joined a private organization

213
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,050
dedicated to enhancing human rights.

214
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,020
I attended the meeting in Geneva

215
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,600
to help create this roadmap

216
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,110
and sent documents to gather support.

217
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,940
How cool.

218
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,060
Anything else I don’t know about you?

219
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,560
I actually like to go out

220
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,310
as long as you go with me.

221
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,670
What about you, Oom?

222
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,900
Do you want to go with me?

223
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,780
As you wish, Princess.

224
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,780
METAWE IS TAKING A SHOWER.

225
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,090
WE’RE GOING OUT.

226
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,440
GOOD.

227
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,950
HEY.

228
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,950
I WAS NEARLY SHOCKED TO DEATH.

229
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,060
MAY'S COUSIN SHOWED UP

230
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,149
OUT OF NOWHERE.

231
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,250
I WAS ALMOST SCREWED.

232
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,660
WHAT? MAY’S COUSIN?

233
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,480
WERE YOU SMOOTH?

234
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,980
SMOOTH, MY FOOT.

235
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,760
THE FLOOR WAS COVERED

236
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,640
IN BROKEN GLASS AS I ENTERED.

237
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,080
I THOUGHT THEY WERE FIGHTING.

238
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,930
I WAS TOO BUSY PROTECTING MAY.

239
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,390
IT’S GOOD THAT OOM

240
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,100
DOESN’T KNOW HIM EITHER.

241
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,490
LET’S SUPPOSE

242
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,220
SHE’S THE ONE BEHIND IT.

243
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,930
YOU WERE SMOOTH.

244
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,040
SHE INTENDED FOR YOU TO BE.

245
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,240
IT’S NOT METAWE.

246
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,530
SHE WAS WORKING ABROAD

247
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,320
AND JUST GOT BACK.

248
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,090
SHE DIDN’T EVEN KNOW

249
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,130
ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

250
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,540
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

251
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:08,010
CROSSING HER OFF THE LIST.

252
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Ahem.

253
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,140
Well…

254
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,870
Can you tell me more about your dad?

255
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,500
He doesn’t handle it well that

256
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,350
I have a girlfriend.

257
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,940
That’s why you’re a secret.

258
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,970
And…

259
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,060
our relationship hasn't been great lately.

260
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,490
You mean your relationship with your dad,

261
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,670
or with me?

262
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,350
Both.

263
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,370
Things became completely

264
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,370
awkward between us,

265
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,900
especially after I found out the truth.

266
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,590
The truth?

267
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,300
You never like telling me the truth.

268
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,460
Was it when you told me to go away?

269
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,750
I was so angry with you.

270
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,090
But you forgave me anyway.

271
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,920
Because I love you.

272
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,040
PANGRAM’S GARDEN
- The day we met,

273
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,840
she kissed me right off.

274
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,310
She must really love Oom.

275
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,550
Kissed?

276
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,460
Does she actually love Oom,

277
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,210
or was she just pretending?

278
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,200
I think she went overboard.

279
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,350
Like she’s scared of getting caught.

280
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,360
Caught for what?

281
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,420
If she showed she knew

282
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,530
you weren’t Ooboom,

283
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,750
she’d become a suspect in the accident.

284
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,850
You still have a theory about that?

285
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
What?

286
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,750
Aren’t you looking into it yourself?

287
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,950
Why are you asking me that?

288
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,650
I…

289
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,650
Are you not looking into it

290
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,610
but trying to prove her innocence?

291
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,900
You met her once,

292
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,160
she kissed you,

293
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,840
and now you think she loves you?

294
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,110
Are you crazy?

295
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,850
It’s not about kissing.

296
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,060
It’s the feeling that told me

297
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,360
the kiss came from love.

298
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,160
I can really sense that

299
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,990
she truly loves Ooboom.

300
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,840
Oom.

301
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,360
You forgave me

302
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,870
right when I came back?

303
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,240
Yes.

304
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,890
Have you ever heard songs with the line,

305
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,030
‘You had me at hello’?

306
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,420
That’s exactly how I felt when you returned.

307
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,280
You dressed up nicely.

308
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,130
You like it?

309
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,840
You look like a princess fleeing her palace.

310
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,330
Then…

311
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,450
you better wear the crown for the princess.

312
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,160
Here.

313
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,860
You trust me too much.

314
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,110
What if it turns out ugly?

315
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,600
As long as I look pretty in your eyes,

316
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,680
that’s enough for me.

317
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,530
You’re such a sweet talker, Princess.

318
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,720
Alright, let’s try it.

319
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,920
(I carefully added

320
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,250
(the crown of the face for Metawe.)

321
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,000
(She’s truly a princess to me now.)

322
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,130
(Not because she’s pretty or wealthy,

323
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,360
but because of a rare virtue

324
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,360
(I’d never encountered before.)

325
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,370
(Without even noticing, I became selfish,

326
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,330
caught up in the idea that

327
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,820
this princess

328
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,600
(was a gift Ooboom had given me.)

329
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yes, Uncle.

330
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,520
May is fine.

331
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,560
The doctor will stop by this evening.

332
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,370
We can also discuss

333
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,070
some other treatment options.

334
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,160
Seriously, Oom?

335
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,260
When I said I wanted to run away,

336
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,710
I meant we drove.

337
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,870
Your cousin will know if we do that.

338
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:54,100
You said you’d like to go out with me.

339
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,700
With you,

340
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,150
I’m willing to go anywhere.

341
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,410
Narrow doorway.

342
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,420
I’LL TAKE MAY TO YOUR SHOP.
LOTS OF TREES…

343
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,950
Pang.

344
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,510
Pang.

345
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:27,840
Hm?

346
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,370
Your friend Ai-oon said

347
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,900
she’d swing by your shop.

348
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,350
Hm?

349
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,060
Why is she coming?

350
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,380
Does she want me to help find fault?

351
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,920
Find fault in what?

352
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:58,470
I’m suspecting the person she’s with

353
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,690
is faking her blindness

354
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,970
and behind many things that happened.

355
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,620
Sounds like a fantasy.

356
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,570
It’s going to be fun.

357
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,859
Well,

358
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,570
I’m off to work.

359
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,480
Um.

360
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,920
Have a nice day.

361
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,450
You have a nice day too.

362
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,720
I hope you find whatever fault there is.

363
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,990
I’m leaving.

364
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:39,690
Bye.

365
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,360
I’M GOING TO SEE

366
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,880
THAT CAPTAIN AGAIN.

367
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,270
YOU’RE WITH METAWE, RIGHT?

368
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,640
IF METAWE’S INVOLVED,

369
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,640
SHE SHOULD RECEIVE SOME CALL.

370
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,780
The bus has arrived, May.

371
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,960
Take one step up.

372
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,430
We’re at our seats.

373
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,490
You take the inside one.

374
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,610
You don’t usually travel by bus, do you?

375
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,180
I don’t quite like it.

376
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,560
I’m sorry if this is inconvenient for you.

377
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,000
Don’t apologize.

378
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,800
The one making things

379
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,400
inconvenient for me isn’t you.

380
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,770
Where to, sis?

381
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,920
Ekkamai for two.

382
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,300
That’ll be 40 baht.

383
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,700
Half-price for the blind.

384
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,980
A Disabled Person ID card?

385
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,380
Can’t you see that I’m blind?

386
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,830
Why do you need to see the card?

387
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,340
Come on. It’s the rule.

388
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,560
Show me the card and you pay only half.

389
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
I don’t have it.

390
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,260
Then I can’t give you the discount.

391
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:24,340
Lots of con artists these days.

392
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,010
Do I look like a con artist to you?

393
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,700
No.

394
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,010
I’m just stating a fact.

395
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,500
Stating facts is fine.

396
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,450
Lacking manners is not.

397
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,060
It’s 40 baht.

398
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,610
Where to, folks?

399
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,880
Don’t mind him.

400
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,930
He’s gone.

401
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,310
This is why I hate going out.

402
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,390
Why do I have to prove my disability?

403
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,776
But showing the Disabled Person ID Card

404
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,970
can’t be that bad.

405
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,030
Do you have to show a card

406
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,580
to prove you’re a non-disabled person?

407
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,170
When you become uncommon,

408
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,850
the world becomes unfair too.

409
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,430
You know, when I first became blind,

410
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,430
I tried living a normal life.

411
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,290
I used the sky train.

412
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,200
I walked to my office...

413
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,930
May, watch out!

414
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:33,950
What is it?

415
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,410
A street sign.

416
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,300
Right.

417
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:38,910
Braille blocks that always

418
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,910
lead me to bump into things,

419
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,910
buses with disability assess,

420
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,650
and elevators that are always locked.

421
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,410
I don’t even know how to use them.

422
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,320
Some don’t even have Braille.

423
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,840
Do you know what universal design is?

424
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,650
I don’t.

425
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,256
It’s a design concept that enables

426
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,360
people with disabilities or impairments

427
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,260
to live normally in public spaces.

428
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,780
It’s based on the idea that

429
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,190
no one is disabled

430
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,400
if environments are universally designed.

431
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,840
This world, at least in this country,

432
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,120
wasn’t built for the disabled at all, Oom.

433
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:20,620
How can I not be afraid of going out?

434
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,840
But I’m grateful I’m blind.

435
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,520
Otherwise, I wouldn’t have

436
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,940
come to this realization.

437
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,000
You know, I joined the

438
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,280
Lawyers Council for Disabled People.

439
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,490
Hey, what are you doing?

440
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,880
I’m helping you catch her.

441
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,516
- Do you want to hear about it?
- This way we’ll see if she’s really blind.

442
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,510
Pang, I’m not playing this.

443
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,920
You said you’d come see me.

444
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,260
Just to take her out to chill.

445
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,220
Oom.

446
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:49,680
Oom!

447
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,430
Let go.

448
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,380
I’ll go to her.

449
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,180
Just wait a bit.

450
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:52,860
Pang!

451
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:53,650
Oom!

452
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,710
Oom.

453
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,390
Oom, where are you?

454
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,420
Oom!

455
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,400
Ouch!

456
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,430
Let go.

457
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,610
May.

458
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
May!

459
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,950
Get off of me!

460
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,770
May!

461
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:09,930
Oom.

462
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,050
May.

463
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,550
May.

464
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
May.

465
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,060
May.

466
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:15,870
May.

467
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,410
Where did you go?

468
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,360
Where did you go?

469
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,190
May.

470
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,300
I’m sorry.

471
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,470
I’m sorry, May.

472
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,350
So sorry.

473
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,520
Are you okay?

474
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,980
Are you hurt?

475
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,010
Inspector, I’ve got something.

476
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
What is it?

477
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,920
It’s highly likely that

478
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,690
the unknown number called from Skype.

479
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,600
So?

480
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:22,540
If we investigate the online account

481
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:23,570
linked to it,

482
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,156
You have to consider that the number

483
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,690
could belong to either

484
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,790
a person or a scammer.

485
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,480
An accident is just an accident.

486
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,610
Then what can I tell the victim’s family?

487
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,790
I can’t investigate the number,

488
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,790
and I can’t see the autopsy report.

489
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,690
The look in that girl’s sister’s eyes

490
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,980
gets stuck in my mind.

491
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,630
She wants to know what

492
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,180
her little sister went through

493
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,330
and why she had an accident

494
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,500
on her wedding day.

495
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,020
Tell her it was an accident.

496
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
Should I do this?

497
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,740
What do you think you’re doing?

498
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,300
Let go of me.

499
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,770
Do I have to tell you again

500
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,100
that you can’t do that?

501
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,510
I know.

502
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,130
Yet you did it anyway.

503
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,800
Right. Even you didn’t get to

504
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,170
read the autopsy report.

505
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,890
You knew that?

506
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,730
I overheard.

507
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,120
Here’s news for you.

508
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,270
What?

509
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,470
I did read the autopsy report.

510
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,820
What?

511
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,050
PANG: HEY, I’M SORRY.

512
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:48,530
Oom, why did you become quiet?

513
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,530
Is something wrong?

514
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,100
I shouldn’t have done that.

515
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,220
Why?

516
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,930
You went to rescue a cat.

517
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,180
At least it survived.

518
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,700
I shouldn’t have left you.

519
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,420
You know,

520
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,710
the feeling of not being able to see

521
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,940
doesn’t just happen when I’m blind,

522
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,250
it also hits me when I realize

523
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,940
you’re not by my side.

524
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,430
May, I’m sorry.

525
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,670
I made going out a nightmare for you.

526
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,530
Make it up to me then.

527
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,260
Sure.

528
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,560
Just say what you want me to do.

529
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
There’s a place I wanna go.

530
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
BANGKOK PLANETARIUM PASS

531
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,940
You know,

532
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,710
I love this place so much.

533
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,330
When I was young,

534
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,080
I came here on a school field trip.

535
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,510
After I moved to Bangkok,

536
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,000
it’s become a place I visit quite often.

537
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,230
Ooboom comes here on dates?

538
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,410
Exactly.

539
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,820
Ooboom doesn’t like it here,

540
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,730
which is why I usually come by myself.

541
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,010
Maybe I’m up in the sky too often.

542
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,300
Probably why I’m not into this kind of stuff.

543
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,380
But you sound more into it now.

544
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,120
Are you no longer a flight attendant?

545
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,480
You know that?

546
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,370
I can feel it.

547
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,200
I also heard you say ‘receive goods’

548
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,550
and ‘deliver goods.’

549
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,400
Have you changed jobs?

550
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,590
What a master of perception.

551
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,130
What else do you feel?

552
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,240
I feel like…

553
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,750
you’re acting strange today.

554
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,880
I’m probably just stressed.

555
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,510
I quit my job not long ago.

556
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,040
No.

557
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,800
It’s just today.

558
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,250
You’re acting strange today.

559
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,610
May, I’ll be right back.

560
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,930
Where are you going?

561
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:16,910
It’ll take just a moment.

562
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:17,930
I’ll be back.

563
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,200
Hello, Jan.

564
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,300
I'm at the police station.

565
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,690
No one called May all day.

566
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,400
I’m sure she’s not behind it.

567
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,650
And she’s not lying about her blindness.

568
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Um.

569
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,330
May isn’t the one behind it.

570
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,490
The ones behind this are Paul’s parents.

571
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,530
What?

572
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,990
Paul was drunk when he was driving,

573
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,110
so his parents asked

574
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,640
for this case to be closed.

575
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:51,760
They don’t want their

576
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,120
family’s reputation ruined.

577
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,700
Why did you come with me, Oom?

578
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,580
Because you’ve been drinking.

579
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,720
I didn’t want you to go alone.

580
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,690
Paul!

581
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,800
Watch out!

582
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,410
The police also said

583
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,530
Paul’s parents already

584
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,900
informed your grandmother,

585
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,870
and they’re willing to take full responsibility.

586
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,290
So that’s why Grandma’s never

587
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,560
spoken of Paul again.

588
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,410
You haven’t done anything

589
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,710
bad to May, have you?

590
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,730
No. I know she isn’t the bad guy.

591
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:36,400
If you’re sure May isn’t involved in this,

592
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,270
then I’m sure too.

593
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,040
I think you should tell her.

594
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,740
She deserves to know about Oom.

595
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,330
Yeah.

596
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,000
(How could I forget

597
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,460
that the forgiveness,

598
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,850
the trust,

599
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,260
and the kiss filled with love

600
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,790
were all meant for Ooboom,

601
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,680
(not Ai-oon?)

602
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,350
May.

603
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,850
You’re done?

604
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,390
Let’s go see the stars.

605
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,850
Use your left foot to take a step.

606
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,940
Which star do you want to see?

607
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,500
I’ll describe it for you.

608
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
The Travelers’ North Star

609
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,560
or Ursa Major,

610
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
which can help us locate the North Star?

611
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,850
I want to see Pluto.

612
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,990
You can’t see it with the naked eye.

613
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
Yeah.

614
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,490
Even more reason to like it.

615
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,870
Why's that?

616
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,240
Because…

617
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:31,610
it makes me feel like

618
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,610
I’m not the only one blind.

619
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,820
Will that be fun?

620
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,240
So much fun.

621
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,690
You’ve made today incredibly fun.

622
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,160
With you,

623
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:54,140
I feel like I’m on Neptune,

624
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,900
the Windy Planet.

625
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,810
In just one day with you,

626
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,820
I experience happiness,

627
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,440
sadness,

628
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,530
fear,

629
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,050
and love.

630
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,340
Like climate variability.

631
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,890
That sounds bad.

632
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,160
No.

633
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,840
Nothing is bad

634
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,250
as long as it’s you.

635
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:45,360
You make me want to live on.

636
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,150
(I suddenly felt like I was Pluto,

637
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,300
once part of Metawe’s solar system,

638
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,270
now destined to be forgotten

639
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:17,500
(while remaining in the same spot.)

640
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:26,560
(Metawe was a charming

641
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,590
and mysterious girl,

642
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:32,210
so it wasn’t surprising that

643
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,640
someone weak-minded like Ooboom

644
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,170
(fell head over heels for her.)

645
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:43,130
(She was rich, beautiful, and smart.)

646
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,990
(It’s hard to believe she could be tricked

647
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,770
(by my sister about that marriage.)

648
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,820
(She was a star

649
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,430
I could only glimpse through a telescope,

650
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:56,610
and all I could see was

651
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:03,560
(so much love for Ooboom it’s annoying.)

652
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,940
(What’s even more annoying is

653
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,240
(Oom’s ingratitude toward that.)

654
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:11,090
(But I couldn’t fully condemn Oom

655
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,580
because what I was doing now

656
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,450
(wasn’t any better.)

657
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,550
(I had been deceiving May,

658
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,640
(and I couldn’t keep doing it anymore.)

659
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,640
Aren’t you coming inside?

660
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,150
Don’t think so.

661
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,720
It’s late.

662
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,510
Aren’t you gonna hug me?

663
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:50,330
I better not.

664
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:55,030
Or I won’t wanna go home.

665
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,720
Then don’t go home

666
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:11,130
Let’s not do it, May.

667
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,130
I caused you enough trouble today.

668
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You made me happy, Oom.

669
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,600
Thank you.

670
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:06,880
Well?

671
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,220
How did it go?

672
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,000
You should go.

673
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,270
I need to think.

674
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,880
What?

675
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,530
Ms. Nid.

676
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,960
Yes?

677
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:23,250
You can take a few days off.

678
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,090
Pack your bag.

679
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:26,820
Ton will drive you.

680
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:29,290
Me?

681
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:32,650
What are you planning to do?

682
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,600
HENG CHAROEN

683
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:59,340
…I HAD BEEN DECEIVING MAY,
AND I COULDN’T KEEP DOING IT ANYMORE.

684
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,630
I’m really sorry, May.

685
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:29,900
But I think you’re better off

686
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,320
without Oom and Ai in your life.

687
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:11,621
Hello, May.

688
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,323
(Oom, help me!)

689
00:48:13,345 --> 00:48:14,345
(Oom.)

690
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:15,440
May?

691
00:48:15,483 --> 00:48:16,741
May, what’s going on?

692
00:48:16,763 --> 00:48:17,338
Hello.

693
00:48:17,367 --> 00:48:18,367
May! What happened?

694
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,774
(Help, Oom.)

695
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,323
May, who did anything to you?

696
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,560
There’s a cockroach in my room.

697
00:48:34,603 --> 00:48:37,425
I could smell it and hear it flying.

698
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,596
Can you get it out for me?

699
00:48:38,618 --> 00:48:39,476
Hold on.

700
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,032
Why don’t you just ignore it?

701
00:48:41,061 --> 00:48:43,556
You could sleep in another room.

702
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:44,530
It will go away soon.

703
00:48:44,552 --> 00:48:45,578
No.

704
00:48:45,607 --> 00:48:47,200
I don’t want it in my room.

705
00:48:47,236 --> 00:48:48,283
Get rid of it.

706
00:48:48,305 --> 00:48:49,105
Please.

707
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,501
I don’t want it to reproduce.

708
00:48:50,538 --> 00:48:52,500
I’ll go get the security guard.

709
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,578
Why?

710
00:48:55,883 --> 00:48:57,927
You usually handle pest control.

711
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,720
(Yeah. Oom isn’t scared.)

712
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:03,876
(But I’m not Oom.)

713
00:49:03,912 --> 00:49:05,360
Jeez!

714
00:49:05,396 --> 00:49:07,520
It’s in the bathroom.

715
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,003
Help!

716
00:49:09,032 --> 00:49:10,734
A cockroach!

717
00:49:10,763 --> 00:49:12,196
Gosh, stop making noise.

718
00:49:12,232 --> 00:49:13,687
I’m reading.

719
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,763
Jeez, I’m getting chills.

720
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,709
You’re a lot bigger than it.

721
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,061
Why are you scared?

722
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,385
I’m not.

723
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,047
Then get this.

724
00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:48,901
- Get it away from me. - It’s coming to you.

725
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:50,196
No!

726
00:49:50,261 --> 00:49:53,367
Don’t!

727
00:49:53,403 --> 00:49:55,054
Put it away.

728
00:49:55,098 --> 00:49:56,098
Oom.

729
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:56,938
Oom!

730
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:57,952
Yes?

731
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:00,363
Are you scared?

732
00:50:00,392 --> 00:50:01,701
Of course not.

733
00:50:01,738 --> 00:50:02,850
Who is?

734
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,705
Not at all.

735
00:50:04,734 --> 00:50:05,490
That’s great.

736
00:50:05,534 --> 00:50:06,901
Then get it out.

737
00:50:06,945 --> 00:50:08,312
My maid is on leave.

738
00:50:08,341 --> 00:50:09,612
She’s usually the one that helps me with this.

739
00:50:09,636 --> 00:50:10,734
Oom, go on.

740
00:50:10,756 --> 00:50:12,610
Don’t let it reproduce.

741
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,374
Gosh, I shouldn’t have come.

742
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:24,741
Alright. I‘m not scared.

743
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:26,589
I’m not scared. I’m not scared.

744
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:45,770
Where is it?

745
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:48,370
Come on.

746
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,090
May.

747
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,060
May.

748
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,018
I think it’s gone.

749
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,080
What did you say?

750
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,080
I looked everywhere.

751
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:44,341
It’s not in here.

752
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,858
You sure?

753
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,480
Yeah.

754
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:55,970
May, I’m right here.

755
00:51:58,734 --> 00:51:59,970
Don’t be afraid.

756
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,047
It should be gone now.

757
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,883
You’re awesome.

758
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,523
What’s that noise?

759
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,829
What is it, Oom?

760
00:52:30,305 --> 00:52:32,269
Argh!

761
00:53:14,763 --> 00:53:16,436
I’ve just discovered that

762
00:53:16,472 --> 00:53:18,392
the sound I like the most

763
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:20,390
is the sound of my heart.

764
00:53:20,421 --> 00:53:21,963
You make me happy, Oom.

765
00:53:22,472 --> 00:53:24,240
So I’m making you happy too.

766
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:26,072
The door is stuck somehow.

767
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,156
Why did this horrible thing have to

768
00:53:29,185 --> 00:53:32,116
happen to a good girl like you, Oom?

769
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,847
It should’ve happened

770
00:53:33,876 --> 00:53:34,894
to a bad girl like me.

771
00:53:34,938 --> 00:53:39,025
Your voice warms my heart.
