1
00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:04,306
This terrible thing shouldn’t have happened
to someone as good as Oom.

2
00:00:05,146 --> 00:00:07,361
It should’ve happened to
a bad person like me instead, huh?

3
00:00:07,385 --> 00:00:08,700
So this is your decision?

4
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:11,675
I think your lack of judgment
comes from your blindness.

5
00:00:11,952 --> 00:00:12,952
You can lean on me.

6
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:15,256
We can go back inside once you feel better.

7
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,125
Here.

8
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:25,174
A helmet?

9
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:27,238
Yep.

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,450
It keeps your head safe

11
00:00:29,604 --> 00:00:30,884
but won’t keep you from hearing.

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,650
Silly!

13
00:00:33,214 --> 00:00:34,620
Of course, it won’t.

14
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,377
When I have too much on my mind,

15
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:41,013
I like to go for a ride.

16
00:00:42,278 --> 00:00:43,703
Listen to the wind rushing,

17
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:45,330
horns honking,

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,813
or even people arguing on the streets.

19
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,774
Sometimes, the world’s noise

20
00:00:55,205 --> 00:00:57,511
can drown out the noise of misery within.

21
00:01:00,213 --> 00:01:01,411
What gives you misery, Oom?

22
00:01:03,174 --> 00:01:04,174
Plenty.

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,420
Everyone has their miserable moments.

24
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:09,442
So…

25
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:15,115
is the world’s noise really louder
than the noise in my mind?

26
00:01:17,752 --> 00:01:19,312
That you have to find out for yourself.

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,317
With me next to you.

28
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:27,601
Well,

29
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:30,256
how do I look right now?

30
00:01:31,823 --> 00:01:32,851
Funny.

31
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:34,296
I look funny?

32
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:35,534
Kidding. You look lovely.

33
00:01:38,644 --> 00:01:40,011
I want to be able to see myself.

34
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:54,305
So?

35
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
You sure about this?

36
00:01:57,948 --> 00:01:59,774
Let’s go fast and furious!

37
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:02,586
Hold tight.

38
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:52,222
Are you almost done, sis?

39
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,309
My customer’s been waiting so long,
she could’ve had three kids by now.

40
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,306
Damn it. I bet they’re all dogs.

41
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,470
Just hold on.

42
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,610
Almost finished.

43
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:02,604
She can get sued for defamation.

44
00:04:05,838 --> 00:04:06,838
Bonkers.

45
00:04:08,226 --> 00:04:08,900
Don’t you know?

46
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,710
The angrier she gets, the tastier the food!

47
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Really?

48
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,220
Yes.

49
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,330
You, little doggy.

50
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,337
Sis, come on! We’re dying over here!

51
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:23,444
Almost done.

52
00:04:23,648 --> 00:04:24,651
Just a bit longer.

53
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,370
Here you go.

54
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,540
Thanks, kiddo.

55
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:31,505
Who do you have there?

56
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
My girlfriend.

57
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,115
Look at you!

58
00:04:37,392 --> 00:04:38,752
You have such a pretty girlfriend.

59
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:42,269
Naturally.

60
00:04:43,202 --> 00:04:43,823
Gosh, just leave.

61
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,830
Get out of my face.

62
00:04:49,484 --> 00:04:50,484
Well?

63
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:51,848
Are you ready?

64
00:04:59,594 --> 00:05:00,594
Ready to go.

65
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:33,869
Please help me with this.

66
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,950
No problem.

67
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:39,013
The doc has been picked up.

68
00:05:45,863 --> 00:05:46,863
May.

69
00:05:47,878 --> 00:05:48,878
Have some water.

70
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,651
Drink with me, Oom.

71
00:06:20,644 --> 00:06:21,644
Let’s go.

72
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:29,508
Hi, Vee.

73
00:06:29,872 --> 00:06:31,274
Back from Korea?

74
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,610
Right, I’m back and
craving Som Tum so much.

75
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,411
Here.

76
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:36,765
Thanks.

77
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,151
What is this?

78
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:42,314
Sorry.

79
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:44,576
You see I just got back from Korea.
I haven’t exchanged any money yet.

80
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
You take that.

81
00:06:45,703 --> 00:06:47,029
It’s 1,000 Korean won.

82
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,041
The change is your tip.

83
00:06:49,314 --> 00:06:50,314
I can’t.

84
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:52,085
I only accept Thai baht.

85
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:53,908
You can transfer instead.

86
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,257
Don’t you get it? I just got back from abroad.

87
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:57,322
I haven’t even set up my internet yet.

88
00:06:57,336 --> 00:06:58,097
I can’t transfer.

89
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,151
Besides, what I gave you is worth a lot more.

90
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:02,521
Come on.

91
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,008
Don’t pull this trick.

92
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:06,302
I know this is a small amount.

93
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,170
Are you accusing me of scamming you?

94
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,958
You don’t know any better.

95
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:11,866
Just leave

96
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:14,613
before I call the police for trespassing.

97
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,170
Hey.

98
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,314
This is a shameless scam.

99
00:07:18,743 --> 00:07:19,437
Scam?

100
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:21,158
I paid you, didn’t I?

101
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:23,014
- How could you say that?
- How is this a scam?

102
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:23,890
How could you say that?

103
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,181
It’s obvious you’re pulling a fast one on me.

104
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:27,205
- Give me the food and take your money back.
- Oom.

105
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:29,654
Let’s go.

106
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:31,588
May.

107
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:33,013
But we can’t back down.

108
00:07:33,573 --> 00:07:34,909
Who said I’m backing down?

109
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,602
I recorded everything.

110
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:40,917
We can just sue her for fraud.

111
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:45,545
Show her this.

112
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,730
What?

113
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Here.

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,250
MS. METAWEE, ATTORNEY

115
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:03,674
So?

116
00:08:05,536 --> 00:08:07,802
I’ll check inside to see if I got any money.

117
00:08:08,365 --> 00:08:09,365
Take this back too.

118
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:33,813
When you're blind,

119
00:08:35,397 --> 00:08:37,373
ice cream tastes better somehow.

120
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:42,122
It’s like…

121
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:45,411
every detail, except what you see,

122
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,220
becomes more important.

123
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:51,318
I don’t think it’s the ice cream.

124
00:08:52,768 --> 00:08:53,979
It’s you, May.

125
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:56,813
Hm?

126
00:08:58,493 --> 00:08:59,629
The details.

127
00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:03,811
You were so cool, showing her your card like that.

128
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,060
It had nothing to do with your blindness.

129
00:09:09,906 --> 00:09:13,320
Vee was working illegally in Korea.

130
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:15,130
Then she got arrested

131
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:18,278
and was deported a few days ago.

132
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:20,857
She might really be out of money.

133
00:09:21,349 --> 00:09:23,746
Still, that’s no excuse to scam someone.

134
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:29,934
True,

135
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,137
but it’s the reason why
I’m asking you to let her off the hook.

136
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,826
Please don’t use the video against her.

137
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:43,816
You’re soft-hearted.

138
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,807
So, my ‘cool’ move was all for nothing.

139
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,514
Actually, I didn’t record anything.

140
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,477
Who could act that fast?

141
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:00,106
I knew it.

142
00:10:01,056 --> 00:10:02,220
But you’re still cool.

143
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:05,296
And you know what’s even cooler?

144
00:10:09,662 --> 00:10:11,980
My heart almost burst out of my chest

145
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,270
when I realized you were protecting me.

146
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,306
When someone protects you,

147
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:22,811
you want to protect them too.

148
00:10:55,247 --> 00:10:56,757
Your ice cream is melting.

149
00:10:57,885 --> 00:10:59,954
I’m protecting your hand from it.

150
00:11:03,238 --> 00:11:05,210
More like an excuse to steal my ice cream.

151
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,410
I won’t let you win this.

152
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,217
(The sunlight warms the day, )

153
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:37,900
(Lifting the world from dismay, )

154
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:42,814
(All doubts are put to flight, )

155
00:11:43,976 --> 00:11:47,825
(When love blooms so pretty inside.)

156
00:12:03,582 --> 00:12:04,582
No!

157
00:12:04,785 --> 00:12:06,377
Oom, help!

158
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,207
Anybody, help!

159
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:10,712
Help!

160
00:12:19,454 --> 00:12:20,454
Oops.

161
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:23,982
When did you get back to work?

162
00:12:30,454 --> 00:12:31,454
Hey.

163
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:36,114
Yes, it’s me, Oaboom.

164
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,750
Oaboom?

165
00:12:49,595 --> 00:12:50,595
And?

166
00:12:51,128 --> 00:12:52,524
This is May, my girlfriend.

167
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,973
Oaboom’s girlfriend?

168
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:01,453
Oom.

169
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:04,011
Who are you talking to?

170
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:07,102
Ah…

171
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:09,614
A friend.

172
00:13:09,677 --> 00:13:10,677
He’s my…

173
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
childhood friend

174
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,269
named Kosol.

175
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:15,813
Tell me.

176
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:21,574
Have you ever told your friend anything about me?

177
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,416
So? Kosol?

178
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:31,894
She told me...

179
00:13:31,908 --> 00:13:32,908
I didn’t.

180
00:13:33,983 --> 00:13:34,983
I couldn’t.

181
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,277
Because he’s my ex.

182
00:13:50,754 --> 00:13:52,014
I’d like to go home.

183
00:13:56,597 --> 00:13:57,597
Come on.

184
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:36,657
Here, May.

185
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:37,385
Let me help.

186
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:38,401
You should go.

187
00:14:41,616 --> 00:14:42,616
I want to rest.

188
00:14:47,362 --> 00:14:48,362
Ms. May.

189
00:14:51,837 --> 00:14:52,837
Ms. Nid,

190
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,631
please guide me inside.

191
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,190
Of course.

192
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,700
You’re still here?

193
00:15:50,386 --> 00:15:51,699
I need to talk to you.

194
00:15:58,152 --> 00:15:59,708
Is there anything you want to ask me?

195
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:03,860
I’d rather you just tell me.

196
00:16:05,525 --> 00:16:06,703
All this time,

197
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,454
you’ve never told me anything.

198
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:14,315
All I know is...

199
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,555
you were a flight attendant,

200
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:19,487
we were together,

201
00:16:22,103 --> 00:16:23,103
we fought,

202
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,574
I became blind,

203
00:16:31,262 --> 00:16:32,416
you were gone,

204
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:36,217
and now you’re back.

205
00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:47,878
Then…

206
00:16:52,254 --> 00:16:53,854
listen to the story of this Oom.

207
00:16:59,678 --> 00:17:01,500
I was born unimportant in my family.

208
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,300
I wasn’t a good student.

209
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,930
I wasn’t good at anything, really.

210
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,835
I’m not someone people can rely on.

211
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:16,420
Friends were the only ones...

212
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:20,383
who made me feel important,

213
00:17:24,373 --> 00:17:25,717
and sometimes

214
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:34,312
it went too far to the point
that we’d end up dating.

215
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,640
I just…

216
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,973
wanted to try loving someone.

217
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:48,863
I wanted to know

218
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:53,281
what it felt like to be loved.

219
00:17:57,765 --> 00:17:58,813
So what was it like?

220
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,300
It felt like

221
00:18:11,982 --> 00:18:14,320
my whole body was filling up with something,

222
00:18:16,466 --> 00:18:18,062
and it just kept growing.

223
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:24,502
The more love I got, the bigger it grew.

224
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,391
But instead of feeling heavy,

225
00:18:30,497 --> 00:18:31,497
no,

226
00:18:32,586 --> 00:18:35,002
I actually felt like I could float.

227
00:18:38,845 --> 00:18:39,845
It’s weird.

228
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,291
Bigger

229
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:44,788
but floaty.

230
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,558
I guess love is like…

231
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:56,813
the air in a balloon.

232
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:00,568
It makes us bigger,

233
00:19:01,922 --> 00:19:02,922
beautiful,

234
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:05,142
and floaty.

235
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,320
What are you doing, May?

236
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,700
I’m scared

237
00:19:29,053 --> 00:19:30,320
that one day

238
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,602
the balloon will float away from me.

239
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:41,816
The feeling I just told you

240
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:45,108
doesn’t happen when just anyone loves me.

241
00:19:52,128 --> 00:19:53,776
It happens when you love me.

242
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:57,623
So don’t worry.

243
00:19:58,237 --> 00:19:59,509
Kosol is just an ex.

244
00:20:01,962 --> 00:20:04,703
I like it when you tell me things like this.

245
00:20:08,355 --> 00:20:09,902
I can actually picture it

246
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,703
and feel it,

247
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,173
like I’m reading a novel.

248
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:23,124
You’re more of a bookworm than I thought.

249
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,379
Bedtime stories and novels.

250
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:36,422
When I was young,

251
00:20:39,334 --> 00:20:41,472
when my parents used to fight…

252
00:20:43,684 --> 00:20:46,614
Didn’t I tell you to raise
our child with discipline?

253
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:48,365
All you do is blame everything on me.

254
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:49,997
That’s because you don’t follow my instructions.

255
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,616
You never do what I want.

256
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:53,471
You’re just good for nothing.

257
00:20:57,004 --> 00:20:58,965
Maybe it’s the same theory.

258
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,429
Let other sounds drown out
the ones you don’t want to hear.

259
00:21:09,697 --> 00:21:11,331
Only, the sounds I used

260
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:14,282
came from my imagination.

261
00:21:20,851 --> 00:21:21,968
I’m going to write a novel.

262
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:27,192
Another surprise for me?

263
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:30,117
So, not only are you a flight attendant,

264
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,714
but now you’re an author too?

265
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:35,837
I’m not a flight attendant anymore.

266
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:38,614
Just a jobless person.

267
00:21:41,712 --> 00:21:42,712
Oom.

268
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:46,782
I actually wrote something in high school,

269
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:49,240
but it wasn’t that serious.

270
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,364
Now that you mentioned it,

271
00:21:53,213 --> 00:21:54,805
I think I should try again.

272
00:21:59,191 --> 00:22:00,605
I believe you can do it.

273
00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:03,499
Yes.

274
00:22:04,164 --> 00:22:05,253
I’m going to make it.

275
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:08,299
Can I get some support?

276
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,640
May!

277
00:22:16,112 --> 00:22:17,520
It’s your support.

278
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:19,605
I meant tell me a bedtime story.

279
00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:23,724
How could a bedtime story be better than my kiss?

280
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:30,540
Your bedtime stories inspire me.

281
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,312
Once upon a time,

282
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,582
there was a town known as the Town of Stars,

283
00:22:54,293 --> 00:22:57,459
because it was full of bright, beautiful stars.

284
00:23:01,411 --> 00:23:03,208
But there was one star,

285
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,005
far away from the others,

286
00:23:13,832 --> 00:23:17,370
with a color different from the rest.

287
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:25,906
That’s why the people in the town couldn’t see it.

288
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:36,770
Hey.

289
00:23:41,241 --> 00:23:42,241
Here.

290
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
I quit.

291
00:23:46,004 --> 00:23:47,004
Why?

292
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,670
Your new girlfriend, aka
your sister’s girlfriend, doesn’t like it?

293
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,008
I told him the story.

294
00:23:54,423 --> 00:23:55,525
It’s my votive offering.

295
00:23:56,887 --> 00:23:58,737
Why did you call me out this late?

296
00:23:59,234 --> 00:24:00,434
It’s about your vow, actually.

297
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:02,509
You’d quit smoking if Ben survived.

298
00:24:05,217 --> 00:24:06,564
Ben wants to see us.

299
00:24:12,604 --> 00:24:14,798
Wow. Your ride is fast.

300
00:24:17,727 --> 00:24:19,324
Are you riding a turtle? So slow.

301
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:21,179
You’re just flexing because that bike is new.

302
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:22,481
How about you catch up with Ben?

303
00:24:42,425 --> 00:24:43,425
Jeez!

304
00:24:50,035 --> 00:24:51,035
Holy shit!

305
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,920
Ben!

306
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:54,951
Ben!

307
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,954
After that, we went our separate ways,

308
00:24:59,608 --> 00:25:01,005
going about our lives.

309
00:25:02,684 --> 00:25:04,155
But Ben was left behind,

310
00:25:05,414 --> 00:25:06,510
disabled for life.

311
00:25:06,954 --> 00:25:08,306
Did you go visit him?

312
00:25:08,903 --> 00:25:09,903
How’s he doing?

313
00:25:10,325 --> 00:25:11,708
He’s still bedridden,

314
00:25:12,574 --> 00:25:13,708
but he’s been a lot better.

315
00:25:14,374 --> 00:25:15,807
He seemed more upbeat

316
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:17,973
and he wants to see you both.

317
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,063
I want to visit him but…

318
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,038
lately, I’ve been…

319
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,962
Busy with your sister’s girlfriend.

320
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:27,294
What?

321
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:29,219
Did you feel something when kissing her?

322
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:31,936
Yes, I did.

323
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:36,802
Don’t give me that funny look.

324
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,001
You and I were just messing around.

325
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,305
I know that.

326
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:43,360
I’m just surprised.

327
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,512
The first time you feel
something kissing someone,

328
00:25:46,536 --> 00:25:48,456
and it turns out to be your sister’s girlfriend.

329
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,300
How did that feel?

330
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,565
Was it weird since you’re both women?

331
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:12,426
Oh, Ai.

332
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,805
Not so fast.

333
00:26:14,176 --> 00:26:16,059
Bring the food offerings to the shrine too.

334
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,106
What’s the rush, really?

335
00:26:33,949 --> 00:26:35,613
(It’s obvious you feel something.)

336
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,709
You like her.

337
00:26:39,174 --> 00:26:40,534
You like your sister’s girlfriend.

338
00:26:42,112 --> 00:26:43,285
I don’t know.

339
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,008
All I know is I want to protect her.

340
00:26:46,868 --> 00:26:48,605
And I hate it when people look down on her.

341
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:51,383
As to why I feel that way,

342
00:26:53,955 --> 00:26:55,057
maybe it’s just because

343
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,450
this is the first time I’ve liked a girl.

344
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:01,330
Will her blindness be cured?

345
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:04,429
Why do you ask?

346
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:06,810
You seem confused when you talk about her.

347
00:27:07,512 --> 00:27:09,105
You must find the answer

348
00:27:09,868 --> 00:27:11,244
before she can see again.

349
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,090
I don’t know.

350
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,905
Jan told me…

351
00:27:23,004 --> 00:27:24,404
Jan is Oaboom’s close friend.

352
00:27:24,887 --> 00:27:25,887
She said

353
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,915
Oom and May fought before the accident occurred,

354
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:30,931
and then May went blind.

355
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:36,539
Then right now you must stop feeling confused.

356
00:27:40,103 --> 00:27:42,420
Or you shouldn’t have been
confused in the first place

357
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,813
because the one she kissed wasn’t you.

358
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:46,377
(It’s Oaboom.)

359
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,090
(Don’t forget that.)

360
00:28:05,804 --> 00:28:06,804
Pim.

361
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,152
Let’s stop.

362
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:12,856
You don’t wanna do it anymore?

363
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:15,042
Um…

364
00:28:15,308 --> 00:28:16,576
Not really in the mood.

365
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,702
Something on your mind?

366
00:28:32,702 --> 00:28:33,955
There, there.

367
00:28:34,937 --> 00:28:35,979
It’s okay.

368
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:40,770
How about this?

369
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:45,091
I will go out and get you the most delicious congee.

370
00:28:45,294 --> 00:28:49,023
Once you’re full, your mood will be lifted.

371
00:28:49,503 --> 00:28:50,503
Okay?

372
00:28:52,408 --> 00:28:53,697
I’ll be right back.

373
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:21,518
Did you forget the keycard, Pim?

374
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:28,973
Ai.

375
00:29:29,155 --> 00:29:30,155
Pang.

376
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,330
Help me.

377
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,604
SUKIYAKI / CONGEE / BLOOD PUDDING SOUP

378
00:29:39,605 --> 00:29:41,765
May I please get
SUKIYAKI / CONGEE / BLOOD PUDDING SOUP

379
00:29:41,862 --> 00:29:42,862
two congees, please?

380
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,620
Sorry, girl.

381
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:45,742
We only have one left.

382
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:52,537
You can have mine.

383
00:29:56,665 --> 00:29:58,305
Hey, you.

384
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,850
Here.

385
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,650
What about you?

386
00:30:03,223 --> 00:30:04,352
I bought extra.

387
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,423
I’m used to buying one more for Oom,

388
00:30:07,725 --> 00:30:10,805
the one in that car accident and the reason
I needed to get evidence from you.

389
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,980
Thank you.

390
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:18,312
What are you doing around here?

391
00:30:19,263 --> 00:30:21,411
I’m here to do a reading for my regular client.

392
00:30:27,601 --> 00:30:29,241
You probably think it’s silly, don’t you?

393
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:32,582
I can’t help it.

394
00:30:32,777 --> 00:30:34,257
I don’t really believe in that stuff.

395
00:30:35,497 --> 00:30:37,405
You’re dealing with a love issue.

396
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,204
You could tell just by looking at my face?

397
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:44,666
No.

398
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:46,380
You bought two congees

399
00:30:46,405 --> 00:30:48,885
from a place far from home or workplace.

400
00:30:49,011 --> 00:30:50,822
So, I’m guessing your loved one lives nearby.

401
00:30:51,071 --> 00:30:52,915
But they didn’t come with you,

402
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,910
which means you two are probably
having some kind of conflict.

403
00:30:56,174 --> 00:30:57,174
You’re spot on.

404
00:30:57,592 --> 00:31:00,312
Or maybe you're just really good at reading people.

405
00:31:00,832 --> 00:31:04,299
I think I need to make some time
to get my fortune told by you.

406
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,066
Your congee is ready.

407
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
Yes, sir.

408
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:14,780
How much?

409
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:15,829
40.

410
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:16,939
40.

411
00:31:18,402 --> 00:31:19,549
Thank you.

412
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:24,383
Here’s for your congee.

413
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,557
You can pay me later with
my fortune-telling service.

414
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,170
But this time,

415
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:33,971
you must take my card, Captain.

416
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:44,241
Will you excuse me?

417
00:31:55,611 --> 00:31:56,611
What is this?

418
00:31:57,197 --> 00:31:58,197
I’m writing a novel.

419
00:32:01,494 --> 00:32:04,814
If you don’t want to write a short story
for the contest like the teacher suggested,

420
00:32:04,942 --> 00:32:06,712
why not try writing a novel instead?

421
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,110
People always seem to love novels at book fairs.

422
00:32:09,651 --> 00:32:10,909
I’m not writing anything.

423
00:32:11,466 --> 00:32:12,604
Why not?

424
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,453
I know you enjoy writing in your diary.

425
00:32:14,742 --> 00:32:16,962
You’re clearly into it. You should keep at it.

426
00:32:20,082 --> 00:32:21,506
It’s none of your business.

427
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,321
After May mentioned that
she liked reading novels,

428
00:32:25,838 --> 00:32:27,648
I stayed up all night writing one.

429
00:32:27,675 --> 00:32:30,505
Damn, I used to think I’d never write again.

430
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:33,573
Aren’t you confused anymore?

431
00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:35,976
Please.

432
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:39,512
Who could figure things out that fast?

433
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:44,774
I have no idea why I like her,

434
00:32:47,077 --> 00:32:49,908
but there’s no reason not to do what makes me happy

435
00:32:49,922 --> 00:32:51,714
and what’s best for me, right?

436
00:32:53,266 --> 00:32:54,546
So, you started writing a novel.

437
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:56,379
Yeah.

438
00:32:57,314 --> 00:32:59,278
Can you read it and tell me if it’s any good?

439
00:33:00,438 --> 00:33:03,577
If it is, I’ll read it to her.

440
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:11,979
I’m not reading it.

441
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:13,122
What?

442
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:15,622
Why not? It’s just a small favor.

443
00:33:18,632 --> 00:33:19,930
If you’re going to like girls,

444
00:33:23,145 --> 00:33:24,405
why can’t it be me?

445
00:33:38,592 --> 00:33:40,404
You’re still thinking that way?

446
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:47,056
You knew?

447
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:52,965
You changed when I was with Kosol.

448
00:33:53,804 --> 00:33:54,804
That’s how I knew.

449
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,030
Right.

450
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:11,022
I wasn’t okay with you being with a guy,

451
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:18,912
but at least I knew I had no chance with you.

452
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:25,576
But what is this now?

453
00:34:26,157 --> 00:34:27,754
You suddenly told me

454
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,982
you felt something for that woman.

455
00:34:32,967 --> 00:34:33,967
Why?

456
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,100
What am I supposed to do?

457
00:34:38,573 --> 00:34:40,773
I’ve had feelings for you, Ai.

458
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:43,183
I’ve always had feelings for you.

459
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,413
If you’re going to like girls,

460
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:53,007
can it be me instead?

461
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:04,514
It’s not that you have no chance
because I like guys or girls.

462
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,105
You have no chance because

463
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:15,798
I don’t feel that way about you, Pang.

464
00:35:27,093 --> 00:35:28,305
You’re with Pim.

465
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,420
Ai...

466
00:35:44,771 --> 00:35:47,170
Actually, May should’ve been
the first person to read this.

467
00:35:49,419 --> 00:35:51,115
I wrote it because of her.

468
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:35,545
(May, I’ll be there soon.)

469
00:36:35,808 --> 00:36:36,808
(Can I get you anything?)

470
00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:40,188
Sorry, Oom.

471
00:36:41,048 --> 00:36:42,968
I have an urgent meeting with the council today.

472
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:44,622
(I’ll see you tomorrow.)

473
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,065
The blood pudding soup,
can I get two instead of three?

474
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:53,462
Ah…

475
00:36:53,942 --> 00:36:54,942
Sure thing.

476
00:36:58,837 --> 00:37:00,805
Can’t wait to see you tomorrow.

477
00:37:13,448 --> 00:37:17,531
Are you sure it was Oaboom’s ex who hurt you?

478
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:19,614
I’m not sure.

479
00:37:19,825 --> 00:37:20,825
What?

480
00:37:21,534 --> 00:37:23,011
Exactly.

481
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:25,308
That’s why I need your help to look into it.

482
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,617
I don’t want just theories.

483
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,685
I need evidence.

484
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,616
What if it was him?

485
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,160
What are you going to do then?

486
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:46,490
2023

487
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:50,910
Witness, did you state that the defendant
intended to run over the plaintiff,

488
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,460
and that, following the incident,

489
00:37:53,429 --> 00:37:55,109
the defendant attempted to flee the scene?

490
00:37:55,388 --> 00:37:56,388
Yes, I did.

491
00:37:57,425 --> 00:37:59,225
How did you know the defendant tried to flee?

492
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,422
I saw him trying to get out of the car

493
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,874
and he suffered many setbacks.

494
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,570
But he couldn’t escape in the end.

495
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,706
He couldn’t escape?

496
00:38:12,705 --> 00:38:13,497
That is correct.

497
00:38:13,721 --> 00:38:15,817
He staggered, fell,

498
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,931
and was unable to rise.

499
00:38:19,622 --> 00:38:20,714
What caused him to fall?

500
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:23,505
I don’t know.

501
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,108
I was watching him and saw

502
00:38:26,481 --> 00:38:29,114
he was trying to get to his feet but he couldn’t.

503
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,213
As the sole eyewitness that night,

504
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,330
may I ask that you consider carefully

505
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:40,168
what could possibly have
caused those demeanors of his?

506
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,225
He was probably drunk.

507
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:48,645
Drunk?

508
00:38:55,622 --> 00:38:57,622
I managed to avoid the blood alcohol content test,

509
00:38:58,028 --> 00:38:59,682
but you made me admit I was drunk.

510
00:39:06,725 --> 00:39:08,805
Or do you want to be imprisoned
for attempted murder?

511
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,700
Are you that dumb?

512
00:39:11,945 --> 00:39:13,250
You managed to avoid the test,

513
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,950
but didn’t manage to avoid
getting caught on camera

514
00:39:16,374 --> 00:39:17,614
when you chased after that guy.

515
00:39:20,878 --> 00:39:21,878
So…

516
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,270
what do you want me to do?

517
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,204
I’ll turn this case into...

518
00:39:37,302 --> 00:39:39,506
driving under the influence causing bodily harm.

519
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,410
Objection, Your Honor.

520
00:39:41,774 --> 00:39:42,774
Yes?

521
00:39:43,493 --> 00:39:45,921
The defendant’s counselor
is asking leading questions,

522
00:39:45,943 --> 00:39:47,328
trying to get the plaintiff’s witness
to say the defendant was drunk

523
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:48,792
in order to minimize the punishment.

524
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,840
May I speak?

525
00:39:49,925 --> 00:39:51,165
Yes, the defendant’s counselor.

526
00:39:51,705 --> 00:39:55,103
Mentioning the punishment could make
the witness feel biased while giving testimony.

527
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:59,979
This court is a place of truth and fairness.

528
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:04,777
We shouldn’t introduce anything that might
cloud the truth from the witness, should we?

529
00:40:09,518 --> 00:40:11,155
Objection overruled.

530
00:40:12,605 --> 00:40:15,007
The defendant’s counselor, please continue.

531
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,000
We all took an oath to
speak the truth before this court.

532
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,005
Witness, can you tell us again

533
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:31,173
if you smelled alcohol

534
00:40:32,028 --> 00:40:33,580
when you approached the defendant?

535
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,379
You’re aware of what you’re doing, aren’t you?

536
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,410
I’m always aware...

537
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,663
of what I’m doing.

538
00:40:55,976 --> 00:40:58,405
You’re a very competent attorney.

539
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,330
METHEE: WIN THIS CASE AND I’LL
LEAVE YOU AND THAT WOMAN ALONE.

540
00:41:55,634 --> 00:41:57,711
I’ll have my people stop following that woman.

541
00:42:00,623 --> 00:42:03,580
And I’ll turn a blind eye to
your homosexual behavior.

542
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,056
Eat more, honey.

543
00:42:07,223 --> 00:42:09,383
- I’ve got dessert—
- Do whatever you want from now on.

544
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:12,309
Just don’t make it so obvious.

545
00:42:13,462 --> 00:42:14,462
Remember,

546
00:42:15,435 --> 00:42:17,478
people still know you’re my daughter.

547
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,980
My attorney fee for this case.

548
00:42:36,438 --> 00:42:37,478
Why did you give it to me?

549
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,475
Think of it as the price of my freedom.

550
00:42:44,112 --> 00:42:46,271
Your freedom costs so little, huh?

551
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,266
That’s just a little extra.

552
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:59,008
I already paid for my freedom

553
00:43:01,244 --> 00:43:03,515
with pride in my profession.

554
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,968
You completely destroyed me.

555
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,565
Is that price enough for me
to finally have true freedom?

556
00:43:14,148 --> 00:43:15,148
May, honey.

557
00:43:22,174 --> 00:43:23,767
I paid you with all my heart.

558
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,016
Right now I just want to...

559
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,213
love someone.

560
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:33,164
I hope you can give me that.

561
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,450
CALLING OABOOM

562
00:43:58,549 --> 00:44:01,400
Oom, I know you landed.

563
00:44:02,183 --> 00:44:03,805
Call me back immediately.

564
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,410
EMERGENCY

565
00:45:26,902 --> 00:45:28,182
Not getting out of the car, huh?

566
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,200
Get out!

567
00:45:32,654 --> 00:45:33,853
I said get out!

568
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,040
‘OABOOM’ CAN NOW BE REACHED…

569
00:45:39,997 --> 00:45:41,106
Not getting out, yeah?

570
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,760
No?

571
00:45:43,188 --> 00:45:44,188
Fine.

572
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,650
Not moving, yeah?

573
00:45:49,177 --> 00:45:50,250
Oom, help!

574
00:45:50,445 --> 00:45:51,506
Oom, help me.

575
00:45:51,524 --> 00:45:52,162
Oom!

576
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:53,109
I told you to get out!

577
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:53,819
Help!

578
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:54,838
Help me!

579
00:45:55,268 --> 00:45:56,268
No?

580
00:45:56,906 --> 00:45:58,508
Oom, help me!

581
00:45:58,851 --> 00:45:59,955
Oom, help me!

582
00:46:02,244 --> 00:46:06,308
Those who do wrong must be punished.

583
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:34,011
(I just understood this feeling
from The Little Prince;)

584
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:36,970
(“If you come at four in the afternoon,

585
00:46:37,742 --> 00:46:41,115
(I'll start being happy by three.”)

586
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,774
(When you told me you liked reading novels,

587
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,377
(I suddenly wanted to write one.)

588
00:47:20,514 --> 00:47:22,008
It’s cheaper online.

589
00:47:22,211 --> 00:47:23,536
That’s an imported good.

590
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,287
No tax is added to it.

591
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:27,429
This one is made locally. Support Thai businesses.

592
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:29,388
Hey.

593
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:30,911
Have you eaten?

594
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:32,971
After the offering ceremony was done,

595
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:35,414
I finished the food too.

596
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:37,374
It might help with Oom’s recovery.

597
00:47:37,447 --> 00:47:38,480
Good.

598
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:40,112
I hope you can do this every day.

599
00:47:40,131 --> 00:47:41,638
It helps your sister to recover faster.

600
00:47:41,662 --> 00:47:42,662
Yes, ma’am.

601
00:47:45,306 --> 00:47:48,900
You still ask Ai to offer food
to the hospital’s shrine?

602
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yes.

603
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:52,669
You should prepare for the worst.

604
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:54,554
Oom’s condition is severe.

605
00:47:56,469 --> 00:47:57,819
I’m not selling you this sponge.

606
00:47:58,878 --> 00:48:00,371
It’s no use for you.

607
00:48:00,851 --> 00:48:02,871
Your mouth is too filthy to be cleaned.

608
00:48:03,657 --> 00:48:04,657
Take back your money.

609
00:48:05,762 --> 00:48:07,176
Why are you so upset?

610
00:48:08,644 --> 00:48:09,912
I was speaking the truth.

611
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:14,558
Where are you going now?

612
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:16,069
And what is that rose for?

613
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,570
Whoa.

614
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:22,348
This rose smells a lot better.

615
00:48:22,485 --> 00:48:23,035
Hey.

616
00:48:23,254 --> 00:48:23,979
You wicked.

617
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,001
Bye now.

618
00:48:56,285 --> 00:48:57,285
Dr. Ton.

619
00:48:57,758 --> 00:48:58,758
Hi.

620
00:48:59,346 --> 00:49:00,346
You came again?

621
00:49:00,868 --> 00:49:02,560
May shooed you away last time.

622
00:49:03,558 --> 00:49:05,109
I brought a guest to visit her.

623
00:49:05,562 --> 00:49:06,562
There.

624
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,472
I brought you flowers. Cute, huh?

625
00:49:16,702 --> 00:49:18,564
There are roses, the ones you like.

626
00:49:19,865 --> 00:49:21,928
And a little cherry tree here.

627
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,259
It smells so good. Sniff it.

628
00:49:27,284 --> 00:49:28,924
Please. You’re never allergic to flowers.

629
00:49:29,115 --> 00:49:30,376
Come here.

630
00:49:35,494 --> 00:49:36,494
Who is she?

631
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,475
Her ex.

632
00:49:41,457 --> 00:49:43,457
Her first girlfriend,
the one she can never forget.

633
00:49:44,757 --> 00:49:46,416
A "favorite ex," if you will.

634
00:50:10,213 --> 00:50:11,213
You guys hungry?

635
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,183
Should we order something?

636
00:50:12,232 --> 00:50:13,705
We should order a lot.

637
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:14,965
Let’s get everything you want, May.

638
00:50:14,983 --> 00:50:15,927
Bring back our memories.

639
00:50:15,943 --> 00:50:16,943
Don’t order it.

640
00:50:17,051 --> 00:50:18,917
I know a good restaurant nearby.

641
00:50:19,274 --> 00:50:20,274
I’ll go buy it for you.

642
00:50:20,949 --> 00:50:21,949
You like novels,

643
00:50:22,428 --> 00:50:23,614
so I’m writing one.

644
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:26,811
I will reward you

645
00:50:27,303 --> 00:50:28,928
for each chapter you finish.

646
00:50:31,045 --> 00:50:32,045
May!

647
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:33,774
Sorry, I can’t see.
