1
00:00:00,448 --> 00:00:01,917
You made me realize that

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,813
everyone can be at their most beautiful

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,471
in the way they are and choose to live.

4
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:13,183
The one I love…

5
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:14,591
is Ai-oon.

6
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,060
Any news?

7
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:50,078
May.

8
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,654
Try to calm down, okay?

9
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,106
And don’t blame yourself.

10
00:01:10,877 --> 00:01:11,877
Paul is dead.

11
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:30,520
What about Oom?

12
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:33,642
Still in intensive care.

13
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:39,660
This is not your fault, May.

14
00:01:41,037 --> 00:01:42,505
No one wanted this to happen.

15
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:52,979
Right.

16
00:01:57,161 --> 00:01:58,779
It never should’ve happened.

17
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,630
She’s out of the woods now,

18
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:18,311
but still unconscious.

19
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,040
She might be going into a vegetative state.

20
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:23,875
Ms. May.

21
00:02:24,552 --> 00:02:25,574
Ms. Oom is here.

22
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,020
Oom?

23
00:02:29,637 --> 00:02:30,637
Yes, ma’am.

24
00:02:30,814 --> 00:02:31,814
She’s out front.

25
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:34,041
Should I tell her to wait in the reading room?

26
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,306
But Oom is sick.

27
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:40,767
Doesn’t look like it.

28
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:42,551
She seems healthy.

29
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,905
Her demeanors are strange though.

30
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:46,122
She’s quite different.

31
00:02:53,094 --> 00:02:56,576
(Are you the real Oaboom that I know?)

32
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,134
Please let her in.

33
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:01,505
Yes, ma’am.

34
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:15,511
May?

35
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:31,910
(Finally, I’ve met the one I truly love.)

36
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:33,914
(Ai-oon.)

37
00:03:34,392 --> 00:03:35,728
It’s really you.

38
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,160
OABOOM INGSAMAK

39
00:05:10,922 --> 00:05:12,416
We’ve arrived at Ploy’s restaurant.

40
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,470
Ready?

41
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:16,878
Let me call Ton and let him know.

42
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:18,814
Sure.

43
00:05:36,155 --> 00:05:37,210
Your phone is dead.

44
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:39,022
You can use mine.

45
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:40,517
No, it’s fine.

46
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:43,180
It’s nothing important.

47
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:45,146
Let’s get inside.

48
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:47,662
Okay.

49
00:05:47,832 --> 00:05:49,106
Let me get the door for you.

50
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:51,608
Oom.

51
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,325
Can you please always stay by my side?

52
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,912
I’ve never once thought of leaving you.

53
00:06:07,462 --> 00:06:09,014
If that’s truly what you think,

54
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:10,709
it’d make me so happy.

55
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:15,808
And if you truly want me by your side forever,

56
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:18,718
that would make me just as happy.

57
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:53,536
Shit!

58
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:02,552
I’m sorry.

59
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,300
Should we continue?

60
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,890
We can’t.

61
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
Or it will get escalated.

62
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,731
Let’s continue tonight.

63
00:07:20,604 --> 00:07:21,706
Now take me inside.

64
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,170
Okay.

65
00:07:26,494 --> 00:07:27,494
Let’s go.

66
00:07:29,832 --> 00:07:30,920
We’re here, May.

67
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,274
The layout is just like the one I took you to before.

68
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:36,997
Don’t worry.

69
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,008
It’s not the place I’m worried about.

70
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:44,528
It’s the people.

71
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:54,522
My phone.

72
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:57,539
Did you leave it in the car?

73
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:00,272
Mm.

74
00:08:01,428 --> 00:08:02,428
May.

75
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:04,029
Ploy.

76
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,650
Then…

77
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:11,355
you can go get it, Oom.

78
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:13,234
I’ll go inside with Ploy.

79
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,511
I’ll be right back.

80
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:19,616
Come on.

81
00:08:20,004 --> 00:08:21,004
Let’s get inside.

82
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:34,134
Guys, our it girl has arrived.

83
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:35,416
May.

84
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:36,635
May, hello.

85
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Come sit here.

86
00:08:38,622 --> 00:08:40,069
Today is the soft opening.

87
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,982
It’s just me, Ann, and Franc.

88
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:44,056
This way, tomorrow’s official opening will be smoother for you.

89
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,469
- Um. - You’ve reached your chair.

90
00:08:54,712 --> 00:08:58,112
So, this is why you invited us to the soft opening.

91
00:08:58,737 --> 00:09:01,508
You’re doing it for May, I see.

92
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,505
You really care about her.

93
00:09:04,663 --> 00:09:06,807
Are we seeing a love rekindled here?

94
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:10,505
No.

95
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:12,754
I have a girlfriend.

96
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,675
May, I’m here.

97
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,331
Oom.

98
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:22,635
Sorry, I took so long to find it.

99
00:09:23,216 --> 00:09:24,216
It’s totally fine, Oom.

100
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,622
Guys, this is Oom, my girlfriend.

101
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:48,100
- Cheers. - Cheers.

102
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,703
Congrats, Ploy.

103
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:52,022
Thank you.

104
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,557
You’re so great, Ploy.

105
00:09:56,177 --> 00:09:57,580
You’ve made your dream come true.

106
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,776
I may be great now,

107
00:09:58,862 --> 00:10:00,908
but you’ve always been greater than any of us.

108
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,530
You started your own company before anyone else, Ms. Attorney May.

109
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:06,804
What a shame.

110
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,912
That incident shouldn’t have happened to you.

111
00:10:09,296 --> 00:10:12,625
A competent girl lost her sight because of a stupid circumstance.

112
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:14,900
Life is so unfair.

113
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:17,266
True.

114
00:10:17,936 --> 00:10:19,534
We’re here for you, May.

115
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:21,911
Such a pity.

116
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,675
Don’t pity her.

117
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:27,671
She’s blind, but she has enough money to last her whole life.

118
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:29,577
Pity yourselves.

119
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:31,179
You’re not making as much as she is.

120
00:10:33,373 --> 00:10:34,779
I think I’ll pass.

121
00:10:36,588 --> 00:10:39,031
Making money isn’t necessary for me.

122
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,478
I have my darling to take care of that.

123
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,109
Gosh. Flexing much?

124
00:10:44,539 --> 00:10:46,739
Easy for you to say, married to a billionaire white man,

125
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:48,205
Mrs. Housewife.

126
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,690
Well, if you want to be a glamorous housewife like me,

127
00:10:53,477 --> 00:10:55,321
find yourself a rich hubby.

128
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:02,374
You can’t always rely on others.

129
00:11:05,525 --> 00:11:07,114
I’ve handled many divorce cases.

130
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:11,219
Most wives whose husbands left…

131
00:11:13,097 --> 00:11:14,226
were housewives.

132
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,620
Women like us,

133
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:23,066
if we want to be rich and glamorous,

134
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,678
must stand on our own two feet,

135
00:11:26,762 --> 00:11:28,074
not rely on anyone else.

136
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,380
Because if the day comes when we can’t rely on them anymore,

137
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,170
we’ll be left with nothing.

138
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:39,663
Right.

139
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,875
I get your point, May.

140
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:44,900
You’re competent,

141
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:46,312
strong,

142
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:47,983
and financially independent.

143
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:50,331
You don’t need to rely on your girlfriend.

144
00:11:51,191 --> 00:11:53,191
I bet your girlfriend is just as competent as you.

145
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:55,465
What do you do for a living?

146
00:11:56,312 --> 00:11:57,312
I’m a delivery rider

147
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,340
who is becoming a novel writer.

148
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:04,272
I’ve never spent May’s money though.

149
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,900
Is this what you wanted to know?

150
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:13,324
No. I was just asking.

151
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,112
But I heard this job doesn’t pay much, right?

152
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:20,219
Can you even make ends meet?

153
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:22,936
Yes, I can.

154
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,110
Because I don’t care for being glamorous.

155
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:43,247
Let’s eat.

156
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:54,671
Blind or not, she’s still so cocky.

157
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:56,871
May just never changes.

158
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:00,971
I sympathized with her,

159
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:04,509
but there she was, being snobbish

160
00:13:04,786 --> 00:13:05,971
and looking down on me.

161
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:09,413
She can't even see.

162
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:10,970
What an ego.

163
00:13:12,234 --> 00:13:14,616
She thinks she’s rich and untouchable.

164
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:17,008
No one can bring her down.

165
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,376
I only yielded because of the connection.

166
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:25,370
If I ever end up in court, she could be useful.

167
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,570
I need to maintain the friendship.

168
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:29,844
With the beef there,

169
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,160
are you still inviting her on the Europe trip?

170
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:33,771
Of course.

171
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:35,828
It’s a nice courtesy to ask.

172
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,933
But she won’t go anyway.

173
00:13:38,346 --> 00:13:40,311
Why would she, when she can’t even see?

174
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,770
True.

175
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,167
Talking shit behind your friend’s back.

176
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,134
So much for true friendship, huh?

177
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,808
Are you okay, May?

178
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,773
They’ve been gone for so long.

179
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:20,011
Ploy, please take me there.

180
00:14:25,622 --> 00:14:26,622
Come on.

181
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,958
You guys put on an act when she’s around.

182
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:39,314
Will you stop faking it?

183
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:42,077
Faking what?

184
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:44,374
Wow, you have the nerve to ask.

185
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,294
I heard what you said...

186
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:46,309
Oom.

187
00:14:53,682 --> 00:14:54,682
What’s going on?

188
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,960
Your friends talked shit about you behind your back.

189
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:00,951
They said you’re cocky.

190
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,204
They only befriend you for the connections.

191
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,710
Why don’t you tell that to her face instead of gossiping behind her back?

192
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:08,374
Say it!

193
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:09,413
Come on.

194
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:10,402
What do you want me to say?

195
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,902
Why don’t you say anything? Come on.

196
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:13,019
- I’m not saying anything. - Say it.

197
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:14,028
Oops.

198
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:19,020
Ms. Ploy, is everything okay here?

199
00:15:20,162 --> 00:15:21,028
It is.

200
00:15:21,106 --> 00:15:22,106
You guys can leave.

201
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,321
Yes, ma’am.

202
00:15:25,143 --> 00:15:29,168
It’s my fault for inviting people who shouldn’t have been invited.

203
00:15:30,604 --> 00:15:31,604
It’s not my fault, Ploy.

204
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,616
It was May’s girlfriend who started the fight.

205
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:37,164
Wow, you’re so addicted to faking.

206
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,580
You knocked that thing down yourself.

207
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:40,368
Stop being a hypocrite...

208
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:41,388
Oom.

209
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:43,367
Stop it.

210
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:49,819
I’m sorry, Ploy,

211
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:52,106
for this chaos.

212
00:15:58,527 --> 00:15:59,527
Oom.

213
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:07,057
I’m here.

214
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:08,911
Let’s talk outside.

215
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:29,835
May,

216
00:16:30,512 --> 00:16:33,315
why are you leaving when those two insulted you so much?

217
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:35,208
I don’t get it.

218
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:41,949
May.

219
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:47,005
Why are you acting like you don’t care about what I told you?

220
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:50,626
Didn’t you believe me when I said

221
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:52,426
your friends were talking behind your back?

222
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:55,845
I did.

223
00:16:57,668 --> 00:16:59,219
Then why didn’t you yell back?

224
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,205
I came to congratulate Ploy.

225
00:17:03,382 --> 00:17:06,102
If I let a mess happen at her restaurant that hasn’t even opened yet,

226
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:07,674
how would she feel?

227
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,240
You care about Ploy’s feelings,

228
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,259
but I care about yours.

229
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:19,350
I can’t just stand by and listen to them talk shit about you without feeling anything.

230
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,140
Don’t you think…

231
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:29,028
what they said has some truth to it?

232
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,561
Why else would two people

233
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:38,911
turn on one person if it wasn’t true at all?

234
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,137
Stop taking my side, Oom.

235
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:48,142
I’m not as good a person as you think.

236
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,830
I don’t care if a hundred people condemn you.

237
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,687
You’re still the best person for me.

238
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:03,167
Wait here. I’ll be right back.

239
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,810
DR. TON

240
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,911
Wow, it took forever to reach you.

241
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:27,891
I almost filed a missing person report.

242
00:18:28,137 --> 00:18:29,202
Don’t be so dramatic.

243
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:30,819
What’s going on?

244
00:18:31,432 --> 00:18:32,432
(Are you alone?)

245
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,220
Yes.

246
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,470
Why?

247
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:36,905
Did you find out anything?

248
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:38,933
(Don’t panic, alright?)

249
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,173
Don’t tell her that you know she’s Ai-oon.

250
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:45,176
(Because…)

251
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,167
(Kosol really was the one who hurt you.)

252
00:18:52,361 --> 00:18:55,518
He did it out of revenge

253
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:58,306
because you represented Batman, the guy who hit Ben with the car.

254
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:03,905
(Kosol, Ben, and Ai-oon, they’re all friends.)

255
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,466
May.

256
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:19,105
Open the door for me.

257
00:19:24,816 --> 00:19:25,816
May!

258
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:32,983
May.

259
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:34,508
What happened?

260
00:19:34,524 --> 00:19:35,604
Why did you lock the doors?

261
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:37,408
What if you couldn’t unlock them?

262
00:19:39,786 --> 00:19:40,911
Of course I could.

263
00:19:41,885 --> 00:19:42,885
It’s my car.

264
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,700
Where did you go, though?

265
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:57,118
(I was doing the right thing.)

266
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:01,303
(Those who hurt you must pay the price.)

267
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,420
Do you smell something burning?

268
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:23,463
I thought you told your chef to leave.

269
00:20:24,782 --> 00:20:25,782
You’re right.

270
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,750
It’s like someone’s frying something.

271
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:34,779
Oh, gosh.

272
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:36,093
What’s going on here?

273
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:37,365
What’s that noise?

274
00:20:37,743 --> 00:20:38,755
Who’s frying something?

275
00:20:58,511 --> 00:20:59,805
I’ll always protect you, May.

276
00:21:01,165 --> 00:21:02,165
Protect me how?

277
00:21:03,315 --> 00:21:04,315
That’s a secret.

278
00:21:04,734 --> 00:21:05,974
Should we head back to Bangkok?

279
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,620
No, Miss.

280
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:09,097
We stick to the plan.

281
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:10,579
We’ll check into a hotel.

282
00:21:11,388 --> 00:21:12,619
The grand opening is tomorrow.

283
00:21:13,478 --> 00:21:14,878
I’ll be there to congratulate Ploy.

284
00:21:16,137 --> 00:21:17,137
And you…

285
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:18,918
must come with me.

286
00:21:41,305 --> 00:21:43,607
May, you wait on the couch for now.

287
00:22:03,466 --> 00:22:04,986
It’s not too late to change your mind.

288
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,688
I don’t think Ploy wants me there anymore.

289
00:22:08,755 --> 00:22:10,628
And all your friends hate me.

290
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:15,207
(Kosol, Ben, and Ai-oon, they’re all friends.)

291
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:20,241
(Kosol really was the one who hurt you.)

292
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,290
And if your friends hated me,

293
00:22:27,502 --> 00:22:28,602
would you hate me too?

294
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:30,388
Um…

295
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,007
That depends on what you did wrong.

296
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:50,168
Who is it?

297
00:22:55,977 --> 00:22:57,201
We need to talk.

298
00:23:27,651 --> 00:23:29,611
Your girlfriend tried to burn my restaurant down.

299
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,380
Don’t make accusations without evidence, Ploy.

300
00:23:32,794 --> 00:23:33,671
I could sue you for that.

301
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:35,308
Yes, I did it.

302
00:23:37,148 --> 00:23:38,607
Those two went behind May’s back.

303
00:23:39,248 --> 00:23:40,702
I went behind their backs too.

304
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:44,602
Seriously, May?

305
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:46,533
With that logic,

306
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:48,654
if she weren’t your girlfriend,

307
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:49,900
you’d be in so much trouble.

308
00:23:53,697 --> 00:23:54,869
I’d rather be in trouble

309
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,306
than have a close friend who never wanted to stand by me.

310
00:23:59,962 --> 00:24:01,811
You know they badmouthed me,

311
00:24:02,722 --> 00:24:03,915
but you didn’t say a word.

312
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:06,060
What’s your logic then?

313
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:14,269
Okay.

314
00:24:14,681 --> 00:24:15,681
You’re right.

315
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:19,786
But I kept quiet because I didn’t want trouble.

316
00:24:21,604 --> 00:24:24,668
You know our friends are important connections for the restaurant.

317
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:33,703
Fine, I’ll let the fire thing slide.

318
00:24:36,682 --> 00:24:38,708
I still want you to come tomorrow.

319
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,241
I’ll have someone pick you up.

320
00:24:45,782 --> 00:24:47,001
Just you alone.

321
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:02,863
Do you want me to take you...

322
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:03,875
No.

323
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,982
I will show everyone...

324
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:16,404
that you’re not the problem.

325
00:25:24,644 --> 00:25:26,232
What are you going to do?

326
00:25:39,714 --> 00:25:42,110
Ms. Oom is wearing a gold camisole dress.

327
00:25:42,157 --> 00:25:43,157
No. Next.

328
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,367
Ms. Oom is now wearing a black velvet dress.

329
00:25:54,383 --> 00:25:55,577
It’s too basic.

330
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,130
Next.

331
00:25:57,185 --> 00:25:58,320
Come on, May.

332
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,308
This is the fifth dress already.

333
00:26:00,946 --> 00:26:02,602
Yesterday, you did that for me.

334
00:26:03,902 --> 00:26:05,371
Today, I’m doing this for you.

335
00:26:06,317 --> 00:26:09,370
I won’t let anyone look down on my girlfriend.

336
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,221
Bring out the next dress, please.

337
00:26:11,245 --> 00:26:12,245
Yes, ma’am.

338
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,820
How about this one?

339
00:26:16,216 --> 00:26:17,817
It’s a blue dress.

340
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,220
What kind of blue?

341
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,214
It’s blue like…

342
00:26:24,527 --> 00:26:25,527
Like…

343
00:26:30,237 --> 00:26:31,237
It’s…

344
00:26:33,165 --> 00:26:34,712
It’s light blue,

345
00:26:36,285 --> 00:26:37,506
like the sky after the rain,

346
00:26:40,105 --> 00:26:41,869
with a white layered skirt.

347
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,115
It gives off the vibe of…

348
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,112
an elegant princess.

349
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,850
There you go. That’s how you describe things.

350
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Please put it on.

351
00:26:56,937 --> 00:26:57,937
Hey.

352
00:26:58,974 --> 00:27:00,517
Having so much fun, aren’t you?

353
00:27:01,771 --> 00:27:02,971
Let me dress you too.

354
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:05,921
Sure thing.

355
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:09,010
I want to be the most beautiful girl in your eyes.

356
00:27:11,306 --> 00:27:12,306
No problem.

357
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:13,696
You’ll definitely be beautiful.

358
00:27:16,117 --> 00:27:17,117
Wish I could see.

359
00:27:26,016 --> 00:27:27,016
Ahem.

360
00:27:30,653 --> 00:27:32,813
The makeup and hair artists will be here in 10 minutes.

361
00:27:33,805 --> 00:27:34,805
Mm.

362
00:27:34,844 --> 00:27:36,164
Do we really need to go this far?

363
00:27:37,862 --> 00:27:38,862
This is for you, Oom.

364
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,680
It must be nothing less than perfect.

365
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,020
I’m gonna step out and take my grandma’s call.

366
00:28:01,768 --> 00:28:03,579
You always have bad timing, Grandma.

367
00:28:03,696 --> 00:28:04,782
What’s up? Make it quick.

368
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:09,411
(Can you go with Jan to gather Oom’s things at Mr. Paul’s house?)

369
00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:11,522
(I already spoke to Jan about it.)

370
00:28:12,063 --> 00:28:13,909
(Mr. Paul’s family said you could go today.)

371
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:15,580
But I can’t, Grandma.

372
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:17,311
I’m in Korat.

373
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:19,261
Why don’t you go with Jan instead?

374
00:28:19,285 --> 00:28:20,285
No way.

375
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:22,617
I’m not familiar with the place,

376
00:28:22,896 --> 00:28:24,508
and I need to visit Oom at the hospital.

377
00:28:25,091 --> 00:28:27,608
(How about you come back a little earlier?)

378
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:30,305
Grandma! It’s Korat, not the next block.

379
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,910
Here’s what we’ll do.

380
00:28:33,385 --> 00:28:36,509
I'll arrange for someone to go with Jan.

381
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
(Fine.)

382
00:28:41,411 --> 00:28:42,811
This is for Oom or for who exactly?

383
00:28:43,645 --> 00:28:44,765
You already know the answer.

384
00:28:44,925 --> 00:28:45,925
Why even ask?

385
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,510
Do you really think this plan will work?

386
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:56,705
Ai-oon may seem tough on the outside,

387
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,030
but she’s incredibly kind on the inside.

388
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,305
If she sees that I’m not okay,

389
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:06,402
she won’t leave me.

390
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,714
If we truly belong to each other,

391
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,874
even after she knows the truth,

392
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,075
she won’t leave me again.

393
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,011
Tonight, I will make Ai-oon mine.

394
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:30,430
Is this really the best a clever girl like you can come up with?

395
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,823
Wasn’t it you and my dad

396
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,105
who gave me no other choice?

397
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,450
Fair enough.

398
00:29:46,936 --> 00:29:48,613
I’m redeeming myself here, alright?

399
00:30:14,794 --> 00:30:16,405
Thank you for coming with me.

400
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:17,865
Um.

401
00:30:18,164 --> 00:30:20,826
No wonder Grandma Duean didn’t want to come.

402
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,150
This place is so luxurious it makes me feel uneasy.

403
00:30:26,731 --> 00:30:28,385
It’s not the luxury.

404
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:31,122
But the...

405
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,022
lifelessness.

406
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:37,632
When I decorate customers' homes,

407
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:42,469
they usually reflect the aura of their owner.

408
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,019
But this house feels dark and gloomy.

409
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,171
It looks like a bachelor’s place.

410
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:57,958
That’s probably because Oom wasn’t into it.

411
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Wasn’t into it?

412
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:04,976
You mean wasn’t into Paul?

413
00:31:16,071 --> 00:31:17,071
Hey.

414
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,120
Which picture do you like?

415
00:31:20,157 --> 00:31:21,416
I’ll put it in our bedroom.

416
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,715
You choose. I’m fine with anything.

417
00:31:25,762 --> 00:31:27,122
But I’ve been choosing everything.

418
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:30,105
Then please choose one more.

419
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,522
Hello, Grandma.

420
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,960
Can’t remember the title of the soap opera you watched?

421
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,681
Tell me its plot.

422
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,168
Please don’t overthink it.

423
00:31:56,807 --> 00:31:58,777
Oom isn’t into house decorating.

424
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:01,751
More like she isn’t into me.

425
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,983
I know you know...

426
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:09,167
that she doesn’t love me,

427
00:32:13,217 --> 00:32:14,217
but it doesn’t matter.

428
00:32:15,828 --> 00:32:17,007
I love her so much.

429
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,730
I’m gonna make her love me one day.

430
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,400
If I’d known things would turn out like this,

431
00:32:25,616 --> 00:32:29,773
I would’ve told Paul he shouldn’t be spending his last days with someone who didn’t love him.

432
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:33,115
You’re Oom’s friend.

433
00:32:33,877 --> 00:32:34,917
Could you really say that?

434
00:32:37,025 --> 00:32:38,376
Because I’m her friend,

435
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,970
it gives me more reason to say it.

436
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,170
And I would’ve told Oom the same thing too.

437
00:32:51,976 --> 00:32:53,122
Does helping Ai-oon

438
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,918
have anything to do with Oaboom?

439
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,168
I just want to redeem my friend’s sin.

440
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,520
Redeem?

441
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,259
One day, you will understand.

442
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,100
Congratulations, Ploy.

443
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,779
Thank you for coming, Ton.

444
00:33:31,088 --> 00:33:32,088
Hey.

445
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,410
May isn’t here yet?

446
00:33:34,034 --> 00:33:35,034
I don’t know.

447
00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:38,219
Don’t be upset.

448
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,240
Honestly, it’s better this way.

449
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,520
At least she won’t bring the problem with her.

450
00:33:44,597 --> 00:33:45,140
True.

451
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:48,672
Her girlfriend would just downgrade your restaurant if she showed up.

452
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,250
That’s not really for me to decide.

453
00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:53,156
Even if I told her not to bring her girlfriend, she wouldn’t listen.

454
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,180
May is smart.

455
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:57,174
Whatever she decides, she’s already thought it through.

456
00:34:01,922 --> 00:34:02,922
There.

457
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,614
May’s decision is coming.

458
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,330
You might want to take back what you said about Oom downgrading the restaurant.

459
00:35:16,001 --> 00:35:17,841
I don’t think the guests here agree with that.

460
00:35:23,764 --> 00:35:24,802
Congratulations, Ploy.

461
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,040
Your dream restaurant has come to life.

462
00:35:27,736 --> 00:35:28,736
Thank you.

463
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,500
Just make sure your girlfriend doesn’t cause any more trouble.

464
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,480
Oom, I think you have something to say.

465
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,764
You guys might have foul mouths,

466
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,968
but I really went too far yesterday.

467
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,130
I’m sorry.

468
00:35:56,441 --> 00:35:57,441
Glad you know it.

469
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:01,106
Let’s just say I’ll let it slide.

470
00:36:02,054 --> 00:36:03,854
You guys need to realize you're at fault too.

471
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,070
If you still want us to be friends,

472
00:36:07,477 --> 00:36:08,619
you know what to do.

473
00:36:10,325 --> 00:36:11,325
Hey.

474
00:36:12,373 --> 00:36:13,672
Just because you’re a lawyer,

475
00:36:13,865 --> 00:36:15,065
you think you can threaten us?

476
00:36:16,094 --> 00:36:17,094
That’s enough.

477
00:36:17,189 --> 00:36:19,228
No fighting on my opening day.

478
00:36:19,736 --> 00:36:20,925
Just admit you were wrong.

479
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,819
Don’t make me ask you to leave.

480
00:36:23,456 --> 00:36:25,185
Hey. Are you taking May’s side?

481
00:36:25,968 --> 00:36:27,420
I’m taking the side of what’s right.

482
00:36:28,272 --> 00:36:29,668
Now it’s your turn.

483
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,060
Fine.

484
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,877
I’ll do this for the sake of your event.

485
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,720
We’re sorry.

486
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:43,613
Okay then.

487
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:45,714
Enjoy dinner, ladies.

488
00:36:48,493 --> 00:36:49,493
Come on.

489
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,300
That ended faster than I expected.

490
00:36:57,037 --> 00:36:58,037
Of course, it did.

491
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,265
My client is Franc’s husband’s customer,

492
00:37:03,558 --> 00:37:06,065
and my dad is Ann’s father’s boss.

493
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
If they didn’t end it,

494
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:10,574
they’d face the consequences.

495
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,555
They’re not the type to lose out on their benefits.

496
00:37:17,442 --> 00:37:22,214
So, the apology was part of the plan?

497
00:37:23,964 --> 00:37:24,976
This is Metawee,

498
00:37:25,607 --> 00:37:27,133
the smartest student in the class.

499
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,360
Oops.

500
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:57,360
Oom, are you alright?

501
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,490
Not used to heels yet?

502
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,670
I don’t usually wear them much.

503
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,660
It’s okay.

504
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,562
I’ll support you.

505
00:38:09,214 --> 00:38:10,411
You lead me the way.

506
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,527
We can’t be separated tonight.

507
00:38:27,674 --> 00:38:28,674
Jeez!

508
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:33,909
What’s going on, Oom?

509
00:38:35,155 --> 00:38:36,155
The power is out.

510
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,416
My apologies, everyone.

511
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:39,616
I don’t know what happened to the power.

512
00:38:39,921 --> 00:38:41,503
Please stay inside for now.

513
00:38:41,731 --> 00:38:42,731
I’m really sorry.

514
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:49,401
Let’s do this, guys.

515
00:38:49,448 --> 00:38:51,060
Please follow me inside.

516
00:38:51,754 --> 00:38:52,423
Please.

517
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:53,764
This way.

518
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,040
How’s it going, Ploy?

519
00:39:04,164 --> 00:39:05,321
The mechanic said the fuse blew,

520
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:06,945
probably because we used too much power.

521
00:39:07,204 --> 00:39:08,564
It’s going to take a while to fix.

522
00:39:09,228 --> 00:39:10,705
What am I going to do, Ton?

523
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:12,219
Don’t panic, Ploy.

524
00:39:12,428 --> 00:39:13,872
I think your guests understand.

525
00:39:14,871 --> 00:39:16,016
You don’t get it.

526
00:39:16,475 --> 00:39:17,979
This restaurant is my dream.

527
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,590
I don’t want it to turn into a nightmare.

528
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:23,471
Excuse me.

529
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,210
How long do you think it’ll take?

530
00:39:25,502 --> 00:39:26,788
I’ve sent my guys out to get the fuse.

531
00:39:26,802 --> 00:39:28,000
Should be about half an hour.

532
00:39:34,397 --> 00:39:35,557
Let’s go talk to your guests.

533
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,400
I won’t let you face this nightmare alone.

534
00:39:50,379 --> 00:39:51,739
I feel bad for Ploy.

535
00:39:52,238 --> 00:39:53,816
She worked so hard for this event.

536
00:39:54,597 --> 00:39:55,597
Exactly.

537
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,758
If the power doesn’t come back soon,

538
00:39:58,274 --> 00:39:59,585
people will start leaving.

539
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,080
May, are you okay?

540
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:11,053
Totally.

541
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,108
Nobody here is more familiar with darkness than me.

542
00:40:22,429 --> 00:40:23,429
Mom…

543
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:28,468
Can I change my answer?

544
00:40:30,914 --> 00:40:31,918
I’m not okay now.

545
00:40:34,777 --> 00:40:36,171
I’m not because…

546
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:38,869
I can’t help Ploy in any way.

547
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,802
Let’s make the best of this darkness.

548
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,965
Once upon a time,

549
00:41:09,151 --> 00:41:10,477
there was a rabbit

550
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:13,117
who was hurt so badly it went blind.

551
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,955
It lived in the darkness,

552
00:41:17,722 --> 00:41:20,133
its life consumed by fear.

553
00:41:21,893 --> 00:41:23,028
One day,

554
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:28,065
the rabbit encountered a fierce wolf

555
00:41:28,724 --> 00:41:30,213
with enormous fangs.

556
00:41:30,924 --> 00:41:31,924
“Woof!”

557
00:41:33,585 --> 00:41:36,637
Terrified, the rabbit fled as fast as it could.

558
00:41:36,939 --> 00:41:40,161
- “Help me. Help me. Help me, please.” - “Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!”

559
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,835
- “Help me, please.” - “Wait up. Hold on. Woof!”

560
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,902
Then, the rabbit encountered a huge hawk.

561
00:41:50,743 --> 00:41:52,111
“I wanna eat this rabbit.”

562
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,130
“Who are you?”

563
00:41:53,266 --> 00:41:53,976
“Who are you?”

564
00:41:54,103 --> 00:41:56,109
The hawk hovered down, trying to catch the rabbit.

565
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:00,703
- “Leave me alone! Let me go!” - “Just let me eat you. Surrender!”

566
00:42:01,411 --> 00:42:06,308
But then, the wolf appeared and came to the rabbit's rescue.

567
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,748
“Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!”

568
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:13,351
“No! Please don’t hurt me.”

569
00:42:13,493 --> 00:42:14,509
“Spare my life.”

570
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,050
I think these two have saved the day.

571
00:42:20,128 --> 00:42:22,705
Then the rabbit realized

572
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,112
that the wolf meant no harm.

573
00:42:26,594 --> 00:42:28,068
It meant love.

574
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,111
The rabbit decided to open up again.

575
00:42:32,888 --> 00:42:36,410
The two lived happily ever after.

576
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,823
“Thank you, thank you, thank you.”

577
00:42:40,197 --> 00:42:41,610
“Thank you so much.”

578
00:42:41,962 --> 00:42:44,102
“You’re so kind. You’re so kind.”

579
00:42:44,589 --> 00:42:46,102
“You’re very kind.”

580
00:43:02,983 --> 00:43:04,611
And that’s the end.

581
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:22,542
May, the power’s back on.

582
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,800
I’ve never seen this side of May before.

583
00:43:37,472 --> 00:43:40,568
Her girlfriend really brings out the brightest side of her.

584
00:43:52,016 --> 00:43:53,508
If it weren’t for you and May,

585
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:55,927
I would’ve been stuck in this nightmare forever.

586
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,920
Don’t mention it.

587
00:43:58,957 --> 00:43:59,957
It’s no trouble at all.

588
00:44:00,961 --> 00:44:04,305
And I’m sorry for thinking you were the problem.

589
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:08,062
Well, I really did something wrong.

590
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,990
It’s good that May knocked some sense into me and made me apologize.

591
00:44:14,948 --> 00:44:17,214
But what else could I have done?

592
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,247
You’re her first girlfriend.

593
00:44:22,205 --> 00:44:23,205
Oh, please.

594
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:27,411
Back then, I was still hurting from my previous relationship,

595
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,118
and May was there.

596
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:30,970
So, I asked her to be my girlfriend.

597
00:44:32,354 --> 00:44:33,242
We called each other girlfriends,

598
00:44:33,281 --> 00:44:35,317
but we were just friends, really.

599
00:44:37,306 --> 00:44:39,069
May never truly loved anyone.

600
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,500
She couldn’t forget her first love.

601
00:44:44,324 --> 00:44:47,103
Her first love was beautiful,

602
00:44:47,374 --> 00:44:49,903
graceful, and brave.

603
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,075
May just showed everyone

604
00:44:55,219 --> 00:44:57,102
that you are the one she truly loves.

605
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:51,814
(Her first love was beautiful, graceful, and brave.)

606
00:46:20,148 --> 00:46:21,762
Did you bring scented candles too?

607
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:24,702
I saw that your house is full of them,

608
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,819
so I asked Doctor Ton.

609
00:46:27,522 --> 00:46:30,731
He said they not only help you relax,

610
00:46:32,232 --> 00:46:34,709
but their scent and warmth

611
00:46:36,718 --> 00:46:38,238
can give you a sense of direction too.

612
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:50,671
You make me feel like I can see again.

613
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,374
I should be the one thanking you.

614
00:47:10,518 --> 00:47:12,462
I’ve never done anything like this before.

615
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,367
Right, this is my Oom...

616
00:47:33,648 --> 00:47:34,648
beautiful,

617
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:39,050
competent,

618
00:47:42,047 --> 00:47:43,176
and brave.

619
00:48:49,355 --> 00:48:50,355
May.

620
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:55,874
I love you.

621
00:48:59,143 --> 00:49:00,143
I love you too...

622
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,540
May.

623
00:50:13,914 --> 00:50:15,110
Can you tell me…

624
00:50:18,168 --> 00:50:19,414
why you love me?

625
00:50:27,287 --> 00:50:28,466
I love you.

626
00:50:33,314 --> 00:50:34,623
You’re my first love, Oom.

627
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:41,382
I fell in love with you at first sight.

628
00:51:06,398 --> 00:51:07,398
Oom?

629
00:51:08,835 --> 00:51:09,908
I’m sorry, May.

630
00:51:18,725 --> 00:51:20,010
I need some fresh air.

631
00:51:42,931 --> 00:51:44,567
She left the lamp on again.

632
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:50,623
Why doesn’t she learn at all?

633
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,770
The electricity authority won’t be happy about this.

634
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,320
And look at that.

635
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,007
She just leaves everything on.

636
00:52:03,531 --> 00:52:05,314
I can’t with this girl.

637
00:52:06,742 --> 00:52:07,742
Oh, gosh.

638
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:09,968
How do I turn this thing off?

639
00:52:15,441 --> 00:52:16,441
Hm?

640
00:52:20,913 --> 00:52:25,003
OOM, HAVE YOU RECOVERED? HOW COME YOU’RE IN KORAT?
I SAW YOU ON MY FRIEND'S IG.

641
00:52:32,422 --> 00:52:33,813
(I can’t go, Grandma.)

642
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,568
(I’m in Korat.)

643
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,031
Why are you drinking here?

644
00:52:57,392 --> 00:52:58,472
You could get into trouble.

645
00:52:59,081 --> 00:53:00,081
Let it come.

646
00:53:01,389 --> 00:53:02,647
I’ll fight anyone.

647
00:53:03,488 --> 00:53:04,600
But the one in her heart…

648
00:53:04,854 --> 00:53:06,115
how could I fight that?

649
00:53:07,733 --> 00:53:08,933
What on earth happened to you?

650
00:53:11,863 --> 00:53:13,114
Hey, where are you going?

651
00:53:13,155 --> 00:53:14,213
I’m going to fight her.

652
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,813
Give me a time machine.

653
00:53:19,961 --> 00:53:21,573
I’ll travel back and meet May first.

654
00:53:27,201 --> 00:53:28,201
Oh, shit.

655
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,511
Hey! Are you okay?

656
00:53:32,651 --> 00:53:33,651
Gosh!

657
00:53:43,271 --> 00:53:44,315
(What happened?)

658
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:47,211
(You said you’d make Ai-oon yours.)

659
00:53:48,072 --> 00:53:49,503
Seems like she got me wrong.

660
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,703
(Please bring her back to me.)

661
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,968
Do you think it’s so easy?

662
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,540
Look how wasted she is.

663
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,080
Slow down.

664
00:54:16,263 --> 00:54:17,263
Damn.

665
00:54:24,508 --> 00:54:27,002
Jeez, it’s so hot.

666
00:54:31,779 --> 00:54:32,779
Zipper.

667
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:33,469
Zip.

668
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:34,937
Zip it down.

669
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:37,573
Oom.

670
00:54:40,394 --> 00:54:41,394
You can leave now.

671
00:54:44,321 --> 00:54:45,321
May.

672
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:46,589
I’m a doctor.

673
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,321
I’ve seen thousands of naked women.

674
00:54:50,237 --> 00:54:51,637
You don’t need to be so possessive.

675
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,170
I don’t care how many women you’ve seen naked.

676
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,908
You can’t see my girl naked.

677
00:55:06,155 --> 00:55:08,368
Gosh, you’re giving me a headache.

678
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,880
Just call me if you need anything.

679
00:55:18,127 --> 00:55:19,127
Here’s a sponge bath.

680
00:55:22,263 --> 00:55:23,263
I’m taking off now.

681
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,668
It’s hot.

682
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,257
No more.

683
00:56:16,825 --> 00:56:18,377
I don’t want to be Oom anymore.

684
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,400
No.

685
00:56:51,321 --> 00:56:52,321
I know.

686
00:57:00,094 --> 00:57:01,262
I know you’re not Oom.

687
00:57:08,586 --> 00:57:09,680
I also know…

688
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,875
that you love me, Ai.

689
00:57:23,779 --> 00:57:26,202
But do you love me enough to forgive me

690
00:57:31,899 --> 00:57:33,028
if you knew

691
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,271
I was the reason...

692
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,506
someone you loved was dead?

693
00:58:54,019 --> 00:58:55,179
What are you painting?

694
00:58:56,148 --> 00:58:59,368
Some feeling I can’t express with words.

695
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,600
Can you feel it?

696
00:59:02,327 --> 00:59:04,411
Your sight will gradually get better.

697
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,220
I love you, May.

698
00:59:06,733 --> 00:59:07,765
May doesn’t love me.

699
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:09,177
She loves Oom.

700
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:13,358
I met my first love at the Bangkok Planetarium.

701
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:16,211
Back then, you just loved wearing Oom’s uniform to mess with her.

702
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:17,487
Holy shit!
