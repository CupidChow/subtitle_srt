1
00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:01,613
She disguised herself as Oom,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,020
made you fall in love,

3
00:00:03,106 --> 00:00:04,782
and then left you after Oom woke up.

4
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:06,706
I think there’s a reason behind this.

5
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,980
I’m the reason May’s blind.

6
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:11,005
Grandma.

7
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:12,912
I love you, May.

8
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,933
I’m sorry, May.

9
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,583
I’m sorry.

10
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,610
2002

11
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:27,573
Wow. That was far.

12
00:00:32,585 --> 00:00:33,585
You’re awesome.

13
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:36,124
Of course I am—just like Dad.

14
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:37,678
I’m following in his footsteps.

15
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:39,481
I’ll be just as skilled as he is.

16
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,480
Then I’ll be skilled too, just like you.

17
00:00:44,465 --> 00:00:46,945
(Actually, I don’t really want to be as skilled as my sister.)

18
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:51,330
It’s alright, sweetheart.

19
00:00:52,146 --> 00:00:53,601
Grandma’s here.

20
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:54,954
Everything’s going to be okay.

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,866
(I just want to be the little sister my sister loves…)

22
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,668
Grandma, I’m out to play!

23
00:01:14,844 --> 00:01:15,844
You little monkey.

24
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:18,423
Don’t stay out too late, or you’ll get a whipping, Ai.

25
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:20,383
Look at that.

26
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:26,767
Hey, Oom,

27
00:01:28,137 --> 00:01:29,857
Don’t you want to go play with your sister?

28
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:30,921
It’s okay.

29
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,037
I don’t want to get sick again

30
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,869
and end up in the hospital.

31
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:40,029
Well, then.

32
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,990
Here.

33
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,823
You can read instead.

34
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:55,527
Take a look.

35
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:57,515
Here.

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,610
2022

37
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:08,499
What are you up to?

38
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,644
You like reading stories too?

39
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,891
My sister did, so I did too.

40
00:02:23,448 --> 00:02:24,518
But then...

41
00:02:34,582 --> 00:02:35,582
Then she stopped reading,

42
00:02:36,838 --> 00:02:37,838
so I stopped too.

43
00:02:42,392 --> 00:02:44,770
You don’t tell me much about your big sister.

44
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,690
How about introducing us?

45
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:48,469
Nope.

46
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,825
Ai’s popular—everyone loves her.

47
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:53,121
If you saw her and liked her more than me,

48
00:02:53,145 --> 00:02:54,145
what would I do?

49
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:00,762
You’re this adorable.

50
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,260
Who could ever like anyone more?

51
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,900
Then...

52
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:09,948
if there’s a chance, I’ll take you to meet her.

53
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,330
You have no idea how much I want to show you off.

54
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:29,475
(…not someone who keeps getting betrayed over and over.)

55
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:37,315
I’m sorry.

56
00:03:38,324 --> 00:03:40,004
Please take me back to where we came from.

57
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,705
I agreed to take on Batman’s case

58
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,964
in exchange for my dad leaving Oom alone.

59
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,654
But then Oom found out that

60
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:13,471
you were my first love.

61
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:17,820
She started distancing herself from me.

62
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,494
Then I got ambushed.

63
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,819
After I became blind, Oom told me…

64
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:34,500
you really were my first love.

65
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:41,219
At first, I didn’t believe her,

66
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:48,165
so I asked Ton to take me to see you.

67
00:05:49,884 --> 00:05:50,477
Peekaboo!

68
00:05:50,644 --> 00:05:51,761
Goodness, Ai!

69
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,180
Hey, what about the vegetables I asked you to buy?

70
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,354
Did you get them yet?

71
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,164
Oh, I know. Stop complaining.

72
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,951
Complaining makes you look old.

73
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:04,106
And now look—you’re looking old!

74
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,130
I’m heading out.

75
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,484
Make it quick.

76
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,551
Her voice sounds so similar.

77
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:18,930
It’s not just her voice...

78
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:21,002
they look exactly alike.

79
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,900
What about her personality?

80
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,650
How does she look?

81
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:27,374
This one looks more casual.

82
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:29,845
She’s wearing a T-shirt and jeans.

83
00:06:30,586 --> 00:06:31,626
Looking pretty easy-going.

84
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:34,711
(The person you love is Ai-oon,

85
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:36,905
(my twin sister.)

86
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,870
Did you really tell the truth, Oom?

87
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:42,930
May.

88
00:06:48,173 --> 00:06:49,373
Finally, you agreed to see me.

89
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:53,434
How amazing.

90
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:57,800
You’ve switched back to being the same Attorney Metawee so quickly.

91
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:00,362
No.

92
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,416
Nothing is the same.

93
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:04,277
That’s right.

94
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,860
You’re blind now.

95
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,230
Not just me who won’t take you...

96
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:10,897
Ai won’t either.

97
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,090
I doubt that.

98
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:17,702
You made me realize that

99
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,360
Ai-oon is different.

100
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,262
She helped me and told me to fight.

101
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,950
But Oaboom…

102
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,222
left me.

103
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:36,527
Right.

104
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,391
All I can ever be is Ai’s shadow.

105
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,779
Have we officially broken up?

106
00:07:55,884 --> 00:07:58,167
If breaking up means you get to go back to Ai,

107
00:08:00,152 --> 00:08:01,152
then no way.

108
00:08:04,936 --> 00:08:06,416
But if you really want to go see her,

109
00:08:07,685 --> 00:08:09,896
think about who she’ll choose:

110
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:13,502
a blind attorney

111
00:08:15,435 --> 00:08:17,518
who caused her friend’s mom to commit suicide

112
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,554
and her only sibling.

113
00:08:26,302 --> 00:08:27,441
After that,

114
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:32,900
I learned that Oom was seeing Paul,

115
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,610
the son of the owner of an airline company.

116
00:08:44,204 --> 00:08:46,666
I love Oom, but she still loves you.

117
00:08:48,585 --> 00:08:49,988
I just want to know that...

118
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,200
I did something that hurt her.

119
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,659
Oom doesn’t love me.

120
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,918
She just wants to punish me

121
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,210
by refusing to break up.

122
00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:10,899
I will love her so much

123
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:13,979
that she can forgive you.

124
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:19,524
(I lived on,

125
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,715
(waiting for the day she’d break up with me and set me free.)

126
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,180
Ton.

127
00:09:29,471 --> 00:09:29,974
Hm?

128
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:31,462
Can you share your Wi-Fi with me?

129
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:33,401
I lost my SIM card at the airport.

130
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,373
Jeez.

131
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:39,106
A disputed, remote area with no internet...

132
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,780
did you really need to go?

133
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,066
The council asked me to be there.

134
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,360
Don’t give so much to others that you forget yourself.

135
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,730
Your karma was redeemed the moment you reflected on yourself back then.

136
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,428
Stop overthinking it.

137
00:09:56,948 --> 00:09:58,521
There, the internet is shared.

138
00:10:06,493 --> 00:10:07,933
I think I forgot the parking ticket.

139
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:09,499
I’ll go grab it.

140
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,090
Be right back.

141
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,300
(May, it’s Oom. Can you call me back?)

142
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:31,813
(The number you’ve dialed cannot be connected at this moment…)

143
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:42,084
Mr. Paul,

144
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,742
I received a message from Oom.

145
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,330
Is she okay?

146
00:10:47,577 --> 00:10:49,176
(How come May has your number, Paul?)

147
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,201
(I just wanted to let you know that

148
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,463
(I asked Ai to go break up with you.)

149
00:10:58,832 --> 00:10:59,896
(If she goes,

150
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:04,302
(she’ll learn we’re no longer together.)

151
00:11:05,962 --> 00:11:07,242
(And even if she doesn’t go,

152
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,800
you should know that

153
00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:15,251
(no matter who you're with from now on, I want nothing to do with it.)

154
00:11:23,543 --> 00:11:25,020
Oom finally let me go, Ton.

155
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,903
And she asked Ai to come see me.

156
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,964
The ball is in your court now.

157
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:40,845
And then you came.

158
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,819
I couldn’t see at the time,

159
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,348
so I didn’t know how you looked at me...

160
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:59,300
with pity or with disdain.

161
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:05,019
All I had left was my final bet,

162
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:11,509
your kiss.

163
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,148
That’s why you always gave me long explanations

164
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,469
and agreed with me on many things.

165
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:45,925
There I was, thinking I was wearing a smooth disguise.

166
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,034
The more time we spent together,

167
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,869
the more confident I became

168
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,590
that it was you, Ai.

169
00:13:00,608 --> 00:13:01,862
You took care of me.

170
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,216
You protected me.

171
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:09,711
You made me feel important.

172
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,357
You made me feel loved.

173
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:18,277
You also made me feel capable.

174
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,385
You gave me the courage to write a novel,

175
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,367
and the courage to do so many things.

176
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,428
You made me feel like,

177
00:13:36,219 --> 00:13:40,462
no matter what failures I faced or how hard life got,

178
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:44,277
you’d always be there by my side.

179
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,451
I could hardly breathe…

180
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,386
the day I finally saw things clearly

181
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,373
and realized you were gone,

182
00:14:11,152 --> 00:14:13,022
giving everything we had to Oom.

183
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,475
Because I felt guilty.

184
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What happened between us,

185
00:14:23,952 --> 00:14:25,514
we were both responsible for.

186
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,400
I only came to my senses

187
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,103
when you said that

188
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,336
if we’d known we’d fall in love,

189
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,425
we wouldn’t have hurt each other.

190
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,543
We can’t fix the past.

191
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,365
So, from now on,

192
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,300
can you promise me

193
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:10,512
that we’ll love each other

194
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,257
without bringing each other pain?

195
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:32,509
I promise.

196
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,530
HENG CHAROEN

197
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:23,431
Where have you been, Ai?

198
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,500
Just around, delivering stuff.

199
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,017
I called May today,

200
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:41,173
but she didn’t pick up at all.

201
00:16:44,814 --> 00:16:46,395
She must be busy these days.

202
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,647
I told you,

203
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:50,949
she’s been working a lot on charity projects.

204
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,457
Is there anything else between you and May that you haven’t told me?

205
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:02,902
How will you handle things with Oom going forward?

206
00:17:05,832 --> 00:17:07,397
I can’t tell her yet.

207
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,275
Otherwise, she’d be devastated.

208
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,715
I don’t want to cause Oom any more heartache either.

209
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,669
All we can do is wait.

210
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:24,737
Mmm.

211
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:27,517
Until Oom recovers.

212
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:32,500
Until Oom recovers.

213
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:43,068
Nothing.

214
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:45,225
Get some sleep.

215
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,230
You’ve just been discharged. You don’t wanna get sick again.

216
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:54,998
What’s with you now?

217
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,943
I might not remember everything,

218
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:11,668
but one thing I do know is that,

219
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:15,131
in the moment of life and death,

220
00:18:18,204 --> 00:18:23,096
my biggest regret was never telling you

221
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,339
that I never hated you.

222
00:18:28,948 --> 00:18:30,509
I know that, alright.

223
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,920
No need for all the touching words.

224
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:35,980
And I’m sorry

225
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:39,842
for being the reason our parents are dead.

226
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:41,256
Come on, Oom.

227
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:43,001
It’s not your fault.

228
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,494
I’m not good at anything other than school.

229
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,004
That’s why you had to drop out

230
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:55,182
and help Grandma work to support me.

231
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,856
I just want to go back to being the sister you love.

232
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,302
You’ve always been that, Oaboom.

233
00:19:16,718 --> 00:19:17,718
Don’t overthink it.

234
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,065
What is this place?

235
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,110
You said you wanted to bring back the memories you lost.

236
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:49,551
Everything is here.

237
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:52,300
This place holds the memories of you

238
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:55,263
and someone who was so important to you.

239
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:36,400
The one who loved you the most was Paul.

240
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,530
Mom,

241
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,367
my friends and I brought someone to meet you today.

242
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:27,574
This is May, my girlfriend.

243
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,790
She’s the attorney representing the guy who hit Ben with the car.

244
00:21:42,282 --> 00:21:43,468
I’m sorry, ma’am.

245
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:49,628
I would like your pardon.

246
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,805
I truly hope you can forgive me.

247
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:00,400
My mom was a nice lady

248
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,740
and she loved Ai like her own.

249
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:05,900
I’m sure she’d forgive anyone Ai loves.

250
00:22:07,838 --> 00:22:08,838
Right, Mom?

251
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,303
All is settled now.

252
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,810
When do you want me to turn myself in?

253
00:23:02,152 --> 00:23:03,152
Well…

254
00:23:04,878 --> 00:23:06,097
Why didn’t you do it sooner?

255
00:23:09,802 --> 00:23:11,398
Besides being a coward,

256
00:23:11,777 --> 00:23:12,937
I was also worried about Ben.

257
00:23:13,551 --> 00:23:15,001
But he’s in good hands with you now.

258
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,059
If you were in prison,

259
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:25,167
Ai would have to go visit you.

260
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:26,699
No.

261
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,325
I don’t want to trouble my girlfriend.

262
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:32,287
Are you saying you’ll let me off the hook?

263
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,182
I’ll start a foundation

264
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,761
that advocates for the rights of those with disabilities,

265
00:23:41,402 --> 00:23:42,402
fosters resilience,

266
00:23:43,398 --> 00:23:46,642
and helps them achieve independent living.

267
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:50,602
Come to work with me.

268
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:54,265
If you want to stop feeling guilty,

269
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:57,995
work hard and put all your effort into it.

270
00:24:00,311 --> 00:24:02,162
If you could take away someone's sight,

271
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:07,401
you can help give many others a brighter life.

272
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:33,518
I came here to participate in a science quiz competition,

273
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,816
but then I was extorted for money.

274
00:24:44,478 --> 00:24:45,678
Did you remember anything, Ai?

275
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,170
I only remember fighting with a girl named Mint.

276
00:24:54,842 --> 00:24:56,306
I was wearing Oom’s uniform.

277
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,057
Mint caught the name

278
00:24:59,687 --> 00:25:00,800
and bullied Oom afterward.

279
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,330
That’s it?

280
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,266
Gosh, I can’t believe you.

281
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:11,302
Should we start over properly then?

282
00:25:12,755 --> 00:25:13,755
How?

283
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,780
Are you alright?

284
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:19,342
You have to fight from now on.

285
00:25:19,614 --> 00:25:21,014
Don’t let anyone pick on you again.

286
00:25:23,598 --> 00:25:24,598
Mm.

287
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:25,949
Thank you.

288
00:25:33,188 --> 00:25:34,188
I’m Ai-oon.

289
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:36,560
Ai-oon Ingsamug.

290
00:25:45,826 --> 00:25:46,826
I’m May.

291
00:25:47,823 --> 00:25:48,823
Metawee.

292
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:05,896
Then and now are so different.

293
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:10,214
To me, they’re not.

294
00:26:16,632 --> 00:26:18,112
It warms my heart every time.

295
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,820
You know, May,

296
00:26:24,943 --> 00:26:26,379
my novel is soon to be published.

297
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:29,145
I’ve got a mockup of the book in hand.

298
00:26:29,826 --> 00:26:31,423
I haven’t given you your reward yet.

299
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:24,891
Sorry.

300
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:26,680
I was confused,

301
00:29:27,025 --> 00:29:28,625
so I wanted to talk to you both at once.

302
00:29:29,571 --> 00:29:31,029
Pang, how long have you liked Jan?

303
00:29:38,023 --> 00:29:39,023
Well,

304
00:29:40,497 --> 00:29:42,069
since after we broke up.

305
00:29:46,511 --> 00:29:47,511
What about you?

306
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,160
Have you started liking Jan yet?

307
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,118
I feel comfortable when I’m with Jan.

308
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,405
But every time I see you,

309
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:10,408
the memories of us since we first met are still vivid.

310
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:15,400
And when you told me that you liked Jan,

311
00:30:16,405 --> 00:30:19,819
I couldn’t help but wonder why it couldn’t be me.

312
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,214
That’s how I feel towards you, Pim.

313
00:31:10,357 --> 00:31:11,357
Gosh.

314
00:31:16,136 --> 00:31:18,059
Have you ever had feelings for me at all, Pim?

315
00:31:53,265 --> 00:31:54,337
I like you.

316
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,438
I like you so much.

317
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,808
OUT DELIVERING.

318
00:32:39,817 --> 00:32:42,100
WILL BE BACK WITH PAPAYA SALAD.

319
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,401
READ THE NOVEL FOR NOW.

320
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:11,610
OOM: MAY, I’LL BE THERE TO PICK YOU UP.

321
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:23,416
Oom.

322
00:33:23,894 --> 00:33:24,894
Oom,

323
00:33:25,423 --> 00:33:27,894
your Korat Salad with just one chili is here.

324
00:33:28,331 --> 00:33:29,500
Oom isn’t here.

325
00:33:29,543 --> 00:33:31,056
She left a while ago.

326
00:33:31,897 --> 00:33:32,897
Oh?

327
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,408
So you’re back to driving, Oom?

328
00:33:54,715 --> 00:33:55,715
What?

329
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,097
Didn’t I always drive to see you?

330
00:34:07,937 --> 00:34:08,493
Oom…

331
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,130
Don’t lie to me, May.

332
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,897
You already know

333
00:34:14,432 --> 00:34:16,201
that this Oom just woke up from a coma

334
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,896
and the one who’s been with you isn’t me.

335
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,330
CALLING AI-OON

336
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:41,862
Hello, May.

337
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:43,651
(Where are you taking me, Oom?)

338
00:34:44,423 --> 00:34:47,198
(The place where we can be together forever.)

339
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,080
Hey.

340
00:35:11,557 --> 00:35:12,557
Hey!

341
00:35:12,788 --> 00:35:13,317
Ai.

342
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,930
Where are you going now?

343
00:35:16,103 --> 00:35:17,103
Ai.

344
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:30,733
May.

345
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,730
May.

346
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,670
May—ouch!

347
00:35:49,474 --> 00:35:50,474
Are you okay?

348
00:35:54,394 --> 00:35:55,394
Not running away anymore?

349
00:36:00,983 --> 00:36:04,002
I don’t know why you took me here,

350
00:36:06,334 --> 00:36:07,334
but Ai is coming.

351
00:36:09,854 --> 00:36:10,854
She’s almost here.

352
00:36:25,174 --> 00:36:27,002
Ai must love you very much.

353
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:32,213
What exactly do you want, Oom?

354
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:44,801
This river seems strange.

355
00:36:53,354 --> 00:36:54,500
Sometimes it’s beautiful.

356
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,481
Sometimes it’s scary.

357
00:37:04,315 --> 00:37:05,605
I never understood

358
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:11,000
how two opposing feelings

359
00:37:12,637 --> 00:37:14,604
could exist at once...

360
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,400
until I loved you.

361
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
Oom.

362
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:28,346
May.

363
00:37:29,351 --> 00:37:30,351
Are you alright?

364
00:37:36,414 --> 00:37:38,801
Oom, what the heck are you doing?

365
00:37:41,608 --> 00:37:43,232
I should be asking you that.

366
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:46,847
What are you doing?

367
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:51,911
You know that I love May.

368
00:37:57,305 --> 00:37:58,503
But May doesn’t love you.

369
00:38:00,957 --> 00:38:01,957
Right.

370
00:38:05,257 --> 00:38:06,502
No one ever loves me.

371
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:08,819
That’s not true.

372
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:10,401
Grandma loves you.

373
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:12,469
So, why are you acting all crazy now?

374
00:38:14,597 --> 00:38:15,597
It’s not true.

375
00:38:18,614 --> 00:38:20,094
You just don’t know anything, do you?

376
00:38:23,374 --> 00:38:25,217
Make sure to study hard,

377
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:28,602
so you’ll be able to take care of yourself, just like Ai can.

378
00:38:30,536 --> 00:38:32,111
Grandma wasn’t concerned about you

379
00:38:33,865 --> 00:38:35,601
because she knew you could survive.

380
00:38:41,971 --> 00:38:43,722
But I was weak.

381
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,139
Lucky me,

382
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,149
I found someone who loved me.

383
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,330
WILL YOU BE MY GIRLFRIEND?

384
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,680
What’s my answer?

385
00:39:02,228 --> 00:39:03,228
I love you, May.

386
00:39:05,979 --> 00:39:06,998
But in the end,

387
00:39:09,325 --> 00:39:13,899
I found out that the one May loved…

388
00:39:17,115 --> 00:39:18,115
was you

389
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,002
while I’d fallen for her with all my heart.

390
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,186
How’s my cousin Metawee?

391
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,583
Physically, she’s fine.

392
00:39:34,327 --> 00:39:36,600
But mentally, not so much.

393
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:39,900
I’m angry with May,

394
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:46,062
but I can’t stand seeing her like this.

395
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:48,986
You should be with her,

396
00:39:49,665 --> 00:39:51,795
give her the courage to keep going.

397
00:39:56,028 --> 00:39:57,028
I…

398
00:40:00,887 --> 00:40:05,696
I can’t bear to be just Ai’s replacement.

399
00:40:12,992 --> 00:40:14,099
I do love May,

400
00:40:18,844 --> 00:40:20,604
but I don’t want to see her face.

401
00:40:28,714 --> 00:40:30,460
What should I do, Jan?

402
00:40:43,562 --> 00:40:45,342
Do what you want to do, Oom.

403
00:41:10,865 --> 00:41:12,210
The person you love…

404
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,610
is Ai-oon,

405
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:25,773
my twin sister.

406
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,598
If you want to leave me because I’m blind,

407
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,672
you don’t have to do this.

408
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,040
You love her so much, don’t you?

409
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,140
That girl, I mean.

410
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,770
Don’t you want to see her at least once in your life?

411
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,130
What do you want, Oom?

412
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I want you to fight.

413
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,817
Don’t let yourself become weak like this.

414
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:28,774
Be the Metawee you once were.

415
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:34,497
If you can do that,

416
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,400
I’ll step aside and break up with you.

417
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:51,223
If you’re really not that person,

418
00:42:52,494 --> 00:42:53,746
break up with me now.

419
00:43:22,568 --> 00:43:24,336
We may not love each other that much,

420
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,515
but I’m not cruel enough to hand someone like you over to my sister.

421
00:43:36,863 --> 00:43:38,697
And that’d be too easy for someone like you.

422
00:43:53,971 --> 00:43:54,998
People like you, May,

423
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,305
must pay for what you did.

424
00:44:04,081 --> 00:44:05,081
(It worked.)

425
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:08,179
(May started to pull herself together and live.)

426
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,040
If you don’t want my handkerchief,

427
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,240
we can stop by the convenience store there

428
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:36,940
and grab some tissues.

429
00:44:39,004 --> 00:44:40,776
You usually buy them for me without asking.

430
00:44:44,672 --> 00:44:45,761
You’re crying.

431
00:44:46,838 --> 00:44:48,198
I don’t want you to cry all alone.

432
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,208
Paul asked me to marry him here.

433
00:45:27,371 --> 00:45:28,872
This river is both beautiful

434
00:45:29,912 --> 00:45:31,496
and scary, don’t you think, Paul?

435
00:45:40,761 --> 00:45:41,761
As long as I’m here,

436
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:44,050
you don’t have to be scared.

437
00:46:06,522 --> 00:46:07,522
Will you marry me, Oom?

438
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:12,146
I will.

439
00:46:25,632 --> 00:46:26,632
Thank you.

440
00:46:29,552 --> 00:46:30,552
For you.

441
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,198
So, you’ve prepared all this, huh?

442
00:46:35,943 --> 00:46:37,897
I don’t want to miss a single moment with you.

443
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:40,490
Thank you.

444
00:46:52,909 --> 00:46:53,909
Paul.

445
00:46:58,074 --> 00:46:59,074
Paul.

446
00:47:04,228 --> 00:47:05,228
Paul.

447
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:09,499
I remember you now, Paul.

448
00:47:20,748 --> 00:47:22,770
I asked you to break up with May for me

449
00:47:26,531 --> 00:47:28,361
so that you’d know that I was two-timing.

450
00:47:31,438 --> 00:47:32,899
Then you’d feel bad for May.

451
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:37,210
As for you, May,

452
00:47:39,914 --> 00:47:41,896
though I didn’t want to see you again,

453
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,164
I still wanted you to be happy.

454
00:47:52,488 --> 00:47:53,488
But…

455
00:47:56,989 --> 00:47:58,401
Once I went through with it,

456
00:48:04,774 --> 00:48:06,982
I came to realize I still loved you.

457
00:48:13,157 --> 00:48:15,106
Ai, I still love May.

458
00:48:49,882 --> 00:48:52,779
I’m so happy you’re finally mine.

459
00:48:54,605 --> 00:48:55,605
Are you alright?

460
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:57,899
You drank a lot. I saw you.

461
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:01,238
Just a bit.

462
00:49:07,722 --> 00:49:08,722
Unknown number.

463
00:49:09,737 --> 00:49:10,737
Who’s calling this late?

464
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:14,791
Hello.

465
00:49:15,214 --> 00:49:16,214
Mr. Paul,

466
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:19,702
I received a message from Oom.

467
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:21,619
Is she okay?

468
00:49:30,154 --> 00:49:31,154
It’s Miss May.

469
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:34,100
Metawee called you.

470
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,942
How come May has your number, Paul?

471
00:49:59,185 --> 00:50:00,185
Hello, May.

472
00:50:04,659 --> 00:50:06,019
I just wanted to let you know that

473
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:11,297
I asked Ai to go break up with you.

474
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:18,354
If she goes,

475
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,299
she’ll learn we’re no longer together.

476
00:50:28,404 --> 00:50:29,662
And even if she doesn’t go,

477
00:50:33,013 --> 00:50:34,400
you should know that

478
00:50:37,405 --> 00:50:39,398
no matter who you're with from now on,

479
00:50:44,662 --> 00:50:46,374
I want nothing to do with it.

480
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:13,050
Oom, what are you doing?

481
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:18,933
Erasing everything about May.

482
00:51:27,992 --> 00:51:29,952
But there’s one place you can’t erase her from...

483
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,506
your own heart.

484
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:43,973
Paul, where are you going?

485
00:51:48,097 --> 00:51:49,097
Don’t worry.

486
00:51:51,223 --> 00:51:52,223
I love you.

487
00:51:53,407 --> 00:51:54,407
I can’t go anywhere.

488
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,002
I just want to give you some time with…

489
00:52:03,337 --> 00:52:05,019
I used to hate seeing you cry

490
00:52:06,322 --> 00:52:07,417
because it broke my heart.

491
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:12,010
But now

492
00:52:13,254 --> 00:52:16,402
you're crying because you love someone else.

493
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:20,665
My heart hurts so much...

494
00:52:22,847 --> 00:52:24,007
that it feels like I'm dying.

495
00:52:28,358 --> 00:52:29,358
Paul.

496
00:52:30,305 --> 00:52:31,305
Paul.

497
00:52:32,402 --> 00:52:33,402
Paul.

498
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,020
Paul.

499
00:52:36,149 --> 00:52:37,149
Paul.

500
00:52:39,397 --> 00:52:40,397
Paul.

501
00:52:43,945 --> 00:52:44,945
Paul.

502
00:52:45,231 --> 00:52:46,231
Paul.

503
00:52:47,518 --> 00:52:48,558
Paul, where are you going?

504
00:52:50,496 --> 00:52:51,496
I’m coming with you.

505
00:53:02,797 --> 00:53:03,997
Why did you come with me, Oom?

506
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:06,502
Because you’ve been drinking.

507
00:53:07,365 --> 00:53:08,762
I didn’t want you to go alone.

508
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:11,961
So you worry about me now?

509
00:53:13,632 --> 00:53:15,802
You called May on our wedding night.

510
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,069
You still care about her.

511
00:53:24,557 --> 00:53:26,001
What do you want me to do?

512
00:53:27,462 --> 00:53:29,200
I don’t want to be like this.

513
00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:32,072
If possible,

514
00:53:33,542 --> 00:53:35,370
I’d want to have feelings for you only.

515
00:53:43,583 --> 00:53:45,117
I’ll let you decide again.

516
00:53:47,217 --> 00:53:48,537
Would you like to go back to her?

517
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:56,755
Paul!

518
00:53:56,777 --> 00:53:57,385
Watch out!

519
00:53:57,475 --> 00:53:58,475
Paul!

520
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:06,897
Paul is dead.

521
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:11,146
The only person who ever loved me is gone.

522
00:54:16,077 --> 00:54:17,408
If it wasn’t for you, May,

523
00:54:17,982 --> 00:54:20,002
Paul would still be alive.

524
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,437
If you hadn’t made me love you,

525
00:54:26,748 --> 00:54:27,957
I’d still be in love with Paul.

526
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:31,524
And I wouldn’t have lost him.

527
00:54:31,608 --> 00:54:32,798
What did I do wrong?

528
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,207
I did everything to protect you,

529
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,828
but I ended up blind because of it.

530
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:47,270
I was deceived.

531
00:54:48,548 --> 00:54:50,604
I got ditched over and over.

532
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,200
You came to me…

533
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:16,031
because of Oom,

534
00:55:18,687 --> 00:55:22,602
rejected me because of Oom,

535
00:55:26,007 --> 00:55:27,299
and left me...

536
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,004
because of Oom.

537
00:55:50,374 --> 00:55:56,174
Has anyone here ever asked me what I want?

538
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:03,804
Has anyone here ever asked me who I love?

539
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:16,690
Do you see now, Oom?

540
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,500
May isn’t happy about it.

541
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,069
Everything started off on the wrong foot.

542
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:31,964
Forgive May

543
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,822
and let’s start over.

544
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,600
Even after everything that’s happened, you’re still taking her damn side?

545
00:56:53,271 --> 00:56:54,271
Right.

546
00:56:55,795 --> 00:56:56,795
You love her

547
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:00,921
and she loves you.

548
00:57:06,468 --> 00:57:07,800
But no one loves me.

549
00:57:11,002 --> 00:57:12,002
That’s not true, Oom.

550
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:24,370
No.

551
00:57:25,949 --> 00:57:26,949
You love May.

552
00:57:31,331 --> 00:57:32,374
You hate me.

553
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:35,354
You condemn me.

554
00:57:39,835 --> 00:57:41,306
You never choose me.

555
00:57:42,714 --> 00:57:44,001
Not even once.

556
00:57:47,093 --> 00:57:48,093
That’s not true.

557
00:57:50,786 --> 00:57:51,842
That’s not true at all.

558
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,400
Then choose.

559
00:58:08,948 --> 00:58:10,000
Will you choose me…

560
00:58:17,171 --> 00:58:18,995
or the person who ruined my life?

561
00:58:31,795 --> 00:58:33,800
Do you remember promising to make it up to me?

562
00:58:39,894 --> 00:58:40,911
If you choose May,

563
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,190
you will never see me again for the rest of your life.

564
00:58:52,068 --> 00:58:53,211
But if you choose me,

565
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:56,097
you can’t see May ever again.

566
00:59:39,906 --> 00:59:40,906
See?

567
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:45,674
You never choose me.

568
01:00:00,773 --> 01:00:02,376
You never choose me.

569
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:11,517
I’ve never not chosen you, Oaboom.

570
01:00:53,872 --> 01:00:54,872
Ai.

571
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,840
Ai.

572
01:00:59,736 --> 01:01:00,897
Ai.

573
01:01:02,653 --> 01:01:03,797
Ai!

574
01:01:05,508 --> 01:01:06,807
Ai!

575
01:01:20,361 --> 01:01:21,361
Easy there.

576
01:01:22,299 --> 01:01:23,299
Breathe slowly, May.

577
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:34,272
May.

578
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:36,010
Ai.

579
01:01:37,179 --> 01:01:38,303
Ai.

580
01:01:38,635 --> 01:01:39,635
Ai!

581
01:01:40,017 --> 01:01:41,414
Ai!

582
01:01:42,235 --> 01:01:43,235
Ai!

583
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,533
Easy.

584
01:01:46,165 --> 01:01:47,595
Ai!

585
01:01:49,644 --> 01:01:51,100
Ai!

586
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:17,350
Calm down.

587
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:18,583
Take a deep breath, May.

588
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:20,497
Ai.

589
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,574
DR. TON: MAY IS HOME.

590
01:02:51,597 --> 01:02:53,557
I GAVE HER SLEEPING PILLS AND ENSURED SHE RESTED.

591
01:03:41,328 --> 01:03:42,558
It will help her relax.

592
01:03:45,976 --> 01:03:47,605
I had no idea

593
01:03:49,597 --> 01:03:51,980
I caused you both traumas while raising you.

594
01:04:04,571 --> 01:04:06,157
We cause each other traumas.

595
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:09,835
But, at least, they come from love,

596
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:13,302
not hatred.

597
01:04:24,074 --> 01:04:25,074
Oh?

598
01:04:29,192 --> 01:04:30,496
Did I wake you, little sister?

599
01:04:35,517 --> 01:04:37,505
Why did you call me little sister?

600
01:04:39,127 --> 01:04:42,397
So you’ll remember I’m your big sister.

601
01:04:49,268 --> 01:04:51,434
And you have me as your grandma.

602
01:04:55,202 --> 01:04:57,303
And this grandma loves her granddaughters the most.

603
01:05:05,254 --> 01:05:08,099
I’m sorry for…

604
01:05:10,254 --> 01:05:11,254
Grandma,

605
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:15,002
I love you and Ai.

606
01:05:40,986 --> 01:05:42,897
I felt so bad after I burned it.

607
01:05:44,672 --> 01:05:47,312
I bought you a new one but didn’t have the guts to give it to you.

608
01:05:50,352 --> 01:05:51,871
Can you read it to me?

609
01:05:54,555 --> 01:05:55,555
Of course.

610
01:06:05,517 --> 01:06:07,306
Once upon a time,

611
01:06:09,189 --> 01:06:12,025
the Sun, the center of the solar system,

612
01:06:13,786 --> 01:06:19,604
discovered that she had a sibling,

613
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:24,137
born at the same time and from the same gas cloud.

614
01:06:27,955 --> 01:06:29,902
But she had forgotten about it.

615
01:06:32,543 --> 01:06:35,402
So, she decided to set out and find her sibling.

616
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:03,000
This novel is dedicated to a love so valuable that we’re willing to let go.

617
01:09:03,407 --> 01:09:05,197
I want to know if you've been happy.

618
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,597
All I know is that Ai’s never been happy.

619
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,829
Because I promised Ai

620
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,900
that I wouldn’t bring her pain.

621
01:09:13,245 --> 01:09:16,299
If our love hurt you, Oom,

622
01:09:16,955 --> 01:09:18,299
how could Ai be happy?

623
01:09:19,096 --> 01:09:20,380
Your novel is amazing.
