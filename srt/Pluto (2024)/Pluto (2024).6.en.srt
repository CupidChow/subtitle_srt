1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,800
If you want to put yourself down and leave me,

2
00:00:04,743 --> 00:00:05,850
then go ahead.

3
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:07,653
I’m going to write a novel.

4
00:00:08,528 --> 00:00:09,912
I believe you can do it.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,554
I will make it happen.

6
00:00:12,844 --> 00:00:14,154
I will be good enough for you.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,130
2014

8
00:00:26,488 --> 00:00:26,961
Ma’am,

9
00:00:26,982 --> 00:00:27,988
we’ve delivered the washed clothes

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,600
and picked up two baskets of dirty ones.

11
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,663
I swear I saw used socks in there.

12
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,770
Ugh, I’m getting chills.

13
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:34,210
Ben,

14
00:00:34,317 --> 00:00:36,303
sit your friends down and have some noodles.

15
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:37,779
Yes, Mom.

16
00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:39,482
Let’s eat.

17
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:40,582
I’m starving.

18
00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:41,911
Gosh.

19
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,040
Just sit down.

20
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:45,915
Let me tell you.

21
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:47,825
What you found is nothing.

22
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,448
Once, I even saw a used sanitary pad in the basket.

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:52,709
Damn.

24
00:00:52,837 --> 00:00:53,837
Disgusting.

25
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:57,431
Food is ready, guys.

26
00:00:57,828 --> 00:00:58,770
Lend her a hand.

27
00:00:58,788 --> 00:00:59,788
Enjoy.

28
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:02,894
It’s normal in this line of work.

29
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:05,591
Overthinking it won’t earn you any money.

30
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,663
Here, I have a little something for you.

31
00:01:09,562 --> 00:01:10,562
Take it.

32
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:11,826
Thank you, ma’am.

33
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:13,345
- Take it. - Thank you, ma’am.

34
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:15,508
Thank you.

35
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:19,180
Eat first. Then go home and study.

36
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:22,185
I’ll stay and help out.

37
00:01:22,903 --> 00:01:24,176
No need.

38
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:27,306
Just head home and sort the clothes.

39
00:01:27,317 --> 00:01:28,217
Your exams are coming up.

40
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:29,322
Wow.

41
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:31,149
Your mom is freakin’ cool.

42
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:39,828
I don’t think I’ll go to college.

43
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,500
What the hell are you saying?

44
00:01:44,524 --> 00:01:46,912
Your mom works so hard just for that.

45
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,790
But if I don’t go to college,

46
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:51,137
my mom wouldn't have to work so hard.

47
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:58,506
Mr. Ah offered me a job as a mechanic.

48
00:01:58,663 --> 00:01:59,983
He said he’d teach me everything.

49
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:02,943
Have you thought this through?

50
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:06,712
I have.

51
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,211
And my thought is

52
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,560
if I want my mom to live comfortably,

53
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,930
I have to live tough.

54
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,503
This kind of life doesn’t allow both of us to live comfortably.

55
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:20,801
Eat.

56
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,660
Damn you.

57
00:02:30,554 --> 00:02:31,554
What are you doing?

58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,250
AI-OON’S CRAM SCHOOL

59
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,300
I never said I wanted to go to cram school.

60
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:46,840
If not cram school,

61
00:02:47,437 --> 00:02:50,062
how else would someone like you get into university?

62
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,919
Gosh, these are all for Oom and me.

63
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,012
AI-OON’S SCHOOL TUITION / AI AND OOM’S ALLOWANCE Gosh, these are all for Oom and me.

64
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:57,320
AI-OON’S SCHOOL TUITION / AI AND OOM’S ALLOWANCE

65
00:02:57,342 --> 00:03:01,306
Don’t you save anything for your own expenses or medical treatment?

66
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,460
That’s for an adult to worry about.

67
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:04,776
A kid like you stay out of it.

68
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:07,808
You’re just irritating.

69
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,100
Look at you.

70
00:03:10,294 --> 00:03:10,917
See?

71
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:12,327
Exactly what I just said.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,890
DOCUMENT OF ACCEPTANCE

73
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,970
FOR AI-OON INGSAMAK TO THE SELECTIVE PROGRAM, CHIANG MAI UNIVERSITY

74
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,247
(Let me share how to write novels that earn a 7-digit income.)

75
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:35,976
(Gosh!)

76
00:05:36,306 --> 00:05:42,471
(Guys, this is the first month my novel earnings have hit 5 digits.)

77
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,222
(Here are tutorials on making money through novel writing.)

78
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,130
HOW TO MAKE…

79
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,730
HOW TO MAKE MONEY FROM WRITING NOVELS

80
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,690
VALUE OF LOVE, OON-AI

81
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,910
You know,

82
00:06:29,982 --> 00:06:31,805
you gave me the courage to dream again.

83
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,518
But it’s healthier if you’re in a deep sleep, without any dreams.

84
00:06:39,881 --> 00:06:41,509
Oh, come on, May.

85
00:06:41,773 --> 00:06:42,773
Come here.

86
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:48,965
When I was young,

87
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,164
my parents used to read me bedtime stories.

88
00:06:54,862 --> 00:06:58,281
It was full of happiness and beauty.

89
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,004
It gave me sweet dreams,

90
00:07:01,594 --> 00:07:03,306
both while I was asleep and awake.

91
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:07,114
But after they passed,

92
00:07:15,537 --> 00:07:16,977
it felt like I woke up from a dream,

93
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:23,890
and I never wanted to touch a storybook again.

94
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,186
But that changed when I met you.

95
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,423
You’re the reason I’m brave enough to dream again.

96
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,217
I just wanted to record that.

97
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,167
All of what you just said

98
00:07:41,297 --> 00:07:42,509
should be in your novel.

99
00:07:43,234 --> 00:07:44,234
Oh, please.

100
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,202
This isn’t a story.

101
00:07:46,474 --> 00:07:47,725
It’s my real life.

102
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,442
I’ve been reading novels all my life,

103
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,962
just to see if they’ll ever become real.

104
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:15,180
I’m going to make it.

105
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:17,939
That’s great.

106
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:19,645
The ultimate reward is waiting for you.

107
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Here you go.

108
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:40,939
Thanks.

109
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:42,389
Thanks for your service.

110
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,708
Of course.

111
00:08:47,038 --> 00:08:48,038
Your food is ready.

112
00:08:49,173 --> 00:08:49,980
Thanks, sis.

113
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,019
- Sure. - I’m off.

114
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:52,103
Sure.

115
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,570
Your order is ready.

116
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:55,822
Thanks so much.

117
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:56,934
Thank you.

118
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:58,383
Hope to be of service again.

119
00:08:58,407 --> 00:08:59,407
Of course.

120
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:04,485
Grandma,

121
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,540
I bought your favorite fish wontons and Oom’s favorite noodles.

122
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,570
I’m offering them to the shrine tomorrow.

123
00:09:11,105 --> 00:09:13,174
So tempting she might want to wake up and eat.

124
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:20,817
Grandma?

125
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,765
What’s going on?

126
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,657
Ever since your parents passed away,

127
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:35,520
I’ve always believed the only thing I could do...

128
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:38,854
was make sure you two could take care of yourselves.

129
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:46,674
Ai, you’re street-smart, but not book-smart.

130
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,112
Oom is book-smart

131
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,410
but naive about the world.

132
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Grandma.

133
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:02,271
I felt sorry for you,

134
00:10:03,882 --> 00:10:06,200
having a bachelor's degree

135
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:09,511
but not a good job,

136
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:17,714
so I took your graduation certificate to Mr. Paul’s company

137
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:20,434
and asked them to help find you a good position.

138
00:10:22,684 --> 00:10:23,974
But they told me…

139
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,300
your certificate was a fake.

140
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,506
I’m sorry, Grandma.

141
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,970
Then what did you do after leaving the house in your university uniform?

142
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:53,268
Press harder.

143
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:54,918
Don’t worry, the clothes won’t get hurt.

144
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Thank you, ma’am,

145
00:10:57,081 --> 00:10:58,401
for allowing me to work with you.

146
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:01,010
I just don’t understand kids these days.

147
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,936
You and Ben, to be exact, hate to study comfortably in the classroom.

148
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,170
Instead of Grandma working hard to afford an education for a dummy like me,

149
00:11:12,814 --> 00:11:15,216
I should be working to help her with Oom’s education.

150
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,765
No one wants to see their loved ones struggle.

151
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,517
Why did you do it, Ai-oon?

152
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
It’s…

153
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:33,407
It was a long time ago, Grandma.

154
00:11:34,297 --> 00:11:36,820
But now, I really graduated.

155
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:01,736
Look, Grandma,

156
00:12:01,957 --> 00:12:03,157
I do have a bachelor's degree.

157
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,810
BACHELOR OF MASS COMMUNICATION

158
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:10,114
You just graduated this year,

159
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:13,182
so you haven’t found a good job yet.

160
00:12:13,352 --> 00:12:14,915
It has nothing to do with what I do.

161
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:18,608
Many people with master’s or PhDs work in delivery service.

162
00:12:19,736 --> 00:12:21,016
Plus, it’s manageable time-wise.

163
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:23,601
I can make time to help you out.

164
00:12:25,136 --> 00:12:26,626
What a stupid thought. Jeez.

165
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,912
Other people choose delivery service,

166
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:34,703
but you had to do it

167
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:36,914
because you had no other choice.

168
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,118
It was my choice.

169
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,623
I chose to do it!

170
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,982
But because I’m dumb,

171
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:48,075
it’s the best choice I could make.

172
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,480
Don’t you remember how hard it was

173
00:12:59,394 --> 00:13:01,108
for you to afford Oom’s education alone?

174
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,200
If I hadn’t lied to you about getting the scholarship,

175
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,964
your house would be under mortgage right now.

176
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,229
How on earth could I get any scholarship since I’m so stupid?

177
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,872
I just worked, made money,

178
00:13:28,957 --> 00:13:30,023
and got by each day.

179
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,469
That’s why you had time to take me to the doctor

180
00:13:37,229 --> 00:13:39,508
and money to help me pay for utilities.

181
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:44,808
You make me feel like I’m a bad grandma.

182
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:49,419
What about me?

183
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,865
How could I be a good granddaughter

184
00:13:56,623 --> 00:13:58,617
if I did nothing when you worked so hard?

185
00:13:59,946 --> 00:14:01,248
You suffered from back pain and eye sores

186
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:03,640
but bought cheap-ass medicine to treat them.

187
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,005
Don’t you see the news that says they can cause kidney disease?

188
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,331
Your eyesight isn’t good.

189
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:15,379
How many times have you been scammed by customers?

190
00:14:19,718 --> 00:14:21,265
You often cough when you stay up late.

191
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:24,309
Sometimes you forget to close the windows

192
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:26,401
or cover yourself with a blanket.

193
00:14:27,351 --> 00:14:28,364
When Oom got sick,

194
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,438
you dropped everything to care for her in the hospital,

195
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:35,570
then came back with rashes all over.

196
00:14:35,777 --> 00:14:36,800
Don’t you remember?

197
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:42,854
Mom and Dad are dead.

198
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,017
Do you think I can afford to lose you too?

199
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,631
And Oom isn’t just your granddaughter,

200
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:03,574
she’s my sister too.

201
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:08,274
And you…

202
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:12,472
Keep this in mind.

203
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:15,426
Oom isn’t your only granddaughter.

204
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,577
I’m your granddaughter too.

205
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,485
Do you know what the most painful punishment is for me?

206
00:15:27,162 --> 00:15:29,509
The price of my lifetime’s devotion.

207
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:33,711
One grandchild is bedridden,

208
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:38,914
and the other drowning in what I’ve created.

209
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,734
(I believe in the theory of making room.)

210
00:16:55,670 --> 00:17:00,259
(We must release some distress in order to have room for happiness.)

211
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:06,404
(Sacrifice is required to make room for success.)

212
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:12,768
(But the room for truth, after lies, is filled with distress.)

213
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:56,607
OFF TO SEE OOM. BROUGHT THE WONTON SOUP TO THE SHRINE. YOU DON’T HAVE TO GO TODAY.

214
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,970
HELLO. YOU THERE?

215
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,131
(The action plan is complete, Ms. May.)

216
00:19:06,952 --> 00:19:09,942
(The meeting minutes are ready.)

217
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:11,505
(No problem.)

218
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:17,287
(There are some resumes for law-related positions for you to review.)

219
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:23,974
(Four messages unread.)

220
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:26,189
(Oom, are you home yet?)

221
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:29,217
(Are you updating another chapter today?)

222
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:30,967
(Oom, why are you so quiet?)

223
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:42,367
Ms. May.

224
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:43,838
Oom, you’re here?

225
00:19:46,928 --> 00:19:47,928
May.

226
00:20:28,045 --> 00:20:29,804
I finished listening to your novel.

227
00:20:34,302 --> 00:20:35,302
I’m sorry.

228
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:38,103
I didn’t write last night.

229
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,680
Does that have something to do with you being so quiet?

230
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:46,004
I had a small fight with my grandma.

231
00:20:48,642 --> 00:20:50,382
If sadness is overwhelming,

232
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,037
you can vent to me.

233
00:20:57,362 --> 00:20:59,365
I want you to have room for happiness.

234
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,114
I have a little sister.

235
00:21:28,322 --> 00:21:29,614
After our parents died,

236
00:21:32,242 --> 00:21:33,811
Grandma took us in.

237
00:21:36,548 --> 00:21:38,321
I decided to work just to help her,

238
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,840
so I graduated university a little later than usual.

239
00:21:52,564 --> 00:21:53,976
When she found out,

240
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:57,768
she got angry at me for lying

241
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:02,967
and started blaming herself for who I’ve become.

242
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,260
What’s wrong with who you’ve become, Oom?

243
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:14,112
Oh, Oom is great.

244
00:22:18,306 --> 00:22:19,306
But I…

245
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:25,173
But this Oom…

246
00:22:31,277 --> 00:22:37,268
This Oom is trying to chase her dream,

247
00:22:40,962 --> 00:22:42,368
a delivery girl by day,

248
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,977
a writer by night.

249
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,173
She even finds time to care for her blind girlfriend.

250
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:54,808
How is this Oom bad?

251
00:23:03,045 --> 00:23:04,045
Hm?

252
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:27,503
You make me feel bigger again.

253
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,765
I’ve been feeding you, haven’t I?

254
00:23:37,826 --> 00:23:39,702
Don’t let yourself become smaller again.

255
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,110
Got it?

256
00:23:56,743 --> 00:24:00,808
You knew what your big sister did, didn't you?

257
00:24:06,174 --> 00:24:13,503
I never imagined having good granddaughters could hurt this much.

258
00:24:55,586 --> 00:24:56,586
Oom.

259
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,191
Grandma already knew I didn’t go to college.

260
00:25:04,314 --> 00:25:05,638
You covered for me,

261
00:25:10,114 --> 00:25:13,290
but the people at your boyfriend’s company messed it up.

262
00:25:17,228 --> 00:25:18,250
I know.

263
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,505
I must thank them, even.

264
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:36,813
And I’m sorry for ever doubting the need for a stable job.

265
00:25:44,202 --> 00:25:45,417
I’m having a dream now.

266
00:25:51,453 --> 00:25:52,613
I want to be a writer,

267
00:25:55,662 --> 00:25:57,016
and I’m trying.

268
00:25:59,521 --> 00:26:00,521
Oom,

269
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:05,974
your big sister is starting to grow up.

270
00:26:06,882 --> 00:26:09,579
She has a dream now, just like everyone else.

271
00:26:11,848 --> 00:26:13,611
You should root for her.

272
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,530
As for me,

273
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,105
I will root for her too.

274
00:26:47,893 --> 00:26:48,893
May.

275
00:26:58,554 --> 00:26:59,868
How did they disappear so fast?

276
00:27:02,644 --> 00:27:03,644
Looking for something?

277
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,552
I’m keeping May company for her follow-up check.

278
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,760
What about you?

279
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:25,108
Visiting a friend.

280
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:30,511
Why didn’t May tell me she had an appointment?

281
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:34,925
Don’t waste your time doubting.

282
00:27:35,709 --> 00:27:37,322
She likes to keep cool

283
00:27:37,828 --> 00:27:40,377
and doesn’t want you to see her as pitiful.

284
00:27:54,468 --> 00:27:55,468
May.

285
00:27:56,894 --> 00:27:57,894
Oom?

286
00:27:59,626 --> 00:28:00,626
What brings you here?

287
00:28:02,205 --> 00:28:05,414
I came to visit a friend.

288
00:28:06,441 --> 00:28:07,814
How are your eyes?

289
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:09,977
Still can’t see.

290
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,690
No updates.

291
00:28:15,423 --> 00:28:16,423
Ploy.

292
00:28:16,937 --> 00:28:17,937
Right here.

293
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,131
I’m sorry.

294
00:28:22,694 --> 00:28:24,654
I don’t think I’ll visit your restaurant anymore.

295
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
May,

296
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:28,031
don’t be like this.

297
00:28:29,992 --> 00:28:32,382
This restaurant is our shared dream.

298
00:28:33,232 --> 00:28:34,232
Ploy.

299
00:28:34,657 --> 00:28:35,657
Don’t pressure her.

300
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:38,213
And who was it that said,

301
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,642
even if she remains blind forever,

302
00:28:41,835 --> 00:28:43,710
she’ll still try to live a normal life?

303
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,186
Ton.

304
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,050
Hm?

305
00:28:56,108 --> 00:28:57,417
Talk to her for me, please.

306
00:28:58,951 --> 00:28:59,982
I’ll leave with Oom.

307
00:29:01,613 --> 00:29:02,613
Okay.

308
00:29:09,943 --> 00:29:10,943
May.

309
00:29:14,675 --> 00:29:15,675
Let’s go.

310
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,524
Do you know why I don’t go to Ploy’s restaurant,

311
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,570
even though it’s the place I want to visit the most?

312
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:42,573
Because I can’t see.

313
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,902
I’ve made up with Grandma.

314
00:29:51,368 --> 00:29:53,005
I’m back to being a big girl again.

315
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,109
So if you wanna lean on me,

316
00:29:56,786 --> 00:29:57,786
you can.

317
00:30:13,488 --> 00:30:14,488
Come on.

318
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:20,425
Ploy.

319
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,278
Ploy.

320
00:30:27,268 --> 00:30:28,417
She asked you to come?

321
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,820
I’d come anyway, even if she didn’t.

322
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:36,417
I don’t get it.

323
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,872
I see her living a normal life.

324
00:30:39,456 --> 00:30:41,114
She goes to work, has a girlfriend,

325
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:42,171
and even travels abroad.

326
00:30:43,469 --> 00:30:45,508
It’s just Korat, why can’t she go?

327
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,466
It isn’t about the place.

328
00:30:48,902 --> 00:30:49,908
It’s about the people.

329
00:30:52,108 --> 00:30:53,414
What people? Me?

330
00:30:53,703 --> 00:30:54,813
No, not you.

331
00:30:55,032 --> 00:30:56,032
Calm down.

332
00:30:56,248 --> 00:30:58,925
Think of it from her perspective.

333
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,465
Her new world after blindness isn’t as scary as the old one.

334
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,694
What are you talking about?

335
00:31:08,841 --> 00:31:10,506
How is her old world scary?

336
00:31:11,423 --> 00:31:12,903
There will be a bunch of our friends.

337
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,608
It’s pity.

338
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:21,007
What May hates the most is pity.

339
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,090
May, be careful.

340
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
There’s a step.

341
00:31:57,765 --> 00:31:59,204
Sit and wait on the couch.

342
00:32:11,927 --> 00:32:13,419
How does this place look, Oom?

343
00:32:17,324 --> 00:32:18,324
Nice.

344
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:21,859
Unique.

345
00:32:28,668 --> 00:32:29,668
It’s quite classic.

346
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,891
You haven’t been here before?

347
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,660
Why did you want to come?

348
00:32:37,737 --> 00:32:38,737
I have.

349
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,090
But I came after I became blind.

350
00:32:44,137 --> 00:32:45,275
I liked it.

351
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,080
This place plays the same type of music as the Thai restaurant

352
00:32:51,225 --> 00:32:53,517
Ploy and I worked at when we were in the US.

353
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,690
It should be similar to the one Ploy is opening.

354
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,709
You want to visit Ploy’s restaurant, don’t you?

355
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:08,445
You can, you know.

356
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,506
I’ll come with you.

357
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,257
Do you see the musicians?

358
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
Yes.

359
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:26,272
I knew this place not long after I became blind.

360
00:33:28,096 --> 00:33:31,511
The band members dedicated themselves to mastering music,

361
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,322
dreaming of becoming true artists.

362
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,640
They were the ones who recommended this place.

363
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:46,077
It’s the only place I want to visit when I go out.

364
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:53,231
You know,

365
00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:02,608
the law distinguishes between those who showcase their talents and beggars,

366
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:09,574
but in reality, people still don’t care.

367
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:14,191
What do you think...

368
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:23,167
is the difference between normal people busking and blind people busking?

369
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,133
We give money to those who can see

370
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,139
because they perform well.

371
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,155
But we give money to the blind

372
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,180
because we feel pity for them.

373
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,001
We don’t even care

374
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,348
if they perform well or not.

375
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,802
That feeling,

376
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,108
I hate it the most.

377
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
May.

378
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:23,903
May, you’re awake?

379
00:35:35,577 --> 00:35:36,577
How are you feeling?

380
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,160
May.

381
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:00,066
What happened?

382
00:36:00,687 --> 00:36:01,687
Take it easy.

383
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,122
You were attacked and left unconscious on the side of the street.

384
00:36:04,146 --> 00:36:05,866
Your girlfriend called the police for help.

385
00:36:06,171 --> 00:36:07,171
No.

386
00:36:07,314 --> 00:36:09,205
I meant, why can’t I see?

387
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:10,521
What?

388
00:36:10,721 --> 00:36:12,447
Ton, I can’t see anything.

389
00:36:12,565 --> 00:36:13,339
May, stay calm.

390
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:14,025
Ton.

391
00:36:14,162 --> 00:36:15,162
May, take it easy.

392
00:36:16,454 --> 00:36:17,454
Calm down.

393
00:36:17,813 --> 00:36:18,813
May, calm down.

394
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:27,010
(My brain’s visual perception area was bruised.)

395
00:36:27,491 --> 00:36:28,918
(I had brain bleeds.)

396
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:33,309
(Undergoing surgery could potentially affect other parts of the brain,

397
00:36:34,343 --> 00:36:37,177
(leading to paralysis or a stroke.)

398
00:36:55,426 --> 00:36:56,426
Oom?

399
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,869
May. It’s me.

400
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,710
Hello.

401
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,900
We came to visit you.

402
00:37:01,731 --> 00:37:02,731
We who?

403
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,408
What? It’s us.

404
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,597
What’s wrong with you?

405
00:37:05,717 --> 00:37:06,454
Us who?

406
00:37:06,576 --> 00:37:07,576
Ann.

407
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:08,869
- Us who? - May, it’s us.

408
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,909
I thought you said she was blind.

409
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,380
Why can’t she remember anything now?

410
00:37:12,404 --> 00:37:13,522
May, it’s Ploy.

411
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:15,308
- May, what’s the matter? - May, what’s wrong?

412
00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:16,016
- Who are you? - May, what’s going on?

413
00:37:16,044 --> 00:37:16,527
May?

414
00:37:16,557 --> 00:37:17,656
May.

415
00:37:17,983 --> 00:37:18,983
Who are you?

416
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,100
Who?

417
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:26,287
May, calm down.

418
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:27,260
May, take a deep breath.

419
00:37:27,343 --> 00:37:28,343
I’ll call you a nurse.

420
00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:38,170
My clear vision faded into a dim light,

421
00:37:40,253 --> 00:37:45,502
just enough for me to tell if it was day or night.

422
00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:50,374
At first, I waited.

423
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:53,623
I waited until I fully recovered.

424
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,808
But what I discovered...

425
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,390
was that you were gone.

426
00:38:09,893 --> 00:38:11,352
I guess I must’ve been…

427
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,020
freaked out.

428
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,007
That must be why I left you.

429
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:24,776
My dad wanted me to go back and live in Korat.

430
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,520
Not only was my sight terrible,

431
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,201
but so was my life.

432
00:38:39,574 --> 00:38:41,265
My life was hell.

433
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,801
But then I thought,

434
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,371
I have money,

435
00:38:54,644 --> 00:38:55,644
I have knowledge,

436
00:38:57,213 --> 00:38:58,213
and I have tomorrow.

437
00:39:00,225 --> 00:39:01,225
I can be happy.

438
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,352
No universal design in this country?

439
00:39:08,117 --> 00:39:09,117
I’ll fight for it.

440
00:39:11,674 --> 00:39:13,835
The world doesn’t see the abilities of the disabled?

441
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:16,777
I’ll make them see.

442
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,520
I can do it.

443
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,545
There’s one thing I can’t do, though.

444
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,190
You're a smart girl.

445
00:39:37,414 --> 00:39:38,429
You can do anything.

446
00:39:44,419 --> 00:39:45,419
No.

447
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:54,305
I can't bear the thought that one day,

448
00:39:56,217 --> 00:39:58,521
the looks of admiration people give me

449
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:05,103
will turn into looks filled with pity.

450
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,350
Funny, isn’t it?

451
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,610
I can’t even see them,

452
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,702
but I'm afraid of how they'll look at me.

453
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:37,970
What are you thinking?

454
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,660
About May.

455
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,854
I want to help her the way she helped me.

456
00:40:46,973 --> 00:40:47,973
How did she help you?

457
00:40:49,668 --> 00:40:51,198
Like I told you,

458
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:55,600
she gave me the courage to dream

459
00:40:57,562 --> 00:40:58,780
and write.

460
00:41:00,653 --> 00:41:01,657
I know that.

461
00:41:02,717 --> 00:41:04,315
I just wanted to recheck,

462
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,579
in case it helped you think of a way.

463
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:13,789
It’s difficult.

464
00:41:14,877 --> 00:41:16,419
I have no idea how I can help.

465
00:41:17,487 --> 00:41:18,487
She’s pretty

466
00:41:19,342 --> 00:41:20,342
and smart.

467
00:41:21,365 --> 00:41:22,365
She’s perfect.

468
00:41:24,591 --> 00:41:26,376
But from what I’ve heard,

469
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:30,477
I don’t think she needs help.

470
00:41:31,871 --> 00:41:33,097
She needs to believe.

471
00:41:35,717 --> 00:41:39,114
Make her believe in herself

472
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,460
the way you believe in her.

473
00:41:43,164 --> 00:41:46,620
Make her see herself the way you see her.

474
00:41:52,912 --> 00:41:54,084
Look at yourself.

475
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,706
You’re down bad.

476
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:57,909
What?

477
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,200
How annoying.

478
00:42:00,705 --> 00:42:02,097
How’s your girlfriend doing anyway?

479
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:03,121
My ex, you mean?

480
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:04,703
Yeah, her.

481
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:07,333
I don’t know.

482
00:42:08,288 --> 00:42:10,288
I don’t think it’s a good idea to talk to her now.

483
00:42:13,706 --> 00:42:16,524
Let’s talk about you since you’re so in love.

484
00:42:17,105 --> 00:42:19,077
Talking about me just kills the vibe.

485
00:42:24,232 --> 00:42:25,232
There he comes.

486
00:42:26,274 --> 00:42:27,303
What took you so long?

487
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:29,659
Where is Ben?

488
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,030
I tried,

489
00:42:31,152 --> 00:42:32,152
but he refused to come.

490
00:42:56,057 --> 00:42:56,672
Ma’am.

491
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,801
SOMSRI CHAN-IMNUAN

492
00:42:57,802 --> 00:42:59,602
We came to pay you a visit. SOMSRI CHAN-IMNUAN

493
00:43:01,724 --> 00:43:03,306
Live up there without any worries.

494
00:43:03,734 --> 00:43:05,054
We will take care of Ben for you.

495
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,062
We are good kids now.

496
00:43:08,354 --> 00:43:09,474
We stopped being motorpunks.

497
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,271
So don’t you worry.

498
00:43:12,712 --> 00:43:13,712
You can rest in peace.

499
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:43,370
I can’t believe I’m spending my annual leave helping someone pack.

500
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,069
Your job is to maintain order and help citizens.

501
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,530
There are no days off from that.

502
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,294
That’s just something you made up.

503
00:43:59,693 --> 00:44:00,693
Hey!

504
00:44:01,567 --> 00:44:02,567
What?

505
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:04,417
I’m happy.

506
00:44:05,173 --> 00:44:06,417
You’re smiling.

507
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:09,730
Now I can move to my new house without any worries.

508
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:12,459
This is good for you.

509
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:17,817
I, too, dream of owning a small house

510
00:44:18,411 --> 00:44:19,817
with lots of plants.

511
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:23,970
You’re doing so well,

512
00:44:24,613 --> 00:44:26,377
buying a house at such a young age.

513
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,611
I’ve heard that fortune tellers are rich.

514
00:44:30,354 --> 00:44:31,354
You just proved it true.

515
00:44:32,105 --> 00:44:33,623
Doctors treat the body.

516
00:44:33,687 --> 00:44:35,244
Fortune tellers treat the heart.

517
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:39,371
Anyway,

518
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,222
I honestly don’t want to move anymore.

519
00:44:44,463 --> 00:44:46,115
I want to stay on in this apartment.

520
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,808
My heart has perfectly healed.

521
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:54,317
You said you have no worries now.

522
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:57,410
You can go.

523
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:00,565
I don't want to be a burden to anyone.

524
00:45:03,149 --> 00:45:04,620
It’s not worry anymore.

525
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:06,973
What makes me hesitate to leave

526
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,862
is jealousy.

527
00:45:15,419 --> 00:45:20,315
I’m afraid that someone else might take this now-healthy heart.

528
00:45:22,077 --> 00:45:23,370
I found it first.

529
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,979
It would be a huge shame

530
00:45:29,992 --> 00:45:31,700
if someone else had it.

531
00:45:33,588 --> 00:45:34,588
Stop it.

532
00:45:35,186 --> 00:45:36,186
You’re crazy.

533
00:45:50,845 --> 00:45:51,845
You can put it here.

534
00:45:53,548 --> 00:45:54,548
Okay.

535
00:45:56,435 --> 00:45:57,435
Heavy, isn’t it?

536
00:46:00,912 --> 00:46:01,912
Thank you.

537
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,280
Yes, Ai?

538
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:17,710
Ploy’s number?

539
00:46:19,908 --> 00:46:20,908
May’s friend?

540
00:46:29,709 --> 00:46:31,265
We’re entering the room.

541
00:46:34,829 --> 00:46:38,711
There are six tables in front of you.

542
00:46:40,087 --> 00:46:43,365
On your left, there’s a line of bunting flags.

543
00:46:44,703 --> 00:46:45,703
You can touch them.

544
00:46:50,177 --> 00:46:51,771
There are blue and white flags,

545
00:46:52,884 --> 00:46:54,324
so beautiful like a temple festival.

546
00:46:55,022 --> 00:46:56,022
Have you been to one?

547
00:46:57,527 --> 00:46:59,047
I worked on a flea market case before.

548
00:47:00,688 --> 00:47:01,688
Did you win or lose?

549
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:04,829
Oh, I never lose.

550
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,973
Come on. Let’s go sit down.

551
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,445
Have a seat right here.

552
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:32,382
Ploy’s restaurant is similar to this one.

553
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,623
I got the full rundown on everything.

554
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:37,503
Around 20 people are attending.

555
00:47:38,674 --> 00:47:39,954
There’s nothing to be afraid of.

556
00:47:41,226 --> 00:47:42,804
Did you secretly talk to Ploy?

557
00:47:44,554 --> 00:47:45,554
Not secretly.

558
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:49,374
Jan is friends with her on Facebook,

559
00:47:49,454 --> 00:47:50,654
so that’s how we got in touch.

560
00:47:53,853 --> 00:47:55,906
Jan and Pang, another friend of mine,

561
00:47:56,417 --> 00:47:57,911
helped set up this place.

562
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,640
So dramatic.

563
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:04,025
Well, I wanted you to go.

564
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:06,869
And I wanted to go too.

565
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:14,779
I’d like to see Ploy’s dream that has you in it.

566
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,829
Did you think doing this would make me go?

567
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:19,838
Apparently not.

568
00:48:20,237 --> 00:48:21,637
That’s why I took you here instead.

569
00:48:39,497 --> 00:48:41,422
The band you like is here too.

570
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,327
But I didn’t invite them out of pity.

571
00:48:49,565 --> 00:48:51,125
I invited them because they’re artists.

572
00:48:55,607 --> 00:48:56,607
Do you remember...

573
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:00,299
the first time we met?

574
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:04,130
You kissed me.

575
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:10,750
And do you know

576
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:14,472
what kind of life it inspired me to live?

577
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,500
What kind?

578
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,650
(Don't be afraid of past heartaches you've had)

579
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:46,960
(Just hold my hand and don’t be sad)

580
00:49:47,992 --> 00:49:51,333
(Step into a world that belongs to just us two)

581
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,722
(And see how wide it can open up for you)

582
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,985
(Leave behind the tears that used to fall)

583
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:04,491
(Rise and follow your heart's call)

584
00:50:05,214 --> 00:50:09,162
(There’s beauty ahead, waiting for you to find)

585
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:12,708
(Just be brave and take this step with me tonight)

586
00:50:13,185 --> 00:50:17,108
(Million stars are shining, casting light on us)

587
00:50:17,499 --> 00:50:21,634
(Mountains and oceans filled with love and trust)

588
00:50:21,828 --> 00:50:25,179
(Good or bad, where we are, it doesn’t matter)

589
00:50:25,417 --> 00:50:28,348
(As long as you’re here with me now and forever)

590
00:50:28,594 --> 00:50:30,616
(Somewhere only we know)

591
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:52,435
(Just take a look around and you will see)

592
00:50:53,749 --> 00:50:56,810
(Fields of flowers blooming endlessly)

593
00:50:57,573 --> 00:50:59,520
(Light up your heart)

594
00:51:00,007 --> 00:51:05,068
(You’ll find the missing part, oh)

595
00:51:05,294 --> 00:51:07,180
(Somewhere only we know)

596
00:51:07,657 --> 00:51:08,990
(I'll be there with you)

597
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,111
(I'll be there with you)

598
00:51:11,379 --> 00:51:13,186
(I'll be there with you)

599
00:51:13,525 --> 00:51:15,320
(I'll be there with you)

600
00:51:15,737 --> 00:51:20,063
(Million stars are shining, casting light on us)

601
00:51:20,351 --> 00:51:24,434
(Mountains and oceans filled with love and trust)

602
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:28,051
(Good or bad, where we are, it doesn’t matter)

603
00:51:28,281 --> 00:51:32,152
(As long as you’re here with me now and forever)

604
00:51:33,204 --> 00:51:37,471
(Million stars are shining, casting light on us)

605
00:51:37,825 --> 00:51:41,945
(Mountains and oceans filled with love and trust)

606
00:51:42,176 --> 00:51:45,477
(Good or bad, where we are, it doesn’t matter)

607
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:48,678
(As long as you’re here with me now and forever)

608
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,804
(Somewhere only we know)

609
00:52:06,714 --> 00:52:08,100
You made me realize that

610
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:15,577
everyone can be at their most beautiful

611
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:20,047
in the way they are and choose to live.

612
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,817
I really want to show people

613
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,390
how beautiful my girlfriend is.

614
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:39,774
You already sing so well.

615
00:52:41,834 --> 00:52:44,814
But there sure will be a slow dance at Ploy’s party.

616
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,460
Have you practiced?

617
00:52:52,872 --> 00:52:53,872
You’re amazing.

618
00:53:09,942 --> 00:53:11,230
She cleared things up with her girlfriend

619
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:13,179
and had her friends clean up afterward.

620
00:53:14,351 --> 00:53:15,725
What kind of person is my friend?

621
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:21,545
Based on what I see, you’re an Aries.

622
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,440
How do you know?

623
00:53:27,465 --> 00:53:28,468
I’m a fortune teller.

624
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:31,850
Are you accurate?

625
00:53:33,737 --> 00:53:34,737
Hm.

626
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,767
You are sweet and kind.

627
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:39,410
You like to keep things to yourself.

628
00:53:39,434 --> 00:53:40,922
You don’t express or talk much.

629
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:45,770
You know that just by looking at me?

630
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:49,390
Otherwise, we wouldn’t be here taking down these bunting flags.

631
00:53:54,251 --> 00:53:56,419
Then I can be a fortune teller too.

632
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:58,651
You’re quite strange.

633
00:53:59,265 --> 00:54:00,265
Suspicious.

634
00:54:01,268 --> 00:54:02,268
Me?

635
00:54:02,798 --> 00:54:04,165
You are Oaboom’s close friend.

636
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,600
You were worried sick when she got injured.

637
00:54:07,493 --> 00:54:08,697
Why are you helping Ai?

638
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:11,715
You could’ve just given her Ploy’s contact.

639
00:54:15,558 --> 00:54:16,565
What are you thinking?

640
00:54:26,072 --> 00:54:27,072
Here you go, Miss.

641
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:29,770
Thank you.

642
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,829
I’ll take it from here, Ms. Nid.

643
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:33,022
Yes, ma’am.

644
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,150
You’re seriously taking her to see your friends.

645
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,900
Aren’t you afraid the secret will be exposed?

646
00:54:48,554 --> 00:54:49,554
I am.

647
00:54:51,047 --> 00:54:52,247
Then why are you bringing her?

648
00:54:53,013 --> 00:54:55,346
If you really want to go, I can take you.

649
00:54:56,758 --> 00:54:57,758
No.

650
00:54:58,487 --> 00:55:02,109
She said she wanted to show people how beautiful her girlfriend is.

651
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:06,112
If I didn’t go, I’d be so mean.

652
00:55:09,497 --> 00:55:11,771
The old Oom, when your sight was perfect,

653
00:55:12,574 --> 00:55:13,974
you never introduced her to anyone.

654
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,336
With the old Oom,

655
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,518
it felt like I loved her past self.

656
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,733
But with this Oom,

657
00:55:28,854 --> 00:55:29,980
even though I can’t see,

658
00:55:31,355 --> 00:55:32,902
I know she’s the one.

659
00:55:35,475 --> 00:55:37,035
Are you sure you’re not mistaken again?

660
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:40,260
I’m sure.

661
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:42,810
The one I love…

662
00:55:44,522 --> 00:55:45,522
is Ai-oon.

663
00:55:55,168 --> 00:55:56,168
Whoa.

664
00:55:57,514 --> 00:55:59,154
Are you sure I want me to drive this car?

665
00:56:01,122 --> 00:56:04,183
This Oom is the only one I trust.

666
00:56:11,408 --> 00:56:12,478
You’re the only one

667
00:56:13,677 --> 00:56:15,210
I’d do this kind of thing for too.

668
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:19,918
(When will you tell her that you know she’s pretending to be Oaboom?)

669
00:56:21,872 --> 00:56:22,872
(Tomorrow night.)

670
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,930
DETECTIVE CHAI

671
00:56:29,555 --> 00:56:30,555
Yes, detective?

672
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:35,328
(Mr. Ton, the person you had me investigate is the one who harmed Ms. May.)

673
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,410
DR. TON

674
00:57:32,029 --> 00:57:34,779
You cleaned up so fast and came back here so soon.

675
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:36,958
Did something happen?

676
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:41,208
I took you out all day.

677
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:43,509
It’s time I take care of you.

678
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:22,970
How does it feel?

679
00:58:28,725 --> 00:58:29,725
Nice.

680
00:58:43,302 --> 00:58:45,259
Don’t spoil me more than you already do.

681
00:58:48,823 --> 00:58:51,423
What if one day I can’t live without you?

682
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:56,277
You’re witty.

683
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:02,517
That’s exactly what I want.

684
00:59:06,435 --> 00:59:07,435
Here.

685
00:59:08,897 --> 00:59:10,217
It’s my turn to take care of you.

686
00:59:10,825 --> 00:59:12,122
And crash here.

687
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,680
Don’t go home.

688
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,400
Here.

689
00:59:39,084 --> 00:59:40,084
Go ahead.

690
00:59:45,139 --> 00:59:46,139
You planned this.

691
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:51,962
I think you’re the one who can’t live without me.

692
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,954
Without you,

693
00:59:59,456 --> 01:00:00,761
who would take care of me?

694
01:00:03,721 --> 01:00:05,001
Without me,

695
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,068
who would take care of you?

696
01:00:13,917 --> 01:00:15,106
I guess that means...

697
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:17,590
we can’t live without each other.

698
01:00:20,087 --> 01:00:22,440
There’s no reason for us to live without each other.

699
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,343
This is my dream.

700
01:00:34,724 --> 01:00:36,484
Lying down while someone’s cleaning my face.

701
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:46,074
Does helping Ai-oon have anything to do with Oaboom?

702
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:47,813
You will find out one day.

703
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,971
This is Oom, my girlfriend.

704
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,371
I will fight anyone

705
01:00:51,675 --> 01:00:53,060
who looks down on my girlfriend.

706
01:00:53,515 --> 01:00:55,060
If I make her mine,

707
01:00:55,797 --> 01:00:57,105
even if she knows the truth,

708
01:00:57,819 --> 01:00:59,174
she won’t leave me again.

709
01:00:59,908 --> 01:01:02,822
Tonight, I’m gonna make Ai-oon mine.

710
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,082
I love you, May.

711
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,220
I love…
