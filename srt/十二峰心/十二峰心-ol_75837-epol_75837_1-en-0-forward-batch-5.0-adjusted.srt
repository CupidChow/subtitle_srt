00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:22,290
(Meiwan Town, 1991)

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,600
(Grandma,)

3
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,039
(I'm going to join you.)

4
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,799
(I really can't hold on any longer.)

5
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,920
(I've tried so hard,)

6
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,520
(exhausting every possible method.)

7
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,280
(But I can never escape Meiwan Town)

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,079
(or get away from him.)

9
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,920
(I'm so tired.)

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,039
(I only have this last bit
of strength left.)

11
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,520
(So I chose this path.)

12
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,920
(Right now, I don't even know
whom to say goodbye to.)

13
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:04,320
(Then let it be
my nineteen-year-old self.)

14
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:09,439
(If my life could start over,)

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,560
(I wish
I could have a chance to choose.)

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,359
(To Ye Haitang, September 3, 1991)

17
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,040
(Goodbye.)

18
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:28,565
(Beixing City, 2026)

19
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,840
Who's it? What are you doing?

20
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,480
Stop!

21
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,560
I can see you.

22
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,560
Listen up.

23
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,400
This pitchfork here won't show mercy.

24
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,208

=Episode 1=
=The Letter Writer=

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,599
Sir,

27
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,719
if you come in daily and won't leave,

28
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll lose my job.

29
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,879
Have some pity on me, will you?

30
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,039
Just do your work.

31
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,719
What work?

32
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,439
My main job is keeping people
from wandering in,

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,560
specifically keeping you out.

34
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,759
I need to get you out.

35
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,800
I'm just a security guard.

36
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,199
This job wasn't easy to get.

37
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,400
Go to my supervisor

38
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,479
if you need anything, okay?

39
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,599
Stop torturing me.

40
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,360
What's today's date?

41
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,919
Dunno. I can't remember either.

42
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,439
Want some?

43
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,088
We've known each other

44
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:46,879
for two months.

45
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,560
That counts as some friendship, right?

46
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,919
Be honest with me.

47
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,719
What are you doing

48
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,039
sitting here every day?

49
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,599
Waiting for a letter.

50
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,599
A letter?

51
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,039
You mean this?

52
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,919
It contains no letters.

53
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,479
Nobody writes letters these days.

54
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,479
It's fake, isn't it?

55
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,800
What are you saying?

56
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,199
It's real!

57
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,120
Okay, it's real.

58
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,639
But they're closing for today.

59
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,840
Come mail tomorrow, okay?

60
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,599
You go ahead.

61
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:23,920
Fine.

62
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,199
Wait all you want then.

63
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,360
Go see a doctor.

64
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,639
Such a nuisance.

65
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,800
Ma'am, can you please
keep an eye on your dad?

66
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,639
They're tearing the place down.
No trespassing.

67
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,639
My coworker and I
fought him this morning.

68
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,519
Just watch your dad, alright?

69
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,319
Let's go home.

70
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,720
I'm not going.

71
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,439
Let's go home, Dad. It's freezing.

72
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,600
It's not time yet.

73
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,560
What 'time'?

74
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,040
Come home with me.

75
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,240
Why?

76
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,079
Why did you come back here again?

77
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,560
You won't stop
until they call the police, will you?

78
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,920
Sir,

79
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,680
you're back.

80
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,360
I'm not moving.

81
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:06,600
Dad.

82
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,240
Sir, we agreed...

83
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,279
Let's talk.

84
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,439
I'm really sorry.

85
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,199
My dad just came from the hospital.

86
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,560
His heart's acting up bad.

87
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,000
The doctor said it's serious.

88
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,600
Why's he
always 'back from the hospital'?

89
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,120
Yes.

90
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,680
Can you move out in the next few days?

91
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,319
My boss said...

92
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,360
We'll definitely move.

93
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,199
I bought the tickets already.
We'll move.

94
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,600
About the terms we agreed on,

95
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,920
I've sorted them out. Look.

96
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,560
Thank you.

97
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,199
Then sign here.

98
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:30,888
- Okay.
- The pen.

99
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,000
How about this?

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,360
Let me check with my dad first.

101
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,560
Then I'll sign it immediately

102
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
and bring it to you.

103
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,439
I know it's been hard for you guys,

104
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,360
coming over here.

105
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,000
It's freezing cold today.

106
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,680
You guys head back to rest first.

107
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,560
Make it quick.

108
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,600
- Sure.
- This is urgent.

109
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,480
My dad needs his meds.

110
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,120
It's his heart.

111
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
Just wait.

112
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,600
Update me soon.

113
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,439
Absolutely.

114
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,439
Thanks. I appreciate it.

115
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,560
Here.

116
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,800
I need your ID card for the tickets.

117
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,439
Your ID card.

118
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:01,920
Fine.

119
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,120
Miaomiao,

120
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,920
can you get me a car?

121
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,399
My dad and I are going

122
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,120
to Beijing.

123
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,480
No need to be big.

124
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,319
Tomorrow or the day after.

125
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,199
Make it fast.

126
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,360
Thank you.

127
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,240
I'm not leaving.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,560
Either

129
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,800
we go to Beijing,

130
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,680
or

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,480
we'll both stay in this dump

132
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,639
and rot here forever.

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,040
I need to call Mingxiao

134
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,240
to have him talk to you.

135
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,560
Why call him?

136
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,879
I broke up with him ages ago.

137
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,560
Why?

138
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,439
Why?

139
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,839
Because he thought I was a burden.

140
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,560
You won't go to Beijing.

141
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
If anything happens here,

142
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,120
I have to rush back.

143
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,680
If you keep making a fuss,

144
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,560
I'll even lose my job in Beijing.

145
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,439
I'll take my meds.

146
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,279
Wait.

147
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,120
Why are you taking meds now?

148
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,600
You refuse to see a doctor.

149
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,120
What good are these meds alone?

150
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,120
Yu Zhiyong,

151
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,680
let's settle this today.

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,160
You keep saying
you're waiting for letters.

153
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,680
Who's actually writing to you?

154
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,800
Not waiting.

155
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,360
I'm sending letters.

156
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,800
I'm sending letters.

157
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,800
I'm done with your nonsense.

158
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,240
Tomorrow,

159
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,360
we're leaving.

160
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,600
No delay.

161
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,000
Nian,

162
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,920
I take the meds.

163
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,560
Go away.

164
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,360
The meds.

165
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,759
The meds.

166
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,600
The meds.

167
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
I'm taking the meds.

168
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,879
Miaomiao.

169
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,639
10 AM works.

170
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,079
Send me the driver's number.

171
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,560
Don't come.

172
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,959
We'll move by ourselves.

173
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,800
I'll message you when we reach Beijing.

174
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,240
Dad,

175
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,440
what would you like?

176
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,200
Dad,

177
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,360
you...

178
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
Where did you go?

179
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,639
(I don't want to leave.)

180
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,799
(I don't want to burden you)

181
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,320
(or make you angry.)

182
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,840
(For me, this illness)

183
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,320
(is not all bad.)

184
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,639
(I need to do something important.)

185
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,320
(When it's done,)

186
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,200
(I'll come back on my own.)

187
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,960
This is my dad.

188
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,440
Officer, this is my dad.

189
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
See? I told you
he was still at the factory.

190
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,919
Let's keep searching.

191
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,799
Wait, are you sure it's him

192
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,039
just from that back view?

193
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,039
I'm sure.

194
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,440
That's what he was wearing.

195
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,320
He's been showing up
around here a lot lately.

196
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,039
The factory was checked.

197
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,000
He's not here.

198
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,600
How about this?

199
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,039
We'll head back to the station,

200
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,399
review the nearby surveillance footage,

201
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,039
and keep searching with patrol cars.

202
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,840
Don't panic.

203
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,039
Officer, here's the thing.

204
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,720
My dad sometimes

205
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,840
gets confused.

206
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,200
I'm very worried about him

207
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,639
now that he's out there alone.

208
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,639
You knew about your dad's condition

209
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,519
and you provoked him?

210
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,320
Yeah, that was my fault.

211
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,200
Head back first.

212
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,679
We'll call you if anything comes up.

213
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,559
(Security Room)
Okay.

214
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,200
Bye, officers.

215
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,440
Call me immediately
if there's news, officers.

216
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:13,919
Okay.

217
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,639
Thank you.

218
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,759
Ma'am? Ma'am?

219
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,600
Ma'am?

220
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,440
Do you need something?

221
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,440
Hello.

222
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,399
I'm Zhang Quan,

223
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,200
a security guard.

224
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,159
Do you remember me?

225
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,080
You picked up your dad from me.

226
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,679
I gave him a band-aid that time.

227
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,919
I remember you.

228
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,000
Do you need something?

229
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,240
Your dad's missing, isn't he?

230
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,440
Have you seen him?

231
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,799
Let me be clear first.

232
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,080
I'm not crazy.

233
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
I'm telling the truth.

234
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,440
If you believe me, I'll tell...

235
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,960
I believe you. Go ahead.

236
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,200
That night,

237
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,639
I was at my post doing my job...

238
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,320
Fine! You want to play it this way?

239
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,399
Sneaking over while I was asleep.

240
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,600
Sir, you're back again.

241
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,080
Why not come inside for dumplings?

242
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,519
You're late today.

243
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,279
What? Expecting letters again?

244
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,039
I'm mailing a letter.

245
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,679
Mailing now, huh?

246
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,200
Alright. Leave after mailing it, okay?

247
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,039
Go home, okay?

248
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:49,200
Just go.

249
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,440
Sir?

250
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,639
What now?

251
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,679
Playing hide-and-seek?

252
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,399
I see you there.

253
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:12,559
Sir?

254
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,559
This is getting creepy.

255
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,039
What? Did he crawl into the mailbox?

256
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,440
So you're saying

257
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,480
the letter just disappeared?

258
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,559
The letter's gone.

259
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,039
And so is he.

260
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,200
Stop talking nonsense, will you?

261
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,320
If you did see my dad,

262
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,080
try to remember which direction he went.

263
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,159
So I can tell the police
for them to search properly.

264
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,279
Why are you like this?

265
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,679
Didn't I just tell you?

266
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,200
You said

267
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,496
you believed me, so I told you.

268
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,919
What would I gain from lying?

269
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,080
Ma'am, let's stop talking here.

270
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,720
This place feels creepy. Let's go.

271
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,799
You go.

272
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,600
You won't leave? Fine.

273
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,679
Stay here by yourself then.

274
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,799
You are both nuts.

275
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,519
The letter's really gone?

276
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,440
Dad,

277
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,440
please come home.

278
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,159
I was wrong before.

279
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,279
I shouldn't have pushed.

280
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,159
Come back.

281
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,600
We won't move.

282
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Whatever issues we have,

283
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,679
let's discuss them properly.

284
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:52,559
Was that the cat?

285
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,120
Ma'am, don't be scared.

286
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,080
The cat meowed, right?

287
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,279
The same cat you mentioned?

288
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,279
Yes.

289
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,440
Don't be afraid.

290
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,000
Hurry.

291
00:13:59,399 --> 00:13:59,960
Get up.

292
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:14,960
Ma'am,

293
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,440
last time after this happened,
your dad disappeared.

294
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,399
There's really a reply letter.

295
00:14:49,992 --> 00:14:55,752
(To Ye Haitang, September 3, 1991)

296
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:05,864
(Meiwan Town, 1991)

297
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,799
Cha.

298
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,200
Did you check the boat?

299
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,960
Yes.

300
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,080
We're still way short on cash.

301
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,799
Need over ten thousand.

302
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,799
Buying a big boat isn't easy.

303
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,256
Both jobs are west of the bridge.

304
00:15:59,039 --> 00:15:59,919
Don't mess up.

305
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,720
When you're done,

306
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,200
meet Bao tonight.

307
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,000

Today's the 7th-day memorial.

337
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,519
My condolences.

338
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,640
This is Ye Yibo's IOU.

339
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,759
(IOU)
1,000 yuan.

340
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,720
We're collecting it.

341
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,599
I don't have money.

342
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,519
So you don't have to pay?

343
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,079
Ye Yibo owes you the money.

344
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,000
Go to him.

345
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,519
Take the stuff.

346
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,359
There's nothing here.

347
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,440
What are you doing?

348
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:42,079
We'll just take some stuff
as collateral.

349
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,359
When your dad comes home,

350
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,599
have him bring the money to me.

351
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,792
Today's my grandma's 7th-day memorial.

352
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,519
Please leave.

353
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
No money, you said?

354
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,599
There's over 100 here.

355
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,759
Perfect.

356
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,440
No need to take anything.

357
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,119
It was my grandma's money.

358
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,440
Put it back.

359
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,960
To honor your grandma,
we won't take anything.

360
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,720
But tell Ye Yibo

361
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,440
he must pay next month.

362
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:17,440
Give it back.

363
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,039
What's this?

364
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,000
Give it back!

365
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,839
We're just doing our job.

366
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,160
We want no trouble.

367
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,720
So cut it.

368
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,599
You won't like how this ends.

369
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,759
Xun, time to work.

370
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,359
That girl's actually pretty pitiful.

371
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,440
Having a dad like that.

372
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
Aren't you pitiful?

373
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,200
Xun, hurry up.

374
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,000
Sorry. Sorry.

375
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,680
It's fine.

376
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,960
Thank you.

377
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,720
Let me help.

378
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,480

What's wrong, Mr. Wang?

382
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:46,640
Tired?

00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,160
Stay away.

514
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,279
You didn't finish senior year

515

This time, focus on
completing the year properly.

517

College is another story.

518
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,720
Get a high school diploma first

519

after class, take him
to get teaching materials

551
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:14,000
and

552
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,640

553

Okay.

554
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,799
Okay, class begins.

555
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,039
Stand up.

556
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:25,039
Good morning, teacher.

557
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,039
Good morning, everyone.
Sit down, please.

558
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:29,279
Open the book.

559
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,279
Turn to page eight.

560
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:37,039
'Ahead of'

561
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,640
means preceding in position,

562
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,559
superior to, or taking the lead.

563
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,680
It's different from

564
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,519
our familiar

565
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:43,359
'in front of'.

566
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,519
It carries

567
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,559
the connotation of excelling in ability.

00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:53,039
Let's hang out.

570
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,599
Stop studying.

571
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,160
What's happening?

572
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:27,519
What do you want?

573
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,279
Where's your old school?

574
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:34,640
Third High School.

575
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,199
You hang around Old Street,
west of the bridge?

576
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,480
I live there.

577
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,519
Know Qiang from Old Street?

578
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,960
No.

579
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,839
I'm Shen Xiaojun.

580
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,599
Come to me if you need anything.

581
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,519
His older brother works with Qiang.

582
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:51,079
He's got connections there.

583
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,079
Got it.

584
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:53,920
Do you play ball?

585
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:54,960
Let's play for a bit.

586
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:56,359
I need to go.

587
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:56,920
Next time.

588
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,480
He's so pretentious.

589
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,799
Where could he possibly need to go?

590
00:33:12,872 --> 00:33:17,960
(Meiwan High School of Fu'an County)

591
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,759
- What's this?
- Return the money.

592
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,079
Or I'll call the police.

593
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:36,424
I don't have it.

594
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,880
You're in cahoots.

595
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,656
You won't escape if I call the police.

596
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:44,079
Your dad owes money.

597
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,160
And debts must be paid, you know?

598
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,960
If you don't pay,

599
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,279
I'll report to the school

600
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,440
that you robbed me.

601
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,799
Your schooling will be over.

602
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:53,359
Go ahead then.

603
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,039
It was my grandma's.

604
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,039
You have to return it.

605
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,200
Tang.

606
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:07,160
If your dad had paid his debt,

607
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,240
nothing would've happened.

608
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,000
What did he say?

609
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,800
Just asked about the schedule.

610
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,360
By the way,

611
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:23,920
we heard he's a hooligan.

612
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,239
Zhou Peng saw him
at the Old Street pool hall.

613
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,760
Doesn't look like one.

614
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,440
I don't go to Old Street much.

615
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,320
Just keep your distance.

616
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:39,272
(Sunshine Bookstore)

617
00:34:53,501 --> 00:34:56,681
(Your wishes will shine into reality
like the northern lights.)

618
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:02,719
Sir.

619
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,519
These mosquitoes are vicious.

620
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,480
Tang,

621
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,320
here's your last month's wages.

622
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,199
Count it.

623
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,079
Thank you, sir.

624
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:15,519
No problem.

625
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
Since we've

626
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,800
stocked new postcards

627
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,119
and stationery supplies recently,

628
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,119
my wife wants to run an event.

629
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,079
Can you organize it?

630
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,159
What kind of event?

631
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,519
Something like

632
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,880
writing to your future self

633
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,280
to share thoughts.

634
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,079
So you can read it

635
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,159
to revisit those thoughts.

636
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,199
Okay.

637
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,639
Refine the idea.

638
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:35,800
Think of a catchy title.

639
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,480
I'm on it.

640
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:49,920
Cha,

641
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:51,519
got any work today?

642
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,280
You're in school now.

643
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,280
Can you still do it?

644
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:55,840
I can.

645
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,320
Alright.

646
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,760
Let's go to the dock.

647
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,599
Okay.

648
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:10,000
(Art Design)

649
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,760
Tang.

650
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,280
Take these cardboard boxes

651
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,400
to sell yourself later.

652
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,480
Thank you, sir.

653
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:17,800
Sure.

654
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,639
Take a look.

655
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,639
You're done?

656
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,480
Write a letter to your future self.

657
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:24,599
The title's good.

658
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,280
When people write letters,

659
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,519
how should we handle them?

660
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,639
Should we mail them?

661
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,119
We're just running an event.

662
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,320
Our main goal is to sell products.

663
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,760
My wife learned this

664
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,079
from people in the city.

665
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,079
Consider it like writing a diary.

666
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,280
So it's fake.

667
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,880
You're missing the point.

668
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,480
What's a diary's purpose?

669
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,320
To express feelings, right?

670
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:45,800
The feelings are genuine.

671
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:47,599
And we'll properly

672
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,920
store the letters.

673
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,119
They can view or retrieve them

674
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:51,039
anytime.

675
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,119
I'll write one.

676
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:53,760
And you too.

677
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:54,400
Okay.

678
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,800
For those postcards, stationery,
and envelopes,

679
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,960
take whatever you like.

680
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:58,840
Alright?

681
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:00,960
I'm picking up Hu. See you later.

682
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:01,880
Thank you, sir.

684
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:15,760
Miss.

685
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,719
Miss.

686
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,159
You don't need the cardboards, right?

687
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,639
Do you take cardboards?

688
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:24,599
Can...

689
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,880
can you give them to me?

690
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:30,079
Fine, you can have them.

691
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:31,320
Great, thanks.

692
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,960
I'll put them on your cart.

693
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:33,920
Okay.

694
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,400
Thank you.

695
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,920
Thank you.

696
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:41,679
No worries.

697
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,199
Thank you.

698
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:49,760
No worries.

699
00:38:11,197 --> 00:38:15,848
(Buddies Billiards)

700
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,880
It was tough.

701
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,320
You were quick-witted.

702
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,360
Or he would've escaped.

703
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,440
You okay, Xun?

704
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,119
I'm fine.

705
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,760
You know what?

706
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:38,800
The guy we beat today with the mustache

707
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,199
is from Bao's hometown.

708
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,960
You think he'll tell Bao?

709
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,920
Bao wouldn't have given us the IOU

710
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,639
if he actually cared.

711
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,280
But if Bao finds out

712
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,840
we beat that guy up like that,

713
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,719
he might get pissed.

714
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,719
So what?

715
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,000
Our job was never about

716
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,880
being polite.

717
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:54,960
I did the math.

718
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,480
In at most one month,

719
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,960
we can buy a boat.

720
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,440
A ten-meter trawler that can sail

721
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,039
at least 50 nautical miles.

722
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,320
Then we'll leave
this crap business to Bao

723
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,000
and make some decent money.

724
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,360
Awesome.

725
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,400
I've hated those guys for ages.

726
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,760
Then we can transport

727
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,320
something like clothing or stuff.

728
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,960
We'll make a thousand per trip.

729
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,360
Nice.

730
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,480
But won't Bao think

731
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,639
we're stealing his business?

732
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,079
He's got people

733
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,400
working on boats too.

734
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:21,519
Don't forget.

735
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,320
We'll run a legitimate business.

736
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:25,119
Bao doesn't own the sea.

737
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,800
If he does 1,000, I'll do 800.

738
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,960
If he does 800, I'll do 500.

739
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,159
So what if we undercut him?

740
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,679
I'll even do 300.

741
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,320
Come on.

742
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:39,760
By the way,

743
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,360
forget about Ye Yibo's uncollected debt.

744
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:49,320
Why?

745
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,119
Nothing particular.

746
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:52,199
Let Bao's men handle those small jobs.

747
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,440
We only take big deals.

748
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,639
Then Ye Yibo's daughter will suffer.

749
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,119
Bao's crew collects debts
with brutal methods.

750
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,159
A bunch of scumbags.

751
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:20,079
Good morning, sir.

752
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:20,840
Morning.

753
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,159
Where did this mailbox come from?

754
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,000
No idea.

755
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,199
No idea who left it.

756
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,119
Right.

757
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,639
It has a letter for you.

758
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,440
For me?

759
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,480
Yes.

760
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,760
I found it inside it.

761
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,360
Who'd write me a letter?

762
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,840
(To Ye Haitang)
No idea.

763
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,760
Who did this?

764
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,840
Why did they put a crappy mailbox

765
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,639
before my shop?

766
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:42,920
Thank you.

767
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:43,920
No worries.

768
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,320
We're running an event.

769
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,119
This mailbox can help.

770
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,079
We can have people put the letters here.

771
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,239
Okay then.

772
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,079
You go get a lock.

773
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,119
Lock this up.

774
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:00,559
I...

775
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:01,119
The school.

776
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,000
I'll get it.

777
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,800
You go to school.

778
00:41:34,717 --> 00:41:37,832
(Meiwan High School of Fu'an County)

779
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,039
Didn't we just pay this last semester?

780
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,000
Why are we paying again?

781
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,159
Miss Tan decides class fund usage.

782
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:03,639
Go to her if you have issues.

783
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:04,800
Wow.

784
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:07,119
You're really her pet.

785
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,679
So you're the class monitor.

786
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:10,880
Do you get a cut from the class fund?

787
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,920
Three yuan for class fund.

788
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,719
Fine, monitor.

789
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:14,679
How about

790
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,920
I give you ten yuan,

791
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,239
and you make me vice monitor?

792
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:20,119
Here's your seven yuan.

793
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:22,400
Ask the teachers
about becoming the monitor.

794
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,960
She gave you seven yuan.

795
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,199
Does that mean a 'no'?

796
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:27,880
Why are you so nosy?

797
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,559
Three yuan for class fund.

798
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:51,800
Come out.

799
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,960
What are you doing?

800
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:09,800
Unlike you,

801
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,239
Ye Haitang surely did her homework.

802
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,719
Stop messing with her belongings.

803
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:15,360
What's wrong
with studying her math paper?

804
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:17,320
Shen Xiaojun, why are you so annoying?

805
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:18,880
She'll scold you when she's back.

806
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,719
I don't fear her.

807
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:29,360
What?

808
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,800
I'm warning you.

809
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:33,599
Don't think

810
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:34,800
you can bully me freely.

811
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,239
If you write me that stuff again,

812
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,000
I'll just

813
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,880
call the police.

814
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:40,719
What did I write?

815
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,880
What are you saying?

816
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:44,760
I'm not afraid of you guys.

817
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,320
Explain yourself clearly.

818
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:53,599
Tang,

819
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,960
we're both people
who crawled out of the muddy pit.

820
00:43:57,239 --> 00:43:59,320
No one understands better than us

821
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:02,079
how pathetic and insignificant we were.

822
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,280
Stop laughing.

823
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,960
The next part's even cornier.

824
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,280
I can't even read it aloud.

825
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,880
Tang, no matter how much time passes,

826
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,920
I still deeply yearn for you.

827
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,840
I've never forgotten

828
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,679
our time together.

829
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:18,280
Shen Xiaojun!

830
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,400
Give it back!

831
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:31,000
Tang, I'll never forget you.

832
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,719
Xun.

833
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,800
Who's Xun?

834
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,559
You can guess.

835
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:40,119
Look, Xun's here.

836
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,719
- Xun!
- Xun!

837
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,840
Why did you kick me?

838
00:44:54,679 --> 00:44:55,400
What is this?

839
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,800
Tang Yixun, can't you read?

840
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,960
You wrote this love letter.

841
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,000
Don't you know?

842
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:02,519
Don't tear it.

843
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:03,440
Are you feeling shy?

844
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:04,599
What are you doing?

845
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:10,440
Tang Yixun,

846
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:12,239
you came here days ago.

847
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:13,599
What did you promise me?

848
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,840
I didn't write it.

849
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,000
Then who did?

850
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,960
How would I know?

851
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:18,440
I definitely didn't write it.

852
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,119
Tang, you speak.

853
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:22,000
Don't be afraid. Just say the truth.

854
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,559
He gave it to you, didn't he?

855
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,119
Explain quickly.

856
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,000
Hand off. Stand still!

857
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,079
Say something!

858
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:31,719
Tell her

859
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:33,079
who wrote this to you.

860
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:38,000
You go back first.

861
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:47,519
Tang Yixun,

862
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,119
I enrolled you here to study,

863
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,440
not to get involved in this nonsense.

864
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,280
I didn't do it.

865
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,079
Isn't this

866
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:56,559
your handwriting?

867
00:45:57,199 --> 00:45:58,440
The writing looks like mine.

868
00:45:58,639 --> 00:45:59,440
But I didn't do it.

869
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:00,000
You didn't?

870
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,960
Then who did? Me?

871
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,519
What other 'Xun' is there?

872
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:04,559
Still refusing to admit it?

873
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:07,280
When did you become like this?

874
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,320
Go and write a self-criticism.

875
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,400
I won't write it.

876
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,400
I didn't write this letter.

877
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:15,559
Why self-criticism?

878
00:46:19,709 --> 00:46:21,519
(Zihua Pavilion)

879
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:22,159
Class dismissed.

880
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:22,880
Stand up.

881
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,639
Goodbye, sir.

882
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,440
Goodbye.

883
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:30,719
Leaving first.

884
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:32,159
Bye.

885
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,719
What are you doing?

886
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:03,320
Where did the letter come from?

887
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:04,719
Ye Haitang's backpack.

888
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,960
Did you do this?

889
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,079
It wasn't me.

890
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:08,320
Your name was on it.

891
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:10,440
Besides, I can't write that well.

892
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:14,519
Listen to me.

893
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,559
If I find out you're involved in this,

894
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,440
I'll break your arm.

895
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:22,880
Tang Yixun,

896
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:25,719
what are you doing?

897
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:27,079
Let go.

898
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:33,519
Let go.

899
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,840
Let go!

900
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:46,880
When I arrived at noon today,

901
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,199
I heard several parents
discussing this matter.

902
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,280
How could you
make such a mistake at school?

903
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,199
Thankfully Miss Tan caught it in time.

904
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:57,880
Tang,

905
00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:00,559
you've made me and Miss Tan worry.

906
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,000
It isn't Tang's fault.

907
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:04,840
As her homeroom teacher,

908
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,880
I'm responsible too.

909
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:06,599
No.

910
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,199
The responsibility lies entirely
with me as her father.

911
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:10,880
Because of my job,

912
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,760
I've neglected Tang's upbringing.

913
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:14,280
I've failed the school

914
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,280
and failed her.

915
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:16,880
Please don't say that.

916
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:18,599
We're not here today to blame

917
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:19,880
anyone for responsibility.

918
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:23,199
Miss Tan, as you know,

919
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:25,719
Tang's always been sensible.

920
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,280
Her grandma's passing

921
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:30,079
hit her very hard.

922
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,960
And I've been away from home so long.

923
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,079
Given their age,

924
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,079
I believe

925
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:39,239
they're just trying to make friends.

926
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:40,000
Right.

927
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,880
I hope you

928
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,719
can give them a chance to correct this.

929
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:45,079
I'll talk to her properly at home.

930
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,320
This won't happen again.

931
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,519
But please don't be hard on her.

932
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:51,760
This really isn't Tang's fault.

933
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,880
Senior year is stressful.

934
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,079
And girls are more sensitive.

935
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,079
She might need more attention at home.

936
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,639
We appreciate your kindness.

937
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:00,440
Not at all.

938
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,480
So he is the...

939
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:04,639
the boy?

940
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,760
Stand up.

941
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:11,840
What's your name?

942
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,440
His name is Tang Yixun.

943
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,880
Tang.

944
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,400
Look at you, such a fine young man.

945
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:29,079
Focus on your studies.

946
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,880
I'm not against you making friends,

947
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,960
but don't let this
affect your schoolwork.

948
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:34,559
And you mustn't do anything

949
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:35,960
that goes against student ethics.

950
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:37,440
Don't you agree?

951
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:41,079
Who are you to lecture me?

952
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:43,559
And that letter

953
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,360
has nothing to do with me.

954
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:46,440
Tang Yixun!

955
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,880
Miss Tan.

956
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:50,280
Haven't we already settled this matter?

957
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,280
I'm not trying to give you a hard time.

958
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,119
I just hope that this incident

959
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,519
can be treated as a joke this time.

960
00:49:56,519 --> 00:49:57,719
But you have to promise me

961
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:00,079
there absolutely

962
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:02,079
won't be a next time.

963
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,079
Don't worry. There won't be a next time.

964
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:10,679
Miss Tan,

965
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:11,960
where's that letter?

966
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,960
It was a joke.

967
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,840
I've thrown it away.

968
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,960
Let's just let this matter pass.

969
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:22,199
Okay, let's drop it then.

970
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:23,719
Thank you for coming.

971
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:24,599
Let me walk you out.

972
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:26,079
Alright.

973
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,239
Let's go home, Tang.

974
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,519
(Tang,)

975
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,679
(I wanted to free you
from this endless suffering.)

976
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,079
(But I never imagined)

977
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,039
(I was opening another abyss.)

978
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,039
(The abyss is worse than a pit.)

979
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:06,280
(Because demons)

980
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,679
(lurk in the abyss.)
