County Owner

My lady,

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,680
the book is upside down.

4
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,920
Why do you keep a straight face every day?

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,520
You can still laugh.

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,680
How can you say so many words at a time?

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm not in the mood to joke with you.

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,000
How about I lend you my shoulder and cry for a while?

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,240
Are you okay?

You look so good. Zhi,

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,680
I'm not your second brother.

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,280
Second brother,

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,520
have a grape.

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,840
Zhi,

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm not you.

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,640
Second Brother.

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,640
Did you come back from the prison?

20
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,680
I want to see him.

21
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,120
Zhi,

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,960
what are you thinking?

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,720
Do you want General Ye's soul

24
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,840
not to rest in peace?

25
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,520
I just want to know the truth.

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,240
The truth is that he has admitted it.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,080
It's written in black and white.

28
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,400
Count the time.

29
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,479
The poisoned wine should be here.

30
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,760
He told me to tell you,

31

Aunt, calm down! Bullshit!

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,040
Calm down.

34
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,280
Qinglang,

35
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,880
leave Zhi alone.

36
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,360
Chuan Gu,

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,840
what's wrong with you?

38
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,080
Marquis is wise,

39
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,320
Kawagu

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,400
Luckily, you won't disgrace your life.

I'll see you off, Your Grace.

46
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,160
My Lord, My Lord,

47
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,640
have you really made up your mind?

48
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,040
How dare you!

49
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,280
How dare I stop you?
