1
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,920
Wait for my husband.

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,320
Dear, wait for me.

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,200
My Lord,

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,120
Wei Shangzhi,

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,240
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,240
I didn't want you to get angry,

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,840
so I left you

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,960
a limited set meal of drumsticks,

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,920
Do you want some?

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,360
And croquettes.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,200
And fruit candy and peanut butter,

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
I'll give you everything I have.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,160
Bie Sheng

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,200
Just ignore it.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,480
Dog man.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,520
Miss,

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,600
if this trend goes on,

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,120
Your divorce letter will be available soon.

19
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,840
Come on.

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,400
I have faith in you.

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,400
and Li Shu

22
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,880
Zhi and his wife are at odds.

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,160
Who is talking nonsense?

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,480
In less than an hour,

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,680
I want to see the latest issue.

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,080
Why would anyone buy a hot search? Right

27
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,120
This one

28
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,080
The eyes of the crowd are sharp, right?

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,520
He didn't wait for you.

30
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
If you call him,

31
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,000
he won't talk to him.

32
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,840
Men are dogs.

33
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,960
None of them are good.

34
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,240
But,

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,960
Master,

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,440
Eldest Young Master,

37
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,960
Second Young Master,

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,760
Except.

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,000
My father,

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,760
elder brother,

41
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,760
My brother-in-law,

42
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,880
too.

43
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,360
You can just sign up for him.

44
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,880
Yes, he … Wei Shangzhi …

45
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,000
He … Ancestor,

46
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,760
How dare you say that.

47
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,520
Do you want to die?

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,120
Wei Shangzhi,

49
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,920
the dog man,

50
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,720
Dog man,

51
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,360
dog man,

52
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,360
Chuangu,

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,080
check Suqiu,

54
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,200
Also,

55
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
go get Bai Xuan,

56
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,400
I understand,

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,160
His Lordship is wise.

58
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,560
Lianxing

59
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,040
Kill who?

60
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,680
If you don't kill anyone this time,

61
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,720
you pretend to be a maid,

62
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,480
Serve Her Ladyship in her room.

63
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,080
Write down her preferences.

64
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,520
Yes.

65
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,800
You may leave.

66
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,440
Sister,

67
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,080
don't be angry.

68
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,800
I was so angry that I had no one to replace me.

69
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:37,840
Come on,

70
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,960
Eat chicken legs to calm down.

71
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,040
Men are good-looking,

72
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,800
aren't they?

73
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,320
You've already let her get angry,

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,920
don't you want her to be angry?

75
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
He's not clear-headed.

76
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,320
You're not clear-headed either.

77
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,560
If I go out to play with my brother,

78
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,960
what kind of green grassland is it?

79
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,680
Unless none of you are my brother.

80
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,440
You're not my brothers.

81
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,080
Sister,

82
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,440
I've told you so many times.

83
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,680
What about that?

84
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:14,960
Am I right?

85
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,279
But,

86
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,360
it's really not what you think.

87
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,080
What are you looking at?

88
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,760
Idiot,

89
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,440
who are you scolding?

90
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,160
I'm telling you, I'm a big brother,

91
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
big brother,

92
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,720
Your Ladyship,

93
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,560
what's your name?

94
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,200
Lianxing,

95
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:52,960
You.

96
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,040
Can't you just say a few more words?

97
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,440
Sister,

98
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,760
let's ignore her.

99
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,200
Look,

100
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,760
What did he bring you?

101
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,720
Brother is better in the world.

102
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,360
Come on,

103
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,120
Look,

104
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,240
big brother,

105
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,560
I scolded her for you.

106
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,800
What do you think?

107
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,920
Do you feel happier?

108
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,480
Are you happy now?

109
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,200
Okay,

110
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,960
Take a look.

111
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,040
I'll leave first.

112
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,680
My lady,

113
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,440
my lady,

114
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,440
Miss,

115
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,200
her name is Her Ladyship.
