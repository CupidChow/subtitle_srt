1
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,920
In addition to the nickname,

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,920
the truth about Ye Jiajun's tragic death turned out to be,

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,240
I can't believe the food hasn't arrived yet.

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,080
Which beast killed thousands of knives?

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,400
Don't let me catch him.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,000
No wonder when Mr. Ye died,

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,320
his stomach was full of rotten leaves,

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,000
Jerk.

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,800
You're a beast.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,480
Jerk! Jerk!

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,360
Kill Duke Jingbei,

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,680
and avenge the Ye Army.

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,240
Smash this shabby marquis mansion.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,960
My Lady,

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,760
it's said outside that

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,240
Ye Jiajun died in battle,

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,240
It's because Marquis Jingbei embezzled military food.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,640
Really?

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,520
It's spread outside.

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,200
My Lady,

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,960
you should divorce him.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,880
If this goes on,

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,440
you'll get the Bai family into trouble.

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,360
But,

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,040
Wei Shangzhi,

26
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,960
It's actually quite good.

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,440
No buts.

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,480
Actually what?

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,560
Sit down.

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:23,880
Take it.

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,120
Come on.

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,680
Let me think about it.

33
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,400
What are you doing?

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,040
It's not my second brother's. You'll know

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,160
when you look at it.

36
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,720
Zhi,

37
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,920
I'm sorry to let you read this letter.

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,280
This is the last thing I want to see.

39
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,080
You and I are not in-laws of the Bai family,

40
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,440
but your family name is Ye,

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,960
She's General Ye's daughter.

42
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,320
My surname is Lin,

43
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,360
and I'm the son of a lieutenant general.

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,080
Back then, Muyun could have won a great victory,

45
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,880
but because he defended his title, he colluded with the enemy,

46
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,520
After deducting grain and grass,

47
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,440
my father risked his life to send you and me away.

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,680
I was hunted down all the way.

49
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,600
Father died.

50
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,560
I took you all the way to Chengen Temple.

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,760
I met Madam Bai who prayed for blessings.

52
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,720
As for what happened later,

53
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,280
you know everything.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,240
Finally, General Ye is determined not to wait.

55
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,200
He tightened his belt

56
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,640
and went into battle,

57
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,760
Until the last moment of the battle,

58
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,440
there was a lot of blood on the battlefield,

59
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,840
Broken limbs and ruins,

60
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,240
yellow sand all over the sky,

61
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,800
Even General Ye

62
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,840
was stabbed into a hedgehog.

63
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,760
But the flag in his hand is still high.

64
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,040
Madam Ye jumped on the city wall,

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,160
died in the city,

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,240
The sun is like blood,

67
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,560
the flag flutters in the wind,

68
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,920
At the moment when the Western Cool Dog

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,839
was about to cut down the flag,

70
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,440
Listen only

71
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,200
An arrow,

72
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,960
coming with the howling wind.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,760
Reinforcements have finally arrived.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,600
Get out of the way!

75
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,520
Your Ladyship, please go back.

76
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,720
Wei Shangzhi asked you to stop me.

77
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,040
So he knew long ago that

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,640
I was the only one who acted like a fool.

79
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,600
You knew it, didn't you?

80
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,160
Is this funny?

81
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,160
Zhi.

82
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,440
Listen to me,

83
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,040
listen to how your father deducted grain and grass,

84
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,320
Harm my parents and brothers,

85
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,600
or listen to you tell me how you control the state affairs?

86
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,080
Killing innocent people indiscriminately.

87
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,840
Zhi,

88
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
calm down.

89
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,960
Okay,

90
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,840
I'll calm down.

91
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,960
Didn't you ask me to calm down?

92
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,640
If you tear one,

93
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,560
I'll write one,

94
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,880
If you tear ten letters,

95
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,960
I'll write ten letters.

96
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,480
Angelica dahurica,

97
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,400
Heli,

98
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,400
You can't

99
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,720
take good care of Her Ladyship.

100
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,320
If there's a hair missing,

101
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,160
and you're the only one asking,

102
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,160
Don't worry.

103
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,000
Father,

104
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,760
Mother,

105
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,080
Brother,

106
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,160
Zhi will avenge you!
