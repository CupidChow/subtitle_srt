1
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,800
Ye Jiajun, who can still find the body,

2
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,200
is buried here.

3
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:33,720
Yes.

4
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,200
(His Lordship took Hua Hua to look for it) (Hua Hua,

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,440
Yes

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,400
I don't want them to be disturbed after death.

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,880
So no monument was erected.

8
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,520
His first six wives,

9
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,400
who were not spies,

10
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,320
It's a warrior of death.

11
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,800
He killed all those who wanted to die as an example.

12
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,080
It can still be saved.

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,040
So I let them all go.

14
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,680
Did they...

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,040
Did they?

16
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,320
Is there?

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,720
Is there?

18
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
Is there?

19
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,240
Is there anything?

20
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,720
Lianxing,

21
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,600
I found that you're a bad student

22
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,520
when you're with him.

23
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,680
I'm not.

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,920
Don't talk nonsense.

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,600
Are you shy?

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,720
Do you have it or not?

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,720
No.

28
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,960
You're finally back.

29
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,480
Do you miss me?

30
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,479
Yes,

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,920
I heard Mr. Shu's storybook every day. It's embarrassing for me

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,440
to listen to your story like this.

33
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,240
I'll leave then.

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,720
As a man,

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,120
you can bend and stretch.

36
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,880
Welcome back.

37
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,720
Bongtian carried the emperor's edict

38
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,080
and said,

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,000
Bai Xuan has made great achievements in defending the enemy,

40
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,360
and he has made Marquis An,

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,280
Bestow Marquis An's Mansion.

42
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,200
General Lin Qinglang of Dingyuan has made great achievements in defending the enemy,

43
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,520
so he appointed the gatekeeper of Muyun City

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,880
and granted Ye surname

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,520
to lead the army of the Ye family

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
to lead the troops to battle?

47
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,480
He was defeated by Xiliang

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,240
and reinstated.

49
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,720
The Princess of Yongle County

50
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,480
will get married on another day.

51
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,480
This is the order.

52
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,640
It's the right time

53
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,520
to get off the sedan chair.

54
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,040
First bow to heaven and earth.

55
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,040
Second, bow to the court.

56
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,240
Couples bow to each other.

57
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
A toast to tea.

58
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,680
Father-in-law, please have some tea. Father, Mother, please have some tea.

59
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,640
Brother-in-law

60
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,880
and brother?

61
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,240
Brother,

62
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,360
Go,

63
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,840
What's it to you?

64
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,560
Good son-in-law,

65
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,520
ignore him.

66
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,520
Lianxing,

67
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,520
they are bullying me.

68
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,360
Get lost!

69
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,120
Husband

70
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,320
Your Ladyship.

71
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,440
Okay.

72
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,920
Zhizhi and his wife are true love.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,880
I ship them.

74
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,160
Let me see. Let me see.

75
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,720
Let me see. Did Xingxuan give out candy today?

76
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,080
Have a good fight.

77
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,800
Don't let me

78
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,120
put down that secret weapon first.

79
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,600
My sister

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,960
has been married twice.

81
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,040
I can't fall behind as a brother, can I?

82
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,640
So,

83
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,840
when are you going to marry me?

84
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,520
Let's talk about it after beating me.

85
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,760
It's scary.

86
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,200
Uncle Ye,

87
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,840
Qinglang avenged you.

88
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,760
Xiliang cut the land for peace,

89
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,640
in exchange for 50 years of peace,

90
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,240
Now the country is peaceful

91
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,000
and the people are happy,

92
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
You can rest in peace.

93
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,800
General,

94
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,200
about the fake imperial edict,

95
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,120
Did you really do it?

96
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,000
If it weren't for His Majesty's permission,

97
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,720
how would I have the courage?

98
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,920
Wei Shangzhi.

99
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,520
No wonder my brother is so loyal to him.

100
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,320
General

101
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,840
I heard that Her Grace is pregnant,

102
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,880
right?

103
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
It's going to be produced in a few days.

104
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,720
It's good.

105
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,920
General,

106
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,600
don't you want to go back and have a look?

107
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,120
No, thanks.

108
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,400
-Congratulations, My Lord. -Congratulations,

109
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,600
My Lord.

110
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,760
A pair of twins.

111
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,480
Your Ladyship.

112
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
Dear,

113
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,880
I'm here.

114
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,240
I'm here.

115
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,960
Crab, coix seed, candied haws,

116
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,400
longan, litchi and crispy cheese,

117
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,080
Take what you didn't allow me to eat before.

118
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,560
All of them.

119
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,520
Okay,

120
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,120
Yes.
