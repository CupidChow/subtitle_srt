1
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,640
It's a dead end.

2
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,280
Your Majesty, you played

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,680
a good chess game.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,600
Have you really thought it through?

5
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,760
I have no regrets.

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,840
In that case,

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,280
I know,

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,360
The way to be a king.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,200
You must care about the people.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,600
Check and balance the imperial court.

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,680
His Majesty is a master now.

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,680
Goodbye, Wei Shangzhi.

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,280
Somebody

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,000
Prepare the imperial edict.

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,600
His Lordship is wise,

16
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,360
Chuangu will not disgrace his life.

17
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,360
Here comes the imperial edict.

18
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,840
Bongtian carried the emperor's edict

19
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,960
and said,

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,440
Defending the title for taking bribes and breaking the law,

21
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,760
embezzling military food,

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,000
That led to the tragic death of Ye Army.

23
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,280
Wei Shangzhi is brutal

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,520
and unworthy of virtue,

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,800
They commit adultery, plunder,

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,040
and do all kinds of evil,

27
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,520
Take away the marquis

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,840
and put him in jail,

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
He will be executed on another day

30
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,880
as a warning to others.

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,760
Bai Zhi

32
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,480
is the daughter of General Ye Shangyu.

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,400
Lord Yongle, Duke Jingbei's Mansion

34
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,320
will be appointed as the county's mansion.

35
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,199
Allow him to marry Wei Shangzhi and Bai Qinglang,

36
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,480
the second son of the Li Bai family,

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,000
Allow him to restore his real name

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,560
to General Lin Feng Dingyuan,

39
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,840
Choose another day

40
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,960
to go to Xiliang.

41
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,200
Wait.

42
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
He raped, killed, plundered,

43
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,840
and did all kinds of evil,

44
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,080
How did you know

45
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,680
about these charges?

46
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,520
At this time,

47
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,560
what does it matter if there's one more and one less?

48
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,920
Take him away.

49
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,320
No.

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,160
Your Ladyship,

51
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,240
what will happen to him?

52
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,120
You'll die.

53
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,600
You're quite skilled.

54
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,520
I'm flattered, General Lin.

55
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,120
Don't think that if you confess,

56
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,800
you can avoid the pain of flesh and blood.

57
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,160
The debts you owe the Wei family,

58
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,240
will be paid by you.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,600
Does it hurt?

60
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,680
Back then, Ye Jiajun suffered a hundred times

61
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,640
as much as you did.

62
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,480
A thousand times,

63
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,400
ten thousand times.

64
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,800
I know.

65
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,440
Is there anything else you want to say?

66
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,920
Take good care of

67
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,000
Zhi,

68
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,640
Don't bother.

69
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,480
The Lin family has been born for the Ye family for generations.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,600
I was born for Zhi.

71
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,960
After killing the guard of Xiliang,

72
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,120
Makino

73
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,960
Don't you have anything else to say?

74
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,480
Old Man Wei,

75
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,280
you handed over the whole Zhou Dynasty to me.

76
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,960
You tricked me for so long.

77
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,520
I'll pay you back.

78
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,800
From now on, we don't owe each other anything.

79
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,120
It's fair, right?

80
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
You little brat!

81
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,680
Stand still!

82
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,240
It's not fair.

83
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,440
My Lord,

84
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,360
Chuanxiao has brought back the secret message from Qingliang.

85
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,680
Forgive Kawahiro......

86
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,320
You must know the truth.
