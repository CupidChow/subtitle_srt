1
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,840
Heavenly King Gai Di Hu,

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,680
you are 250.

3
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,360
In addition to the nickname,

4
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,960
Miss Bai came back standing on her back door.

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,800
Is this the distortion of human nature?

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,280
Or moral decay?

7
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,440
The truth is here.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,360
Make way for me first.

9
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,520
-Take it. -Take it. What

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,000
the hell?

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,800
How can you believe Marquis Jingbei will have true love these days?

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,160
I did.

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,400
I also hit

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,360
Zhizhi and his wife. Go for it.

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,880
What's wrong with Su Qiu?

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,200
Duke Jingbei is really not a thing.

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,080
Don't talk nonsense.

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,480
Are you going to die?

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,640
What are you afraid of?

20
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,280
Even if I die,

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,160
I'm sure I'll die before you.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,960
But I don't want to die yet.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,280
I also want to eat roast chicken.

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,280
Candied haws?

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,400
Fried meatballs,

26
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,520
muffins,

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,600
Braised pork

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,880
with bean juice.

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,840
Did you hear me clearly?

30
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
Let the kitchen do it.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,800
His Lordship is wise,

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,360
His Lordship,

33
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,040
What do you want the kitchen to make?

34
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,480
Songcake, bean juice, candied haws, croquettes,

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,480
Got it?

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,720
I see.

37
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,560
My Lord is wise.

38
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,440
Come with me.

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,480
Miss,

40
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,080
you have no idea.

41
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,400
The list of hot events in the Zhou Dynasty

42
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,880
has exploded.

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,840
In his first six terms,

44
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,480
all of them died miserably.

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,520
The first one

46
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,840
was hung on the wall.

47
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,320
Hang the body for three days.

48
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,120
The second one died suddenly,

49
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,040
and was thrown into the Burial Mounds.

50
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,560
The third, fourth and fifth terms

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,640
were eaten raw.

52
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,640
And the sixth one?

53
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,960
The sixth one,

54
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,920
whose face was scratched

55
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,640
and chopped up and fed to the dog

56
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,160
to fry meatballs,

57
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,200
Do you want to eat?

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,760
What about roast chicken?

59
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,440
Is this the last supper?

60
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,320
Yes,

61
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,920
it's poisonous.

62
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,400
Do you want to eat it?

63
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,000
Wei Shangzhi,

64
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,200
I'll eat it.

65
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll die if I die.

66
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,160
I won't lose money even if I hold you.

67
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,240
anyway

68
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,440
Even if you expose the body, no one will collect it in the wilderness.

69
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,680
Unlike me,

70
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,680
I prepared my own

71
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,400
Wei Shangzhi for you.

72
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,800
You're teasing me.

73
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,200
Yes,

74
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,560
is it delicious?

75
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,640
Then it's my turn.

76
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:16,959
Wait.

77
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,959
What are you doing?

78
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,200
I'm telling you,

79
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,680
human flesh is sour,

80
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,640
I don't like it.

81
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,880
A delicate girl like you

82
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,640
needs fresh food to taste good.

83
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,320
I'll take one bite at a time.

84
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,160
Wei Shangzhi,

85
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,760
I'm here for the lunar event.

86
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,600
Dirty,

87
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,560
It doesn't taste good,

88
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,200
does it?

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,560
You can still take a bath in the coming months.

90
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,960
I just came here.

91
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,960
I got it.

92
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,200
Send a message to Lord Qingmu,

93
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,280
and ask Lord Qingmu to save Sister Qingmu.
