1
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,040
Gedei Tiger,

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,600
Heavenly King Gedei,

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,080
The Heavenly King covers the Earth Tiger,

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,840
and you are

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,480
Madam 250,

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,400
I understand how you feel,

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,560
but I really can't accept your order.

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,640
Please forgive me.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,800
The price is not a problem.

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,960
It doesn't matter if you don't have money,

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,680
you really can't pick it up.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,360
I can't even answer it.

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,600
Why?

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,720
There are too many of them.

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,880
I can't curse by myself.

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,480
It's full of scolding down there,

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,200
The sales volume of the hot list has tripled in the week.

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,880
I can't make the list of hot events

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,120
in the Zhou Dynasty, Madam.

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,240
Duke Jingbei tore the imperial edict.

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,200
Your love,

22
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,440
you need me to protect you.

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,520
My Lady,

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,000
Second Young Master is back.

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,760
He's here to take you home.

26
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,880
Second brother is back.

27
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,400
Second brother,

28
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,920
are you willing to come back?

29
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,040
Zhi,

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,120
I'm back.

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,680
No one will bully you again.

32
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,840
Second brother,

33
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,200
I'm here,

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,080
I'll take you home.

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,200
Second brother,

36
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,240
I'm married now,

37
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,120
There's no reason to just go back.

38
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,240
Then he is not worthy of

39
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,440
Li Wei Shang Zhi.

40
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,320
Second brother,

41
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,880
don't believe those rumors outside,

42
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,840
Those messages are all fake.

43
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,120
You like him?

44
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,680
No.

45
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,120
Then come back with me.

46
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,160
Let's go.

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,680
Second brother,

48
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,800
Zhi,

49
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,000
Let go!

50
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,680
I'll let go if you let go.

51
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,360
You're the one who should let go.

52
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,880
Wei Shangzhi,

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,960
why did you force you to marry Zhi?

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,840
Did you ask her what she meant?

55
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,960
Gentleman Bai in Attendance is going to rob Zhi.

56
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,040
Did you ask her what she meant?

57
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,800
Whether she's willing to go with you,

58
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,760
I don't agree to this marriage.

59
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,080
I want to take Zhi back.

60
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,000
If the two surnames are married,

61
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,200
what does this marriage have to do with you?

62
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,080
Zhi,

63
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,760
he married you for an impure purpose,

64
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:42,920
Listen to me.

65
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,600
Come home with me.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,120
If my purpose is not pure,

67
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,080
then you are pure.

68
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,400
Gentleman Bai in Attendance

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,080
speaks with double standards.

70
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,600
Stay away from me.

71
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,240
Stop fighting!

72
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,160
Stop fighting!

73
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,120
Get lost!

74
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,320
Qinglang,

75
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,280
this is His Lordship's Mansion.

76
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,440
What are you fooling around with?

77
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,080
Come back with me.

78
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,520
For Zhi's marriage,

79
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,960
who are you to decide?

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,680
Come back with me.
