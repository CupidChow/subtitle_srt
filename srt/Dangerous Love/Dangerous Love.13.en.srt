1
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,960
Let go of me!

2
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,280
Put me down.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,920
They are all servants,

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:22,920
Tell me

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,480
You don't have any sense of sight.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,680
Don't be so self-righteous.

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,040
That's why she really kisses with flower cakes,

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,840
talking about self-cultivation of eating food.

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,760
Hold on.

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,520
So,

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,200
what exactly is that pot of red soup?

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,880
Duke Jingbei killed someone again.

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,080
Miss, you'd better forget about it.

14
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,360
You haven't even touched a needle.

15
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,080
This looks good to me.

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,800
Su Qiu, what do you think?

17
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,360
My lady,

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,280
as long as you're happy.

19
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,120
Call me Madam.

20
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,720
Yes.

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,840
Yes, Madam.

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,200
What do you think of Lianxing?

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,760
Not bad.

24
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,480
You have a good taste.

25
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,000
What's wrong?

26
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,000
My Lady, I didn't mean to.

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,720
I really didn't mean it.

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,840
What are you doing?

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,040
I'm useless.

30
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,160
You can't even pour water well.

31
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,120
It's okay.

32
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,880
Are you seeing something exciting?

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,080
Lianxing,

34
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,440
Su Qiu really didn't do it on purpose,

35
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,400
Don't kick me out.

36
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,160
Su Qiu has been with you since she was a child,

37
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,760
I can't live

38
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,560
without you.

39
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,760
Lianxing,

40
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,920
what are you doing?

41
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,760
Let Su Qiu go.

42
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,640
Did you make this?

43
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,480
Me

44
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
Lianxing,

45
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,560
I know you want to be Her Ladyship's maid.

46
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
You don't like me.

47
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,960
But,

48
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,520
Su Qiu grew up with you since she was a child,

49
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,240
I can't leave.

50
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,120
I'll give you the position of the maid, okay?

51
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,640
Don't kick me out.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,760
Is what Su Qiu said true?

53
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,920
Me

54
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,120
Stop crying.

55
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,360
Stop crying.

56
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,560
Yes.

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,640
Since you admit your mistake,

58
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,120
go to the courtyard and kneel down.

59
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,720
Stand up.

60
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Su Qiu is fine,

61
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
Su Qiu is not wronged,

62
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,360
No one can drive you away from me.

63
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,600
Su Qiu is fine.

64
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,480
Su Qiu is not wronged.

65
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,000
You also make mistakes.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,520
No.

67
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,480
Then why did I punish you?

68
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,200
Su Qiu harmed me.

69
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,480
My Lady,

70
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,880
don't blame Lianxing.

71
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,560
She just wants to be loved by you.

72
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,200
Don't hold a grudge against His Lordship.

73
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:41,920
He,

74
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,800
He didn't send Lianxing here

75
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,400
to spy on you.
