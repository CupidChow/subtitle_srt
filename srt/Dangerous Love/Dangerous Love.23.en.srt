1
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:14,840
Qing Lang

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,600
As a man,

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,120
he will commit suicide when he is in trouble.

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,960
Who taught you that?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,440
Big,

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,480
Colonel Bai,

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,640
I'm sorry,

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,560
He's not big or small.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,080
Call him big brother.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,040
Xiliang has already hit the door,

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,640
so you don't want to quit, do you?

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:53,840
Please.

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,800
Forget it.

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,640
It's hopeless.

15
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,880
Get out.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,480
Lianxing,

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,680
go and buy it for me again.

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,560
Forget it.

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,920
Let's save him.

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,000
What happened to my husband, Doctor.

21
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,640
It's hopeless.

22
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,120
It's better to prepare for the funeral.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,160
Don't leave me.

24
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,400
It's my fault.

25
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,880
I was wrong about you.

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,199
Don't leave me, okay?

27
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,920
It's my fault.

28
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Don't leave me alone.

29
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,120
Wei Shangzhi,

30
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
if you don't wake up,

31
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,360
So I took the first bite of

32
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,400
the chicken drumstick and croquettes,

33
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,400
And the core in the middle of the watermelon

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,720
has been eaten by others.

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,600
How dare you?

36
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,520
Are you okay now?

37
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,960
Are you okay now?

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm fine.

39
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,920
Stop crying. Stop crying.

40
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,240
It's making my head spin.

41
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,800
I won't cry anymore.

42
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,760
Then don't die!

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,480
Okay,

44
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,640
Just listen to Her Ladyship.

45
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,400
Lianxing,

46
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,000
hire 600 more painters for me,

47
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,680
Yes

48
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,280
Husband, husband,

49
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,560
how are you?

50
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,680
Where does it hurt?

51
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,800
Don't look.

52
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,160
They're talking nonsense.

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,960
Ignore them.

54
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
Are you going to follow me in the shower?

55
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,360
It's not like I haven't seen her before.

56
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,680
Let me wipe your back.

57
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,640
Don't worry. I didn't see anything.

58
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,080
Does it hurt?

59
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,760
I'm fine.

60
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,400
Why are you so nice to me?

61
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,520
You really don't remember anything.

62
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:06,960
What?

63
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,320
To save my life.

64
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,240
You should promise me with your own body.

65
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,880
Young master,

66
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,960
what are you doing?

67
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Murder,

68
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,920
Murder.

69
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,680
childe

70
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,240
Help! Help Young Master!

71
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,360
Somebody.

72
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
-Help! -Save Young Master.

73
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,600
Wait.

74
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,080
Did you do the same to your first six wives?

75
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,800
You're hesitating,

76
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,760
scumbag.

77
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,760
Lianxing,

78
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,880
I'm here.
