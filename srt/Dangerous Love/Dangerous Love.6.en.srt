1
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,280
Zhi,

2
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,880
Wait for me.

3
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,200
My lady is safe now.

4
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,800
Come on.

5
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:07,640
My Lady,

6
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,760
it's him.

7
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,720
What trick is Wei Shangzhi playing?

8
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,200
It's the same if you ask me a hundred times.

9
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,760
I was sent by His Majesty.

10
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,800
I'm not here to interrogate you.

11
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,360
Su Qiu,

12
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,840
go over and bandage him up.

13
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,520
Su Qiu,

14
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,640
Well,

15
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,840
Are you Miss Bai?

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,560
Yes.

17
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,720
Don't be afraid.

18
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,280
There's no one outside now.

19
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,280
Let's go.

20
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,560
That's right.

21
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,800
Sister Hua Hua's brother Hua Hua is still in Muyun City.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,840
Hurry up, Miss.

23
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,680
It's too late.

24
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,320
But,

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,040
Miss,

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
No buts.

27
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,280
Even if the pursuers are here,

28
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,640
none of us will be able to leave.

29
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,200
Be gentle.

30
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,560
This is Miss Bai.

31
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,840
Miss Su Qiu, don't worry.

32
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,960
Of course I know this is Miss Bai,

33
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,600
She is also the wife of Duke Jingbei.

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,760
Brother Dog,

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,240
you're not from the palace.

36
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,080
Madam Wei is as pretty as a flower

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,000
and smart as ice and snow!

38
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,520
Don't worry,

39
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,600
I'm not interested in Her Ladyship.

40
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,040
That's your own meat.

41
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,440
Would you like to

42
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,320
have a taste of my meat lady?

43
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,160
It's chewy.

44
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,720
This is not human flesh.

45
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,880
Congratulations. You

46
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,120
got it right.

47
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,080
What about us gangsters?

48
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,720
There are principles.

49
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,880
Mr. Bai is a good person,

50
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,760
and you're his daughter?

51
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,080
As long as you sign it,

52
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,880
we'll let you go.

53
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,000
I won't help you wronged a good person.

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,279
Look,

55
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,720
this one is not right.

56
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,720
And this one.

57
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,040
This one is not right either.

58
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,760
These two are totally wrong.

59
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,160
Good man,

60
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,760
he forced taxes,

61
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,680
Killing people like hemp,

62
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,400
controlling the state affairs,

63
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,760
Cover the sky with one hand.

64
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,360
Do you believe whatever people say outside?

65
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,640
Don't you have a brain?

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,160
On the count of three,

67
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,600
shall I sign or not?

68
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,680
One,

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,600
Two.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,080
2. 9。 .

71
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,960
Let go of me!

72
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,760
Let go of me!

73
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,160
Brother Dog, what nonsense are you talking to her about?

74
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,080
Do Zhizhi and his wife really love each other?

75
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,080
Try it and you'll know.

76
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,560
Yes.

77
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,400
The meat on your cheeks is the tenderest.

78
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,720
Wei Shangzhi,

79
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,520
what are you doing?

80
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,800
Don't... Don't touch my lady.

81
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,200
Our Young Master won't spare you.

82
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,920
Childe Bai knows a lot about justice,

83
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,720
he will understand.

84
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,800
You.

85
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,200
It's all your fault that you married the wrong person.

86
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,200
He wasn't sent by Lord Qingmu.
