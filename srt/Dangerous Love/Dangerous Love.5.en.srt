1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,240
Miss,

2
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,360
do you want to watch the show?

3
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,720
I heard that

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,320
someone came outside to deliver the edict,

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,240
Duke Jingbei

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,240
will be in bad luck.

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,800
Really?

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,960
It's true.

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,840
Let's go and have a look.

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,120
I didn't expect the wedding ceremony of the Heavenly Palace Office

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,080
to come so soon.

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,080
My lady, slow down.

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,440
Wei Shangzhi, how dare you disobey the imperial edict?

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,800
What kind of decree did you send?

15
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,600
Seeing the imperial edict is like seeing His Majesty,

16
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,560
This is disrespectful.

17
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,000
Dirty.

18
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,520
Be good.

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,560
What about him?

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,600
Don't worry.

21
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,920
I won't die.

22
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,560
Chuan Gu,

23
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,800
take him away.

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:48,960
Yes.

25
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,040
His Lordship is wise,

26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,160
Let's go.

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,880
Suqiu,

28
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,560
go and find out where the person who passed the imperial edict is?

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,280
Okay,

30
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,920
Got it.

31
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,320
I heard that the meat on both sides of a person's cheeks is the tenderest.

32
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,600
His Lordship is wise.

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,840
Say it or not?

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,920
Say it or not?

35
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,320
Say it or not?

36
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,880
Bah!

37
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,960
I'm talking about you.

38
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,760
Wei Shangzhi,

39
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,920
you bullied His Majesty for being young,

40
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,360
He controls the government

41
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,280
and does all kinds of evil,

42
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,120
Now you even dare not accept the imperial edict.

43
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,440
This is a great crime to be executed with the whole clan.

44
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:04,920
My lady,

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,720
bad news.

46
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,960
Marquis Jingbei, the man who eats human flesh and drinks human blood

47
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,400
to pass the imperial edict is probably in bad shape.

48
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,200
Where is he?

49
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,920
Kitchen,

50
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's go.

51
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,720
How come a good person

52
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,040
has such a long mouth

53
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,280
to tell me,

54
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,720
Tell me.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,600
My Lady.

56
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,480
Nonsense.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,680
Nonsense!

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Nonsense.

59
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,480
Miss,

60
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,680
take a look.

61
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,720
Nonsense.

62
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Murder! Murder!

63
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,560
Tell me,

64
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,200
Kawaku,

65
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,080
throw him to the dungeon,

66
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,040
Don't let him die.

67
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,080
Yes.

68
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,040
You may leave now.

69
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,080
Zhi,

70
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:36,920
come out.

71
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,080
I'm cold.

72
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,200
Come out.

73
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,160
The kitchen just

74
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,760
made it. Try it.

75
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,760
You don't like it?

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,040
Go away.

77
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,080
Don't stay under the quilt.

78
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,480
Don't suffocate yourself.

79
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,600
My Lady,

80
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,200
I've found out everything.

81
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,600
The servant is locked in the dungeon.

82
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,080
I lost two pieces of meat on my face.

83
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,080
Is that his flesh?
