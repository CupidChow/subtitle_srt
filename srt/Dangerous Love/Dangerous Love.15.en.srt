1
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,280
What's wrong?

2
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,160
Zhi was bullied by Wei Shangzhi

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,400
Second Childe,

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,360
Miss, it's okay.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,560
It's just,

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,120
It's just that she might have

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,840
fallen in love with Wei Shangzhi.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,200
Ask Zhi out for me

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,240
at the Lantern Festival tomorrow.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,440
I

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:46,920
… Su Qiu,

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,040
Thank you for your hard work.

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,880
Okay, Second Young Master,

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,680
I will finish the task.

15
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,000
Bai Qinglang.

16
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,600
It's finally done.

17
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,760
It can't be exactly the same,

18
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,000
it can only be said that it has nothing to do with it.

19
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,360
Your Ladyship,

20
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,920
on the Lantern Festival tomorrow,

21
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,200
You have to go back to Bai Mansion.

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,080
My parents go to watch the lantern show every year,

23
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,320
and my brother is not at home.

24
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,360
No one came home.

25
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,280
Second Childe is here.

26
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,720
No way.

27
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,400
If you go to see Second Brother,

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,680
your husband will be unreasonable again.

29
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,960
Second Young Master is alone.

30
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,880
It must be pitiful.

31
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,120
Why don't you give this to Second Young Master?

32
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,600
No way.

33
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,680
I have a safety talisman in my locker,

34
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,280
take four servants

35
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,600
and send them back to Bai Mansion.

36
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,600
Hello, My Lord,

37
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,080
if His Lordship can't keep you,

38
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,440
I'll ask someone to carry you back tomorrow.

39
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,120
No, no, no. Don't bother His Lordship.

40
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
I'm loyal,

41
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,960
which can be seen by heaven and earth,

42
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,280
You'd better do that.

43
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,320
Zhi.

44
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,480
On the Lantern Festival tomorrow,

45
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,800
there will be a lantern show in the west of the city,

46
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,080
Yes,

47
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,160
tomorrow on the Lantern Festival,

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,880
I know.

49
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,240
You don't have anything to give me.

50
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,240
No.

51
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,800
What are you holding?

52
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,400
Where's the other one?

53
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,040
I don't even have

54
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,680
two hands.

55
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,000
Get off.

56
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
Give it to me.

57
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,280
No means no.

58
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,640
Here you are

59
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,360
Why are you laughing?

60
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,080
Don't laugh.

61
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,160
Her Ladyship's embroidery is really unique,

62
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,040
so give it back to me if you dislike it.

63
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,320
It's the only one in the world.

64
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,600
It's not too late for me to be happy.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,839
Let's go to the lantern show

66
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,480
tomorrow.

67
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,920
Why are you wearing this?

68
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,200
I'm not afraid of being laughed at.

69
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,880
Take it off.

70
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,480
No one dares to laugh.

71
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,240
But if you wear it,

72
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,040
the whole city will know that I'm useless as an embroiderer.

73
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,800
Give me a kiss.

74
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,120
Kiss you and you'll take it off.

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,840
You can take it off now, right?

76
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,240
If you cheat,

77
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,440
how can I cheat?

78
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,040
You are not allowed to wear it.

79
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
Kiss me again.

80
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,400
Rascal,

81
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,840
Madam Rascal.
