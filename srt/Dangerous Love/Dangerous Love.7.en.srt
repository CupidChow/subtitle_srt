1
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,320
No,

2
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,280
Brother,

3
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,800
Did you see this knife?

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,520
You're abusing the dog here.

5
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,200
I'm not blind.

6
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,040
There's a way to heaven. If you don't go,

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,160
There's no way out of hell. You're here to vote.

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,360
It's been a long time since you were upset.

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,840
Don't come near me.

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,960
If you come any closer, I'll kill her.

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
I'm not going there.

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,040
Don't touch her.

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,720
Of course,

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,800
we are gangsters.

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,840
It's also ethical.

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,960
What do you want?

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,560
I'll kill you.

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,720
You … You don't talk about martial arts?

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,000
My Lord.

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,200
Take Her Ladyship back.

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,480
The rest of you,

22
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,000
take them away.

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,840
His Lordship is wise.

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,160
You're still here.

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,520
My Lord,

26
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,520
I found it.

27
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Bai Qinglang ordered it.

28
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,360
Bai Qinglang,

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,480
fake imperial edict,

30
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
He doesn't have the guts.

31
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,240
Keep investigating.

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,560
Yes.

33
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,320
His Lordship and

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,760
Bai Qinglang are going back to the capital.

35
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,520
Got it.

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,280
Your Ladyship

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,800
I want to see His Lordship go back

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,600
and look good. This is the dark place.

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,000
What can you see?

40
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,120
I didn't look at him.

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,880
Who on earth

42
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,680
are those people?

43
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:28,920
Nothing.

44
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,200
I just want His Lordship's life.

45
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,600
By the way, Your Ladyship,

46
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,080
His Lordship didn't want to lock you up,

47
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
It's just that it's not peaceful outside these two days,

48
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,240
don't you know?

49
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,040
In order to catch them,

50
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,680
His Lordship hasn't slept for two days.

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,200
Don't go out these two days.

52
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,600
Otherwise,

53
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,760
I'll eat you.

54
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:53,960
Su Qiu,

55
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,480
go and look for it later.

56
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,920
What did those people say about Duke Jingbei?

57
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,400
Yes, Miss.

58
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,040
You've found the right person.

59
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,200
Just wait and see.

60
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,040
Your Majesty,

61
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,640
this mutton is a tribute from the north.

62
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,360
When I was seven or eight months old,

63
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,720
I was the most tender.

64
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,280
Seven or eight months.

65
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,640
Your Majesty,

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,920
about the fake imperial edict,

67
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,880
The mutton is too tender.

68
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,840
It's too early to kill him now.

69
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
My Lord, it's obviously

70
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,680
disaster relief food from Hexi,

71
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,800
You must say it's your birthday gift.

72
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,480
What do you know?

73
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,440
His Lordship has his own reasons

74
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,240
for this arrangement.

75
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,520
And the flood in Longxi.

76
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,040
Zhi,

77
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,160
Brother,

78
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,440
Why are you here?

79
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,720
Here's the thing.

80
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,640
My brother-in-law doesn't want you to be bored.

81
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,240
He asked me to come and see you.

82
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,080
You seem to be living a good life.

83
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:36,880
Zhi.

84
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,880
Are you listening to me?

85
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,520
Let's eat.

86
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,560
The dishes are getting cold.

87
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,520
< Jingbei Marquis Black Material

88
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,240
Collection >, why are you still reading this stuff?

89
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,560
Did Su Qiu give it to you?

90
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:04,920
Give me all of them.

91
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,560
Brother,

92
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,280
and this.

93
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,840
That's too much.

94
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,280
He has no conscience.

95
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,320
It's really hard for me

96
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,200
to explain this to you.

97
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,760
But you have to know,

98
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,280
what's on it,

99
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,560
That's because there's something fishy about it

100
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,640
and it's totally uncountable to deliberately erase it,

101
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,080
Brother,

102
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,160
let's make it clear for him.

103
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,440
Dear,

104
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,400
would you like some tea?

105
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,320
Look,

106
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,280
there's no poison.

107
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,880
Are you hungry?

108
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,080
Do you want to eat something delicious?

109
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,920
I know I was wrong.

110
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,600
Got it.

111
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,160
What did you do wrong?

112
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,720
I shouldn't have.

113
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,960
I shouldn't suspect you of eating human flesh.

114
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,000
I shouldn't have let the bad guys go.

115
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,480
You shouldn't eat human flesh.

116
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,480
Sorry,

117
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,200
I won't do it again.

118
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,720
There will be another time.

119
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,720
No, no next time.

120
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,400
It won't happen again.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,760
Come and sleep.

122
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,200
A little girl like you,

123
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,200
who's so sweet and soft,

124
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,920
I'll take one bite at a time,
