Second Young Master gave it to me.

3
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,840
I didn't have time to give it to you just now.

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,680
It's so cute.

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,200
The color is warm

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,240

It looks good.

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
Soft and tough,

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,120
long whip.

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:00:59,920
Give it back

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,360
to me. You're a girl,

14
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,920
Why do you always think about knives and guns in your head?

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,200
I wonder what your brother-in-law was thinking

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,920
when he sent you here?

17
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,920
You're crazy.

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,240
You're right.

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,240
He's just sick.

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,040
The point is, is there something wrong here,

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,000
or is there something wrong here?

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,120
Let's go.

23
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,080
Take it to work.

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,080
Let him be jealous,

25
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,360
not to mention that I didn't help you.

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,240
What?

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,759
I'm touched.

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,240
Give me back my pen.

29
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,640
Woman,

30
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,720
your name is Ruthless.

31
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,560
My Lord.

32
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,840
She likes drumsticks and flowers.

33
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,240
All the girls like to be praised.

34
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,920
I remember it very well.

35
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,880
I don't need to do it next time.

36
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,440
Yes.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,720

Clean it up,

41

Sister,

45
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,120
Where's Big Brother?

46
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,120
I don't want you to be bored.

47
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,080
I brought you some scripts to relieve boredom.

48
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,800
One.

Thank you, bro.

52
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,800
Don't thank me.

53
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,240
Actually,

54
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,320
these scripts,

55
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,640
I didn't find them.

56
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,560
Sister,

57
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,640
a man,

58
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,160
Good face. If you give me a step,

59
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,280
he'll roll down right away.

60
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,640
Why don't you give me a sachet too?

61
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,480
What gift is good for your husband on Shangyuan Festival,

62
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,200
as long as you send it to your home

have a look

65
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,240
Who wants to give him a sachet?

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,480
I'm leaving.

67
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,160
Miss,

68
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,680

If you used your brain on divorce,

72
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,840
we would have been abandoned long ago.

73
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,040
My dear girl,

74
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,400
your lady has been divorced.

75
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,480
What's in it for you?

76
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,000
You,

77
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,520
Husband

78
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,840
How can you take it back if you gave it to me?

79
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,760
What a cheapskate.

80
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,880
Don't you already have one?

81
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,560
That's different.

82
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,680
Choose one from the other,

83
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,240
Chuan Gu.

84
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,480
Thank you, my husband.

85
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:55,960
Is it sweet?

86
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,560
