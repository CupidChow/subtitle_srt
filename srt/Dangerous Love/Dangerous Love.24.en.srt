1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,120
I'll beat you to death, you playboy!

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,600
I asked you to marry six wives.

3
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,440
What are you doing?

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
His Lordship asked me to visit you.

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,360
I can't believe you can say so many words at once.

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,000
Let me tell you a secret.

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,360
I'm his third wife.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,920
Do you want to hear a story?

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,840
Sit down.

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,160
I'm a killer.

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,400
But I also have my principles.

12
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,160
I only kill evil people.

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,560
You live a life of licking blood on the tip of a knife every day.

14
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,080
It's often precarious,

15
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,240
but I can survive it with my support,

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,160
is to kill the biggest traitor

17
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,760
of the Zhou Dynasty one day.

18
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,520
Wei Shangzhi,

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:32,960
finally,

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,760
Someone came to me.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,760
And then?

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,560
Like I said,

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,040
I have my principles.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,800
I only kill evil people.

25
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,680
If he's not evil,

26
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,000
I won't kill him.

27
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,800
Good skill. How much

28
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,680
did he pay you?

29
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,960
I'll pay you double.

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,560
Why don't you work for me?

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,280
Wei Shangzhi,

32
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,120
you have no conscience.

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,120
I'm going to die a horrible death.

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,280
Not only is he not evil,

35
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,560
on the contrary,

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,040
No one

37
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,360
cares more about the state of Zhou than he does,

38
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,560
He bears all the notoriety.

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,520
From the moment the late emperor passed away,

40
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,320
he was ready

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,600
to die with all the charges.

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,040
It's the same

43
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,440
with everyone else

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,160
in the Wei family.

45
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,040
Now that His Majesty is 16 years old,

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,560
he knows the time has come.

47
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,040
So he used his own life

48
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,480
to pave the way for him.

49
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,520
So,

50
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,640
he hid the truth about the Ye family's death.

51
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,600
I'm also bent on dying.

52
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes.

53
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,000
Not really.

54
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,520
He's selfish.

55
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,120
Because

56
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,400
if I let you know,

57
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,720
Lin Weixin did all this.

58
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,560
One more blow like this,

59
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,360
he's afraid you won't be able to take it.

60
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,280
Liar!

61
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,160
Okay,

62
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,640
I'm a liar.

63
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,720
Why don't you explain?

64
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,960
A man should establish himself,

65
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,440
but be worthy of his heart.

66
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,880
What do others think?

67
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,440
What does it have to do with me?

68
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,440
Don't mess around.

69
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,480
You haven't recovered yet.

70
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,800
Zhi thinks I can't do it,

71
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,320
but I don't.

72
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,280
Don't talk nonsense.

73
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
That's enough.

74
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,600
Don't be shy.

75
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,200
Zhi,

76
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,840
I think my injury is almost healed.

77
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,920
Makino

78
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,480
You've lived long enough.

79
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,360
Dear,

80
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,240
I'll wait for you to come back.

81
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,240
Take me with you.

82
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,120
What should I wear

83
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,440
for our wedding tomorrow?

84
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,560
The nickname is the nickname,

85
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,760
His Lordship has won again and again,

86
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,400
I won

87
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,720
-Give me one. -Give me one.

88
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,080
His Lordship,

89
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,120
with a long spear,

90
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,080
As soon as General Lin holds his sword, his sword qi is like a rainbow,

91
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,160
and Colonel Bai's whip is like walking a dragon.

92
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,960
His Lordship led the army straight to Huanglong,

93
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,200
and cut off the head of that old Muye thief.

94
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,960
Okay.

95
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,560
General Lin and Colonel Bai copied two loaves of bread

96
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,400
and beat those cool dogs,

97
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,000
It's called a mess.

98
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,280
It's a scurrying head-on,

99
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,120
Okay,

100
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,280
One more.

101
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,560
Okay, okay.

102
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:50,840
Okay,
