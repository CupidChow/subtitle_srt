1
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,280
Sachet.

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,080
Have a look.

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,880
Look, the sachet he's wearing is so ugly.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,440
That's romantic.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,440
You don't understand.

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,800
My child,

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,760
why are you running so far away?

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,400
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,800
I told you not to wear it.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,400
Look,

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,640
even kids laugh at you.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
I told you,

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,520
this is romantic.

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,800
Take a look!

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,200
Rouge powder,

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,160
candied haws?

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,120
Roasted whole beef with clams and peanuts,

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,400
eight-treasure porridge with melon seeds,

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,880
Roasted whole beef with clams and peanuts,

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,760
eight-treasure porridge with melon seeds,

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,640
Make way. Make way.

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,160
Be careful.

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,640
Watch the road.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,480
Make way. -Make

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,520
way. -Husband,

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,800
You're too close.

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,400
What's going on?

28
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,080
Why do you have two husbands?

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,080
Good, good, good.

30
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,040
Okay, okay.

31
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,960
This young master is amazing.

32
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,080
This is Hua Hua.

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,040
Zhi,

34
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,840
you don't even know your husband?

35
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,120
Duke Jingbei is here!

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,120
Run!

37
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,080
Hurry up! Hurry up!

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,600
Run!

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,360
Maybe he kissed you here just now.

40
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,720
No,

41
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,840
what he kissed was,

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,840
Second brother,

43
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,480
what a coincidence,

44
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,920
Come to the lantern show, too.

45
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,440
No,

46
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,120
actually, I came here on purpose,

47
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,480
Why are you here?

48
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,080
Do you see that scooter?

49
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,680
Over there, right?

50
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,120
I went after the car

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,200
while you were chatting.

52
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,560
Second brother,

53
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,520
Zhi made this sachet herself.

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,400
Which lady gave the one

55
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,200
at Assistant Minister Bai's waist?

56
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,880
Zhi,

57
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,960
how can you be so protective?

58
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,800
You won't even let anyone else look at you.

59
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,240
Of course

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,640
It belongs to the Ye family of Zhijin Pavilion.

61
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,720
It does come from the Ye family,

62
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,120
although the Ye family is a merchant,

63
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,680
But it doesn't matter.

64
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,240
As long as Second Brother likes it,

65
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,280
we'll go back and tell Father and Mother later,

66
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,920
Ask the matchmaker to come another day,

67
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,200
Your Ladyship is right.

68
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,640
Gentleman Bai in Attendance is not young anymore,

69
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,560
No.

70
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,640
Second Brother

71
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,360
Which lady of the Ye family

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,320
is the eldest lady of the Ye family

73
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,640
I have been in love with her for a long time,

74
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,920
The Ye family.

75
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,040
Second brother,

76
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,720
you know I'm not good at embroidering,

77
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,080
You even compared your future sister-in-law's with mine,

78
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,040
Qing Lang

79
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,360
Father and mother

80
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,160
don't disturb His Lordship's pleasure.

81
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,040
Qinglang,

82
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,760
let's go.

83
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,680
Let's go.

84
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,160
Zhi,

85
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
what are you doing?

86
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,240
Husband,

87
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,760
Dear.

88
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,560
You've been in Muyun for three years,

89
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,960
but you haven't made any progress.

90
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,480
Angelica dahurica is your sister?

91
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,560
I can't believe you did this to her.

92
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,880
Whether you're wrong or not,

93
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,240
I'm not wrong.

94
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,080
How dare you be stubborn?

95
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,600
Just ten times,

96
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,600
it's all about our father-son relationship.

97
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,800
I'll leave Zhi to you.

98
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,880
I'm not asking you to push her into the fire.

99
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,200
It's all my fault.

100
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,440
Father,

101
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,680
Zhi and I

102
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,640
are not siblings.

103
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,320
Now there are internal and external troubles,

104
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,520
and the court is unstable,

105
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,240
What is home?

106
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,840
Qing Lang

107
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,040
A man should aim in all directions.

108
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,240
Yes.

109
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,080
Dad, why are you here?

110
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,840
Kill the defind the title.

111
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,160
Revenge for the Ye Army.

112
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,600
I want you to pay with your blood.
