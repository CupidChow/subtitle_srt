1
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,600
You were so careless.

2
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:17,800
Does it hurt?

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,080
It hurts

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,680
It won't hurt if you just give me a shout.

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,560
What delicacy did your husband bring me today?

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,760
Duck tongue,

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,040
left and right can't talk,

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,880
It's better to pull it out.

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:42,960
All right.

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,840
By the way, my husband,

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,640
Suqiu is serving me in my room.

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,960
Take Lianxing back.

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,800
Since you made a mistake,

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,120
you must be punished first.

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,840
My husband is right.

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,400
I'll send it back to you after I punish you.

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,280
Sister.

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,080
Why did Miss Lianxing

19
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,480
give such a big gift?

20
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,560
Come on, don't be so polite.

21
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,640
Come on.

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,360
Let me help you up.

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:30,720
You,

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,040
You're a girl.

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,280
Why are you so strong?

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,240
You practice iron sand palm?

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,120
You can tell.

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,400
That's right.

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,000
Miss Lianxing,

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,040
would you do me the honor

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,200
to teach me,

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,080
Let's go.

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:57,920
Let's go

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,000
He has been single for 27 years,

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,720
and finally he has a crush on a girl,

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,039
If we break them up,

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,360
I don't know when we'll meet again.

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,400
But Lianxing still bullies Suqiu,

39
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,680
if she enters the Bai family,

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,720
The Bai family has to be broken up by her.

41
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,120
What should we do?

42
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,840
Zhi

43
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,240
Your Ladyship,

44
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,280
your hair,

45
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,880
I'm afraid I can't stand your bonus hunting.

46
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,120
Dear,

47
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,720
tell me,

48
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,320
If a person makes a mistake,

49
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,320
can she correct it?

50
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,320
If you follow the right person,

51
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,640
you can change it.

52
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,920
My husband is right.

53
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,400
Lianxing,

54
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,640
what happened today,

55
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,680
Do you know your mistake?

56
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,520
If you admit your mistake,

57
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,040
can you correct it?

58
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

59
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,400
Then you can serve me personally from now on.

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,960
Yes.

61
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,800
By the way,

62
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,760
I've prepared some books for you.

63
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Go back and take a good look.

64
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,560
Okay,

65
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,840
I have to check it at midnight

66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,720
every day. It's so beautiful.

67
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,200
Yes

68
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,280
Lianxing,

69
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,880
look at the ups and downs of the tea leaves.

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
It's like

71
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,480
the ups and downs of life,

72
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,920
It doesn't go well all the time.

73
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,960
Learn to be patient.

74
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,240
Do you get it?

75
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,920
Understood.

76
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,440
Lianxing.

77
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,040
Good things need to be shared.

78
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,320
Got it?

79
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,440
You.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,120
I want to share it.

81
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,880
I understand.

82
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,600
Lianxing,

83
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,120
Lianxing.

84
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,160
Lianxing,

85
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,000
let's go shopping.

86
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,960
Did Su Qiu do something wrong?

87
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,480
Did Su Qiu annoy Her Ladyship?

88
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,200
Su Qiu,

89
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Don't think too much

90
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,400
about what's not there.

91
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,720
You said you were going to kick her out that day.

92
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,520
Take a look.

93
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,680
Look, you only care about her now.

94
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,520
Sure enough, love will disappear.

95
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,840
I've fallen out of favor, right?

96
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,960
Su Qiu,

97
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,520
don't make trouble out of nothing.

98
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,360
Su Qiu got it,
