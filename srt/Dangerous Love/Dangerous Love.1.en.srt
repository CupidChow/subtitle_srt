1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,400
When it's cool in the west today

2
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,000
and Muyun City is the boundary between the two states,

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,000
The situation is

4
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,680
as strong as the legend,

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,040
When the Emperor of Zhou was young,

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,800
Duke Wei of Jingbei took over the power of military affairs.

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,120
He is cruel and merciless,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,240
and suffers from internal and external troubles in Zhou,

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,560
It's dangerous.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,560
You don't deserve her face.

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,640
Clean it up.

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,520
Don't leave any dirt on it.

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,120
It's His Lordship.

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,560
In addition to the nickname,

15
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,520
Duke Jingbei's sixth wife

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,320
died suddenly again.

17
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,120
Let me see. Let me see

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,040
the nickname.

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,960
Let me see

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,320
Duke Jingbei getting married this year,

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,480
One by one,

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,640
let me see who is so unlucky.

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,760
If Duke Jingbei likes you,

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,960
Duke Jingbei proposed to Miss Bai,

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,840
Lord Bai is tough Duke Jingbei,

26
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,880
oh, hello.

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,680
Father,

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,560
Mother,

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,160
Why are you crying

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,160
on my wedding day?

31
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,160
It's all my fault.

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,880
My poor child.

33
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,880
Miss,

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,040
you can't get married.

35
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,320
No, no.

36
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,360
Don't delay the auspicious time.

37
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,680
Brother,

38
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,240
if I

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,040
come to see you,

40
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,320
Bring Fanlou's roast chicken with you.

41
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,400
It's the right time

42
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,440
to get off the sedan chair.

43
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,160
I heard that Lord Bai participated in Marquis Jingbei's book,

44
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,680
I think Marquis Jingbei is probably taking revenge.

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,000
Who says it's not?

46
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,160
Look at Bai Mansion,

47
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,520
turning a happy event into a funeral.

48
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,920
Lower your voice.

49
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,920
Do you want to die?

50
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,320
If anyone hears you,

51
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,760
let's go!

52
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,960
Let's go.

53
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,520
Who are you scaring?

54
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,920
I'm going to die anyway.

55
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,160
You can't starve to death, can you?

56
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,160
The Bai family has always been loyal and upright,

57
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,320
you treacherous official.

58
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,560
You can be buried with me.

59
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,000
You've accumulated eight lifetimes of virtue.

60
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,200
Let's have fun.

61
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,960
-Afraid of me? -No, I'm

62
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,640
not.

63
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,520
Now I'm afraid it's like this.

64
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,560
Don't cry.

65
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,760
Do you want to drink Hehe Liquor?

66
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,120
I'll get it.

67
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,160
What's wrong?

68
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,960
No,

69
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,880
or the two cups on the table?

70
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,880
Your Ladyship,

71
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,240
that's not how daggers are used.

72
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,320
First of all,

73
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,480
the scabbard can't hurt anyone.

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,880
Cut here.
