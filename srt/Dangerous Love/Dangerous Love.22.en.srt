1
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,840
Don't drink it.

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,200
Spit it out.

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,320
Spit it out.

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,320
Dear,

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,640
can you spit it out?

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,200
I'm begging you.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,480
Spit it out.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,240
Call the doctor,

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,480
Zhi.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,440
If,

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,480
if Kawaku doesn't tell me,

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,480
How long are you going to keep it from me?

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,960
Don't always be so self-righteous.

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,240
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,320
Aren't we husband and wife?

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,880
You're always like this.

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,280
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,880
Did you ask my opinion?

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,240
Did you ask my opinion?

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,640
Sorry.

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,640
I won't do it again.

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,360
No matter how many you have, you can do it next time.

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,000
As many as you want next time.

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,440
Wei Shangzhi, don't die.

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,480
Husband, don't die.

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,160
Doctor,

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,400
go get a doctor.

28
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,040
Bongtian carried the emperor's edict

29
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,240
and said,

30
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,200
It has been found that

31
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,160
there is something else hidden about the death of Ye Jiajun,

32
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,240
It has nothing to do with defind the title.

33
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,520
There are many doubts about Wei Shangzhi's case,

34
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,200
and we can make a decision

35
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,120
after we find out.

36
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,560
Kill Wei Shangzhi,

37
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,000
and sacrifice his blood to the Ye Army.

38
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,680
Kill Wei Shangzhi,

39
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,040
and sacrifice his blood to the Ye Army.

40
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,600
Kill Wei Shangzhi,

41
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,840
and sacrifice his blood to the Ye Army.

42
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,400
Kill Wei Shangzhi,

43
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,760
and sacrifice his blood to the Ye Army.

44
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,920
Kill Wei Shangzhi,

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,880
kill Wei Shangzhi,

46
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,280
Kill Wei Shangzhi.

47
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
Kill Wei Shangzhi.

48
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,360
Your Highness,

49
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,680
hand over that thief.

50
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,840
Hand it over.

51
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,840
Why do you have the right to make a fool of yourself?

52
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,200
It's clearly written in black and white.

53
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,040
I bought the news.

54
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,560
I bought it. Do you know?

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,400
You're General Ye's daughter.

56
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,800
We only respect you three points.

57
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,120
I didn't expect you to say such words,

58
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,760
but I think you're lost by that traitor.

59
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,440
Jerk!

60
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,960
I don't allow you to say that about him.

61
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,200
Get lost!

62
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't allow you to say that about him.

63
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,000
Get lost!

64
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,440
How can you say that about him without any evidence?

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,560
Hit her!

66
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,120
Get lost!

67
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,120
Kill Wei Shangzhi,

68
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,400
Get lost!

69
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,840
Kill Wei Shangzhi,

70
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,000
smash it, smash it,

71
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
Hit her! Throw her away!

72
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,720
Hit her.

73
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,200
Zhi,

74
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,560
Brother,

75
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,600
Even you are mad at me.

76
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,120
Believe me,

77
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,440
the truth will come to light one day.

78
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,320
My Lady,

79
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,200
Young Master,

80
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,880
My Lady,

81
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,480
Second Young Master,

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,840
Second Young Master is missing.

83
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,360
Will he commit suicide?

84
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,040
Please save him.

85
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,640
You're the only one he has.

86
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,040
Kill,

87
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,320
Kill the defind the title,

88
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,440
revenge for Ye Jiajun.

89
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,960
Father,

90
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,880
you made a mistake back then.

91
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,080
I almost let Hua Hua hurt Hua Hua by mistake.

92
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,400
I got my revenge,

93
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,120
Your Ladyship.

94
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,400
What a touching picture.

95
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,880
General, don't worry.

96
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,600
Her Ladyship is doing well in my mansion,

97
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,000
but Her Ladyship was a little careless,

98
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,440
That's why he ate the poison in my mansion by mistake.

99
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,000
You.

100
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
But don't worry, General,

101
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,520
I've sent someone to get the antidote.

102
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,280
Old thief,

103
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,560
if anything happens to my wife,

104
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,680
Shh.

105
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,120
Don't scare the baby in Her Ladyship's belly.

106
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
His Lordship keeps his word,

107
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,200
of course.

108
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,200
General, stay.

109
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,640
By the way,

110
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,840
I forgot one thing,

111
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,040
The antidote is only effective for three days.
