1
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,600
You … You,

2
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,320
Your Ladyship

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,240
Mind your manners outside. It won't

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,160
affect you well.

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,360
No, I didn't.

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
You reversed the black and white.

7
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,640
Thank you for your compliment.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:34,800
Father,

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,680
Mother,

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,400
Father-in-law,

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,440
please don't invite me in.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,080
Baozi,

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,960
thank you, Young Master.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,160
My daughter came back alive.

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,360
Why are you putting on such a bad face?

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,160
There's no room for a giant Buddha like you

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,720
in our Bai Family Temple,

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,880
What nonsense are you talking about?

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,000
As a family,

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,560
why do you talk about these empty gifts?

21
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,120
Am I right?

22
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,840
Father-in-law,

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,120
You.

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,160
Father,

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,240
Don't be mad.

26
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,040
Zhi is still here.

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,240
My Lord,

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,400
No.

29
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,880
Brother-in-law,

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:35,920
Take it away

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,280
Getting married is different.

32
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:38,920
It's expensive.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,040
Don't touch it.

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,120
Zhi,

35
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,040
come with me.

36
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,560
Yes.

37
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,640
let go

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,880
Husband

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,880
Let go,

40
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,440
Father.

41
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,960
Zhi,

42
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,000
in front of the ancestors of the Bai family,

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,560
Say what you said before you got married again.

44
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,560
Ancestral ancestors and ancestors,

45
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,520
Angelica dahurica and Weishang branch are at odds,

46
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,320
If we get married tomorrow,

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,320
it won't be his death,

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,840
The coffin is ready for me

49
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,160
to die as my father.

50
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,600
I can't believe

51
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,160
you're so close to that traitor.

52
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,080
The Bai family is loyal for generations,

53
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,240
why are you so attracted by the appearance

54
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,720
Father,

55
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,640
Dad, I didn't.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,440
Father,

57
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,720
Let go of me

58
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,520
Wei Shangzhi, let go,

59
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,080
I will educate my daughter,

60
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,920
There's no need for outsiders to intervene.

61
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,200
Kneel down!

62
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,040
Don't kneel

63
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,840
down.

64
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,000
Father, brother-in-law,

65
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,040
gentlemen talk but don't fight,

66
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,440
This is a society ruled by law.

67
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,040
you guys

68
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,760
Is there anything that can't be solved properly?

69
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,040
Lunch is ready.

70
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,000
Zhi,

71
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,240
take His Lordship there.

72
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,520
That's right.

73
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,800
Let's eat first.

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,240
Let's go

75
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,880
Stand up.

76
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,080
Bai Ding, I'm telling you,

77
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,280
I don't care about your stupid stuff.

78
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,600
I just want Zhi to be alive.

79
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,800
As for your men,

80
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,000
why do you involve Zhi?

81
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,280
Just listen to Her Ladyship.

82
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,640
Just listen to Her Ladyship.

83
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,200
Let's go.

84
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,400
Let's eat.

85
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,080
Madam,

86
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
peel the shrimp for me.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,640
You're

88
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,400
so old now.

89
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,360
You need an outsider to peel the shrimp for you.

90
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,560
No, thanks.

91
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,160
My Lord,

92
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,440
if you can't get used to the simple food of our Bai family,

93
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
The door is over there.

94
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,880
Help yourself, My Lord.

95
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,080
Son-in-law,

96
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,800
freshly fried meatballs,

97
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,600
Have a taste.

98
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,480
I like my mother's croquettes the most.

99
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,320
Thank you, Mother.

100
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,080
Okay, son,

101
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,520
you're good at chopsticks.

102
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,600
Come on, Madam. Have some.

103
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,280
Sit down.

104
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,400
Enjoy your meal.

105
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,000
Looks like the dishes from the Marquis'Mansion are to your liking.

106
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,520
Our Bai Mansion is used to simple meals,

107
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,680
but not to the delicacies of your Marquis'Mansion,

108
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes.

109
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Father is right.

110
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,160
Eat slowly.

111
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,080
No rush.

112
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,600
Come on.

113
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,080
I'm not eating.

114
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,760
Haven't you had a few bites?

115
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,480
Think about it carefully.

116
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,280
Su Qiu has made up his mind,

117
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,520
regardless of life or death,

118
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,280
Suqiu is willing to follow you.

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Miss, wait for me.

120
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,520
Su Qiu.

121
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,640
Miss, please.
