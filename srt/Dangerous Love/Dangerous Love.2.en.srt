1
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,360
I'm still alive.

2
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,080
Her Ladyship is up now.

3
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,840
His Lordship invites you there.

4
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,920
Coming

5
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,920
Where's my broil that can be broken?

6
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,080
And the poison you bought with a roast chicken.

7
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,600
Roasted chicken.

8
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,400
Isn't this my dagger?

9
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,720
Oh no.

10
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,600
The dishes on this table must be poisonous.

11
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,160
Why are you sitting so far away?

12
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,960
Sit here.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,520
My Lord,

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,360
what did you call me just now?

15
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,280
My Lord,

16
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,720
no,

17
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,360
Say it again

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,920
Sir Wei,

19
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,320
Say it again

20
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,160
Dear,

21
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,640
sit down and eat.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,480
My Lord, you want to eat first. Dear,

23
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,440
what do you want to eat first?

24
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,320
Have some shrimp.

25
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
It'll nourish your blood

26
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,640
and poison you to death.

27
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,760
I won't let you survive today.

28
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,960
Is it because the dose is not enough?

29
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,520
A few more.

30
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,520
Your face stinks like rotten shrimp.

31
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,400
It won't kill you.

32
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,800
Poison you to death.

33
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,920
Bah!

34
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,680
Why hasn't he responded yet?

35
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,760
Why does he have such a good appetite?

36
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,440
I think you're still here.

37
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,840
No,

38
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,160
it's an elephant. It's poisoned.

39
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,400
Is there no poison in the dish?

40
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:57,960
You.

41
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,440
You tricked me.

42
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,320
I'll go back with you later.

43
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,760
Go back.

44
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,960
If you ask me to show my love, I'll show my love.

45
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,160
How embarrassing I am.

46
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,480
The family of the Heavenly Palace has been humiliated.

47
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,440
You're such a bad guy,

48
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,920
remember what you just said.

49
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,600
Yes, I remember.

50
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,800
Dear,

51
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,600
would you like some tea?

52
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,200
It's not poisonous.

53
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,320
Zhi,

54
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,560
Father and Mother,

55
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,200
My new steamed buns.

56
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,000
Do you want to eat them?

57
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,760
Eat, eat,

58
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,640
eat all day.

59
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,680
Your sister's life and death are still unknown.

60
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,320
You can even eat steamed buns?

61
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,760
Father and Mother,

62
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,560
Duke Jingbei actually,

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,520
Let's go.

64
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,400
Let's go pick Zhi up.

65
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,640
I didn't do it on purpose.

66
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,520
What are you doing?

67
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,760
It's a sunny day.

68
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,720
Don't mess around.

69
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,080
I'll call you if you come here again.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,240
Help!

71
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,640
I just wanted to splash your clothes.

72
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,600
You'd better behave yourself.

73
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,560
Otherwise,

74
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,520
if I accidentally

75
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,640
shake my hand.

76
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,360
With Zhi's face,

77
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm afraid it's going to ruin

78
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,160
Old Madam,

79
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,200
The living sister Hua Hua is back.

80
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,320
Let's go.

81
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,200
No,
