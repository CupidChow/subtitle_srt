I'll get you a glass of water.

192
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,420
This way, please.

193
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,140
This way.

194
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,700
Miss Song,

195
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,500
please take a deep breath.

196
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:16,860
Miss Song,

197
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,500
please take

198
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,620
another deep breath.

199
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:20,860
Come on.

200
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,740
It's done.

201
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,940
Prestigious families
are different indeed.

202
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,900
I'm losing half my life
by getting married.

203
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,860
I brought this on myself.

204
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,260
The wheel of fortune turns,

205
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,740
and the heavens spare no one.

206
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,860
Girls,

207
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,700
can you help me loosen it up a bit?

208
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,380
I'm going to throw up my breakfast.

209
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,980
Miss Song, well,

210
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,300
can you hold it for half an hour?

211
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,100
I...

212
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,100
What's wrong? It doesn't look good?

213
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,020
Fine, I'll just take it off.

214
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,540
Wait.

215
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,220
You can't see anything this way.

216
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,340
Cover your eyes.

217
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,180
I told you I'd cover for you.

218
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,740
Why am I given

219
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,340
the difficult and unrewarding task

220
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,980
of arranging the seating of the guests?

221
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,740
Hao,

222
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,420
you're heartless.

223
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,980
[Shen Shuangshuang, Song Lingren,
Gu Zijun, Jiang Nanxuan]

224
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,460
Shen Shuangshuang?

225
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,620
What's up?

226
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,460
Shen Shuangshuang,

227
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,820
I'll give you a chance to impress.

228
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,860
Just get to the point.

229
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,620
After all this time spent with you,

230
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,980
I've found that you

231
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,340
are smart,

232
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,460
pretty,

233
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:14,820
and courageous.

234
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,220
So I'll leave

235
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,220
the guests' seating arrangements

236
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,300
to you.

237
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,100
Remember.

238
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,340
Be sure to be attentive

239
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,300
to the connections

240
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,180
between all the guests.

241
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,340
The ones with asterisks on them

242
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,580
have business problems

243
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,820
and can't be arranged at the same table.

244
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,060
Those with triangles

245
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,100
are business contacts,

246
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,100
so we must keep them close.

247
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:31,940
Besides,

248
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,980
ensure that every guest

249
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,620
is happy,

250
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,820
their view is not blocked,

251
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,940
and they can't be dazzled by the lights.

252
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,580
And

253
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,700
there should be a thousand

254
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,820
or eight hundred guests

255
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,700
for a prestigious family.

256
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,060
But since you're so capable,

257
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,980
you can do it.

258
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,620
I've got things to do,

259
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,860
so I'm leaving.

260
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,060
I'll beat you to death.

261
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,620
Stop it.

262
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,340
Stop it.

263
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,420
You're leaving so many things

264
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,340
to a weak woman

265
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,100
like me.

266
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,060
Are you sure you're weak?

267
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,740
Aren't you cruel?

268
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,100
How could you be so cruel?

269
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,100
I'll beat you to death.

270
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,060
Stop!

271
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,700
You can refuse it.

272
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,740
But I've heard

273
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,220

I'm the worst at this.

280
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:15,700
Wait.

288

forward a little bit, please.

Yes, the spotlight will catch it.

I don't believe

a daughter-in-law like you.

383
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,100
Miss Song, it's done.

384
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,180
Thank you.

385
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,820
In the past,

386
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,660
I used to play

387
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,980
the bad girl at other people's weddings.

388
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,140
I never thought I'd be the bride today.

389
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,340
Yao,

390
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,580
I'm your fan

391
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,700
from now on.

392
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,340
You're so pretty, my girl.

393
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,860
You're sparkling.

394
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,100
It's about time.

395
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,100
Nature really is amazing.

396
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:57,940
Give me a hand.

397
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,020
Come on.

398
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,220
I didn't know

399
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,260
she was married.

400
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,500
As a rich bachelor,

401
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,180
is it wrong for me to pursue love?

402
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,420
No.

403
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,020
So, what should I do?

404
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,820
Go and apologize.

405
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,700
I can't bring myself to do it.

406
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,300
Even so, you still have to apologize.

407
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,460
Yao,

408
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,540
you're so pretty today.

409
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,660
I still have to get ready.

410
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,100
Yao, don't be nervous.

411
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,260
Just take it easy.

412
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,700
Anyway, you two are just

413
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,500
working together.

414
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,340
He's barely a working partner.

415
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,900
Yao,

416
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,620
this is as far as I can go with you.

417
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,420
You're on your own

418

420
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,580
stop being so dramatic.

421
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:42,980
Okay.

422
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,940

You can do it, my girl.

425
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,340
You're quite dramatic today, aren't you?

426
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,380
You're not the one
who's getting married.
