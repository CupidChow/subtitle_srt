My goodness, sis.

194
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,620
You've overestimated

195
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,500
my efficiency.

196
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,780
Besides, with our meager funds,

197
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,660
how can we hire a group of actors?

198
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,340
Who said

199
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,140
she is a straightforward
and principled person?

200
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,140
You must give him

201
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,580
the right to access.

202
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,460
I think

203
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,460
the way you stick to your principles

204
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,940
is hurting yourself.

205
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:02,700
Gu Zijun.

206
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,220
Stop

207
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,100
being sarcastic.

208
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,100
Listen up.

209
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,700
Regarding Ji Chengchuan,

210
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,460
I've succeeded.

211
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,220
Really?

212
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,060
How did that happen?

213
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:11,740
Tell me.

214
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,740
Just now

215
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,500
when Li Chen attacked me,

216
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,460
I took the opportunity

217
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,580
and pretended to be pitiful.

218
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,500
Then,

219
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,980
I successfully advanced

220
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,100
to be the first love

221
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,060

223

Your shamelessness

224

225
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,460
have changed my worldview.

226
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,220
Yay! Impressive.

227
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,340
Got it.

228
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,460
But Ji Chengchuan

229
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,100
has strong willpower.

230
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,460
It's been a while

231
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,460
since I last met such a tough opponent.

232
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,500
I think

233
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,420
it's because

234
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,420
we had a conflict

235
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,220
when we first met.

236
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:44,980
Hence, he wasn't

237
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,100
seduced by me.

238
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:46,820
It's okay.

239
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,580
After my constant hard work,

240
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,460
he has successfully taken the bait.

242

We only have three days.

243

246
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,180
No.

247
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,940
At such a key moment,

248
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,460
we can't be too anxious.

249
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,820
Our previous failures

250
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,860
made him think

251
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,180
that we harbor ill intentions.

252
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,460
If this time

253
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,300
I fail again,

254
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,500
what would happen?

255
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,580
We may be easily exposed.

256
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,420
Therefore,

257
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,700
we must

258
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,980

I'll gain his trust.

262
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,340
What happened?

263
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,100
You saved the damsel in distress.

264
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,340
Are you so kind?

265
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,940
Not only that,

266
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,820
you were also being a busybody.

267
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,980

What do you mean?

Song Yao may be

271
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,180
the girl we're looking for.

272
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,060
This is

273
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,340
a great coincidence.

274
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:07,620
Oh no.

275
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,940
You still didn't have to go all out.

276
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,820
You even injured yourself for her.

277
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,620
How can I make Song Yao
change her opinion of me

278
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,700
if I don't make sacrifices?

279
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,740

This bandage is badly done.

285

No need.

286
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:39,860
It's a minor injury.

Take a seat.

288
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,540
Song Yao bandaged it?

289
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,780

and today you're here to see me.

Chengchuan, why are you here?

I would like to go on a date with you.

Now?

Now.
