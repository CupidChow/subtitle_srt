00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,940
Using her as a shield

195
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,260
is better than accepting
the marriage arrangement

196
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,180
from Ji Honglin.

197
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,700
Liang Jingyi knows too many things

198
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,300
about Ji Chengchuan's

199
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,100
childhood.

200
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,740
Too much interaction with her

201
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,140
will expose my true identity eventually.

202
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,580
Meanwhile, Song Yao

203

00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,180

205
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,020
that as long as you

206
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,940

207
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,620
you may be able to find a way
by dragging it out.

208
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,060
After what happened at the airport,

209
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,900
it's obvious that Ji Honglin

210
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,620
doesn't trust me.

211
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,020

212
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,540
if I drag it out?

213
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,900

215
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,700
Once he sets his target,

216
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,300

until he has reached his goal.

219

If I don't nip it

220
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,860
in the bud,

221
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,980

the secret of my identity.

230
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,500
That's why I have

231

00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,740
Look at its beautiful color.

573
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,460
Let me tell you.

574
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,420
If you wear this,

575
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,820
you'll look so reliable.

576
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,180
You'll look mature and reliable.

577
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,460
Ling.

578
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,380
I'll give you another chance.

579
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,660
This suit is from

580
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,860
a classic movie.

581
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,420
Guess what movie it is.

582
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,380
"Penguins of Madagascar".

583
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,020
"Penguins of Madagascar".

584
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,660
Wrong.

585
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,260
The movie is "Gone with the Wind".

586
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,380
Later, you'll hide behind both sides

587
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,100
of the door.

588
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,340
Once Qin Hao shows up,

589
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,340
you'll ambush him

590
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,340
and take him down.

591
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,500
It's done.

592
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:48,940
Look at you.

593
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,580
Wait.

594
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,500
It's not dry yet.

595
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,580
Just pat it on.

596
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,820
Take him down?

597
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,460
Remove these thick brows on my face.

598
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,140
We are out of time.
You can do it yourself.

599
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,410
[Those who comply with me thrive
and those who resist me perish.]

600
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,700
Those who...

601
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,300
Who can we fool

602
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,300
with this kind

603
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,180
of low-quality cosplay?

604
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,220
Do you think we can fool Qin Hao?

605
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,420
What are you talking about?

606
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,820
Don't laud your opponent

607
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,260
at your own expense.

608
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,740
We need to grab the snake by its head.

609
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,540
It doesn't matter

610
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,420
if he comes

611
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,180
with a truckload of men.

612
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,420
Take him down on my cue!

613
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,300
I already said

614
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,220
that driving this kind of car here

615
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,380
is a terrible idea.

616
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,940
It doesn't matter if it gets scratched.

617
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,140
It's for my best friend
to make an impression

618
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,500
and to show them

619
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,300
how ambitious he is.

620
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,020
It's worth it.

621
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,900
You've reached your destination.

622
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,380
The navigation will end now.

623
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:10,980
Jiang Nanxuan.

624
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,660
Are you sure this is the place?

625
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,180
Are you sure your navigation
is not wrong?

626
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,260
Wrong? That's impossible.

627
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,100
My Zhiling

628
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:17,740
will never be wrong.

629
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,220
It's from the bank.

630
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,820
Don't be afraid, Hao.

631
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,860
They are just making
an empty show of strength

632
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,340
by asking us

633
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,580
to come to this location.

634
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,500
Let me

635
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,140
take the lead today.

636
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,020
Where is he?

637
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,380
Stay still.

638
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,700
I never thought that you would be
in this position one day.

639
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,580
Are they playing
the murder mystery game?

640
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,300
Be smart

641
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,500
and do as we say.

642
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,940
Otherwise, this will happen to you.

643
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,220
The tools they use are quite convincing.

644
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,900
Hand it over now.

645
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,460
Finally, we've cut to the point.

646
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,500
It's time for my performance.

647
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,460
I think that's enough.

648
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,940
We haven't even...

649
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,580
We caught the wrong person.

650
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,620
Gu Zijun, catch.

651
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:32,700
My hands are full.

652
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,140
I'll do it.

653
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,380
Stop!

654
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,500
Do you know

655
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,020
what you destroyed?

656
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:18,820
It's a safeguard

657
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,860
that will protect you
for the rest of your life.

658
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,300
That's why I tore it.

659
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,860
- It's you.
- It's you.

660
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,140
You even threw it away!

661
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,020
No.

662
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,220
Give it back to me!

663
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,060
Go away!

664
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:30,660
Give it back to me!

665
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,780
Don't touch me!

666
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,180
Give it back to me!

667
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:33,660
Go away!

668
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,140
I...

669
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,140
Go away!

670
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,500
You...

671
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,420
Call the ambulance now!

672
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,740
Hurry up!

673
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,340
Quick!

674
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:56,860
Lingren.

675
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,940
Call the ambulance now!

676
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,220
Call the ambulance now!

677
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,900
Give me a hand.

678
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,260
Are you just going to leave like this?

679
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,340
Aren't you going to explain?

680
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:47,900
Hi, Ms. Song.

681
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,260
Long time no see.

682
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,740
What's your name?

683
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,540
I'm Gu Zijun from the florist.

684
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,060
Okay.

685
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,860
Wait. Don't you remember

686
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,100
what happened that day?

687
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,060
Which day? What happened?

688
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,300
Wait. No...

689
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,380
Come with me.

690
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,340
But...

691
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:23,780
It's okay.

692
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,900
Shuangshuang will send him
to the hospital.

693
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:25,660
Come.

694
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,540
Get into the car first.

695
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,980
Are you just going
to leave him like this?

696
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,180
Looks like I'm more reliable.

697
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,020
This is the reverse gear, right?

698
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,380
Why should I panic?

699
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,820
Both of us are alone.

700
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,460
Besides, the contract is destroyed now.

701
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,660
I'm afraid of no one.

702
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,020
The contract you threatened me with

703
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,060
has been destroyed.

704
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,160
I'm no longer afraid of you.

705
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,020
Are you sure?

706
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:52,980
Stop pretending.

707
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,820
Let's go our own separate ways now.

708
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,420
See you.

709
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:10,860
You should take a look

710
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,220
at what you destroyed.

711
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,620
What do you mean?

712
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,780
That's not the contract

713
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,820
that you want.

714
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,220
That's just commercial insurance

715
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,060
that Jiang Nanxuan bought for you.

716
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,380
Don't lie to me. Do you think...

717
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,620
I'm that foolish?

718
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,500
So you better cooperate with me.

719
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,140
Don't try to plot anything.

720
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,820
Fine. You are ruthless.

721
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,900
But we have a long way ahead of us.

722
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,060
We'll see.

723
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,900
Slow down. I feel nauseous.

724
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:20,940
Are you okay?

725
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,580
Shen Shuangshuang.

726
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,580
[Dangerous, don't imitate]
Drive my car slowly.

727
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,420
Please.

728
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,300
That's dangerous. Don't touch me.

729
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,620
Do you know

730
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,500
what you destroyed?

731
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,700
You destroyed my olive branch.

732
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,940
And I was worried

733
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,500
you didn't have insurance and funds.

734
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,100
Thus, I bought

735
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,020
the most elite insurance for you

736
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,020
to give you a better future.

737
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:41,900
Are you crazy?

738
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,420
Why did you buy it when we are all fine?

739
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,100
I'm crazy? You...

740
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:46,940
Don't you know

741
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,500
what saving for a rainy day means?

742
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,940
The global economy is in recession.

743
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,780
You need to have risk management.

744
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,500
You don't know anything.

745
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,020
I haven't even asked you

746
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,060
to pay for Qiao's pillow.

747
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,900
It'll be my loss.

748
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,620
But let's consider it even between us.

749
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,460
Your loss? It's even between us?

750
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,220
Stop the car now. You...

751
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,060
Jiang Nanxuan!

752
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:02,380
Stop the car!

753
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,380
I saved you.

754
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,100
Don't be ungrateful.

755
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,540
Ungrateful?

756
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,900
Stop the car!

757
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,300
Stop the car!

758
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:08,900
Let go!

759
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,580
Let go!

760
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:28,780
Come.

761
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:32,940
Here.

762
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,020
This is the florist.

763
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,380
That day, I was wearing lace.

764
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,980
And I sent you out with some flowers.

765
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,300
When I was about to leave,

766
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,380
you pulled me back

767
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,420
and did this

768
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,340
to me.

769
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,420
At that moment,

770
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,020
I felt like the world had become gentle.

771
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,500
I could even hear music
playing in the background.

772
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,940
Do you remember?

773
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,210
I do.

774
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,010
I pushed you

775
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,060
against the car that day, right?

776
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,100
Yes.

777
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,460
What do you want?

778
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,980
Actually, I don't want anything.

779
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,620
I just want to tell you

780
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,180
it felt pretty special that day.

781
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,580
Like this, right?

782
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,180
That day,

783
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,420
it was just an emergency.

784
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,020
It didn't mean anything.

785
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,340
Your tattoo looks nice.

786
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,460
Aren't you Mr. Ji?

787
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,060
You are a CEO.

788
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,780
Are you going to walk instead of

789
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,060
going back by car?

790
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,140
This place

791
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,980
is far away from the city.

792
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,820
It'll be too tiring to walk back.

793
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,020
What is that saying again?

794
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,020
The evil we bring on ourselves...

795
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,140
You don't have to pretend to care.

796
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,380
The saying is

797
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,060
that you reap what you sow.

798
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,140
Qin Hao, you...

799
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,580
All the procedures

800
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,700
for the asset transfer of Ji Chengchuan

801
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,780
are complete.

802
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,020
Do not turn back.

803
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,020
Qin Hao, do not turn back.

804
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,900
Qin Hao, you are a jinx.

805
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,380
What is he plotting?

806
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,620
Aren't you cold?

807
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,020
I am.

808
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,060
But it feels worse
to see you being cold.
