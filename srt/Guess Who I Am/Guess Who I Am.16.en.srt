I thought you were on leave.

378
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,740
I came here to tender my resignation.

379
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,740
My health hasn't been
doing too well lately.

380
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,100
I plan to return to my hometown
and recuperate there.

381
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,820

I have no idea.

Wasn't she on leave?

Hello, miss.

402
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,020
Are you buying it for yourself?

403
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,900
Or is it a gift?

404
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,460
I think it's a gift.

405
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,660
This crystal ball

406
