00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,020
he is my father in name.

192
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,660
Don't move.

193
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,260
Stop it, Yao.

194
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,780
How did you know it was me?

195
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,580
What if it were an outlaw?

196
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,820
An outlaw that's under 1.7 meters tall?

197
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,740
You're not cooperating with me at all.

198
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,780
So boring.

199
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,700
Why do you come to the office?

200
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,780
It's

201
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,460
a secret.

202
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,820
You've been hijacked

203
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,580
by an outlaw.

204
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,500
Do as I say and come with me.

205
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,220
Okay.

206
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,380
Be careful.

207
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,380
Slowly.

208
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,500
Are we there yet?

209
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,860
Almost.

210
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:53,980
Okay, stop.

211
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,340
Wait for me here.

212
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:56,940
Don't open your eyes

213
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,940
unless I tell you to.

214
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,620
Okay.

215
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,780
Song Yao.

216
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,220
Song Yao?

217
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,780
Qin Hao!

218
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,660
Open your eyes!

219
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,900
Qin Hao!

220
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,700
Are you scared?

221
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:01,980
It's okay.

222
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,180
I'm here.

223
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,580
Look.

224
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,740
Watching fireworks

225
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,740
from this far,

226
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,860
it's not that terrible, right?

227
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,180
Relax, don't be scared.

228
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,340
From now on,
I will accompany you

229
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,700
to do desensitization training

230
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,540
You'll get better.

231
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,860
Thank you for the fireworks.

232
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,300
It's beautiful.

233
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,260
Mom, I'm here.

234
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,860
Yao...

235
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,260
Yao.

236
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:54,900
Mom.

237
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:55,900
Mom?

238
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,500
Mom...

239
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,460
Nurse!

240
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,020
Nurse!

241
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,780
Here.

242
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,580
Yao.

243
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,340
How is your mother doing?

244
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,220
She's doing quite good.

245
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,540
She can talk now. Let's go and see her.

246
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,740
That's great.

247
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,220
My mom's waiting for you.

248
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,860
Song Yao.

249
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,940
Why didn't you ask me to come

250
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,660
these past few days?

251
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,740
Get in first.

252
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,540
Mom.

253
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,180
Shuangshuang and the others
are here to see you.

254
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,820
Madam.

255
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,300
Mom.

256
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,500
They've been a big help
these past years.

257
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,180
I was in a coma for a long time.

258
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,300
Thank you guys for everything.

259
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,100
You're welcome, ma'am.

260
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,460
We were happy to help.

261
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,260
This young man is...

262
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:13,860
Madam.

263
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,700
He is Yao's husband.

264
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,140
What?

265
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,500
You two are

266
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,540
legally married.

267
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:24,860
Mom.

268
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,820
My name is Ji Chengchuan.

269
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,940
I'm Yao's husband.

270
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,460
Ji Chengchuan?

271
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,660
Are you Zhuang?

272
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,690
You're all grown up.

273
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,370
- I remember when you were young...
- Mom.

274
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,860
You just woke up.

275
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,620
The doctor said you need more rest.

276
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,020
Okay.

277
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,620
Yao.

278
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,900
You've sacrificed so much
these past years.

279
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,140
I owe you a lot.

280
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,940
What are you saying?

281
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,340
All I want now

282
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,340
is you can get better soon.

283
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:58,900
I want you

284
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,060
to make me food.

285
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,380
I'll cook for you.

286
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,700
Ma'am,

287
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,340
have a good rest.

288
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,540
We'll leave now.

289
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,380
Bye, ma'am.

290
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,220
Goodbye.

291
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,900
I'll see them out.

292
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:13,980
Okay.

293
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,300
Are you tired?

294
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,300
Do you want to lie down?

295
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,420
No.

296
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,100
I've been lying down for too long.

297
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,860
I never thought

298
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,180
you'd have grown so much.

299
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,380
I really slept

300
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,860
for too long.

301
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,500
Yao must have suffered a lot

302
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,700
all these years.

303
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,500
As the mother, I should be the one

304
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,060
looking after her.

305
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,940
Don't blame yourself.

306
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,060
Yao is happy

307
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,180
that you can wake up.

308
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,900
I didn't expect

309
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,700
you two will get married

310
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,380
after all the twists and turns.

311
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,860
This must be fate.

312
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,820
My daughter is reckless,

313
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
but she has a good heart.

314
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,860
She suffered a lot over the years

315
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,700
because of me.

316
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,460
Now that you two have got married,

317
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,290
I shall entrust her to you.

318
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,380
I hope you can take good care of her.

319
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,660
Don't worry,

320
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,700
I will.

321
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,060
Thank you.

322
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,220
I can rest assured now.

323
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,740
Hey, kids!

324
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,100
Here comes Santa Claus!

325
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,780
Come...

326
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,980
See what Christmas presents

327
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,860
I've got you this year?

328
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,580
Give me one...

329
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,740
You're already drinking?

330
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,020
I'm coming...

331
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,540
Shuang.

332
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,060
Coming.

333
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,860
Come on, hurry up.

334
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,620
What else is missing?

335
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,540
Let me see.

336
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,140
Ms. Song will be coming, right?

337
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,180
She said she's not coming.

338
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,140
She has work to do in the office.

339
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,980
Is everything ready?

340
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,820
Yes.

341
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,100
Everything's here.

342
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,460
Look.

343
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,260
Help us out.

344
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,540
You're not a guest waiting to be served.

345
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,780
Do you expect me
to feed it to your mouth?

346
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,020
That'd be great.

347
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,500
Thanks, mister!

348
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,300
You're welcome.

349
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,140
Go ahead and have fun.

350
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,340
Merry Christmas!

351
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,580
Kids!

352
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,380
Santa Claus

353
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,420
is here.

354
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,100
Is he your friend?

355
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,620
Yours?

356
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,260
Sheng Silin.

357
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,220
You're clearly

358
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,220
a fake Santa with no beard.

359
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,180
Nonsense.

360
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,500
The beard would only cover up
my handsome face.

361
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:29,980
What's so funny?

362
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,940
Come and help me.

363
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,260
Don't you want your presents?

364
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,220
Who kicked me?

365
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,380
I was trying to help.

366
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,180
Thanks, Mr. Sheng.

367
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,700
Let's have a toast.

368
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,340
Come on.

369
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,620
Merry Christmas!

370
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,540
Now,

371
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,540
to celebrate

372
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,660
Christmas today,

373
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,980
I've prepared

374
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,220
a little gift

375
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,060
for each of you.

376
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,620
This is for you.

377
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,460
Thanks.

378
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,660
Yours.

379
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,180
Thanks.

380
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,140
Where's mine?

381
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:10,940
Be patient.

382
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,020
Here you go.

383
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,060
Thanks.

384
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,460
Song Yao.

385
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,580
This is for you.

386
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,020
Thanks.

387
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,820
Why are you staring at me?
What's the rush?

388
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,700
Let me check.

389
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,860
I'm out.

390
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,260
I didn't say I wanted one.

391
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,340
And I didn't prepare one for you.

392
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,100
That's crass.

393
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,060
Do you guys know

394
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,420
why I got you gifts?

395
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,380
No idea.

396
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,420
Today,

397
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,660
I have officially been promoted

398
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,540
to managing director of Shengshi Group.

399
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,100
It's a little different from

400
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,340
some guy's director position.

401
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,580
I'm the managing director.

402
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,940
I meant to say
that nowadays, anybody and everybody

403
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,580
could be a member

404
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,060
of the board of directors, no?

405
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:05,860
Indeed.

406
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,740
Mr. Ji.

407
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,700
Look at how generous Mr. Sheng is.

408
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,940
You're both directors,

409
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,940
but why are you so different from him?

410
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,340
I can be as generous as him,

411
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,940
providing you forfeit

412
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,460
your year-end bonus.

413
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,180
No way.

414
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,020
I am wrong.

415
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,220
I was just joking.

416
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,380
Don't get upset.

417
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,580
Here, have some meat.

418
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,100
Thanks.

419
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,060
Enjoy...

420
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,420
Here you go.

421
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,860
Thanks.

422
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,220
You should eat some greens.

423
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,380
Okay.

424
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,900
Come on, let's drink.

425
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,580
Let me hear you say "my lady."

426
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,580
I'll do it after you drink.

427
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,540
Jun.

428
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,380
Have a mushroom.

429
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,020
Hey, don't.

430
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,100
I don't want it.

431
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:48,940
Jun.

432
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,060
I don't want it, don't give it to me.

433
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:50,900
Have another mushroom.

434
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,980
Excuse me for a bit.

435
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,100
Jun.

436
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,140
Jun? Where are you going?

437
00:25:59,220 --> 00:25:59,700
I have something to do.

438
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,180
Wait.

439
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,100
Look at these couples here.

440
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,180
How could you leave just like this?

441
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:02,780
Goodbye.

442
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,900
Where has all the food gone?

443
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,940
Yes, they're gone.

444
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,260
