00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,580
three.

191
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,700
I'm scared.

192
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,020
Help me.

193
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,540
Don't be scared.

194
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,660
I'm here.

195
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,860
One, two, three.

196
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,420
We're making eye contact.

197
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,140
This is the true gaze of destiny.

198
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,460
It's you again?

199
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,700
Did he recognize me?

200
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,100
Have you recognized

201
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,940
your one true love?

202
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,580
Very good.

203
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,540
This is the right timing.

204
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:25,980
It's me.

205
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,420
Miss,

206
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,500
this safety rope is very safe.

207
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,540
You can come down now.

208
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,580
Can you let go of me now?

209
00:10:59,420 --> 00:10:59,940
What do you think?

210
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,180
I'm reliable, aren't I?

211
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,420
According to the records,

212
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,580
these are

213
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,100
all the photos Lin Shu printed

214
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,940
in SeaDream Studio

215
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,620
back then.

216
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,500
If you do find any clues,

217
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,500
the credit is all mine.

218
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,900
It's all mine.

219
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,500
I'll say it again. It's all mine.

220
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,460
Is that all?

221
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,340
These films

222
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,460
are too damp

223
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,580
to be developed.

224
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,340
Did you not find

225
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,580
the photo you wanted?

226
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,460
No.

227
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,020
Is this what you mean by reliable?

228
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,300
We have five days left

229
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,060
before the document signing.

230
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,340
We have to locate the girl

231
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,540
by hook or by crook.

232
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,340
I remember she was around
seven to ten years old

233
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,140
in the photo.

234
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,940
Hurry and filter out

235
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,020
all girls who fit the criteria

236
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,940
on Yuzhou Island.

237
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,540
Alright, Qin Hao.

238
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,300
Hey,

239
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,420
are you done pacing around?

240
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Can you be quiet for once?

241
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,580
My son

242
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,820
was going to be
the next general manager, you know?

243
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,740
And now, the eldest son is back?

244
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,340
It's obvious that he's back

245
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,740
to fight for the family inheritance.

246
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,780
Uncle,

247
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,580
I thought

248
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,220
you already dealt with them back then.

249
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,380
How could you have no idea

250
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,580
that Ji Chengchuan was still alive?

251
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,500
This conversation is between adults.

252
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,500
It's none of your business.

253
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,220
Why are you taking it out on An?

254
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,740
Besides, he's right.

255
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,260
Yaqin,

256
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,300
we held a casual funeral
for them back then.

257
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,900
That was what Honglin wanted.

258
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,060
Also,

259
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,060
I saw

260
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,300
a dead woman

261
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,980
and a dead child.

262
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,020
Naturally,

263
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,220
I thought of them
as Lin Shu and her son.

264
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,340
Who would expect another kid

265
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,100
to appear at the scene?

266
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:55,980
If Ji Chengchuan

267
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,140
does show us the necklace,

268
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,380
that means he'll be
the new general manager.

269
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,260
If so, An will have no place
in this company.

270
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,300
I served Ji Honglin

271
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,780
for so many years.

272
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,740
I did so in hopes

273
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,980
that An could take over
the group eventually.

274
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,580
Yaqin, calm down for now.

275
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,540
The necklace

276
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,220
won't come to us

277
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,340
no matter how impatient you get.

278
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,180
Uncle,

279
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:13,660
I have a...

280
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,300
Shut up.

281
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,660
We don't have much time.

282
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,620
If Ji Chengchuan

283
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,900
does show us the necklace,

284
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,820
it's pointless

285
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,620
no matter what we say.

286
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,700
We still have a few days left.

287
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,060
Don't worry.

288
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,100
Do you know something that I don't?

289
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,580
Yaqin, look.

290
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,580
At this moment,

291
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,620
the eldest son suddenly came back

292
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,660
and said

293
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,020
that he wanted to be
the general manager.

294
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,140
It's obvious

295
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,340
that he's going against Honglin.

296
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,380
How long do you think

297
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,660
Honglin can tolerate his demeanor?

298
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,660
It's not that big of a deal.

299
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,780
Do we need to resort
to all this trouble?

300
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,380
Just look closely.

301
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,420
Why were you looking for me?

302
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,700
Five million yuan

303
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,780
for your necklace.

304
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,820
Do you know how much the annual wage

305
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,940
of Chengtian Group's general manager is?

306
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,540
Do you think I care about your money?

307
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,500
If so...

308
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,700
You...

309
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,220
Ji Chengchuan,

310
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,380
you better take the money and leave

311
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,620
if you know what's good for you.

312
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:47,980
If not...

313
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,020
Say,

314
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,500
I was already staring at him
with my soul.

315
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,980
Why didn't he fall for it?

316
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,140
Who knows?

317
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,060
Does he have glaucoma?

318
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:22,980
Listen.

319
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,900
Even if he doesn't have glaucoma,

320
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,460
I'm sure his eyes are crossed!

321
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,420
Anyway, something's off about him.

322
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,420
Wait.

323
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,420
Could it be that you're the one
with the issue here?

324
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,060
Could it be that your electrifying gaze
has lost its charm?

325
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,980
We'll know the result

326
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,660
once we put it to the test.

327
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,540
Let's put it to the test.

328
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,300
Let's put it to the test.

329
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,140
Come back!

330
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,700
Where are you going?

331
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,300
What are you doing?

332
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,660
Why did you two drink so much?

333
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,500
Moreover,

334
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,580
do you know where we are?

335
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,220
Did you guys forget
what happened here back then?

336
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,220
Ji Chengchuan is inside.

337
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,820
How could you two

338
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,260
go inside?

339
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,500
Yao. Go.

340
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,980
Stay out of this.

341
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,380
Don't come near me!

342
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,340
Mister,

343
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,700
why don't we go inside together?

344
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,740
Sure. Let's go inside.

345
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,540
She's something else.

346
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,780
Bring it on.

347
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,300
Listen.

348
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,420
I'm Grade 3 in Judo,

349
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,180
Grade 5 in Taekwondo,

350
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,420
and Grade 10 in piano.

351
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,140
Since my electrifying gaze

352
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,820
is still effective...

353
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,100
Ji Chengchuan.

354
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,460
and you delivered yourself
to my doorstep,

355
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,180
don't blame me for showing you no mercy.

356
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,540
Come here.

357
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,780
Come here!

358
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,940
I'll go to you
if you're not coming over.

359
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,620
Let's go.

360
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,140
What are you up to?

361
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,740
Ji Chengchuan!

362
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,660
Remember! You ran away from me!

363
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,420
You fools.

364
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,580
Don't move!

365
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,660
If you can endure three seconds

366
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,540
of my gaze,

367
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,180
I'll kneel in front of you!

368
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,620
What exactly are you up to?

369
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,660
Say no more.

370
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:57,900
Look into my eyes.

371
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,580
It's been three seconds.

372
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,260
This doesn't make sense.

373
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,420
You've been approaching me

374
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,700
time and time again.

375
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,900
What's your motive?

376
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,620
What motive?

377
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,580
I won't fall for that.

378
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,420
Don't waste your time.

379
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,220
He's so dashing.

382
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,700
Hi, hunk.

383
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,100
May we have a drink together?

384
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,620

387
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,700
What's my motive?

388
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,820
I won't fall for your trick.

389
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,100
What are you doing?

390
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,260
Don't do this in public...

Let go of my Aphrodite!

392
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,380
This is unexpected indeed.

393
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,460
So, the famous Ji Chengchuan

394
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,900
is actually this kind of guy.

395

Excuse me.

408
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Did I say you could leave?
Stop right there.

409
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,940
Who are you trying to command here?

410
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,540
Do you know how long
you have been absent from work?

411
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,780
You want me
to call you back to the company?

412

413
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,780
I've long heard of your name.

414
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,860
My brother, Sheng Silin,
is young and ignorant.

415

Please forgive him

416

if he has offended you in any way.

417

We can talk in the office.

421
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,020
Have you found him?

422
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,140
Hao.

423
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,580
It happened 15 years ago.

424
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,140
Moreover, you didn't even know

425
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,140
what the girl looked like back then.

426
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,380
We're finding
a needle in a haystack here.

427
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,300
It'll take some time.

428
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,580
We don't have much time.

429
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,140
We have to locate the girl

430
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,420
in the next few days.

431
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,020
If not, our plan will be ruined

432

once time's up.

433
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,420
Alright.

434
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,060

If you can endure
three seconds of my gaze,

439
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,660
I'll kneel in front of you!

440
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,700
It's been three seconds.

441
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,860
I did a terrible job

442
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,060
last night.

443
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,740
Can I go back in time and do it again?

444
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,660
This doesn't make sense.

445
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,860
Why didn't Ji Chengchuan

446
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,220
give me any response?

447
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,180

That's right. It's us.

No problem.

about the time and date later.

462

Weren't you the one who said

466
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,500
we had to locate her
by hook or by crook?

467
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,580
Tell me, then.

468
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,020
Is there a better way than this?

469
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,060
Do you have one?

470

Do you?

471

Listen, there's no better way than this.

472
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,620
This is the simplest
and most direct way.

473
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,620
Look at the number of people

474
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,100
who have registered their names.

475
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,820
Since we can't locate her,

476
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,860
why don't we do it another way

477
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,140
and make her come to us instead?

478
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,620
This will work.

479

If so,

that I didn't manage to
obtain photos of him when he was young.

489

But that's not the point here.

The point is,

491
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,340
according to the intel

492
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,340
I gathered from Madam Zhang,

before he reached ten.

496
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,340
After that,

00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,260
he left with his mother
to take a breather

498

00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,780
To those whose names weren't called,

568
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,940
you may leave now.

569
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:10,980
Thank you for coming.

570
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,460
Yao,

571
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,780
are you sure you memorized
the secret manual

572
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,580
I gave you?

573
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:17,900
Of course.

574
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,140
What's going on, then?

575
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,340
Excuse me.

576
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,300
Are you sure you didn't miss out
on any names?

577
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:23,980
Yes.

578
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,580
That's impossible.

579
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,580
Isn't that my name?

580
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,660
Why was it removed?

581
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,140
Mr. Ji Chengchuan checked the name list

582
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,340
himself.

583
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,780
He said you weren't the one.

584
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,420
That's why your name is removed.

585
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,220
What gives?

586
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,340
I got all the questions correct,
didn't I?

587
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,580
Miss,

588
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,460
please.

589
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,620
What do you mean by this?

590
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,980
I've already explained myself just now.

591
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:45,860
Please leave.

592
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,020
Wait.

593
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,220
Explain yourself!

594
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,100
I got all the questions correct!

595
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,220
Why should I leave?

596
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,180
I'm speechless.

597
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,380
You guys are so unreasonable.

598
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,340
What kinds of stupid rules are those?

599
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,260
Enough! Let go of me!

600
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,020
I can walk by myself!

601
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,580
I only have one question.

602
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,540
On

603
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,740
28th July 2006,

604
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,580
we were having fun by the sea.

605
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:23,780
What color

606
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,780
was the skirt you wore?

607
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,300
Ji Chengchuan!

608
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,180
Why did you remove my name?

609
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:47,940
I won't leave

610
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,580
the venue

611
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,460
unless you give me an account!

612
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:52,980
You're Song Yao, right?

613
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,660
I'm sure you know

614
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,380
the kind of person you are, right?

615
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,260
Ji Chengchuan,

616
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,940
what about you, then?

617
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,140
Anyway, I'm different from you.

618
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,260
So, you think

619
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,140
a wealthy playboy like you

620
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,060
can take other people for fools,

621
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,580
huh?

622
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,380
Sisters, wake up!

623
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,300
Don't trust him!

624
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,100
He's just toying with you guys!

625
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,780
That summer,

626
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,700
the wind was strong

627
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,660
near my house.

628
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,300
Only fools would wear skirts
to the seaside.

629
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,340
You're curious as to why I know that,

630
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:24,900
am I right?

631
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,980
I'm sure you didn't expect this.

632
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,780
I, whom you've removed
from the name list,

633
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,940
am actually the girl

634
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,300
