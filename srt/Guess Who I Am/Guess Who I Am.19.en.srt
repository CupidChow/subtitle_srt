00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,500
come with me.

191
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,660
I ask the cleaning person

192
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,260
to clean your room every single day.

193
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,540
Just like the way it was

194
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,140
before your mother took you away.

195
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,940
I never forgot
what happened in the past.

196
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,220
The stuff shared by us
before we got divorced

197
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,060
is all kept here.

198
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,220
I truly hoped

199
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,380
that you guys could move back.

200
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:41,860
I know,

201
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,540
it's meaningless

202
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,300
to say this now.

203
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,700
Mr. Ji,

204
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,980
can Song Yao and I

205
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,060
sleep here tonight?

206
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,100
Of course.

207
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,940
This will always be your home.

208
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,580
So rude.

209
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,460
You do make yourself home now, huh?

210
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,740
The painting is still here?

211
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,580
What do you mean by that?

212
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,660
Didn't you know?

213
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,420
Chengchuan's mother painted this.

214
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,420
It looks amazing.

215
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,260
No wonder

216
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,420
he doesn't allow me to remove it
even after such a long time.

217
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,860
He always stares at it.

218
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,180
However,

219
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,100
I've heard before

220
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,860
paintings

221
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,820
are wicked.

222
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,140
Think about it.

223
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,260
This painting was painted by her

224
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,140
before she passed away.

225
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,860
Keeping it here

226
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,820
is just like keeping it on an altar
for the dead.

227
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,740
You'd better think about

228
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,940
whether or not there's any other stuff

229
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,500
that's related to her looks like this.

230
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,940
No.

231
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,820
We kept everything else in the attic.

232
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,420
Good to hear that.

233
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,460
So they kept them in the attic?

234
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,060
It's not even a challenge dealing with

235
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,540
a brainless mistress like her.

236
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,300
I feel sleepy now.

237
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,300
I'll go to bed first.

238
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,700
You should rest early too.

239
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,060
How was it? Did you find anything?

240
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,300
Ji Honglin said he kept everything
he had with Lin Shu

241
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,860
before they got divorced.

242
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,180
I think it includes that cuff link.

243
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,740
If so, do you know where it is?

244
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,300
You must know the answer.

245
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,700
I'll take this side.
You can take that side.

246
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,460
Yeah.

247
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:24,740
Found it.

248
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,740
It's really him.

249
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,300
So the cuff link
you possess

250
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,020
belongs to Ji Honglin.

251
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,460
And the other one

252
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,460
was dropped many years ago.

253
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,260
It's covered in dust.

254
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,380
My mother told me

255
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,420
that Ji Honglin did visit Ms. Lin

256
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,420
on the day the house was on fire.

257
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,060
They even

258
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,140
argued with each other.

259
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,780
Maybe the cuff link fell

260
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,340
during their altercation.

261
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,060
After that,

262
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,300
Ji Honglin chose to
set the place on fire.

263
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,540
But he's Zhuang's father

264
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,660
after all.

265
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,140
How could he...

266
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,580
Some people become devils

267
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,180
in the presence of interest and profits.

268
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,820
I never expected

269
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,820
the truth to be something like this.

270
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,300
It's been tough for you

271
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,580
the past few days.

272
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,420
I'm fine.

273
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,120
[1st January, Saturday, New Year's Day]

274
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,180
Happy New Year.

275
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,180
Happy New Year.

276
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,740
Mr. Zhao, find out which hospital

277
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,260
Song Yao's mother is staying at.

278
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,740
It's time to meet her.

279
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,260
Okay, Mr. Ji.

280
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Have some water and take a break.

281
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,020
Thank you.

282
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,260
You study them every day.

283
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,980
Isn't it stressing you out?

284
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,740
I have the feeling

285
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,740
that something's wrong.

286
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,700
Close it.

287
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,580
Spend some time with me.

288
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,100
Yeah.

289
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,980
You said you'll do as I say before.

290
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,060
- Let's go.
- Sure, I'll do as you say.

Just relax.

295

since you took a break.

It's in two hours.

Why don't we eat something first?

309
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,820
Would you like some shaved ice?

310
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:27,820
What's wrong?

311
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,260
Qin Hao and Song Yao are inside.

312
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,300
Are you chickening out?

313

Who said so?

00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,900
How's your progress
with the investigation?

315
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,140
Mr. Ji,

Song Yao's mother
is staying at Ward 1721,

00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,980
Jianghai First People's Hospital.

318
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,060
She looks familiar.

319
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,340
Go make some arrangements.

320
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,580
We'll head to the hospital.

321
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,220
Sure.

322
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:37,940
Let's go.

Excuse me. Who are you looking for?

Excuse me.

00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,100
in this ward?

You mean Madam Song?

00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,620
I think

331
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,780
she's taking a walk in the garden.

00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,140
This person is the suspect

380
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,900
of the fire case 15 years ago.

381
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,180
Therefore,

382
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,780
the suspect who murdered Ms. Kang

383
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,500
is the one

384
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,820
who got Song Yao's mother injured

385
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,540
15 years ago.

386
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,980
I'll never forget that birthmark.

387
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,660
This is the suspect.

388
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,460
Hello?

389
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,380
The boss said there was something

390
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:25,940
at Zone B No. 13.

391
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,700
I think there's nothing.

392
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,660
Just a few rats.

393
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,900
Wait for me to go back to play cards.

394
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,860
I saw this person before.

395
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,980
He was the one

396
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,820
who was trying to point me
in the wrong direction

397
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,420
at the port.

398
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,940
I was wondering at that time

399
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,140
why that person

400
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:39,940
was acting so weird.

401
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:40,820
You were saying

402
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,620
you met him at the port?

403
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,180
Yeah, what?

404
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,620
We're in trouble!

405
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,060
That means he's been
around us all the time!

406
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,060
I've got to go to Song Yao!

407
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,060
Sorry.

414
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,460
Hello. It's time to change the dressing.

415

Coming.

416
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,820
Mom, wake up.

417
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:00,980
