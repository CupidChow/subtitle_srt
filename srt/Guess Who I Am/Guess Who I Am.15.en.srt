you should stop consoling me.

206
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,980

better than getting my heart broken.

He's been returning home late

208

When I asked him about it,

209
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,180
he said that he was busy with work.

210
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,220

any hesitations.

219

Initially, I thought

But he has to be willing.

239
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,340
He didn't want to sleep with me.

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,860
Song Yao, just you wait.

241
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,300

242

I'm illiterate.

377
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,420
I can't read!

378
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,340
Just leave!

379
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,660
I can explain it to you
if you can't read.

380
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,780
It is finally the time!

381
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,420

421
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,260
You saw him?

422
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,980
Why didn't you help me out, then?

423

Are you angry?

427

Are you jealous?

Enough already. Drop the act.

444

He didn't answer my calls either.

445

I had no choice

446
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,340
but to come here and find him.

447

He said he was working overtime.

448

"Good girl. I'll be back later."

"Good girl?"

464
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,900
He never said that to me before.

465
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,620
Maybe it was a misunderstanding.

466
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,700
I'm sure I was mistaken.

467
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,700
He actually told someone else
that she was a good girl?

468
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,620
Stop crying.

469
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,660

512
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,020
