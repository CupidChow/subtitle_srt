00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,220
How are you? Are you getting better now?

190
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,020
How can he be okay?

191
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,660
He's even got sutures.

192
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,860
Who did this?

193
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,900
Find him at all costs.

194
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,340
I will never let him go.

195
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,060
Mom,

196
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,940
I need to speak
with my uncle in private.

197
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,380
Could you leave us alone?

198
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:20,940
Uncle,

199
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,420
you should stop.

200
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,620
Why?

201
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,020
Because

202
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,060
there are things
that are more important than money

203
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,820
in the world.

204
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,340
Is that your explanation to me?

205
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,900
The cops just finished
recording my statement.

206
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,340
The cops are looking for him.

207
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,260
He won't be able to escape.

208
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,140
I won't hold it against you
for swapping out the pen.

209
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,820
Have a rest
and take good care of yourself.

210
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,140
Seems like my efforts on you
in these years are in vain.

211
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,540
Keep an eye on him.

212
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,660
Yes, Mr. Chen.

213
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,220
You almost killed my nephew.

214
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,300
I won't allow anyone

215
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,100
to stand in your way.

216
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,660
I won't!

217
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,860
You've crossed the line.

218
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,700
You plotted a murder in the mall,

219
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,740
which had a really bad effect.

220
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,100
You're wanted by the cops.

221
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:57,980
Leave now.

222
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:05,980
Go.

223
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,340
According to the traces left behind

224
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,180
before Ji Honglin's accident

225
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,180
and your assumption,

226
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,380
he was headed
for Xishan Factory back then.

227
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,100
He's spending so much effort

228
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,980
to meet the person
related to the incident

229
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,940
15 years ago.

230
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,420
I'm sure

231
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,300
that person
must know something important.

232
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,660
It makes me angry
by talking about his person.

233
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,340
You have no idea

234
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,540
how much effort I've put in

235
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,780
for him to agree to see you.

236
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,940
So, were you the one
who invited him here?

237
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,540
No.

238
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,260
He was terrified by

239
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,180
what happened to Ji Honglin.

240
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,460
He was badly frightened.

241
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,260
He said

242
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,580
we must meet in a crowded place.

243
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,300
I assume he thought
that a quiet place wasn't safe for him.

244
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,620
Everything is in order, right?

245
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,220
Table A3, meet at 10 PM.

246
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,940
He even warned me not to call the cops,

247
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,780
otherwise, he'll destroy the evidence.

248
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,700
Now,

249
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,700
can you tell me

250
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,180
why the number "3" appeared
in the message sent by Ji Honglin

251
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,260
is this person?

252
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,180
Didn't I tell you not to come?

253
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,740
I'm here to work.

254
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,260
This place is very dangerous.

255
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,340
Go home, please.

256
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:41,980
Don't forget.

257
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,700
You're still my target.

258
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,060
I'm going to make you
fall for me once again.

259
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,940
Stop it.

260
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:49,980
Mr. Ji,

261
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,780
don't you think this place

262
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,420
looks familiar?

263
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,020
What?

264
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,020
Have you forgotten?

265
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,460
Do you need me to help
you recall what happened here?

266
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,340
Don't tell me

267
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,900
you thought I was going to kiss you?

268
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:37,980
Mister.

269
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,140
Please enjoy your drink.

270
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,100
Why are you looking at me?

271
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,540
I need to make a living too.

272
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,180
Since my boss has already run away.

273
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,860
I have no choice
but to work for my boss's wife.

274
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,900
Excuse me. I need to clean the table.

275
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,420
Ji Chengchuan.

276
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,420
I was crying a lot for your death,
and you are responsible for that.

277
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,860
Mr. Ji.

278
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,700
Congratulations.

279
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,980
You are still alive.

280
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,300
Don't you think we need to celebrate it
by booking two tables to pig out?

281
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,180
Two tables aren't enough.

282
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,700
We need to set up a banquet
with at least 100 tables.

283
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,580
That's not enough.

284
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,140
What exactly are you guys up to?

285
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,420
Now, you have

286
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,500
three choices.

287
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,540
First one: cooperate with us.

288
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,740
Second one: cooperate with us.

289
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,420
Third one:

290
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,100
you have actually no choice

291
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,660
but to cooperate with us.

292
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,220
Fine.

293
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,060
Tell us what's going on.

294
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,140
I think my dad was going to meet someone

295
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,220
before he was caught
in the car accident.

296
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,300
Who was that person?

297
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,340
Someone who knew the truth
of the fire incident 15 years ago.

298
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,620
That means

299
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,620
Chen Jinghui hired someone

300
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,460
to cause the car accident

301
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,260
after he found out about that?

302
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,580
I investigated

303
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,420
the route my father was traveling on.

304
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,820
I searched all the possible spots

305
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,900
that he might stop at.

306
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,020
I narrowed it down

307
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,980
to Xishan Factory.

308
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,900
And I found the person
who knew about the truth.

309
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,100
I've made an appointment with him

310
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,140
at 10 PM tonight.

311
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,420
Xishan Factory?

312
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,020
According to what I know,

313
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,260
Xishan Factory

314
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,300
is the largest factory here.

315
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,100
There are at least
two to three thousand workers.

316
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,340
How do you know if he's the one?

317
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,780
It's because

318
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,700
my father texted me

319
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,980
the number "3."

320
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:35,940
"3?"

321
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,020
What does that mean?

322
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,780
It's almost 10 PM. He'll be here soon.

323
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,420
[Reserved]

324
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,220
How did you confirm it was him

325
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,660
with only one number?

326
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,940
Actually, "3" isn't a number.

327
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,580
My father always uses

328
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,980
the handwriting input method,

329
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,380
and that person's family name is Wan.

330
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,020
You're really smart!

331
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,260
Wan?

332
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,020
You should be careful in the future.

333
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't need you to teach me that.

334
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,420
I'll check that area.

335
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,180
What's wrong?

336
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,260
It's Li Chen.
I don't want to see him.

337
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,020
I thought you didn't need me
to teach you.

338
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,460
Teach me, please.

339
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,500
Time to take action,

340
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,460
Ms. Song.

341
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,650
[Reserved]

342
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,380
It's Wan!

343
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,060
You...

344
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:46,660
I...

345
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:48,860
My car!

346
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:58,900
Catch it.

347
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:29,900
Hello.

348
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,980
You need your gas stove
to be fixed, right?

349
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,740
Ms. Song told me to come.

350
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,700
That's right.

351
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,740
Please come in.

352
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,260
Where's the kitchen?

353
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,700
Over here.

354
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,340
I'll leave it to you, then.

355
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,700
I don't think

356
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,660
there is a problem with the stove.

357
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,580
I think it's the pipe.

358
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,580
Let me check.

359
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,660
Okay.

360
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,780
Thank you.

361
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,820
Deal with them appropriately.
Don't leave anyone alive.

362
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,100
Alright, Mr. Hui.

363
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,540
Mr. Hui,

364
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,580
all done.

365
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,700
They have a nanny, right?

366
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,580
The nanny isn't here today.

367
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,980
I don't think
she can cause any problems.

368
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,700
For our safety,

369
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,660
you should kill her.

370
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,340
Fifteen, calm down!

371
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,780
Fifteen.

372
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,420
Let him go.

373
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,700
Let's have a talk.

374
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,220
We meet again.

375
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,420
Do you know how many people

376
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,900
have died because of you
all these years?

377
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,660
I don't know if you're lucky

378
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,820
or unlucky.

379
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,580
So you were the one
who murdered all the people?

380
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,660
Yeah, so what?

381
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,580
I told you before

382
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,660
I'll catch you with my bare hands.

383
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,060
How?

384
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,100
You want to get me through him?

385
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,340
I didn't expect

386
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,860
that there was another witness

387
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,380
at the scene 15 years ago.

388
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,060
You've been hiding for 15 years.

389
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,580
Why did you show up now?

390
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:57,820
Don't blame me for this.

391
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,060
Blame them.

392
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,220
it's all their fault.

393
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,580
Fifteen, just give up!

394
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,980
The cops are on their way!

395
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,300
Do you like the fire

396
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,820
I set in the hospital?

397
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:13,860
I know

398
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:15,820
it's Chen Jinghui

399
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,300
who told you to do all these things.

400
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,180
But have you considered this before?

401
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,700
Is it worth it for you

402
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,940
to do all these things for him?

403
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,660
It has already come to this.

404
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,660
It's pointless for you
to struggle any longer.

405
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,660
Ji Chengchuan,

406
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,140
listen,

407
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,380
your mother's death,

408
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,020
Qin Ming's death,

409
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,020
Qin Hao's death,

410
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,300
the car accidents
that Song Yao's mother

411
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,380
and Ji Honglin
were caught in respectively,

412
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,900
are all caused by me.

413
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,820
What can you do about it?

414
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,620
Let him go!

415
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,020
You're too naive.

416
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,900
You think you can restart everything

417
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,180
by faking your death?

418
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,100
No way!

419
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,740
Now,

420
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,260
I'm going to end the game.

421
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:50,980
We have to leave.

422
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,220
You mustn't let anyone see you,

423
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,260
otherwise, things will get complicated.

424
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,100
Let's go.

425
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,060
