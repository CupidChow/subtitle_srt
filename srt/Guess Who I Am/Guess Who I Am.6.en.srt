I was caught in a fire when I was young.

00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,460
It left this mark on me.

195
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,220
So, it was true

196
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,740
that he was caught in a fire
when he was young.

It happened a long time ago.

Doesn't it look like this?

207
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,140
What you saw might be a scar.

208
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,660
But to me,

209
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,820
I saw a beautiful nebula.

211
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,220
Why did I tell her that?

212

213
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:08,940
He deceived you before this.

214

Seems like the money
has been wired away.

I hope you can stay strong.

230

It's nothing to me.

233
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,660
Why did you get the money instead?

234
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,700
Although Qin Hao was forced
to agree to your suggestion

235
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,100
under such circumstances,

236
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,260
it's a shame

237
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,260
that he didn't believe

238
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,860
that you could keep yourself in check
with all that money.

239
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,940
That's why he wired the money to me.

240
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,780

00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,260
After that, I need to go
and wake Song Yao up.

382
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,580
You know how grumpy she is
when she wakes up.

383
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,860
She tears down the roof
if you wake her up by force.

it's definitely your turn.

393

I won't!

395
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,420
It's either I don't,
or we perish together.

396
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,740
Fine. How about this?

After that, we'll walk to her room.

400
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,300
Okay.

You two.

00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,380
Why are you guys arguing

406
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,620
in front of my room instead of sleeping?

407
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,700
Is this a morning workout?

who didn't sleep a wink last night

413
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,460
because of her work?

414
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,980
Beautiful girl,

415
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,580
you look worn out.

416
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,100
Why didn't you sleep last night?

417
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,980
Yao, this can't be true.

418
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,660
Don't tell me you were reminiscing about

419
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,500
your date with Qin Hao
at the planetarium.

420
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,260
No. That's not true.

421
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:52,860
Don't spout nonsense.

422
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,700
She denied it three times.

423
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,660
If so, why didn't you sleep?

424
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,260
Usually, you sleep so soundly

425
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,540
that you wouldn't even wake up
from lightning strikes.

426
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,220
It's because

427
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,580
I was studying the mission.

428
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,300
Is that so?

429
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,940
Since when

430
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,740
were you this hardworking?

431
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,660
Give me some.

432
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,180
It's because my foe is too strong.

433
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,620
I have to become stronger.

434
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,900
Comrade, you do have
great self-awareness.

435
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,220
Not bad at all.

436
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,500
However, it's not like we did nothing.

437
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,260
We came up with an idea.

438
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,580
You'll prepare
lovely lunch boxes for Qin Hao

439
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,420
to bewitch him.

440
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,820
Gu Zijun even

441
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,660
got the recipe for you.

442
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,380
Can Gu Zijun even come up with a recipe?

443
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,340
Why not?

Don't tell me

Listen.

00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,860
I've already stopped playing

450
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,620
Now, I'm only in love with

452
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,900
They're very fun.

I'll download one for you guys

Yao, we're serious.

456
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,580
This time, it isn't a game.

We changed our style.

458

Last night, we watched "Midnight Diner"

until late at night.

460
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,460
It was a great show.

Yeah.

00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,140
Qin Hao said he's very busy lately

479
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,660
and that he has no time
to go on a date with you.

480
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,820
Now, he's totally under your spell.

481
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,940
He should be trying to create chances

482
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,660
to be with you all the time.

483
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,020
But now, he's actually coming up
with excuses to avoid you.

571
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,660
Okay.

572
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,660
But I have something to do tomorrow.

573
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,380
I need to head to the airport first.

574
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,420
Must you go?

575
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,500
Yes.

576
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,620
You must go?

577
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,340
Is it something very important?

578
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:10,820
Yeah.

579
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,580
It's very important.

580
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,420
I'll come back and pick you up

581
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,260
once I'm done.

582
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,700
I'm not lying.

583
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,020
Forget it.
You can proceed with your work.

584
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,820
I need to go now.

585
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,460
You're back.

586
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,260
Where have you been?

587
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,580

588
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:01,820
Who knows?

589
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,980

591
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,540
do we still proceed with our plan?

Chairman,

593
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,740
please take a look.

594
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,100
It's understandable
that he needs to go abroad

595
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,180
to deal with his business.

596
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,100
There's no need to be alarmed.

597
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:53,860
Sir,

598
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,980
I just received the news

599
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,780
that Ji Chengchuan
transferred his assets

600
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,420
to Song Lingren.

601
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,660
I'm afraid

602
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,500
they have an ulterior motive
for doing so.

603
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,500
Honglin,

604
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,860
Chengchuan is going abroad.

605
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,820
And he transferred his assets
to another person.

606
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,100
Could it be

607
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,060
that he's trying to run away
with our money?

608
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,700
If so, he's being too impatient.

609
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:23,900
Ji Chengchuan is on his way

610
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,060
to the airport now.

611
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,300
We'll head to the airport now.

612
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,700
You'll join us too.

613
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,780
You scared me.

614
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,580

616

this early in the morning.

617
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,460
You look like a queen.

618
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,620
Did you not sleep a wink last night?

619
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:04,820
By the way,

620
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,940
I've already sent info
on Qin Hao's escape attempt

621
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,460
to our client.

622
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,580
Cash on delivery,

623
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,980
and the deal is complete.

624

Gu Zijun,

625
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,460
who told you to send that?

626
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,900
Why are you so quick?

627
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:17,900
What's wrong?

628
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,460
This won't do.

629
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,060
I'll be landing him in trouble

630
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,380
if I misunderstood him.

631
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,500
I have to look for him.

632
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,780
I think this proposal

633
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,300
is excellent.

634
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,540
However, for some of the details...

635
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,660

What are you guys doing here?

639
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,620
Chengchuan,

640
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,500
seems like

641
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,620
you're going abroad.

642
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,540
But I don't think

643
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,460
I heard anything about

644
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,620
you having a business trip lately.

645
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,220
Mr. Chen,

646
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,020
who said I was going on a business trip?

647
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,940
But you transferred your assets

648
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,660
to another person

649
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,700
without notifying us.

650
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,220
I'm afraid that's inappropriate.

651
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,500
I need an explanation from you.

652
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,580
Sir,

653
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,620
before this, you said

654
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,860
you wanted us to achieve something

655
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,940
to show the board of directors
our capabilities.

656
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,900
This is Mr. Joseph,

657
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,700

658
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,500

always wanted to collaborate with.

660

I just came here

661
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,180
to discuss business with him

662
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,260
as he's waiting for

663
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:00,940
his next transit.

664
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,500
Are you satisfied

665
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,500
with that explanation?

666
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,340
Mr. Ji, I've long heard of your name.

667
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,580
I'm very interested in the proposal

668
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,060
that Mr. Ji mentioned just now.

669
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,100
It's a shame that I'm in a rush today.

670

00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,340
Are you referring to the money?

00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,540

679
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,380
that you were this concerned about me

had I not done it.

681
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,700
