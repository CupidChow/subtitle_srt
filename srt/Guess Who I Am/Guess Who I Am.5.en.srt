00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,460
he took away Song Yao's necklace

190
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,060
just like that.

191
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,060
I'll expose him online.

192
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,820
Forget it.

193
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,780
If you have the energy,

194
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,940
why don't you think something
for the money?

195
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,540
I even sold

196
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,700
Qiao's merchandise online.

197
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,100
What else can I do?

198
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,900
What can you do...

199
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,860
Just like a father

200
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,540
forgiving his child.

201
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,660
Mind your mouth.

202
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,580
It's as big as an old lady's pants.

203
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,500
When Yao comes later,

204
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
don't mention the money.

205
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,260
I know what to do.

206
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,580
I just beat the crap out of

207
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,340
that damn liar.

208
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,220
It felt so good.

209
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,380
Yao,

210
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,740
although

211
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,980
they did it seamlessly,

212
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,780
I still found out

213
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,620
that jerk is indeed
a fake Ji Chengchuan.

214
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,820
His real name is Qin Hao.

215
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:40,980
For the past fifteen years,

216
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,260
he has been living abroad.

217
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,940
He has just returned to China
a few months ago.

218
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,660
He is currently living in Villa No. 23
on the Jinling Peninsula.

219
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,900
Besides, in order to gain

220
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,820
the trust of others,

221
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,740
he came up with

222
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,980
a pitiful and lonely story

223
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,260
about his life.

224
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,380
The worst thing,

225
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,340

226
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,380
every single tragic incident

227
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,060
that Ji Chengchuan had experienced

228
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,940
on himself.

229
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,740
He said he experienced a fire

230
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,740
and lost his memory.

231
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,820
It's all nonsense.

232
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,620
What era is it now?

233
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,860
I can't believe there's still someone
playing the rise from the ashes thing.

234
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,060
Does he think

235
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,140
he's Dumbledore's bird?

236
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,820
But it's this bird

237
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:09,860
that defeated us,

for the first time.

240
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,300
Stop bringing up the past.

241
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,820
Life has its ups and downs.

242
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,300
Don't worry, we can resolve it.

243
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,020
If things get worse,

244
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,260
we'll take on a few more orders.

245
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:27,940
Oh, no.

246
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,140
The debt collectors are coming.

[Chengtian Group's Newly Appointed CEO
Kisses His "First Love" in Public!]

00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,220
I didn't expect this.

249
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,180
At a very critical moment,

250
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,700
Hao did his best

251
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,060
to prevent Song Yao
from causing trouble.

252
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,180
Look.

253
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,740
I got it.

254
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,940
I will shut up.

255
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,140
You better think about

256
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,260
how to resolve this matter.

257
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,740
Wait. What's happening now?

258
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,820
I'm asking you!

259
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,940
What happened?

260
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,020
What?

261
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,340
I was asking

262
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,500
about you and Song Yao kissing.

263
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,620
What's going on?

264
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,620
I don't know either.

265
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:02,700
As soon as I see her,

You fell in love with her?

00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,460
This is the money
you asked me to prepare

273

for Song Yao's mother's
medical expenses.

274

277
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,740
Look at you now.

278
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,180
You are acting more
like a domineering CEO now.

279
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,980
You're using money to settle problems.

280
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,700
The necklace was hers.

281
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,220
I had no choice but to take it away.

282
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,420
Consider it as my apology.

283
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,460
Ji Chengchuan's taste

284
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,580
is quite good.

285
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,300
I was just kidding,
don't be too nervous.

286
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,340
You are our client,

287
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,300
so it's necessary for me

288
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,340
to explain to you

289
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,460
about the failure this time.

290
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,820
It was indeed an accident.

291

Because...

292

I'm not going to say something

about the impostor yet.

294
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,860
After all, I have no evidence.

295
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,700
There's also no need
to get involved in this mess.

296
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,940
This is like a big family affair

297
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,980
in a soap opera.

298
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:19,940
No matter what,

we will pay the compensation

300
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,460
according to the agreement.

A friend of mine

302
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,300
introduced your team to me.

303
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,460
I know what your team is capable of.

304
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,300
It was just an accident this time.

305
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,980
It's not your fault it didn't work out.

306
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,300

an easy person to deal with.

the Chairman's trust

312
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,340
and obtained the position of the CEO.

continue staying by his side

325
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,620
and report
everything he does to me promptly.

326
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,220
This is to prevent him

from doing anything harmful

You know her well.

When she's not in a good mood,

00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,300
she would play with those flowers.

00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,980
to accept this money.

379
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,220
From now on,

380
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,700
Mr. Ji has nothing to do
with you anymore.

381
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,700
There will be nothing
between you two anymore.

382
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,740
Such a nonsense!

383
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,300
Shuang!

384
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,700
Listen to your own nonsense!

385
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,300
I'll teach you a lesson

386
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,060
today!

387
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:27,940
Calm down.

388
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,460
Stop there!

389
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,980
Hair!

390
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,940
Hair!

391
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,540
I'll beat the crap out of you!

392
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,260
That's enough...

393
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,900
Ji Chengchuan.

394
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,540
You started it first,
so don't blame me for being bad.

395
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,620
Why are you here?

396
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,660
Qin Hao.

397
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,780
I've thought about it.

398
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,340
You've become

399
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,780
the CEO of Chengtian Group.

400
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,940
How can I just leave like this?

401
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,660
Stop thinking about

402
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,540
kicking the ladder.

403
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,220
What makes you think that you could
dismiss me with just a check?

404
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,340
Who do you think I am?

405
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,780
[Chengtian... "First Love" in Public!]
Now that everyone knew about it,

406
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,580
why don't we just make it real?

407
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,340
What do you think?

408
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,060
What do you mean?

409
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,540
What do I mean?

410
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,180
What's wrong?

411
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,060
Don't you agree?

412
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,900
I've thought about it.

413
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,740
You're pretty nice to me

414
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,660
and I can't bear to leave you.

415
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,380
Besides,

416
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,900
you must be really into me, right?

417
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,700
What are you up to?

418
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,900
Are you willing to be with me?

419
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,980
I'm confessing to you.

420
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,620
Can you give me a response?

421
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,540
What are you trying to do?

422
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,580
Do you agree?

423
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,020
I'll take it as a yes.

424
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,540
I'm going home, then.

425
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,860
I'll miss you.

426
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,620
Will you miss me?

427
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,340
It's okay if you don't miss me.

428
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,340
Anyway, you're in love with me.

429
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,020
So adorable.

430
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,060
Bye.

431
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,500
You didn't like me before this

432
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,780
so there's nothing I could do about you.

433
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,420
Just wait and see.

434
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,820
I'll reveal your true colors.

435
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,180
I'm telling you, no.

436
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,460
Can you listen to me?

437
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,220
Let's discuss this later.

438
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,780
You don't even know who this person is.

439
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,220
Forget it.

440
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,420
Don't touch me, I have typed it wrongly.

441
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,470
[I accept this order]

442
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,340
You...

443
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,180
You...

444
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,860
Friends,

445
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,820
I've made an impulsive

446
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,460
yet unquestionable decision.

447
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:58,820
Yao,

448
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,380
I've also made an impulsive

449
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,500
yet unquestionable decision.

450
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,540
- Let me explain first.
- Let me explain first.

451
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,500
- Let's continue with Qin Hao's matter.
- Let's continue with Qin Hao's matter.

452
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,460
Hold... Hold on.

453
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,100
How are you two

454
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,060
so excited?

455
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
What's your situation? You go first.

456
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,060
Qin Hao the liar

457
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,140
has gone too far.

458
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,100
I've already decided

459
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,340
to reveal his secrets

460
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,900
and expose his sinister intentions.

461
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,460
What a coincidence!

462
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,500
I have just replied

463
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,140
to the mysterious client

464
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:19,860
and expressed

465
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,740
our determination and courage

466
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,820
to continue the mission.

467
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,220
Yao,

468
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,740
should we

469
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,820
tell the client

470
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,340
that Ji Chengchuan is fake?

471
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:24,940
There's no need for that.

472
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,220
Qin Hao said it himself.

473
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,340
The whole world has already recognized

474
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,340
that he's Ji Chengchuan.

475
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,620
We have no evidence now.

476
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,660
It's pointless to expose it.

477
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,540
Therefore,

478
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,940
wait until I have conclusive evidence,

479
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,180
I'll cut off his last lifeline

480
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,500
and give him another fatal blow!

481
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,420
What are your plans after this?

482
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,620
It's simple.

483
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,140
Everyone thinks

484
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,340
we have a close relationship.

485
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,740
I'm going to use this identity

486
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,900
to stay by his side.

487
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,300
By that time,

488
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,020
he will surely give the game away.

489
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,380
Yao,

490
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,820
you're amazing!

491
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,580
Friends,

492
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,500
I have a little question.

493
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,340
Go on.

494
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,140
Have... Have you ever thought about

495
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,980
who this mysterious client

496
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,820
is?

497
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,100
Why does he

498
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,980
keep targeting Qin Hao?

499
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,140
I suspect

500
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:06,900
there's something fishy

501
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,380
going on here.

502
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,920
Whatever.

503
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,060
The enemy of our enemy is our friend.

504
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,900
As long as he targets

505
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,020
Qin Hao, this damn liar,

506
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,580
that makes him a righteous man.

507
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:32,900
You two...

508
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,820
What?

509
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,660
There's only me.

510
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,820
Starting today,

511
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,020
I have nothing to do with him.

512
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,300
Qin Hao,

513
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,500
why is he acting crazy again?

514
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,140
Me?

515
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,580
He's the one who's gone mad.

516
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,980
You don't even know
what happened earlier.

517
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,820
Shatter all these.

518
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,740
What's going on here?

519
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,740
Just a moment ago,

520
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,940
you were acting lovey-dovey in the car.

521
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,340
In just a moment,

522
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,460
she is not your cutie anymore.

523
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,300
If you keep talking nonsense,

524
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,260
I'll sell off all your stocks and funds,

525
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,340
believe it or not.

526
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,260
I...

527
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,020
Fine.

528
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,580
I'll listen to you.

529
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,660
Mr. Ji.

530
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,020
Okay.

531
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,740
Shatter them.

532
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,220
I'll help you shatter all of these.

533
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,740
I'm helping you now.

534
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,340
I'll shatter them all for you.

535
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,980
Don't worry.

536
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,660
Only three left now.

537
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,020
Two left now.

538
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,460
Last one.

539
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,100
Wait.

540
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,100
Qin Hao.

541
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,300
Half an hour later,

542
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,580
we'll hold an emergency board meeting

543
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,700
to discuss your proposal

544
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,900
to become a core director.

545
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,260
Okay, I got it.

546
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:42,650
Hao,

547
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,700
I really don't understand
what you're thinking.

548
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,300
Although money isn't

549
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,100
our real goal,

550
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,100
Song Yao

551
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,020
is a greedy woman.

552
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,340
Any other person
would have avoided her long ago.

553
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,180
You're the only one
who's willing to entertain her.

554
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,580
Am I wrong?

555
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,060
Qin Hao.

556
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,900
Actually, Jiang Nanxuan isn't wrong.

557
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,260
A person like Song Yao

558
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,180
will only bring us

559
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,060
more trouble.

560
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,980
Song Yao is definitely

561
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,700
not doing it for money.

562
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,700
She approached me again and again.

563
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,020
I think
there must be someone behind her.

564
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,540
You mean...

565
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,540
If I guess it right,

566
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,660
the person behind her

567
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,340
must be someone
from the Chengtian Group.

568
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,500
That's right.

569
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,740
This person

570
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,180
really doesn't want Ji Chengchuan

571
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,020
to take over the Chengtian Group.

572
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,260
So,

573
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,740
Chen Yaqin,

574
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,220
Chen Jinghui,

575
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,900
and Ji Cheng'an?

576
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,540
If we go by this logic,

577
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,500
there are probably more people

578
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,580
who don't want Ji Chengchuan
to come back.

579
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,740
Let's say,

580
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,260
Ji Honglin.

581
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,300
The reason I suddenly
held this meeting today

582
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,740
is because all of you are here

583
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,500
and I want to hear your opinions.

584
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,980
Yesterday, Mr. Ji Chengchuan proposed

585
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,420
to replace Ms. Lin Shu

586
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,020
and exercise the rights
of core directors.

587
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,700
According to the company's rules,

588
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,500
updating the core director list

589
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,340
requires the consent

590
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,780
of two-thirds
of the Board of Directors' members

591
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,820
for it to take effect.

592
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,540
Chengtian Group's current success

593
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,260
is inseparable from

594
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,260
everyone's cooperation
throughout the years.

595
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,900
Please feel free to speak your mind.

596
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,260
Don't hold back

597
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,340
just because Chengchuan

598
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,700
is my son.

599
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,660
Jinghui,

600
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,740
you're Chengchuan's uncle.

601
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,500
What do you have to say?

602
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,540
Alright, sir.

603
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,500
In my opinion,

604
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,180
Chengchuan, at such a young age,

605
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,740
has already achieved something abroad.

606
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,900
His return and joining
the Chengtian Group

607
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,820
has injected fresh blood

608
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,180
into the group.

609
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,460
However...

610
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,540
The replacement of core directors

611
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,460
is crucial to Chengtian Group's future.

612
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,340
There is no room for mistakes.

613
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,740
I think

614
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:53,900
this matter

615
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,220
should be handled with extreme caution.

616
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,740
Of course,

617
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,460
this is just my opinion.

618
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,220
Chengchuan,

619
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,780
you won't blame me, right?

620
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,100
I thought that by doing this,

621
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,700
you could smoothly take up

622
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,700
the position of core director.

623
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,260
But unexpectedly,
Chen Jinghui and Ji Honglin,

624
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,180
these two old foxes,

625
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,500
actually rejected

626
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,220
the proposal.

627
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,740
I will never give up so easily.

628
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,300
With them interfering like this,

629
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,020
the truth about Mr. Qin's death

630
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,260
would

631
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,060
remain unknown.

632
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,260
On the day of the incident,

633
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,700
this cufflink appeared at the scene.

634
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,820
The owner of this cufflink

635
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,260
must have something to do

636
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,340
with his death.

637
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,100
I have investigated this matter.

638
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,540
This cufflink

639
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,260
was specially customized

640
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,940
for the core senior members
of the Chengtian Group

641
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,860
when it got listed.

642
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,100
Each totem on the cufflink

643
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,660
represents a core member.

644
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,700
This list

645
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,060
is currently kept in

646
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,660
Chengtian Group's core archive room.

647
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,180
To obtain access to the room

648
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,020
and get the list,

649
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,460
we must take up

650
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,580
the position of core director.

651
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,780
What should we do next?

652
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,660
Since they said

653
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,620
we are newbies

654
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,580
with a lack of qualifications,

655
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,540
then let's apply our capabilities

656
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,500
and achieve something

657
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,380
to show them

658
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,780
and shut them up.

659
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,980
[Qin Hao]
What are you doing?

660
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,020
Yao,

661
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,100
you're not sending this, are you?

662
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,740
Why not?

663
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,220
There are a thousand methods,

664
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,460
but caution is the first.

665
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,220
We have to act cautiously.

666
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,020
Think about it.

667
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:09,900
Why are we

668
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,860
texting him?

669
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,820
To ask him out

670
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,740
and find an opportunity

671
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,540
to add

672
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,780
this intimate lover's account?

673
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,060
Wasn't that the plan?

674
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,140
You're right.

675
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,100
So asking him out is important.

676
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,380
How you're going to ask
and what you're going to say.

677
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,660
It's a pretty tricky matter.

678
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,460
I thought I only needed to ask him out,

679
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,260
he said yes,

680
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,740
and then we would have a nice talk.

681
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,980
You're careless.

682
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,140
People who returned from abroad
aren't stupid.

683
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,820
Don't forget
what he did to you before this.

684
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,500
Let's be careful this time.

685
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,700
Texting someone to meet up

686
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,100
has a low success rate.

687
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,100
It's popular...

688
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,620
to use stickers these days.

689
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,540
Come on, our best actress.

690
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,420
It's your time

691
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,300
to shine with your looks.

692
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,300
Done.

693
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,740
Your little sweetheart suddenly appears.

694
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,500
Wait for it, sis.

695
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,100
[Song Yao]

696
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,460
Your little sweetheart suddenly appears.

697
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,860
What are you doing now?

698
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,940
I miss you.
Do you want to date?

699
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,860
How about the Astronomy Museum?

700
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,740
Way to go, Ms. Shen.

701
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,740
You're so good at this.

702
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,100
[Add stickers]

703
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,020
Qin Hao, what are you doing?

704
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,150
[Okay.]

705
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,420
[I'll go.]

706
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,750
[Alright.]

707
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,940
What's wrong with Qin Hao?

708
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,100
It's been half an hour

709
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,260
and he is still typing.

710
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,620
He only needs
to type one word to say yes.

711
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,740
How many times does he need to type?

712
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,060
Shen Shuangshuang, please calm down.

713
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,980
We are a committee after all.

714
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,780
Well,

715
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,340
he will eventually
reply to this message.

733
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,780
how much you made me lose

734
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,900
in the futures market?

735
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,180

big knife?

00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,860
Has he not looked at
his phone all morning?

747
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,700
Or is he disconnected?

No.

I'm restraining myself.

00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,260
from being angry and killing Qin Hao.

Qin Hao, what's wrong with him?

you're only a step away

00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,940
from being a fool.

760
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,260
Qin Hao,

761
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,340
you've lost only a woman.

762
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,420
In my case,

763
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,900
I've lost the whole world.

764
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,380
Every time I see her,

765
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,580
I would lose control inexplicably.

766
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,340
No way.

767
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,740
I must find the reason.

768
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,020
I think you are

769
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,980
the problem here.

770
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,620
I also found something strange

771
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,740
about this matter.

772
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,660
That's why I went through
some information.

773
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,820
I found Li Chen

774
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,900
was also

775
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,820
very obsessed with Song Yao.

776
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,500
But I remember you told me that

777
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,140
after he lost his equity,

778
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,580
[Divorce agreement]
his attitude towards Song Yao

779
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,660
has changed immediately.

780
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,220
Now that I'm calmed

781
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,260
and I see that

782
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,300
you look servile.

783
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,300
You deserve a piece of me.

784
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,860
I seem to remember Li Chen said

785
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,340
after he left the office,
he seemed to be

786
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,340
out of Song Yao's influence.

787
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:40,780
Qin Hao,

788
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,020
if I am not mistaken,

789
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,060
this condition has started

790
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,060
after you inherited the inheritance.

791
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,860
If this is the case,

792
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,620
I have a very good idea.

793
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:51,780
Hao,

794
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,780
how about

795
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,340
you transfer the money to me first?

796
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,300
I'm willing to bear this painful torment

797
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,300
on your behalf.

798
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,980
When everything is resolved later,

799
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,340
I'll return every penny to you.

800
00:37:59,340 --> 00:37:59,900
What do you think?

801
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,060
Don't tell me
this is your "very good idea".

802
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,140
What else can we do?

803
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,540
Is there any other way

804
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,340
you have in mind?

805
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,180
Hao,

806
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,420
do you want to lose control

807
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,180
as soon as you see her?

808
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:08,860
Nonsense.

809
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,660
Of course not.

810
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:11,940
I know her kind

811
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,700
the best.

812
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,460
