131
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,980

133
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:18,540
By the way,

00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,100
It won't help the situation.

153

154
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,500

155
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,980

156
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,580

157
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:07,820
Officer Zhang,

158
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,860
you said the fire

159
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,100
was caused

160
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:11,980
by the gas leak.

161
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,980
But why did it burst into flames
all of a sudden?

162
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,940
According to our investigation,

163
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,420
the kitchen was the place
where the fire broke out.

164
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,300
At that time, someone
was cooking soup on the stove.

165
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,980
The soup spilled out
and put out the fire,

166
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,900
which led to the gas leak.

167
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,060
If that's the case,

168
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,300
nothing should've happened.

169
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,620
But coincidentally,

170
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,500
there was a lighter in the kitchen,

171
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,140
and
the weather was pretty hot back then.

172
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,220
So the lighter exploded

173
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,300
under such high temperatures,

174
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,660
which finally caused the fire.

175
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,980
Officer Zhang, could you remember

176
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,060
whether

177
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:46,900
there were any strange things
that happened

178
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,300
or other witnesses.

179
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,660
No.

180
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,780
You know that

181
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,300
this island is pretty small.

182
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,500
And
this case was the largest one I handled

183
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,100
ever since I became a cop.

184
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,420
It left a deep impression on me.

185
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,620
Ji Honglin was

186
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,140
going to the company back then.

187
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,060
But he changed his mind

188
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,220
and was headed for Xishan

189

after Mr. Zhao received a call.

190
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,020
I checked the number.

191
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,620
Now, the number no longer exists.

192
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,940
What about the number 3?

193
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,060
[Ji Honglin]
Is there any special meaning behind it?

194
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,700

but nothing is related to this number.

195

202

So, the car accident
Song Yao's mother got into,

203
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,340

204

205
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,300

206
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,900

207
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,020

208
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,100
I want you to resign

209
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,140
from all your duties in Chengtian Group

210
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,820
and announce that you're giving up

211
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,860
on the Ji family's inheritance.

212
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,580
Of course,

213
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,220
you may choose to go abroad

214
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,060
after everything is done.

215
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:39,980
What do you think?

216
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,140
Don't you think I'm being kind to you?

217
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,020
At least I'm not going to kill you.

218
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,580
Think about Lin Shu, Qin Ming

219
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,260
and Ji Honglin,

220
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,780

221
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,100
better than I do.

222
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:56,620
By the way,

223
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,300

224
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,420

you'll be able to save Song Yao again

226
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,060
if she's in danger?

227
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,660
Do you think you can keep her safe?

228
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
You don't need to answer me now.

229
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,540
Take your time.

230
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,300
I have plenty of time to wait
for your answer.

231
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,300
This case was the largest case I handled

232
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,980
ever since I became a cop.

233
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,540
As there was no evidence
that it was a man-made incident,

234
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,820
it was judged to be an accident.

235
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,340
Since no one came to clean up
the Lin family's house,

236
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,660
it should be the same.

237
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,180
Ji Chengchuan died in a fire.

238
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,620
I was playing hide-and-seek with him
on that day.

239
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,660
I hid in the closet.

240
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,860

256

00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,740
Aren't you happy that he's dead?

372
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:14,900
Hello?

373
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,380
Hello.

374
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,380
Is this Mrs. Ji?

375
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:19,740
Hello?

376
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,780
Hello?

377
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:23,900
Yes.

378
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,220
This is the Astronomy Museum.

379
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,140
The item your husband had ordered

380
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:28,740
has arrived.

381
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,020
We couldn't reach him.

382
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,980
Are you free to take it now?

383
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,060
Sure. I'll be right there.

384
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,260
Okay. Goodbye.

385
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,700
This may look like a scar to you,

386
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,300
but to me,

387
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,380
it's a beautiful nebula.

388
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,540
Mrs. Ji,

389
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,140
this is the item, Mr. Ji

390
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:04,700
had ordered.

391
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:16,780
What is this?

392
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,340
It's a star

393
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,700
from the Andromeda Galaxy

394
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,260
that's 2.2 million light-years away

395
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,020
from Earth.

396
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,580
It's one of the most distant stars

397
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,820
that is visible to the naked eye.

398
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,380
What you're seeing right now

399
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,260
is what it looks like
after crossing galaxies

400
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,340
and entering our atmosphere

401
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,820
after experiencing
a meteor shower outburst.

402
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,900
Mr. Ji said he hoped

403
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,940
he could help you
to realize your childhood dream.

404
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:41,620
Thank you.

405
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,100
Look, I think

406
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,100
that should be Planet B612.

407
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,180
It's where The Little Prince lives.

408
00:35:59,340 --> 00:35:59,940
That's

409
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,060
my favorite star.

410
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,260
That's the Polaris.

411
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,300
No, if I call it "Planet B612",

412
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,580
then it must be "Planet B612".

413
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,540
If so, do you know
what's the name of the star

414
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,420
under it?

415
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,380
That one?

416
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,220
I don't know.

417
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,700
That's Andromeda.

418
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,540
Then, from now on,

419
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,420
it'll also be my favorite star

420
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,380
besides

421
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,660
Planet B612.

422
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,380
Why?

423
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,100
It's because

424
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,220
I'm a princess, just like Andromeda.

425
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,780
I hope

426
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,700
I can encounter it one day.

427
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,700

- Okay.

503
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,140
According to our evidence,

504
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,740
the person who caused
my mother's car accident 15 years ago,

505
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,940
the fire Ji Chengchuan was caught in

506
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,860
when he was young,

507
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,180
the attack I suffered in the hospital,

508
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,020
and the fire there,

509
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,660
[Fifteen]
was all caused by this person.

510
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,980
He should also be the culprit

511
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,820
who caused Ji Honglin's accident.

512
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,700
Now, our priority is to find out

513
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,820
the mastermind behind him.

514
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,580
I did my research.

515
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,220
Chen Jinghui

516
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,500
was the last person Qin Hao had seen

517
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,460
before his death.

518
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,500
That's right.

519
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,660
Therefore, locating him

520
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,380
will be the best evidence for us

521
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,220
to expose Chen Jinghui.

522
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,540
But now,

523
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,340
we already have all the information
we could find out.

524
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,100
This person

525
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,300
never left any traces

526
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,620
after he was bailed from prison
while he was abroad.

527
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,140
We couldn't find any information
about him,

528
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:21,980
no matter his check-in information,

529
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,660
transaction records,

530
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,460
or trajectories.

531
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,260
It's like he's invisible.

532
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,220
Based on this,
Chen Jinghui and Fifteen

533
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,980
always established
a one-way communication line.

534
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,460
It's impossible to force Chen Jinghui

535
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,740
to tell us where Fifteen is.

536
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,460
So let's start by

537
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,340
investigating the people
around Chen Jinghui.

538
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,460
For example, Chen Yaqin.

539
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,700
They're siblings.

540
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,940
According to
my understanding of Chen Yaqin,

541
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,220
it's either

542
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,060
she's one of the conspirators

543
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,740
or she knows nothing about it.

544
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,220
Moreover, she always hoped

545
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,340
that Ji Cheng'an could
take over the company.

546
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,540
I don't think it's realistic

547
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,380
to start from her.

548
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,700
However, Ji Cheng'an was panicking

549
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,740
when Ji Honglin was caught
in the accident.

550
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,460
I believe that was his real reaction.

551
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,370
What's your opinion?

552
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,220
He's our breakthrough point.

553
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,500
But he's the sole successor

554
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,340
of Chengtian Group now.

555
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,260
