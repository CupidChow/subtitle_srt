190
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,660
Do you have a cure for it?

191
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,980
Recently, you are really…

192
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,140
What's wrong with me recently?

193
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,460
Why... Why are you here?

194
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,460
What is this?

195
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,060
He didn't even knock.

196
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,180
You're a match made in heaven.

197
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,220
Two psychos.

198
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,100
What do you want to do?

199
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,500
I'm not the kind of person
you think I am.

200
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,300
What are you thinking about?

201
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,340
Put this on.

202
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,900
Join me for dinner tonight
at Ji Residence.

203
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,300
Ji Residence?

204
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,180
Wouldn't I be trapped
in a wealthy family?

205
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,140
I won't go.

206
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,700
If something goes wrong,

207
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,620
I can't take responsibility for it.

208
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,140
I'm not going.

209
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,540
I don't mind helping you get changed
with my own hands.

210
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,260
No, I shan't trouble you.

211
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,500
I'll do it myself.

212
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:25,740
Please.

213
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,300
He should've told me earlier
about the dinner.

214
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,220
No one in the Ji family
is a proper person.

215
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,620
I have to think of a way

216
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,140
to not meet their eyes.

217
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:41,980
Sunglasses?

218
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,740
Wearing sunglasses
when meeting his parents

219
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,660
is too pretentious.

220
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,660
Sun hat.

221
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,700
It's dark now, there are no UV rays.

222
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,700
It would be absurd to wear a hat.

223
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:52,980
Never mind.

224
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,380
The old man is getting older.

225
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,700
If you scared him,

226
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,780
you were to blame.

227
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,260
I hate wearing this the most.

228
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,260
You really know
how to cause trouble for me.

229
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,220
I'm so annoyed.
It's all Qin Hao's fault.

230
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,060
Three, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

231
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,940
Four, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

232
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:33,940
Are you ready?

233
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,740
Why did you cry?

234
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,220
Do you hate going with me that much?

235
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,500
What are you doing?

236
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,500
Try poking your eyes with your finger.

237
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,060
Later when we're at Ji Residence,

238
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,940
don't try anything funny.

239
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,780
Okay, I will stay quiet and obedient.

240
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,900
That's it for today.

241
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,260
Do some stretching.

242
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,260
Mr. Ji, the dishes are all ready.

243
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,100
Okay.

244
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,460
All right, we're having
a family dinner today.

245
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,260
It's a rare occasion
that all of us can have a meal together.

246
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,100
Help yourselves.

247
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:50,660
Jingyi,

248
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,060
this shrimp is so delicious.

249
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,260
Here.

250
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,540
Okay.

251
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,940
Dear, here.

252
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,420
Have a mushroom.

253
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,940
Qin Hao, you didn't expect this,
did you?

254
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,060
Although Zhuang and I

255
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,220
have just known each other
for a few days,

256
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,180
I know

257
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,500
he never eats mushrooms.

258
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,980
I want you to

259
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,100
give yourself away

260
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,140
before the Ji family.

261
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,580
Let's see if you still dare
to be smug with me.

262
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,420
Honey, did you forget?

263
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,540
I never eat mushrooms.

264
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,100
That's not right.

265
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,300
Your mouth is dirty,
let me wipe it for you.

266
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,540
You've done your homework.

267
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,540
Thanks, dear.

268
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,780
An,

269
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,620
learn from your brother.

270
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,700
Be kinder to your wife in the future.

271
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,020
Jingyi,

272
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,820
I just peeled this shrimp for you.

273
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,180
Good evening, Mr. Chen.

274
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,420
Honglin, Yaqin.

275
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,980
My flight was delayed.

276
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,500
Sit there.

277
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,540
Sit down quickly.

278
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,580
Jinghui.

279
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,020
When you were away on the business trip,

280
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,380
many major things happened.

281
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,260
Ms. Song and Chengchuan

282
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,340
are married.

283
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,540
Ms. Song

284
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,860
is truly extraordinary.

285
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,420
You can be considered

286
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,740
marrying into wealth.

287
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,860
In that aspect,

288
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,060
Mrs. Chen is more experienced.

289
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:57,940
Chengchuan,

290
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,900
come with me.

291
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,300
Here, eat. Be good.

292
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:13,660
Okay.

293
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,540
You're both living separately.

294
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,980
How can you call it a marriage?

295
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,020
Are you trying to fob me off?

296
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,140
Sir,

297
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,740
Yao and I were reunited
after many years.

298
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,980
Everything takes time.

299
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,220
Chengchuan,

300
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,780
since you are married,

301
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,940
just live together already.

302
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,580
I don't want to
be ridiculed by others for this.

303
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,060
You shouldn't be concerned with

304
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,260
my personal affairs with Yao, sir.

305
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,180
Okay, if you refuse
the Liang family's help,

306
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,940
don't blame me
for not paving the way for you.

307
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,100
If you want to gain a foothold
in Chengtian,

308
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,940
you'll have to depend
on your own abilities.

309
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,380
If there is nothing else,

310
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,900
I shall excuse myself.

311
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,220
Why was this house built

312
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,500
like a maze?

313
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,260
Ms. Song,

314
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,660
you really are something.

315
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,660
Or I should call you
my niece-in-law now?

316
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,890
Our cooperation will continue.

317
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:21,820
And you

318
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,460
will continue to stay by his side.

319
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,780
Report his actions to me anytime.

320
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,860
Prevent him from doing something

321
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,500
unfavorable to

322
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,540
our group.

323
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,820
Ms. Song,

324
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,460
you plotted meticulously

325
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,620
to enter the Ji family.

326
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,940
You must have a big ambition.

327
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,300
Chengchuan and I got married

328
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,180
all thanks to your introduction.

329
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,140
If you cause any more trouble,

330
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,980
let's see if Chengchuan

331
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,740
trusts his step-uncle

332
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,020
who is trying to sow discord,

333
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,060
or his wife

334
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,580
whispering intimately to him.

335
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,580
I will return the money to you.

336
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,020
Miss Liang,

337
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,020
if there's nothing important,

338
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,180
could you please make way?

339
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,300
Who are you showing

340
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,900
this pitiful pretense to?

341
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,180
You wench.

342
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,020
Of course, for those who want to see it.

343
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,980
I advise you to leave Ji Chengchuan
as soon as possible.

344
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,460
A romance with unequal familial status

345
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,300
will not bear fruit.

346
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,340
It would be best for both of you
to separate as soon as possible.

347
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,900
Okay, I'll think about it.

348
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,780
What's with your attitude?

349
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,020
Look at yourself.

350
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,220
Are you even worthy of him?

351
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,060
Yes, I'm not good enough for him.

352
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,460
You deserve him better.

353
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,780
You are simply

354
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,300
a beautiful pair, a perfect couple,

355
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,020
a match made in heaven.

356
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,020
Oh, right.

357
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,420
Can you help me persuade him

358
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,580
to dump me as soon as possible?

359
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,980
Then he can send a carriage to you

360
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,940
and carry you home to marry you.

361
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,340
What?

362
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,020
What's with

363
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,740
your weird tone?

364
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,260
My nephew

365
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,740
is excellent but naive.

366
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,740
He is still young.

367
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,500
Do you want me to dump you?

368
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,740
Do you really want to divorce me
that badly?

369
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,900
Why did you spout nonsense

370
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,740
in front of Liang Jingyi?

371
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,260
I wasn't talking nonsense.

372
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,260
I didn't bring you here

373
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,220
for you to wreak havoc.

374
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,420
I wasn't wreaking havoc.

375
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,220
From today onward,

376
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,500
you move into my house and live with me.

377
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,300
What?

378
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,580
Are you okay? Are you crazy?

379
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,460
I knew you were perverted,

380
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:21,900
but I didn't know

381
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,660
that you would be this perverted.

382
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,700
Let me tell you,

383
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,820
I'm poor but I have dignity.

384
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,740
I only sell my skills, not my body.

385
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,020
Give up on this thought.

386
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,060
Selling your skills but not your body?

387
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,500
Yes.

388
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,580
Last night, who was the one

389
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,540
who stuck around my house
and wouldn't leave?

390
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,100
Forcing herself on me?

391
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,460
That's because you took the…

392
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,260
Forget it, stop the car.

393
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,580
Stop the car!

394
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,500
If you don't stop it,

395
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,460
I will jump out of the car.

396
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,020
Song Yao.

397
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,540
Get in.

398
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,300
Song Yao.

399
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,980
Get in the car and stop making trouble.

400
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,020
I'll give you ten seconds

401
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,180
to get out of my sight.

402
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,940
It seems like their relationship

403
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,500
is not as lovey-dovey

404
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,940
as they looked during dinner

405
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,980
just now.

406
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,180
Hello?

407
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,660
Help me with something.

408
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,850
[Sheng Silin]

409
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,460
Aphrodite?

410
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,300
It is so close!

411
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:14,980
This is an opportunity not to be missed.

412
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,660
Goddess, here I come.

413
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,020
Mr. Sheng Jr.,

414
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,260
have you finally decided

415
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,260
to go back to work?

416
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:25,940
If not,

417
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,980
Mr. Sheng Sr. told us

418
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,340
that you can't go anywhere.

419
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,500
Excuse me.

420
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,020
Mr. Sheng Jr.

421
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:03,980
Mr. Sheng Jr.

422
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:10,900
Mr. Sheng Jr.!

423
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,100
Mr. Sheng Jr., please stop it.

424
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,460
If not, I can't explain myself
to your brother,

425
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:15,980
Mr. Sheng Jr.

426
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,060
The sound from
branded bluetooth speakers

427
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,180
really sounds like the real thing.

428
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,060
Mr. Sheng Jr.!

429
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,660
Well,

430
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,420
you get what you pay for.

431
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,020
Mr. Sheng Jr.!

432
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,820
I can't explain myself to your brother.

433
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,220
I really can't!

434
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,620
What kind of lousy place is this?

435
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,980
I can't even get a taxi.

436
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,100
I should've

437
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,180
kicked Qin Hao out of the car.

438
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,620
Why should I get out of the car?

439
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,380
Playing this game with me?

440
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,860
You will definitely call me

441
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,340
within three minutes,

442
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,460
begging me to pick you up.

443
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,820
What a coincidence.

444
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,620
Once a coincidence, twice a coincidence.

445
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,660
Can it still be called a coincidence
after so many times?

446
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,500
Perhaps

447
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,500
it's destiny.

448
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,620
Don't you know me?

449
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,660
I am

450
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,740
the unparalleled good-looking man.

451
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,380
It's me, Sheng Silin.

452
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,020
Look at this godly handsome face.

453
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,260
She is so fascinated

454
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,500
that she is speechless.

455
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,140
Five minutes.

456
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,380
No, eight minutes.

457
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,340
She will definitely call me.

458
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,620
I understand.

459
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,580
Having a WeChat friend

460
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,220
as perfect as me

461
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,340
will surely make you feel inferior.

462
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,380
Actually,
you don't have to feel this way.

463
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,220
After all, in the whole world

464
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,580
there is only one me.

465
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,900
I'll make an exception

466
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,380
and allow you to be my good friend.

467
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,780
You're not making any sense.

468
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,700
Quickly

469
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,740
remove me

470
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,780
from your WeChat block list.

471
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,980
You don't have to be embarrassed.

472
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,900
After all, I am a man.

473
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,300
As I said, you are…

474
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,260
No.

475
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,900
Don't follow me.

476
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,260
Okay, I'll do as you say.

477
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,420
Goodbye.

478
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,220
[Crazy guy]

479
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,620
What took you so long

480
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,260
to answer my call?

481
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:33,980
Who is this?

482
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,500
Sheng Silin?

483
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,020
How come Song Yao's phone

484
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,540
is with you?

485
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,220
Where are you?

486
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,140
The two of us are at the bus stop.

487
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,900
Well, well. She refuses to get in my car

488
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,300
but leaves her phone behind

489
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,020
with another man.

490
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,020
It is you.

491
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:19,940
Where is Song Yao?

492
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,380
I sent her home.

493
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,620
She left her phone here.

494
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:27,900
Don't worry.

495
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,460
First, make a call

496
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,140
to this phone.

497
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,660
How else would I know

498
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,940
that you know her?

499
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,900
Maybe you were coveting this phone

500
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,180
and trying to falsely claim it.

501
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,660
Turns out the Crazy Guy

502
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,940
is you.

503
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,350
[Crazy Guy]

504
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,900
Stay away from her.

505
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,980
No, I prefer not.

506
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,060
I want to be closer to her.

507
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,140
Closer.

508
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,660
I want to get super close to her.

509
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,860
You're nuts.

510
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,340
Live together with him?

511
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,300
Unexpectedly, Qin Hao is also a pervert.

512
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,660
Yao.

513
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,260
You must not back down on this matter.

514
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,900
If he dares
trying anything funny, I will…

515
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,020
Shen Shuangshuang,

516
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,220
stop meddling
in other people's business.

517
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,180
Maybe Yao

518
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,060
is very happy.

519
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,340
Not only happy, but extremely happy.

520
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:02,980
Gu Zijun,

521
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,140
what nonsense are you talking about?

522
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,260
Do you see Yao as that kind of person?

523
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,140
How would she like some jerk

524
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,340
like Qin Hao?

525
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,540
Let's talk.

526
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,380
See?

527
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,180
What did I say?

528
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,260
Look at how they are glued together.

529
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,020
Inseparable.

530
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,620
Shut up.

531
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,300
Our store is closed.
Please take your leave.

532
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,020
Don't you want your phone back?

533
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,700
Give it to me.

534
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,550
[Dear]

535
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,380
You…

536
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,860
We are now a legal couple.

537
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,300
Why? Does my honey wish for

538
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,860
a more intimate term?

539
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,740
How about 'Dear Hubby'?

540
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,580
You are too shameless.

541
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,260
Change it quickly, hurry up!

542
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,020
Give it to me! Give it back to me!

543
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,660
Give it back to me!

544
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,020
You…

545
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,980
So desperate to fall into my embrace?

546
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,500
Why don't you move in with me
as soon as possible?

547
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,540
Shut up!

548
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,100
You…

549
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,340
What a pervert!

550
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,180
Let me tell you this!

551
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,460
Even if I wander on the streets,

552
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,220
I won't live together with

553
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,060
a pervert like you!

554
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,860
Pervert, cursed rogue!

555
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,740
Stop running! Stop right there!

556
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:47,580
You…

557
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:48,860
Just wait.

558
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,500
Sooner or later I'll make you move in

559
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,020
with me.

560
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,580
Dream on!

561
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,300
Let me guess

562
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,740
the only one who could

563
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,820
make Hao into this state

564
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,980
must be the marvelous

565
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,820
Ms. Song Yao.

566
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,460
Am I right?

567
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:19,900
Qin Hao,

568
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,180
I found out that Liang Jingyi

569
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,260
is investigating Song Yao.

570
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,660
She seems to be doubting

571
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,500
the truth behind your marriage.

572
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,020
Do you need me to…

573
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:26,500
No.

574
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,060
Liang Jingyi has no patience.

575
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,940
She will act soon.

576
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,940
Now that Ji Honglin has

577
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,020
started to doubt Song Yao and me,

578
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,740
I need to find a reason

579
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,620
to make Song Yao move in here

580
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,260
and dispel their suspicions.

581
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,900
So...

582
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,460
You're going to
make Liang Jingyi part of the plan?

583
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:46,620
Yes.

584
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:48,820
