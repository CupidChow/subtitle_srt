Song Yao.

21
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,780
I've finished reading your novel.

22
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,620
Your writing

23
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,260
is pretty good.

24
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,540
Particularly the parts of them dating.

25
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,500
Even though I've been single

26
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,300
for over 40 years,

27
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,220
I felt the urge to be in love
after reading it.

28
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,860
However,

29
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,900
I'm afraid that we can't

30
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,780
sign you on.

31
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,980
Why is that?

32
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,540
Didn't we agree on it?

33
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,620
Once the story is complete,

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,820
you'll publish it for me.

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,540
Song Yao.

36
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,740
What we agreed on was

37
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,420
if the readership was good,

38
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,420
we'd sign you on.

39
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,100
But the readership of this book

40
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,540
doesn't hit the mark.

41
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,900
No way.

42
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,020
I received comments from my readers

43
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,340
just today.

44
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,820
Those were the efforts of our editors,

45
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,660
pretending to be readers.

46
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,980
We must gain a fair amount of comments
in order to meet the KPI.

47
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,100
The actual number of readers
for your novel

48
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,460
is closer to single digits.

49
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,580
Works that are purely of one genre

50
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,740
are no longer able to satisfy

51
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,260
the current market.

52
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,740
What do readers want nowadays?

53
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,660
Diversity, complexity,

54
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,260
realistic works.

55
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,300
Solely talking about love

56
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,260
can no longer satiate the market.

57
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,140
In our industry,

58
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,500
competition is tough.

59
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,060
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,020
We won't be able to sign you on.

61
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:12,700
Anyway,

62
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,940
to express our apology,

63
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,780
I specially picked this memento out

64
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,940
from the Editorial Department

65
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,860

Sir.

68
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,460
If the readers are not satisfied,

69
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,420
I'm willing to revise.

70
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,380
Song.

71
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,620
Listen.

72
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,820
I have a meeting with my boss.

73
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,500
He'll be here very soon.

74
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,780
He's really punctual.

75
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:43,820
So,

76
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,580
why don't you

77
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,500
head back first?

78
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,060
I'll see you next time, then.

79
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,380
See you again.

80
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,100
You guessed it.

81
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,300
Listen to me.

82
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,700
Here's the deal.

83
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,780
Your next book,

84
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,740
and your book after the next
will all be mine.

85
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,380
Alright?

86
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,300
Nobody else.

87
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,180
Sure, I'll buy you dinner tonight.

88
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:25,940
Sure.

89
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,940
I'll send you the address later.

90
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,780
Okay, got it.

91
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,740
Sure, Zhou.

92
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,740
See you at dinner.

93
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,380
Mr. Liu.

94
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,140
Would you like a drink?

95
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,860
Who cares about drinking?

96
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,020
Mr. Lu.

97
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,220
I pay you a handsome salary.

98
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,900
Why?

99
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,020
Just one reason.

100
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,460
To secure good stories and publish them
on behalf of the company.

101
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,580
What is the deal right now?

102
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,660
Tell me.

103
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,060
Look at

104
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,060
the list of books you handed in.

105
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,220
Which book

106
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,660
fits the criteria I named

107
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,700
in the last meeting?

108
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:55,820
But...

109
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,820
No, don't you "but" me.

110
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,780
I don't want any "buts".

111
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,380
I'm going to tell you one last time.

112
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,780
Our works

113
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,700
need to have
the complexity of human nature,

114
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,220
relationship entanglements,

115
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,100
as well as the dark currents

116
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,220
beneath the flashy exterior.

117
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,460
Don't forget

118
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,220
a sense of imagination
beyond common understanding.

119
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,540
The point is,

120
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,100
it needs to have power struggles,

121
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,140
reasoning,

122
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,780
suspense,

123
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,700
action,

124
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,820
comedy and the like in your story.

125
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,380
That's what sells!

126
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,020
That is what the readers

127
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,540
are expecting.

128
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,700
How many times do I have to repeat it?

129
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,900
Every time,

130
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,020
you answer with "Yes, I know".

131
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,900
Whatever you promised,

132
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,700
you forgot.

133
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,140
Mister.

134
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,340
Can I ask a favor from you?

135
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,700
Those works you want

136
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,780
are easier said than done.

137
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,660
As of now,

138
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,460
we don't have anything like that.

139
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,540
Easier said than done?

140
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,020
Does it get done

141
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,660
by you sitting here drinking coffee?

142
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,260
You even got yourself a private room.

143
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,100
Tell me.

144
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,140
If I hadn't come to see you today,

145
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,780
would you still

146
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,540
be slacking the whole afternoon?

147
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,140
No, surely not.

148
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,460
Don't misunderstand.

149
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,460
I came today because...

150
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:58,700
Hi there.

151
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,580
Which one of you is Mr. Lu?

152
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,220
That... That's me.

153
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,540
Hi.

154
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,540
Who is this?

155
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,620
Cold Wind in September.

156
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,700
The suspense writer
Mr. Lu wanted to meet.

157
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,900
Suspense writer?

158
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:22,970
You write suspense stories?

159
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,420
Just suspense is not good enough.

160
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,060
A story with just one subject

161
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,820
can't satisfy what the market wants.

162
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,100
Readers nowadays

163
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,900
want diversity,

164
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,860
realistic,

165
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,060
and complex stories.

166
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,940
That's exactly what I said

167
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,140
in our last meeting!

168
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,820
Great minds think alike.

169
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,380
Listen carefully, Lu Yu.

170
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,180
May I ask who this like-minded man is?

171
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,740
Mr. Liu, the publisher's director.

172
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:53,940
Nice to meet you, Mr. Liu.

173
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,540
Likewise.

174
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,340
I came to see Mr. Lu today

175
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,220
to talk about

176
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,420
the new novel I'm working on.

177
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,340
Like I said,

178
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,340
my new novel has a mix

179
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,460
of mystery solving,

180
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,460
dynamic action,

181
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,300
relationship issues,

182
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,660
and the battle of wits
in business competition.

183
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,980
That's what the story is about.

184
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,140
Have you made up your mind?

185
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:12,900
Here's the thing.

186
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,980
Right now, I've been contacted
by multiple companies

187
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,060
to discuss serialization,

188
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,660
including publishing rights and such.

189
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,740
If you

190
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,860
are not ready to decide,

191
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:22,580
then I'll...

192
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,420
No, no.

193
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,260
Here's the thing.

194
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:27,820
Ms. Cold Wind.

195
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,740
Our company

196
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,780
prioritizes numbers and data.

197
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,540
My suggestion to you

198
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,740
is to first have your work
serialized on our platform.

199
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,500
If the numbers are good,

200
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,740
we'll sign a contract with you.

201
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,740
What do you say?

202
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,580
No problem.

203
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,300
I look forward to our collaboration.

204
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,100
Likewise.

205
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:46,900
Awesome.

206
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,860
As for the details,

207
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,780
I will leave you to it.

208
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,740
Go over them

209
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,340
with Mr. Lu here.

210
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:50,780
Okay?

211
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,460
Sure.

212
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,180
See to it.

213
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,300
I'll be off.

214
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,060
See you.

215
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:54,980
I'll leave you two to it.

216
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:55,820
Take care, Mr. Liu.

217
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,580
Sure.

218
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,420
Incredible.

219
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,860
That was superb acting.

220
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,940
I think

221
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,740
it's such a waste you're not an actor.

222
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,900
Really?

223
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,100
I did think about

224
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,300
being an actress

225
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,060
instead of being a crew member.

226
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,460
Do you really think I'm praising you?

227
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:19,660
Song Yao.

228
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,460
Do you have any idea

229
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,660
the consequence
of your little act there?

230
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,900
Where am I supposed to find the story?

231
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,580
I didn't lie to you.

232
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,460
I am trying

233
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,540
at other genres.

234
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,900
I'm currently working on

235
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,100
a romantic suspense story.

236
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,460
And what I did just now
got me the chance

237
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,220
to have another go at serialization.

238
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,660
Whether or not it can get published

239
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,940
will still depend on the numbers.

240
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,460
But I'm confident

241
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,580
this time will definitely work out.

242
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,500
You?

243
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,140
Romantic suspense?

244
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,820
Don't worry.

245
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,020
On my way here just now,

246
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,340
I've already come up with an outline.

247
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,340
How about this?

248
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,620
Just give me three months.

249
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,740
I promise you'll be happy with my work.

250
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,180
Fine.

251
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,060
Since you've gone

252
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,820
this far,

253
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,220
I'll wait for your new work, then.

254
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,460
If it doesn't work...

255
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,300
Both of us can look for another career.

256
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:12,860
Don't worry.

257
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,020
[Chapter 1]

258
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,580
Reasoning, suspense, action,
business competition, comedy.

259
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,020
I simply don't know where to start.

260
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,140
Why on earth

261
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,540
get myself into trouble?

262
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:58,200
[Rashomon]

263
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,020
Not only does it require
human complexity,

264
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,620
but it also needs to have
relationship entanglements

265
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,500
and the dark currents

266
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,380
beneath the flashy exterior.

267
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,220
Imagination beyond common understanding.

268
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,740
I've got it.

269
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,000
[One fine day, in a bar named Oscar]

270
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,300
[in the city of Jianghai,]

271
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,300
[customers are reveling
in food and wine.]

272
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,250
[On the bar top,
lies several glasses of whiskey.]

273
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,350
[A hand stealthily reaches over]

274
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,070
[and swaps one of it out.]

275
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,380
I've swapped the glass.

276
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,020
Facing me,

277
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,660
the first, top left.

278
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,020
When the target

279
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,620
is tipsy,

280
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,340
I'll deliver it.

281
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,020
Ling, serve the alcohol.

282
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,740
Then, serve the glass

283
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,220
we specified.

284
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:30,860
Let him hold it.

285
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Hao will press the trigger

286
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,460
and injure his hand.

287
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,740
Then take a blood sample.

288
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:35,980
Got it?

289
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,260
Where are the drinks?

290
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,020
Coming.

291
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,260
I'll repeat it once more.

292
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,100
I'm going

293
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,140
to hand you the specific glass to you.

294
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,020
Don't get it wrong.

295
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,140
Drink up. Don't just sit there.
Hurry up.

296
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,860
Bottoms up, come on.

297
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,620
Here.

298
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,020
The target

299
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,900
is getting tipsy.

300
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:10,620
Head over.

301
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,740
Thanks.

302
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,620
What happened?

303
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,500
Nothing.

304
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,780
Just a little mishap.

305
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:44,820
Don't worry, Hao.

306
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:45,980
Be careful.

307
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,660
I'm already in position.

308
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,540
Got it.

309
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,660
What's happened?

310
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,620
The audio's no good.

311
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,620
Come on, attack the guy.

312
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,340
Why are you standing so far away?

313
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,380
Gu Zijun, find out what's wrong.

314
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,460
It's probably

315
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,060
interference from another signal.

316
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,340
The source is very near to you.

317
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,380
Looks like

318
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,660
we're not the only ones with a plan.

319
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,580
Hi there.

320
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,860
Where's the target?

321
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:46,980
We've already sussed him out.

322
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,020
He's seated at Table 8.

323
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,900
That's him enjoying himself.

324
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:49,580
Go ahead.

325
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,420
Thanks.

326
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:54,780
Twenty, fifteen.

327
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,060

329
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,780
What are you doing here?

330
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,140
Can't I be here?

331
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,820
I thought you asked me to come.

332
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:36,820
Come, quick.

333
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,820
Sit down.

334
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:38,980
Make space.

335
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:40,700
Sit.

336
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,740
Chen.

337
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,700
About what we talked about before,

338
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,820
have you appraised it?

339
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,900
Haven't I told you?

340
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,420
Better appraise the assets properly.

341
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,940
I want what's best for you.

342
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,620
After all, you two
are getting a divorce.

343
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,300
Regarding your personal assets,

344
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,620
I've done a rough estimation.

345
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,020
It's by the book.

346
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,300
It'll save you a lot of trouble.

347
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,540
You'll soon regain your freedom.

348
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,460
You are always right.

349
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,460
I'll do as you say.

350
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,380
Here.

351
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,420
Is it this amount?

352
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,100
Take a look.

353
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,620
Babe, you're so smart.

354
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,620
It's right on the dot.

355
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,940
We've confirmed

356
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,740
all the information.

357
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,180
I'm going to send the contents

358
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,340
to Li Chen's wife right away.

359
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,100
Don't dally, get out soon.

360
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:29,780
Chen.

361
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:30,980
Have a drink.

362
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,420
I'm going to the ladies.

363
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,340
I'll be right back.

364
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,300
Come back quickly.

365
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,740
Here, play on.

366
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,580
Sir, your drink.

367
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,100
Thanks.

368
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,500
Enjoy.

369
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,300
I'll be waiting for you.

370
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:01,820
Chen!

371
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,380
Are you hurt?

372
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,980
How did this happen?

373
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,860
Why did the glass suddenly

374
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,540
shatter?

375
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,020
I dare not...

376
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,980
Go get a waiter.

377
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,860
I can't handle blood.

378
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,660
That woman is suspicious.

379
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,100
Catch her!

380
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,180
She's there!

381
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:22,980
Plan B.

382
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,140
Li Chen has come to his senses.

383
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:24,740

the plan would've utterly failed.

You've got some nerve to talk.

Because of you,

I love you more, Yao.

576
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,220
Because they're all liars.

577
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,500
Yao.

578
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,060
Marry me.

579
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,900
And they're rich.

580
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,940
Marry me, Yao.

581
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:30,660
Marry me, Yao.

582
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,660
Yao. Marry me, Yao.

583
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,900
Marry me, Yao.

584
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:34,940
I love you.

585
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,020
Marry me.

586
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,180
How did such a thing happen?

587
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,980
I still don't know.

588
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,060
Perhaps it's because
they have ill intentions,

589
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,300
insatiable desires,

590
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,220
limitless greed.

591
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,220
Who knows?

592
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,860
But there is a way

593
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,980
to snap them out of

594
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,740
the illusions.

595
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,380
Sir.

596
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,540
You managed to get much more
than what you invested.

597
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,460
That was smart.

598
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,940
The method is...

599
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,580
Sir!

600
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,340
Bad news.

601
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,540
Our company has gone bankrupt!

602
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,100
As simple as that.

603
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,340
Yao!

604
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,140
Don't run, Yao!

605
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:19,900
There's another way

606
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,180
to temporarily

607
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,340
resolve the emergency.

608
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,300
That is

609
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,340
cut off the line of sight.

610
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,420
Babe.

611
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:39,900
Dear.

612
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,740
What is wrong with you?

613
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,660
However,

614
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,700
my life

615
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,140
can no longer remain as it used to.

616
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:56,980
[Chengtian Group's CEO]
The position of CEO

617
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,820
[still pending assignment]
of Chengtian Group

618
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,860
has been vacant for a long time,

619
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,700
attracting close attention
from the business industry.

620
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,620
Most think

621
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,540
that Ji Honglin's son, Ji Cheng'an

622
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,500
succeeds the CEO post

623
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,260
through nomination by his father.

624
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,460
With that,

625
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,020
Chengtian Group would be

626
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,900
fully controlled by Mr. Ji and his son.

627
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,700
Hello, Mr. Chen.

628
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:45,900
Hold up.

629
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:46,860
Uncle.

630
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,420
Could you please read the air?

631
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,580
What?

632
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,580
Why did you ask me to come
so early in the morning?

633
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,500
My hands are still injured.

634
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,020
The meeting today is very important.

635
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,300
How can you miss it?

636
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,100
But I...

637
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,420
Sir.

638
00:27:59,540 --> 00:27:59,940
Dad.

639
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,780
I mean, sir.

640
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:04,860
Sir.

641
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,780
Cheng'an

642
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,020
has been working hard lately.

643
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:08,940
Work?

644
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,780
Working on useless stuff, I reckon.

645
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,060
You think I don't know?

646
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,220
Honglin.

647
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,060
That was an accident last night.

648
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:19,980
Enough.

649
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,820
No need to defend him.

650
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,020
It's because you and his mom

651
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,580
are over-protective of him.

652
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,020
Cheng'an.

653
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,820
I handed a few projects to you

654
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,860
previously.

655
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,100
Look at

656
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,140
how they all ended up.

657
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,260
A complete mess!

658
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,220
Don't think

659
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,620
just because you're my only son

660
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,100
that I'd hand the company over to you.

661
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,340
Dad.

662
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,740
I... I was wrong.

663
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,220
Come on.

664
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,940
Do as I say.

665
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,420
Yes, sir.

666
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,180
Who are you?

667
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,060
Who said

668
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,700
you could sit in that chair?

669
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,980
Allow me to introduce myself.

670
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,340
I am Ji Chengchuan.

671
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,620
Chengchuan?

672
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,180
Ji Chengchuan?

673
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,940
What is going on?

674
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,420
Long time no see, sir.

675
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:36,860
I'm back.

676
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,700
What...

677
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,540
Let us talk somewhere else.

678
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,780
Back then,
the chairman divorced Lin Shu.

679
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,940
Didn't Lin Shu go overseas

680
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,060
with Ji Chengchuan?

681
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,540
When it's time to nominate the next CEO,

682
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,380
he shows up.

683
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,140
It's most likely Lin Shu's idea.

684
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,540
Aren't Lin Shu and Ji Chengchuan...

685
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,380
I bet you wish

686
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,340
we were both dead.

687
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,060
But too bad.

688
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,180
I survived that incident 15 years ago.

689
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,180
How am I supposed to believe

690
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,620
you're really Ji Chengchuan?

691
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,100
A DNA test

692
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,620
should confirm it.

693
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:55,740
What do you think?

694
00:30:59,380 --> 00:30:59,820
Jinghui.

695
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,460
See to that.

696
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,180
Okay.

697
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,820
I'll get to it, sir.

698
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,020
[DNA results]

699
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,060
[The possibility of establishing
biological kinship is 99.9999%]

700
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,420
How could this be?

701
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,180
My mom

702
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,740
did pass away in that accident.

703
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:34,940
But you didn't know

704
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,860
that I was the sole survival

705
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,940
of that fire.

706
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,540
The boy who was burned

707
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,300
beyond recognition

708
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,300
was Qin Ming's son.

709
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,620
The day of the fire,

710
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,220
he happened to be playing hide-and-seek
at my place.

711
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,660
I hid in a cupboard

712
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,820
when the fire broke out.

713
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,260
I managed to survive it,

714
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,540
but he was burned to death.

715
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,380
He then laid in the tomb for me

716
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,460
for decades.

717
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,500
After the incident,

718
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,300
I was adopted by Mr. Qin.

719
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,540
All these years,

720
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,980
you thought the one who died
was Qin Ming,

721
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,260
Lin Shu and Ji Chengchuan.

722
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,180
You missed the fact that I survived.

723
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,220
Of course, I get that

724
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,780
in order to take control of the company,

725
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,060
you kept the news of your wife's

726
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,700
and actual son's death a secret.

727
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,660
So, why did you

728
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,460
come back?

729
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,020
To take over the role of CEO,

730
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,540
as my mom had stated
in the document.

731
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,940
Of course,
there's something more important.

732
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,980
Did you think I didn't know?

733
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,460
The money.

734
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,620
My mom had left me a sum of money.

735
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,860
Otherwise, you thought

736
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,900
I was going to reunite with you, Uncle?

737
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,780
These past years,

738
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,100
how have you been?

739
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:58,860
Mr. Ji.

740
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,660
You can save

741
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,620
your insincere pleasantries.

742
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:02,700
All I know

743
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,380
is that you had an affair
with Chen Yaqin.

744
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,780
My mom only agreed

745
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,700
to the divorce

746
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,780
because you totally broke her heart.

747
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,340
Also, she had made preparations

748
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,700
to take me overseas.

749
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,420
But the accident happened.

750
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,220
Not long after,

751
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,020
you married Chen Yaqin.

752
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,700
Even after so many years,

753
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,020
you never announced the deaths

754
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,340
of me and my mother.

755
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:45,980
At the time,

756
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,860
Chengtian barely got on track.

757
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,900
If I had announced your deaths,

758
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,700
it would've caused volatility
within the company.

759
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:54,980
I didn't want it

760
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,620
to all be for naught.

761
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,780
Alright.

762
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,340
Since you won't believe me,

763
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,460
never mind.

764
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,740
This is a handwritten statement

765
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,140
from Madam Lin Shu.

766
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,260
[For the declaration document
to be signed and effective,]

767
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,380
[both the person and the seal
must be present at the same time.]

768
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,340
So if I wish to claim this money

769
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,140
and be appointed

770

the CEO position in Chengtian,

771
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,420
I'd have to show my mom's personal stamp

772
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,140
at the board meeting?

773
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,660
That's right.

774
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,540
Perhaps you're unaware.

775
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,980
At the time, your mother
made the special clause

776
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,060
in the agreement.

777
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,500
To prevent any mishaps,

778
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,500
you and the stamp

779
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,780
have to be present together

780
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,380
in order to obtain what is yours

781
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,260
as stated in the agreement.

782
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,500
And your mother had repurposed

783
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,140
her personal stamp

784
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,740
into a pendant then.

785
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,020
She gifted it to you

786
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,860
when you turned one.

787
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,260
Seems like

788
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,500
if I can't show you the pendant,

789
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,460
what is originally mine

790
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,620
will still be in your possession.

791
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,100
How scheming you are,

792
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,900
Mr. Ji.

793
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,540
After all, it concerns
Chengtian's future.

794
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,380
Besides,

795
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,060
it's all the chairman's lifelong work.

796
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,020
Of course we have to be extra cautious.

797
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,060
Moreover, the stakeholders meeting
is in seven days.

798
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,020
We have to be able to explain

799
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,860
to the stakeholders.

800
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:29,820
Where's the necklace?

801
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,420
Needless to say,

802
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,380
I wear it at all times.

803
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,140
Because it constantly

804
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,180
reminds me

805
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,260
of what you did to me

806
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,580
and my mother back then.

807
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:05,860
Gentlemen.

808
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,660
We shall meet
at the stakeholder's meeting.

809
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,700
I expect all documentation
for the handover

810
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,100
to be ready by then.

811
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,220
I reckon with the presence

812
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,020
of the stakeholders,

813
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:18,900
no one is going

814
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,180
to play any more tricks.

815
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,660
Hao, are you finished?

816
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,660
What's the situation?

817
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,900
They believe I'm Ji Chengchuan.

818
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,620
That's great.

819
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,100
When you're part of the executive board,

820
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:52,900
things will become much easier.

821
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,180
Did Ji Cheng'an recognize you?

822
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,380
If that woman hadn't caused the mess

823

last night,

824
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,860
we wouldn't have almost blown our cover.

825
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,500
Never mind that.

826
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,140
It's time

827
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:05,820

the trauma I suffered last time.

841
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,820
I need a break for two days.

842
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,220
