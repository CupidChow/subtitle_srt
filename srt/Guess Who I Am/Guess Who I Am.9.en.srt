Where are you going? With who?

193
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,660
Will you still love me when you return?

194
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,980
A big villa, Qin Hao, no more love.

195
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,180
Then take me along.

196
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,620
I want to stay in a big villa too.

197
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,140
Gosh, stop it.

198
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,180
Be serious.

199

Stay safe.

to catch the tiger.

This time, I'll make sure

00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,300
to get the contract back.

203
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,540
You can do it!

204
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:31,740

That's enough.

208

I don't need so many things.

209
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,780
This won't do. No amount of money

210
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,700
can sustain this.

211

00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,860
about the minimalist trend?

We've already bought a dozen cups.

216

You're buying more?

217

What about these?

They're plain.

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,940
Qin Hao, open your arms wide

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,900
and catch more!

And your legs too.
Put some strength into them.

Clamp them with your legs!

Catch more with your hands.

230

There's a lot here. Come.

to take the pink one.

253
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,100
