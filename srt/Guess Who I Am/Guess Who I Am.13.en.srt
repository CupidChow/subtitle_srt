00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:09,900
Mr. Ji,

194
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,580
we're sorry.

195
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,820
It's all our fault.

196
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,020
We'll rectify it immediately.

197
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,620
Yeah, yeah.

198
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,300
Please.

199
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,180
Sir.

200
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,020
Sir.

201
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,980
I heard

202
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,340
that you didn't give Bai
and the rest an out for their error.

203
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,940
Is that the reason you summoned me?

204
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,700
All of them are prominent elders
of the group.

205
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,060
Sometimes, it's not a good thing

206
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,220
for you to show off too much.

207
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,740
It's been some time
since I had a gathering with my friends.

208
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,700
I'm holding a gathering with them today.

209
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,140
You should join me.

210
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
You've seen many of the youngsters

211
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,660
when you were young.

212
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,580
You know

213
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,380
that I'm uninterested in such affairs.

214
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,850
[The Highest Goodness Is Like Water]
Mr. Wang, the owner of Riyue Bay,

215
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:20,940
[The Highest Goodness Is Like Water]
will be there too.

216
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,420
You can decide

217
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,180
whether you want to go or not.

218
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,700
Okay.

219
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,300
I got it.

220
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,260
The last stroke for "Shui" is too heavy.

221
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,100
After all, it's not good

222
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,260
to show off too much, right?

223
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,620
Qin Hao,

224
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,220
most of the people here

225
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,740
knew Ji Chengchuan

226
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,740
when he was young.

227
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,180
You want to head there alone?

228
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,580
What should we do if they question

229
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,220
your identity?

230
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,780
Call Song Yao here, then.

231
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,250
[Yao: Sorry, I'm not free.]

232
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:25,780
No need for that.

233
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,460
Over here, please.

234
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,580
Chengchuan?

235
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,980
We've been waiting for you.

236
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,860
Zhaolin, long time no see.

237
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,540
It's been a while.

238
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,220
Ji,

239
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,060
I heard that Chengchuan

240
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,420
was in charge of the Riyue Bay project.

241
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,900
It's nothing noteworthy.

242
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,380
Wang,

243
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,540
you have to keep an eye on him.

244
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,340
Chengchuan,

245
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,420
Riyue Bay is my life's work.

246
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,540
You have to show me

247
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,860
your sincerity.

248
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,140
Definitely.

249
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,660
Mr. Wang, I won't disappoint you

250
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,980
during the bid.

251
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,260
Here, Chengchuan. Have a seat.

252
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:18,740
Chengchuan,

253
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,700
I was overseas when you got married.

254
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,660
I couldn't attend your wedding.

255
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,260
Why didn't you bring your wife here

256
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,660
and introduce her

257
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,620
to us?

258
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,820
She's unwell today.

259
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,220
That's why I didn't bring her here.

260
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,260
I watched the livestream.

261
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,820
Your wife is protective of you indeed.

262
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,180
Jingyi,

263
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,420
I still remember

264
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,260
that you loved to cling
onto Chengchuan when you were young.

265
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,740
You kept saying that you wanted
to get married to Chengchuan.

266
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,460
I remember

267
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,900
that Chengchuan loved Dou.

268
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,860
But you stole it from him while sobbing.

269
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,100
That's not true.

270
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,140
Chengchuan gave it to me.

271
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,900
Chengchuan,

272
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,020
do you still remember Dou?

273
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,740
Of course.

274
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,940
I remember that you loved it

275
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,700
back then.

276
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,660
You took pictures with it in your arms.

277
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,900
Pictures?

278
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,780
Was I wrong?

279
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,540
Dear, did you forget?

280
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,940
Dou didn't allow anyone to hold it
except for you.

281
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,060
Cats dislike strangers.

282
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,380
Ms. Liang.

283
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,980
How was Dou after that?

284
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,180
Of course it was doing great.

285
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,260
I can rest at ease, then.

286
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,340
Why are you everywhere?

287
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,780
You haunt me to no end.

288
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,820
Hello, everyone. I'm Song Yao.

289
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,220
I'm Chengchuan's wife.

290
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,740
Sorry about that.

291
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,060
Didn't you say you were busy?

292
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,220
Why are you here?

293
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,980
Jiang Nanxuan texted me.

294
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,220
If so, your eyes...

295
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,740
Don't worry.

296
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,580
I know the context of the situation.

297
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,020
I wore contact lenses today.

298
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,060
Thank you for coming to my rescue.

299
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,620
Don't mention it. It's my duty.

300
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,900
Let's go back. Time to eat.

301
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,580
Mr. Wang.

302
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,060
I heard that the project at Riyue Bay

303
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,140
was undergoing an upgrade.

304
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,780
You don't mind
if I visit the site, do you?

305
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,380
Kid, you're pretty resourceful,
aren't you?

306
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,180
You do put your survey
in a nice way, don't you?

307
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,780
Making necessary preparations

308
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,300
is a part of my duty as well.

309
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,660
Mr. Wang, let me offer you a toast.

310
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,180
Mr. Wang.

311
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,140
It's been so long

312
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,060
since I visited your resort.

313
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,860
Why don't Chengchuan and I...

314
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,620
Mr. Wang,

315
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,980
my wife is very interested

316
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,020
in your resort too.

317
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,460
You won't mind if I bring her along

318
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,500
for the survey, right?

319
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,700
Of course not.

320
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,860
Great. You guys can take a breather

321
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,340
at my resort.

322
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,380
Okay.

323
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,180
Mr. Wang,
I'll thank you in advance, then.

324
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,940
But Mr. Wang...

325
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,140
I guess one can never
escape from misfortunes

326
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,300
when they happen.

327
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,340
Chengchuan,

328
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,700
I hope

329
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,100
that your project

330
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,140
will proceed smoothly.

331
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,780
Look at how careless I am.

332
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,340
Here.

333
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,780
Sorry about that.

334
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,980
Chengchuan, are you okay?

335
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:50,660
I'm fine.

336
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,540
Chengchuan,

337
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,580
I remember that you had a scar here

338
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,860
when you were young.

339
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,500
Oh no. Qin Hao's scar
is located on his left arm.

340
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,940
Don't tell me his identity
will be exposed?

341
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,420
Uncle,

342
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,180
what are you suspecting?

343
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,100
Or,

344
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,460
Dad,

345
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,700
are you suspecting me as well?

346
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,180
Chengchuan,

347
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,300
I do remember that you had a scar

348
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,580
when you were young.

349
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,860
Chairman,

350
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,700
you remembered incorrectly.

351
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,060
My scar is located on my left arm.

352
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,460
It's just that the scar I had
when I was young

353
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,660
was covered by this scar.

354
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,060
You can ask Ji Cheng'an

355
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,100
if you don't believe me.

356
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,700
I believe that he remembers the details.

357
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:56,860
Enough.

358
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,380
You guys should be satisfied
after seeing his scar.

359
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:01,980
Let's go.

360
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,980
[Ji Cheng'an]
Ji Chengchuan's scar

361
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,260
was on his left arm.

362
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,420
I caused the scar

363
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,180
when I was young.

364
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,220
Uncle, what's the matter?

365
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,540
Did they treat you like this too

366
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,540
when you guys were

367
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,300
in Chengtian Group?

368
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,260
Do you feel heartbroken?

369
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,140
Why should I?

370
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,860
I'm just asking.

371
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:56,980
Follow me

372
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,740
to the resort.

373
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,060
Nope. I'm busy.

374
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,460
What should I do if this happens again

375
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,860
when you're not around?

376
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,860
I won't be as lucky

377
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,460
next time.

378
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,860
You did resolve the conflict well.

379
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,740
You don't need me at all.

380
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:23,700
Yes.

381
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,180
And no.

382
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,780
Eenie, meenie, minie, moe.

383
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,940
Should I go? Or should I not?

384
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,260
Eenie, meenie, minie, moe.

385
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,740
Should I go? Or should I not?

386
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,300
You think you're cool,

387
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,700
but you're just sick in the head!

388
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,140
Are we leaving?

389
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,380
Wait a little longer.

390
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:09,980
Dude,

391
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,300
it's been half an hour.

392
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,900
Song Yao won't be coming.

393
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,780
Let's just go.

394
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,660
She'll come.

395
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,700
Hao,

396
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,700
I've told you many times before.

397
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,460
If a woman says yes,

398
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,620
it might not happen.

399
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,660
If she says no,

400
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,780
that means it definitely won't happen.

401
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,180
Look at you.

402
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,380
You don't know women at all.

403
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,380
You don't know Song Yao at all.

404
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,220
I don't know Song Yao, huh? But she...

405
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,980
Let me make myself clear.

406
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,220
I'm only doing this

407
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:44,900
to uphold the contract.

408
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,500
Let's go.

I'll talk to the manager.

419
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,420
Okay.

420
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,220
What are you two up to again?

421
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,220
Life is tough.
We're doing part-time jobs here.

422
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,020
Let me introduce him.

423
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,780
The global Chinese trendsetter,

424
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,380
the top-ranking guy in Asia

425
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,380
for The Top 100 Beautiful Faces
in the World,

426
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,420
Vogue's Man With Most Beautiful Abs
of the Year,

427
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,140
the top-ranking youth

428
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,740
for Forbes' Most Charismatic Youth
three years in a row,

429
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,980
the Guinness record holder

430
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,740
for most female fans

431
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,020
for an Asian man.

432
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,260
And, he's even

433
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,540
the favored winner of

434
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,980
the Riyue Bay Wetland Resort bid.

435
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,380
He's Sheng Silin, CEO of Shengshi Group

436
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,260
cum project manager.

437
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,380
What's wrong with you
for the past few days?

438
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,860
Nothing. I'm doing quite fine.

439
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,260
I didn't expect them

440
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,460
to decorate it in such a way.

441
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,940
I'll tell the manager
to get us another room.

442
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,700
It's okay.

443
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,420
I need to look for Shuangshuang.

444
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,740
I'll be staying in the same room
as her tonight.

445
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:14,980
Song Yao.

446
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,740
If you don't want
to sleep beside Ji Chengchuan,

447
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,180
I don't mind sacrificing my body

448
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:21,980
tonight.

449
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,140
I mean, I'll sleep
in the same room as him.

450
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,820
If so, I'll make a move first.

451
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,300
Song Yao.

452
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,540
You're welcome.

453
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,620
Please go ahead.

454
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:50,460
Roll off the bed.

455
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,900
Fine. I'll roll off the bed.

456
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,020
Mr. Ji, Mr. Sheng, everything is ready.

457
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,060
Should I come back later?

458
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,660
Should I?

459
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:06,940
Let's go.

460
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,380
Why did he leave me here by myself?

461
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,900
Guys, this is

462
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,020
the resort's kitchen.

463
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,660
It was revamped not long ago.

464
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,660
Not only did we import

465
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,660
professional kitchen tools from Germany,

466
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,580
but we also hired

467
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,940
Michelin three-star chefs.

468
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,900
The workspace has limited functionality.

469
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,660
It'll be hard to satisfy

470
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,380
the various demands of our customers.

471
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,340
I think this workspace is pretty good.

472
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,900
It's perfectly designed

473
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,020
for our ergonomics.

474
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,340
That's right.

475
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,540
We designed

476
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,940
this living room

477
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,500
for the top-tier customers

478
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,540
of our resort.

479
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,020
It has excellent privacy.

480
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,060
It's the best venue for people

481
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,860
to discuss business deals here.

482
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,260
It took 20 minutes for us to reach here

483
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,140
from the activity zone.

484
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,860
Who would walk this far
just to come here?

485
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,100
It's superfluous.

486
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,020
Superfluous?

487
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,260
Who said so?

488
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,020
I love to talk walks when I'm free.

489
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,260
Mr. Ji,

490
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,860
this is a warm reminder.
You should take walks more often.

491
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,740
For this area,

492
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,700
we hired

493
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,780
top Japanese garden designers

494
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,980
to create this garden.

495
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,980
We strive to achieve
the magnificent view

496
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,940
of water and peaks.

497
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,100
The greening is pretty good.

498
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,900
However, bugs and mosquitoes

499
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,580
grow in large numbers during summer.

500
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,860
It'll affect our customers.

501
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,620
Ji Chengchuan,

502
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,140
are you even human?

503
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,340
This is what you call an ecosystem.

504
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,820
Humans aren't the only species

505
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,860
on the planet, you know?

506
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,220
Mr. Sheng, you do harbor
humanistic love.

507
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,460
Sirs, over here, please.

508
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:57,820
Sirs,

509
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,820
this is the resort's rock-climbing zone

510
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,460
that's currently being built.

511
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,700
The main structure

512
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,500
is basically done.

513
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,540
We predict that it can be used

514
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,860
by the end of this year.

515
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,100
There's not enough
safety equipment here.

516
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,460
You won't be able to deal with

517
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,020
accidents.

518
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,500
It's a huge safety hazard.

519
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,580
Rock-climbing

520
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,460
is a thrilling activity, no?

521
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,620
Why do you think
people do rock-climbing?

522
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,780
Do you dare

523
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,380
compete with me?

524
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,300
Let's not put on

525
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,420
any safety equipment.

526
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,780
Sheng Silin,

527
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,980
I don't have time to play with you.

528
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,340
If you win against me,

529
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,860
I'll leave the resort immediately.

530
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,140
Ji Chengchuan, are you scared?

531
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,580
Why did you two

532
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,380
drag me here?

533
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,580
What's going on?

534
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,860
Yao, just bear with us.

535
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,980
It'll be over soon.

536
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,500
Sheng Silin said he found out

537
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,260
about your contract.

538
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,100
He said he wanted to save you.

539
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,380
You actually believe him?

540
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,420
Of course not.

541
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,140
However...

542
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,980
Were you two bribed by him?

543
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:35,940
You got it.

544
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,980
You should've become a prophet.

545
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,660
Three, two, one, begin!

546
00:30:40,660 --> 00:31:00,460
[Dramatic effect! Dangerous!
Please do not imitate them!]

547
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,980
Come down! It's too dangerous!

548
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,460
Careful!

549
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,500
Loser.

550
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,220
Goodbye.

551
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,380
Watch out!

552
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,700
Loser.

553
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,460
Have you lost your mind?
Do you have a death wish?

554
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,220
You think you're cool?

555
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,140
You think you're good at this?

556
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,660
You think you're the Spiderman
of Riyue Bay, huh?

557
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:18,980
If you're that capable,

558
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,060
why don't you fly to the sky?

559
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,460
You think this is the Avengers?

560
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,060
This is life.

561
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,300
It is what it is.

562
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,460
You may look like you won the match,

563
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,020
but you lost your relationship with her.

564
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,700
Don't go. Wait for me.

565
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:58,620
Excuse me.

566
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,060
Do you have a first-aid kit?

567
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,620
Yes. What medicine do you need?

568
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,700
My friend sprained his wrist.

569
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,020
Okay. I'll find something for you.

570
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,940
Please wait a moment.

571
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,260
Slow down.

572
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,500
Say,

573
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,060
this is truly unexpected.

574
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,060
This is my first loss

575
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:17,980
in life,

576
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,380
but I'm actually happy about it.

577
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,380
You better keep your promise
and leave the place.

578
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,660
I'll definitely leave.

579
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,900
But before that,

580
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,340
I need to interview you.

581
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:30,900
Mr. Ji Chengchuan,

582
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,580
you made a bet with Ji Honglin

583
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,780
for Song Yao's sake.

584
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,060
Due to that, Song Yao

585
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,100
told you off

586
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,060
in public

587
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,940
and

588
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,620
humiliated you.

589
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,380
Also,

590
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,460
you will lose to me

591
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,580
in the upcoming bid

592
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,900
and leave Chengtian Group after that.

593
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,420
How do you feel about

594
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,860
losing both your career

595
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,020
and relationship?

596
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,180
You don't need to tell me.

597
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,380
I don't wish to know.

598
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,460
A bet? What's going on?

599
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,020
I shouldn't have
hidden the bet from you.

600
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,580
I should be the one apologizing to you.

601
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,940
What's wrong with you
these past few days?

602
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,820
Have I done something wrong

603
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,140
and made you upset?

604
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,460
That day,

605
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,020
I saw the text Ms. Song sent to you

606
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,220
by accident.

607
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,700
It seemed like
you were still investigating me.

608
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,980
May I know why?

609
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,500
Actually, I came back

610
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,460
to investigate

611
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,980
the truth behind the fire
that happened 15 years ago.

612
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,700
Back then, after your mother's surgery,

613
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,660
I read her medical records.

614
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,940
I found out by accident

615
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,260
that your mother was
caught in a car accident before that.

616
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,340
It happened on the same day

617
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,900
as the fire incident
involving Ji Chengchuan.

618
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,500
Therefore, I became suspicious.

619
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,580
I told Song Lingren
to do some investigation.

620
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,660
I actually found out

621
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,060
that the driver
who bumped into your mother

622
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,500
was the culprit

623
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,540
of the fire incident 15 years ago.

624
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,180
I hid it from you because I was sure

625
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,900
that these incidents were related

626
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,100
to Chengtian Group's executives.

627
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,300
The more you delve into it,
the more dangerous it'll be.

628
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,140
Since I'm already involved with the case

629
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:10,980
and can't turn back,

630
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,820
I don't want to implicate you.

631
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,460
It was my fault for keeping it from you.

632
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,060
However, it's too dangerous for you.

633
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,420
Don't forget.

634
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,060
We're partners.

635
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,180
We should face these ordeals together.

636
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,180
And, shouldn't we tell the cops

637
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,420
all this?

638
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,860
The fire 15 years ago

639
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,580
and your mother's case
were already closed.

640
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,500
We cannot reopen the case
without any evidence.

641
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,300
We have to
find conclusive evidence first.

642
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,300
Alright. I'll join you, then.
