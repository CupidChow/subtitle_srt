00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,140
Don't you know what "closed" means?

[Shunda Car Dealership]

196
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,060
Hello.

197
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,940
This is a car rental agency, right?

198
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,060
Could you tell me if you rented out

199
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,700
a Jinbei Haise recently.

200
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,380
Sorry, we didn't.

201
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,300
Sir.

202
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,820
Could I take a look
at your surveillance footage?

203
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,420
I'm busy.

204
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,340
Sure, follow me.

205
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:27,820
This way.

206
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:41,780
Hi.

207
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,540
May I know if you rented out

208
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,340
a Jinbei Haise recently?

209
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Sorry, we didn't.

210
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,500
Okay, thanks.

211
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,420
I've given you the account
of our dealership's surveillance system.

212
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,300
You can take a look yourself.

213
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,540
Hello, is this a car rental agency?

214
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,900
Could you tell me

215
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,260
if you rented out a Jinbei Haise

216
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,140
recently?

217
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,020
No.

218
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,060
Thank you.

219
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,700
Open up!

220
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,220
Anyone out there?

221
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,740
- Anyone there?
- Open the door!

222
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,580
Anybody?

223
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,340
Can anyone hear us?

224
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,980
Anyone?

225
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,340
Help!

226
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,460
Anyone there?

227
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,940
Help!

228
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,900

229
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,500
Help!

230
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,900
Help!

231
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,300
Help!

232
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,940
Anyone there?

233
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,500
Anyone there?

234
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,780
Help us.

235
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:53,940
Hello, Ms. Kang.

236
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,660
The Jinbei Haise commercial van

237
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,020
that you rented from our company
three days ago

238
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,780
has been issued

239
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,700
a traffic violation at the entrance
of Jianghai Port.

240
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,700
You're required

241
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,700
to go to

242
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,540
the Traffic Management Bureau

243
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,820
with your driving license
and pay the fine within 15 working days.

244
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,740
Have a good day.

245
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:06,540
Thank you.

246
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,540
Have a good day too.

247
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,220
Song Yao.

248
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,620
Don't fall asleep.

249
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,140
I'm so sleepy.

250
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,940
Don't sleep.

251
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:47,860
Let's...

252
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,060
Let's play a game.

253
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,060
Okay?

254
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,260
What game?

255
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,500
Truth or Dare.

256
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,060
Okay.

257
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,300
When was the happiest time

258
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,340
of your life so far?

259
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,500
It was the time when I was young

260
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,340
living on Yuzhou Island.

261
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,300
What about your unhappiest time?

262
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,180
Definitely the time when you dragged me

263
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,900
to get the marriage license.

264
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:35,860
Then

265
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,820
do you regret meeting me?

266
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,100
Of course...

267
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,580
not.

268
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,540
Don't fall asleep.

269
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,060
I'll just sleep for a while.

270
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,980
Hang in there.

271
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,660
Don't sleep.

272
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,540
Long, long ago...

273
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,700
Yes.

274
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,700
Song Yao.

275
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,220
Do you know

276
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,500
why I asked you to come

277
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,140
to the amusement park yesterday?

278
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,340
That was the last

279
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:53,780
car rental agency.

280
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,580
We still couldn't find any clues.

281
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,180
It's been 50 hours.

282
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,140
What should we do
if we still can't find anything?

283
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,180
We must have missed something.

284
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,500
I've talked to the police.

285
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,140
They haven't got any clues either.

286
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:08,860
Wait!

287
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,180
I think I've found it.

288
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,260
Look.

289
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,520
There is a row
of annual inspection marks

290
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,140
on the windshield.

291
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,580
There's no reflection in the middle,

292
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,580
meaning one's missing.

293
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,660
This is the car.

294
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,180
You must be Conan.

295
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,620
No kidding.

296
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,740
Shuang managed to pinpoint

297
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,340
the car

298
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,620
where her favorite idol was in

299
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,300
among over 30 same vehicles.

300
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,900
Awesome, idolater.

301
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:39,580
Okay.

302
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,060
Yeah.

303
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,460
You can go ahead and check it.

304
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,340
Can you restore it?

305
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,860
It shouldn't be a problem.

306
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,500
Although the records were cleared,

307
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,860
all car navigations are linked

308
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,060
to a satellite positioning system.

309
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,100
Once we locate one position,

310
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,180
we'll be able to restore all the tracks

311
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,340
through the BeiDou System.

312
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:06,940
Found it.

313
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,980
I'll notify the police right away.

314
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,460
The police, ambulance and Sheng Silin

315
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,420
will be here soon.

316
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,340
Let's help find them.

317
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:29,740
Okay.

318
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,620
Guys.

319
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,860
Follow my lead.

320
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,700
Each of you is responsible for one zone

321
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,820
and do a blanket search.

322
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,260
Understand?

323
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:09,980
Yes!

324
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,500
Go, go, go!

325
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:55,500
Song Yao.

326
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,340
Song Yao!

327
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,020
Rescuers are here.

328
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,220
They're coming.

329
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,500
Song Yao!

330
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,180
Yao!

331
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,580
- Song Yao!
- Yao!

332
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,020
Qin Hao!

333
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:38,500
Hao!

334
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,500
Hao!

335
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,660
Not found in Zone A.

336
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:50,820
Not found in Zone B either.

337
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,660
Not found in Zone C either.

338
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,500
Qin Hao!

339
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,020
Yao!

340
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:51,980
Song Yao!

341
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,540
Qin Hao.

342
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,420
Qin Hao.

343
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,020
Qin Hao.

344
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,500
Qin Hao.

345
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,900
Qin Hao.

346
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,540
Hao!

347
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,020
Song Yao!

348
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,260
Hey,

349
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,100
boss said there's something going on

350
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:24,580
in Zone B, No.13.

351
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,460
Nothing was there.

352
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,460
Just a few rats.

353
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,500
Wait for me to go back
and play cards.

354
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,220
Hurry up!

355
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,500
There's something in Zone B.

356
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,060
Hurry!

357
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,260
Attention, guys.

358
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,460
In Zone F07,

359
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,500
there's smoke coming out
from a container.

360
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,020
Everyone meet at Zone F07.

361
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,220
Repeat...

362
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,020
Everyone meet at Zone F07.

363
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:56,660
Over there.

364
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,660
Qin Hao...

365
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:32,740
Qin Hao...

366
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:33,740
Qin Hao!

367
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,620
What are you laughing at?

368
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,620
I was afraid you'd die.

369
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,380
Thanks to you,

370
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,260
I am still alive.

371
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,220
Are you feeling sick?

372
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,660
No.

373
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,020
I'm as strong as a horse.

374
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,300
That's great.

375
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,660
We are both alive.

376
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:45,900
Yeah, pretty nice.

377
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,100
Your savior is here.

378
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,860
Ji Chengchuan, get up.

379
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,580
Let Song Yao lie down.

380
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,900
She's not well yet.

381
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,620
Let her rest.

382
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,780
Is that

383
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,580
how you treat your savior?

384
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:06,820
Song Yao.

385
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,780
As the one who saved your life,

386
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,300
I'll just give in a little more.

387
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,420
I'll devote my life to you.

388
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,700

389
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,020
Mr. Ji.

390
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,140
We'll leave you to it.

391
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,340
We'll leave first.

392
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,060
Sit down, please.

393
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,820
How are you feeling?

394
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,060
I'm pretty well now.

395
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,620
Don't worry.

396
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,980
Get well first.

397
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:04,900
Take care of yourself.

398
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:08,980
As for Kang Liping,

399
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,260
I'll make it up to you.

400
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:29,780
Let's have a talk.

401
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,180
Sure.

402
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,340
Have a seat.

403
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,420
Do you like me?

404
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,620
What about now?

405
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,420
You don't like me that much right?

406
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,500
So,

407
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,220
you don't really like me.

408
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,380
Wait a minute.

409
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,340
You...

410
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,260
Take off the glasses.

411
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,140
Let me feel it again.

412
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,380
Are you a fairy coming from heaven
down to earth?

413
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,020
Take care of yourself.

414
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,140
See you.

415
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:44,980
Chengchuan.

416
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:45,740
I'm here to visit you.

417
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,060
I've heard

418
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:51,860
Kang Liping

419
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,020
was targeting Song Yao.

420
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,060
You are implicated.

421
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,740
I told you

422
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,100
Song Yao's of unknown origin.

423
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,060
She's not a good person.

424
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,060
But you wouldn't listen.

425
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,100
Who knows

426
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:00,980
what did she get herself into this time?

427
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,660
Shut up!

428
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,180
This is my last warning.

429
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,620
Don't ever speak ill of my wife again.

430
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,020
But...

431
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,820
I'm just worried about you.

432
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,060
Liang Jingyi.

433
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,060
You have too much time huh?

434
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:23,740
Hello?

435
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,500
Hey, Jingyi.

436
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,420
Where are you?

437
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,300
School's about to start, right?

438
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,220
Listen,

439
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,260
tomorrow,

440
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,820
I'll get someone
to take you to the airport.

441
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,020
I'm telling you this

442
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:00,940
because I regard you as a friend.

443
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,300
Keep it a secret.

444
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:03,860
I knew it.

445
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,180
How could a god like me

446
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,620
fall in love with you?

447
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,780
You're just a normal girl.

448
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,860
Thank you.

449
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,100
So, don't pester me anymore.

450
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:10,660
Sure.

451
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,940
Why are you eavesdropping, Mr. Ji?

452
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,460
Thanks.

453
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,380
Is this all you have to say

454
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,500
to your savior?

455
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,060
From now on, we're friends.

456
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,540
Who wants to be your friend?

457
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:52,900
Don't forget.

458
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,300
I am always your savior.

459
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,020
What?

460
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,500
Wait...

461
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,260
Mr. Sheng.

462
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,220
I just wanted to say thank you.

463
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,260
What?

464
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:04,940
You...

465
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,740
Sheng Silin.

466
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,100
How could you bully a patient?

467
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:07,580
I...

468
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,220
I did not.

469
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,180
I was just...

470
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:09,820
Wait...

471

Are you okay?

472
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,220
I'm okay.

473
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:16,460
Let's go.

474
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:17,940
I just

475
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,900
gently...

476
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:25,500
Ji Chengchuan.

477
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,220
You're behaving like a jealous man.

478
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,500
You must be feeling tired.

479
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,740
You should rest early.

480
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,380
Get some sleep.

481
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,340
Stay with me.

482
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,620
I'm going to rest in my own room.

483
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,860
I...I've got a headache.

484
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:00,980
I've got a headache.

485
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,300
Let me do a massage for you.

486
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:06,820
Okay.

487
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:07,460
Here.

488
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:11,820
Here.

489
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,620
Well,

490
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,300
Why are you in such a hurry
to leave the hospital?

491
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,540
You're not fully well yet.

492
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,060
I don't like the smell of disinfectant

493
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,140
in the hospital.

494
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,300
Besides...

495
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,780
What?

496
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,340
Sheng Silin went there every day.

497
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,540
I only want you to take care of me.

498
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,580
Okay.

499
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,500
Okay.

500
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,260
Mr. Chen,

501
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,900
I've gone through the medical records.

502
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,780
This person should be

503
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,900
suffering from severe PTSD.

504
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,620
The main trigger is fire.

505
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,140
I recommend

506
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,500
that he get professional psychiatric help
as soon as possible.

507
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:15,460
Got it.

508
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,060
Thanks, Dr. Wang.

509
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,380
Ji Chengchuan

511

You need to take action.

Yaqin.

513
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,900
Honglin made the arrangement.

514
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,260
What can I do?

515
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,580
Medium rare.

516
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:37,740
Perfect.

517
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,740
Any news about Kang Liping?

518
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,820
The killer's methods were spotless.

519
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,740
There were no clues left behind
at the scene.

520
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,900
But the police

521
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,180
have investigated from other sources.

522
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,100
Her death was too strange.

523
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:55,540
I think

524
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,660
it's closely related to

525
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,900
what happened 15 years ago.

526
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,020
Come in.

527
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,140
Mr. Ji.

528
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,500
Mr. Chairman asked me

529
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,340
to give this to you.

530

this is how he makes up to you.

Thanks.

What is it?

534
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,700
Looks like Ji Honglin

535
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,140
will be appointing me
as a member of the board of directors

at the annual meeting.

537
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,860
I suppose it's his way

538
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:41,940
to pacify me.

539
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,620
I will make use of this chance

540
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,660
to join the board
