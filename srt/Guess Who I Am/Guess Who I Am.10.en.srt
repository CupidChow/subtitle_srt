00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,820
There are more to come.

193
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,140
Amazing.

194
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,820
Come with me.

195
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,940
But there are more to come.

196
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,100
Please excuse us for a second.

197
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,300
Please give me a moment.

198
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,460
Did you notice his mask?

199
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,540
What exactly are you doing?

200
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,540
Of course I'm greeting your guests
in the best way possible.

201
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,220
Don't you think our team is great?

202
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,420
It was an impeccable greeting, right?

203
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,580
Are you doing this on purpose?

204
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,020
What do you mean by that?

205
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,060
Don't tell me

206
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,380
you think that I'm causing trouble
for you on purpose

207
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,380
and trying to embarrass you here?

208
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,660
Is that not the case?

209
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,180
Of course not.

210
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,500
Qin Hao, you're terrible.

211
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,700
You were the one who said

212
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,140
we had to leave a deep impression
on our guests.

213
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,380
Our team pulled an all-nighter

214
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,380
to come up with this solution.

215
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,700
And now, you think

216
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,780
I'm causing trouble for you on purpose?

217
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,060
Fine. I'll go there right now

218
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,580
and tell them

219
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,420
that it's my idea.

220
00:13:59,420 --> 00:13:59,940
It has nothing to do with you.

221
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,060
Wait!

222
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,500
I won't!

223
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:05,740
Wait!

224
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,380
Mr. Ji,

225
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,780
this banquet

226
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,060
was very fun.

227
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,300
Your wife is a genius.

228
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,380
Mrs. Ji,

229
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,420
thank you

230
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,420
for preparing

231
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,020
such a lovely night for us.

232
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,900
You're truly unique.

233
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,980
I need to use the restroom.

234
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,380
Please excuse me.

235
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,340
Mr. Ji,

236
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,620
I believe our collaboration

237
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,100
will proceed more smoothly

238
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,740
if I can have a private chat

239
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,060
with your wife.

240
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,580
I think there's no point

241
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,620
in having this meal any longer.

242
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,300
Song Yao.

243
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,500
Let's go.

244
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,340
Where are you going?

245
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,140
It's inappropriate for you to leave now.

246
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,260
Your guests are still waiting for you.

247
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,380
Go back.

248
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,900
What's wrong with you now?

249
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,300
You're almost there, you know?

250
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,780
You shouldn't leave right now.

251
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,420
That's unnecessary.

252
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,260
This is my personal matter.

253
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,180
Follow me home.

254
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,140
Wait.

255
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,900
What's wrong, Mr. Ji?

256
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,420
Do I have to perform for you

257
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,180
before I'm allowed to head back?

258
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,500
What you did to Joseph just now...

259
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,740
What do you mean by that?

260
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,580
Did you think I did it on purpose?

261
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,820
So, in your eyes,

262
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,180
I'm someone who can resort
to anything just to achieve my goal,

263
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,860
huh?

264
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:08,700
That's not true.

265
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,620
That's not true?

266
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,420
Didn't you tell me to come

267
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,420
because I could achieve that?

268
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,940
What? Do you regret it now?

269
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,580
Are you upset
because someone took advantage of me

270
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,660
in public?

271
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,260
Mr. Ji, don't forget.

272
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,060
This is just a contractual relationship.

273
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,900
What? You don't like what I'm saying?

274
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,380
I'll tell you this, then.

275
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,620
I, Song Yao,

276
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,340
am a gold-digger

277
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,140
who loves rich men!

278
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,820
If only all the men

279
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,540
could love me and revolve around me!

280
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,100
I love to be other people's mistress!

281
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,420
I love it when people say

282
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:41,940
that I'm a vixen

283
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,940
and slap me in public!

284
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,900
I love it

285
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,620
when people pursue me so hard

286
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,780
that I don't even manage

287
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,660
to get my graduation certificate!

288
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,580
I love it when they come at me 24/7

289
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,820
and that I have to hide from them

290
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,140
like a rat on a crosswalk!

291
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,740
Shouldn't you have guessed it by now?

292
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:00,900
That's right.

293
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,620
Some people will fall for me

294
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,780
when they look into my eyes.

295
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,340
Just like Joseph.

296
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,940
He might've looked into my eyes

297
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,860
by accident just now.

298
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,180
That's why it happened.

299
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,900
What's the use of
telling you all of that?

300
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,780
I'll shield you from them in the future.

301
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,770
[Have some food and sleep early]

302
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,020
Have some food and sleep early.

303
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,380
I think he hasn't eaten yet.

304
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,580
What?

305
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,540
You want to terminate

306
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,620
the deal with Joseph?

307
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,500
Please.

308
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,260
This project is worth billions.

309
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,980
It also plays a huge role
in securing your position

310
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,900
as one of the core directors.

311
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,580
You want to terminate it just like that?

312
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:51,740
Buddy,

313
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,020
are you sure you want
to do this out of spite

314
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,620
just for Song Yao's sake?

315
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,900
Why did you marry her
in the first place?

316
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,620
It's to reduce the trouble
you'll face. Am I right?

317
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,820
Why are you causing trouble
for yourself here?

318
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,780
Are we still proceeding
with the cufflink's investigation?

319
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,140
Send the details

320
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:02,820
of other potential companies to me.

321
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,900
We have to find a new partner

322
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,020
within three days.

323
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,380
Okay.

324
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,380
You guys have lost your mind.

325
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,860
So,

326
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,660
I'll make a move first.

327
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,380
Qin Hao has left the house.

328
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,900
I'll head back right now. Over.

329
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,500
[Kaleidoscope]

330
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,140
I ruined the greeting session

331
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,980
for Joseph.

332
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,340
I plan to deal with him
on Qin Hao's behalf.

333
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,500
- What?
- What?

334
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,340
Song Yao,

335
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,420
blink if you

336
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,220
are under his spell.

337
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,500
I'll search for his details online

338
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,980
after this.

339
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,660
I don't believe
that I can't clinch a deal with him.

340
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,900
Why are you suddenly

341
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,140
this concerned about Qin Hao's matter?

342
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:42,860
That's right.

343
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,940
I'm upholding justice here.

344
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,220
You're lying.

345
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,860
Be honest with us!

346
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,340
You slippery old fox.

347
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,340
I'm sure you've betrayed us

348
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,180
and fallen for him.

349
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,620
Nonsense!

350
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,060
Aren't our goals to punish crooks

351
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,740
and eradicate corruption?

352
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,420
We found Joseph's details

353
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,860
on the Internet.

354
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,260
We'll give you
the printed materials tomorrow.

355
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,620
We also told him

356
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,940
to meet you at the Chengtian Hotel
tomorrow morning.

357
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,700
Welcome.

358
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,220
Hao,

359
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,220
who's the partner

360
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,100
you mentioned?

361
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,580
Besides, we don't even have

362
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,180
a new proposal.

363
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,180
I don't think

364
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,580
I can make it back
to my hometown in time.

365
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,780
Song Lingren

366
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,580
is on her way here.

367
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:27,900
Wait.

368
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,860
You see, our success rate

369
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,860
is less than 10%, you know?

370
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,500
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

371
00:23:59,300 --> 00:23:59,780
We've confirmed it.

372
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,180
Joseph's room number

373
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,740
is 1201.

374
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,420
I'll be receiving you

375
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,340
at the fire exit later.

376
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,540
Call me if you need anything.

377
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,100
Mr. Sheng, sorry for the wait.

378
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,180
I hope we can collaborate

379
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,060
after this meeting.

380
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,180
I'm looking forward
to your proposal too.

381
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:28,820
Please have a seat.

382
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,300
Okay.

383
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,180
So, it's you.

384
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,300
Let's have a chat.

385
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,340
Please.

386
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,740
May I see this

387
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,020
as you offering yourself to me?

388
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,300
Take a look at these first.

389
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,300
Joseph, the family man,

390
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,700
is actually a playboy, huh?

391
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,420
You have an affair
while you are married.

392
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,180
What a shameless guy.

393
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,300
But I never expected you
to bring your mistress here

394
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,700
as your "wife".

395
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,260
Your wife must be very wealthy.

396
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,900
I presume you married into her family.

397
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,780
I wonder what your wife

398
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,100
will do

399
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,140
when she sees these pictures.

400
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,580
What do you want?

401
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,100
It's simple. Just maintain

402
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,580
the collaboration with Chengtian Group,

403
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,860
and we'll be even.

404
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,180
What are you doing here?

405
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,020
Mrs. Ji,

406
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,940
I'm impressed by your courage.

407
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,300
But your threat

408
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,140
doesn't work

409
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,940
on me.

410
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,300
Seems like you didn't investigate
my background thoroughly.

411
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,900
Do you think my wife

412
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,020
cares about that?

413
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,660
Her life out there
is much more exciting than me.

414
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,900
Since you're already offering yourself
to my doorstep,

415
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,620
I won't stand on ceremony, then.

416
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,060
Shuangshuang, Gu Zijun.

417
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:02,900
Shuangshuang!

418
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,580
Don't come near me!

419
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,580
If not, I'll call the cops on you!

420
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,340
There's no surveillance camera here.

421
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:11,660
Qin Hao!

422
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,020
Song Yao is in the hotel.

423
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,300
What is she doing here?

424
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,700
Look!

425
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,300
It's so dangerous.

426
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,220
What if she falls?

427
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,740
She has to be careful.

428
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:54,900
Is that Song Yao?

429
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,340
Luckily, she went inside.

430
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,180
That was scary.

431
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,500
Qin Hao?

432
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,660
What were you doing there?

433
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,420
I wanted to help you out.

434
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,060
By scaling the balcony?

435
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,620
I had no idea Joseph

436
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,580
wasn't terrified of his wife at all.

437
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,380
He even wanted to do something to me...

438
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,180
That's why I scaled the balcony.

439
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,420
His tricks are...

440
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,060
Was that why

441
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,060
you did such a dumb deed?

442
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,420
I won't report it
as an occupational injury

443
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,660
if you fall and become a cripple.

444
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,620
I only wanted to help you out.

445
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,860
I don't need your help.

446
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:30,740
Fine.

447
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,980
I'll leave, then. Okay?

448
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,780
Let go of me.

449
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,780
We already signed the contract.

450
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,580
Now, you're Mrs. Ji.

451
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:40,900
Where do you think you're going?

452
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,660
Mrs. Ji, my foot! I quit!

453
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,740
If you breach the contract,

454
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,020
you have to pay me one million yuan.

455
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,220
One million yuan?

456
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,100
Check it again.

457
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,420
[Penalty, 1 million yuan]
No need for that. Pass it to me.

458
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,580
You do know your stuff, huh?

459
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,260
Did you set me up?

460
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,660
You signed the contract

461
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,660
without checking it thoroughly.

462
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,020
I should've let you

463
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:05,940
die in the basement

464
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,860
back then.

465
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,420
I'll pay you for the stupid penalty.

466
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,860
You can keep it in your piggy bank!

467
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,220
I've fallen out with Qin Hao.

468
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,100
From today onward,

469
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:19,860
I'm free.

470
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,380
But...

471
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,860
But I have bad news.

472
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,820
I need to pay him one million yuan.

473
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,460
My lady,

474
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,060
please turn around and apologize to him.

475
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,220
We can't afford to pay the penalty.

476
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:57,860
We'll terminate all deals

477
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,060
with Joseph.

478
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,780
We'll never collaborate with him again.

479
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,340
Joseph

480
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,420
is truly unfortunate to encounter you.

481
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,260
He didn't know what was good for him

482
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,180
and offended your dear wife.

483
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,620
[Ji Chengchuan]
I'm not doing it for her sake.

484
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:27,700
What...

485
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,500
Why are you back?

486
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,300
Did you realize the importance

487
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,980

00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:24,860

Speak for yourself.

00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,820
I learned that from you.

518
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,940
We said that each of us
would own half of the property.

519
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,860
What? You want
to go back on your promise?

Let's see
who will be the winner at the end.

if you just yield and be nice to me?

a five-star review, then.

550
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,140

Please know where you stand.

552
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,500
This is my territory.

553
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,900
No means no.

554
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,180
Please don't waste my time.

555
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,620
You're crossing the line!

556
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,100
Now, I'll show you what it means

557
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,540
to cross the line.

558
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:31,580
Listen.

559
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,580
You'd better not try anything funny.

560
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,460
We

561
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,500
signed an agreement.

562
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,220
We signed an agreement, huh?

563
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,100
If so, I'll utilize the rights
given to me

564
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,900

565
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,060
What do you think?

566
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,700
Turning on the heater

567
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,900
is part of my rights too.

568
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,820
Dear Daughter,

569
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,180
I've let you down!

570
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,660
I'm inhumane!

571
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,340
I didn't stop you when you said

572
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,540
you were moving to Qin Hao's house.

573
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,580
I should've gone there instead of you!

574
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,420
Shen Shuangshuang,

575
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,860
say something I can understand.

576
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,420
Look at the state you're in.

577
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,060
Don't tell me he...

578
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:19,900
Don't bring it up.

579
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,100
Qin Hao is totally perverted.

580
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,700
What did he do to you?

581
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:24,620
He...

582
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,180
He trampled upon my soul.

583
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,100
I'll say this right now.

584
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,260
For the sake of my freedom and dignity,

585
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,420
I must make one million yuan

586
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,260
to pay off the penalty.

587
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,220
Therefore, I plan
to do my old trade again

588
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,540
to pay off my debt.

589
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,900
I wouldn't have rejected
that one-million-yuan deal

590
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,060
had I known this would happen.

591
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,500
I remember that.

592
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,540
It was three days ago.

593
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,380
You received a phone call

594
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,420
concerning a million-yuan deal
at 3:28 PM.

595
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,300
Are you sure you didn't get it wrong?

596
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,340
Trust me.

597
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,220
Thirty days ago,

at 4:14 AM,

599
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,100
a hater insulted

600
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,140
my idol for scratching his feet at home.

601
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:15,980
I remember everything.

602
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:16,940
Of course

603
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,780
I can remember
what happened three days ago.

604
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,900
I found it.

605
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,420
I'll tell Dad about it personally.

606
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,260
It's a waste for Shuangshuang

607
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,500
to be working in our committee.

608
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,300
Indeed.

609
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,580
It's a total waste of her talent.

610
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,220
All right. No problem.

611
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,340
The deal is completed.

612
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,220
Buddies, let's eat!

613
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,540
Are you sure the deal is done?

614
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,780
Is it even reliable?
They might be a scammer.

615
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,500
You have received 500,000 yuan
to your Alipay account.

616
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,300
Seems like

617
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,300
they're not that close to each other.

[Liang Jingyi]
Chengchuan,

619
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,220
there are some facts

00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,660
you should know about Song Yao.

621
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,660
Chengchuan,

622
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,780
I never expected her

623
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,580
to be someone like this.

624
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,060
How could she

625
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,940
deceive you like this?

626
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,540
Deceive what?

627
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,060
Your feelings.

628
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,060
She approached you

629
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,300
because of money.

630
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,340
It has nothing to do with money.

631
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,380
I love her.

632
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,380
She's my true love.

633

What's so good about that Song Yao?

635
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,180
We're supposed

to be the perfect couple here.

637
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,220
Miss Liang,

638
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,300
I don't want you to invade

00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,580
our privacy again.

Have you obtained
the details of our target?

641
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,860
The client said it was unnecessary.

642
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,140
You could recognize him immediately.

643
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,220
Long time no see,

644
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:41,940
Goddess.

645
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,700
I understand now.

646
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,220
You're my client, aren't you?

647
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,300
What are you saying? I don't understand.

648
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,060
Only a fool as narcissistic as you

649
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,180
would spend so much

650
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,780
to hire me to tail you.

651
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:02,860
Enough.

00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,060

Why aren't you following the script?

punish me right now?

658
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,580
You don't need punishment.

659

You need treatment

660

even if

664
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,300
it means my handsome face
has to be damaged.

If I were Aphrodite,

670
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:50,740
A while ago,

671
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,060
Chengchuan clinched
a foreign project deal

672
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,220
with Shengshi Group.

673
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,380
Therefore, I suggest

674
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,660
he become a member
of the board of directors.

Although Chengchuan is young,

678
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,980
he's making a name for himself
right after returning to the country.

679
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,380
He's young and talented indeed.

680
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,860
However, I heard

681
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,660
that he clinched a deal
with Shengshi Group

682
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,220
because he fell out
with our original partner,

Mr. Joseph, due to private reasons.

684
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,340
That's why

685
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,540
he clinched a deal with Shengshi Group.

686
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,780
Chengtian Group had to invest
an extra few billion yuan due to that.

687
