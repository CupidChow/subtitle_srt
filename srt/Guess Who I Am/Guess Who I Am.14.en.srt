00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,420
Should I set up a bench for you

192
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,260
so you can listen next to me?

193
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,500

00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,700
You even called me here.

307
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,660
it was me and Ling.

308
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,940
I have checked

309
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,900
all the videos that you provided me.

The Maintenance Department
has a record of this matter.

313
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,300
There were no suspicious individuals.

314
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,340
I also checked the attendance records.

If you ask me, it has to be Mr. Xu.

321
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,460
He is the most suspicious one.

322
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,940
He's been sneaking around a lot lately.

323
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,380
He also went missing from time to time.

324
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,580
Is Mr. Xu

325
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,660
in a relationship recently?

326
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,580

of long, brown hair on him.

00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,660
No way.

330
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,340
He has been single for a long time.

331
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,500
No, he is indeed in love,

332
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,900
not to mention with Lisa.

333
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,340
By the way, I have a points card.

334
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,980
The convenience store's point cards

335
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,980
has a real-name system.

336
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,820
Lisa was using

337
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,980
Mr. Xu's point card.

338
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,340
Even the stickers
are all in the same position.

339
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,100

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,740

341
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,740

every single night,

344
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,340
the day of the meeting
would not be an exception.

345
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,940
Do you know

346
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,860
what time they met up?

347
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,460
I remember the time

348
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,140
for printing the document that night

349
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,940
was 10:47 PM.

350
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,980
Mr. Xu is definitely not the mole, then.

351
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,740
How far is Qilinshe from the office?

352
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,580
If driving, it would take

353
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,380
at least 20 minutes.

354
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,420
I signed

355
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,260
one of his expense reimbursement forms
yesterday.

356
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,860
The time shown on it

357
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,820
is 10:40 PM.

358
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,580
[Mr. Xu]
There'd be no way

359
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,260

he could rush back to the office

360
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,140
and steal the bid proposal
within seven minutes.

361
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,820
However, the remaining two

362
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,140
did not leave any trace either.

363
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,180
Mr. Ji,

364
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,140
we have already done so much.

365

It's your turn after this,

366
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,980
isn't it?

367
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,220
I allow Gu Zijun to use

368
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,580
the account of Chengtian Group's CEO.

369
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,540
What do you mean?

370
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,500
It's a trap.

371
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,580
Is this

372
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,420
how you always operated?

373
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,740
Of course.

374
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,700
We will never

375
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,620
give scums

376
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,580
the opportunity to escape.

377
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,140
No wonder.

378
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,260
No wonder you were
so close to ruining my plan

379
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,340
when we first met.

380
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,060
I wasn't as skilled as you,

381
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,620
who played us like a fiddle.

382
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,260
Likewise.

383
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,860
It's all in the past.

384
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,940
Life has seen many storms,

385
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,380
let's not bring up the past anymore.

386
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,540
I'll continue writing it in my room.

387
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,300
Everyone,

388
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,540
I believe that some of you

389
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,380
have already heard

390
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,420
that our bid price was leaked

391
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,100
two days ago.

392
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,620
Obviously,

393
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,420
amongst you

394
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,300
is a traitor who betrayed
the Chengtian Group.

395
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,900
Thus, from today onward,

396
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,180
the 27th floor will serve as

397
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,740
the floor solely dedicated
to the bidding project team.

398
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,340
And we will turn it into
a fully enclosed office

399
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,100
with all electronic signals blocked.

400
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,100
Without my permission,

401
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,460
any documents,

402
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,140
even if it's just a piece of paper,

403
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,900
are not allowed to leave this floor.

404
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,140
Mr. Ji is being extremely meticulous.

405
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,620
Say less.

406
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,340
Don't bring trouble upon yourself.

407
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,300
My mobile phone has no signal.

408
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,220
I was on the phone.

409
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,220
I have to make the call outside.

410
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,540
How's it going?
Did you figure out anything?

411
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,140
Hello?

412
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,700
The leaked bid proposal incident

413
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,500
couldn't have been hidden
for too long anyway.

414
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,620
Just keep doing your thing.

415
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,460
I have my own arrangements for the rest.

416
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,220
The best way to distract Ji Chengchuan

417
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,300
is to

418
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,980
start from Song Yao.

419
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,100
As for the one
who will make things worse

420
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:02,940
[Reliable source from Chengtian Group.]
on behalf

421
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,660
[Song Yao is a commercial spy.]
of us,

422
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,450
[She approached Ji Chengchuan
with an ulterior motive.]

423
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,050
[The evidence of her previous actions]

424
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,700
[has been sent to you via email.]

425
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,780
Liang Jingyi would be

426
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,940
a fairly good choice.

427
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,340
Chengchuan,

428
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,260
this is Song Yao's true motive

429
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,380
in getting close to you.

430
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,940
Have a look.

431
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,000
[Liang Jingyi]

432
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,340
The game is starting to get interesting.

433
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,180
Killing with a borrowed knife.

434
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,260
It seems that our opponent

435
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,140
is not simple.

436
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,380
Liang Jingyi probably doesn't know

437
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,820
that she has been

438
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,060
used as a weapon yet.

439
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,620
Do you dare go big with me?

440
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,580
What are you suggesting?

441
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,740
When are you available?

442
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,660
Let's meet up and talk.

443
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,700
[Ji Chengchuan]
It's time to showcase

444
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,060
my true skills.

445
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,500
The divide and conquer strategy.

446
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,780
The divide and conquer strategy?

447
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,740
You still don't get it?

448
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,500
You ask Liang Jingyi out,

449
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,860
pretending to be convinced by her.

450
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,100
You then trick her into coming clean.

451
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,460
You'll know the mastermind
behind all this,

452
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,140
no?

453
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,380
However, we do

454
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,220
have a problem here.

455
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,180
You're so bad

456
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,100
at putting up an act.

457
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:25,980
I must give you

458
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,820
an impromptu coaching session.

459
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,540
I guarantee that you can master it
in three to five days.

460
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,020
Stand up.

461
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,340
Let's start from

462
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,740
Stanislavski

463
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,580
and Brecht's

464
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,620
acting system.

465
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,620
Bring it on.

466
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,660
Our first lesson

467
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,180
is non-tangible performance exercise.

468
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:45,780
Look at me.

469
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,020
I am currently demonstrating
a perfect portrayal

470
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,780
of a corporate drone

471
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,100
acting like a humanoid pendant

472
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,780
on a bus.

473
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,020
Observe me well.

474
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,140
The key point of this act

475
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,340
is the swinging movement.

476
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,100
And you must follow inertia.

477
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,340
Turning left,

478
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,500
turning right.

479
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,260
What are you doing? Learn.

480
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,500
I'm observing you.

481
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,220
Stop observing, you have to practice.

482
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,980
Hand in position, raise it high.

483
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,220
The driver's going to drive.

484
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,220
Turning left,

485
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,940
turning right.

486
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,260
Accelerating.

487
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,220
What's wrong?

488
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,660
That was a sudden brake.

489
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,740
Now I have a thread on my hand.

490
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,460
One end is linked to
the tip of your nose.

491
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,540
The other one
is linked to my finger.

492
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,860
You have to go wherever I pull you.

493
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,540
Do you understand?

494
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,300
Yes.

495
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,260
Liberate your nature at this moment.

496
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,100
What?

497
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,380
Simply put, it is a basic training

498
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,460
in performing art.

499
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:41,980
Let me search for it on Baidu.

500
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,260
The liberation of nature
in performing art

501
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,260
is a professional term.

502
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,820
Rationally speaking, because of
the changes and influences

503
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,500
in the environment,

504
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,580
human nature is constrained.

505
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,900
You have to be able to

506
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,540
immerse yourself

507
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,300
in the predetermined situation

508
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,820
with a good

509
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,900
and correct performance state

510
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,340
so as to express
the true and rich mental state

511
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,620
of the character.

512
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,580
Do you understand?

513
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,180
Yes, but...

514
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,180
But what?

515
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,340
Close your eyes

516
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,420
and imagine yourself

517
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,500
as an orangutan with me.

518
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,260
Got it?

519
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,100
Do it.

520
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:34,980
What?

521
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,060
You should imitate your teacher.

522
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,580
Hurry.

523
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,380
Well...

524
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:11,900
What's this?

525
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:12,700
A pig.

526
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,340
A pig rolling over the ground.

527
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,260
You are the pig here.

528
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,540
Have you ever seen such a skinny pig?

529
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,100
This is a dog.
A dog rolling over the floor.

530
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,780
A Tyrannosaurus.

531
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,940
Because of the short hands,

532
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,620
this must be a Tyrannosaurus.

533
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,500
Nonsense, this is a meerkat.

534
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,700
What's a meerkat?

535
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,180
Timon, Hakuna Matata.

536
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,340
Come, let's revise.

537
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,340
Come on.

538
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,180
Here, please have a seat.

539
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,540
What are we doing now?

540
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,820
This

541
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,100
is your wife who has changed her heart.

542
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,980
Please go ahead
and release your emotions.

543
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,210
Remember to be sincere

544
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,860
but tense enough.

545
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:07,860
Bring it on.

546
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,060
Why are you coming this way?

547
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,300
Your wife is here.

548
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,020
Are you attacking your coach?

549
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,580
