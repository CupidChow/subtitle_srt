He only travels to two places every day,

190
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,380
the office and his home.

191
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,140
The office and his home.

192
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:34,900
The office and his home.

193
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,300
He's as regular as a robot.

194
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,940
Do you think this trick

195
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,220
is still going to work?

196
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,540
Be patient.

197
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,610
It's only a matter of time
before he shows his true colors.

198
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,780
Fifty-four meters above sea level,
18th floor.

199
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,060
Chen Jinghui has been sitting
in the office

200
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,260
all morning

201
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,660
without even going to the toilet.

202
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,140
His kidneys are too good.

203
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,500
What's it?

204
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,500
What's going on?

205
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,260
It's a new program I've added.

206
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,140
As soon as Chen Jinghui is out of

207
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,860
his regular spots,

208
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,900
the alarm will automatically go off.

209
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:45,660
What?

210
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,140
Why didn't you tell me?

211
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,620
You made me stay up all night.

212
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,540
It's okay.

213
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,980
With you, there's double security.

214
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,100
Be good.

215
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,380
He suddenly left the office

216
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,140
during office hours.

217
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,140
He doesn't have

218
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,260
any official schedule today.

219
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,380
Something must be up.

220
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,380
Shuangshuang, get up!

221
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,260
That's all you eat

222
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
with the money I gave you?

223
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,620
Eating anything is the same.

224
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,740
Here, take it.

225
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,020
I came here today

226
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,020
to tell you something.

227
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,380
Who's the target this time?

228
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,100
You don't have to do
this kind of thing anymore.

229
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,780
What is this?

230
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,020
You've been helping me for so long.

231
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,780
It's time for you to have your own life.

232
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,260
Sign it

233
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,580
and I'll take care of the rest.

234
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,580
The target is right here.

235
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,660
The altimeter on the pen

236
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,540
says 20 meters.

237
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,700
They should be on the top floor.
Let's go.

238
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,100
You guys go over there.

239
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,900
Gu Zijun, you go to the stairs
over there.

240
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,980
Okay, be careful.

241
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,740
It's time to put an end to all this.

242
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,180
The remaining mice

243
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,700
are about to disappear.

244
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,020
What's happened?

245
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,260
Let's go and take a look.

246
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,060
Did something happen?

247
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,780
Quick! Call the police!

248
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,460
There's a fire! Call 911!

249
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,340
Call the police now!

250
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,460
The remaining mice are unsettling.

251
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,260
Find a chance to get rid of them.

252
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,540
What's it?

253
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,540
What's going on?

254
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,540
[Location confirmed]

255
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,980
Sheng Silin, what are you doing here?

256
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,460
You can't be here.

257
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,540
No, Chen Jinghui is up there.

258
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,180
I have to go.

259
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:48,820
Let the police catch the criminals.

260
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,740
You can't go up there.

261
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,220
Let's go.

262
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,020
Do you know how dangerous that was?

263
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,380
Do you know

264
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,420
you almost died?

265
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,420
How did you know I was here?

266
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,940
Don't tell me you were just passing by.

267
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,300
And don't tell me it was a coincidence.

268
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,220
It's telepathy.

269
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,660
You think I will buy into that?

270
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,300
As soon as Ji Chengchuan
had an accident,

271
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,060
I guessed Chen Jinghui

272
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,980
would do something bad to you.

273
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,740
I called the police and followed you.

274
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,860
How did you know about Chen Jinghui?

275
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:44,820
Song Yao,

276
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,500
is that how you treat

277
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,460
your savior?

278
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,620
No. How dare you fight against

279
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,140
someone like Chen Jinghui?

280
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,580
He's heartless.

281
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,020
Let's go.

282
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,620
No, if we've been exposed,

283
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,100
so has Ji Cheng'an.

284
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,380
Wait, Ji Cheng'an.

285
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,260
Why did you suddenly

286
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,540
come to the mall?

287
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,020
Didn't you tell me

288
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,260
to behave as usual?

289
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,580
I'm behaving as usual.

290
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,020
All right, stop it.

291
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,900
Where exactly are you?

292
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,380
I'm on the ground floor,

293
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,660
in front of a cafe.

294
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,500
I'm on the first floor right now.

295
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,700
- Can you see me?
- First floor?

296
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,860
Okay, I see you.

297
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:25,740
Hello?

298
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:27,940
Wait for me there.

299
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,940
I'll be right there.

300
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,780
Wait for me there.

301
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,500
Ji Cheng'an!

302
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,860
Ji Cheng'an! Watch out! He's behind you!

303
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,620
Ji Cheng'an, watch out!

304
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,420
Behind you!

305
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,900
Ji Cheng'an!

306
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:55,940
Call the police!

307
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,700
Call the police!

308
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,580
He's over there!

309
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,260
Stop right there!

310
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,060
Don't run!

311
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:02,860
We've called the police.

312
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:03,900
Stop right there!

313
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,500
Ji Chengchuan.

314
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,340
I understand.

315
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,580
You're doing this to protect me.

316
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,340
But you know what?

317
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,540
