00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,460
Have you forgotten

191
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,420
the way you set me up at that time?

192
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,620
Today,

193
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,660
I'll let you experience

194
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,620
the feeling of losing everything.

195
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,580
Search and locate Song Yao's gang.

196
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,980
Don't let them get away.

197
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,500
You two, stay here.

198
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,860
You three check over there.

199
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,540
Yes, sir.

200
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,700
The rest follow me up.

201
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,580
Check each floor.

202
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,420
I'm so appreciated

203
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,340
that you can come today.

204
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,580
In the future,

205
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,660
I will lead the Chengtian Group

206
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,140
towards digitalization,

207
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,220
internationalization,

208
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,140
and intelligentization advancements.

209
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,820
Hurry, they're in this room.

210
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,380
Get the door open.

211
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:14,780
Song Yao.

212
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:15,980
You're screwed.

213
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,020
Break it!

214
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,900
Song Yao.

215
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,540
There's no time.

216
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,380
Shuangshuang and the rest

217
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,300
have been controlled
by Chen Jinghui's gang.

218
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:40,700
Hurry up.

219
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,580
I'm going to get reinforcement.

220
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,580
Find a way to escape.

221
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:42,900
Break it!

222
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,500
Song Yao.

223
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,380
It's me.

224
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,900
I'll get you ten more minutes.

225
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,380
Hey!

226
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,220
Chengtian will continue to improve.

227
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,180
- Yes!
- Good!

228
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,940
Don't move!

229
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,460
Don't come any closer!

230
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,340
Watch it.

231
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,500
- Drop the knife.
- Move back!

232
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,300
Don't be rash.

233
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,260
Ji Chengchuan.

234
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,620
What are you doing?

235
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,340
I'm here to kill you.

236
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,580
Is this your last resort?

237
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:44,980
What?

238
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:45,980
Are you scared?

239
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,180
You're the one

240
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,780
who should be scared.

241
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,420
Ji Chengchuan.

242
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,500
You want to kill me?

243
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,300
If so, that means
we are exactly the same kind of person.

244
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,620
No, we are not.

245
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,140
You don't trust anyone.

246
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,020
Whereas I...

247
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,260
I trust Song Yao.

248
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,180
So that's your plan.

249
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,460
Do you think if I'm caught by you,

250
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,300
Song Yao could get the evidence

251
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,180
from Li Chen?

252
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,620
Should I call you naive,

253
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,460
or just dumb?

254
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,820
Li Chen hates Song Yao a lot.

255
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,380
Don't you know about that?

256
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,820
No matter what you say,

257
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,380
I'd never give it to you.

258
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,460
We've made an agreement long ago.

259
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,260
My people

260
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,940
are probably about

261
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,180
to break the door
of the meeting room.

262
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,660
None of you

263
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,260
will be able to get away.

264
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,140
Push harder!

265
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,980
You up there! Don't move!

266
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,220
Ji Chengchuan.

267
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,220
The police are here.

268
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,860
You lose!

269
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,780
Handcuff him.

270
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,020
I made it.

271
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,580
Li Chen.

272
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,420
Do you know

273
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,140
how many people died

274
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,060
because of this?

275
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:51,900
If you hand the evidence

276
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,700
to the culprit,

277
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,140
you'd be an accomplice,
do you know that?

278
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,380
Go on.

279
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,620
Say whatever you want.

280
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,900
Push harder!

281
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,780
Li Chen.

282
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,700
I can't believe I helped you

283
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,220
to get visitation to your daughter.

284
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,500
Now, I'm feeling like

285
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,580
I was just a busybody,

286
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,220
poking my nose in your business.

287
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,340
What did you say?

288
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,500
Poor Yuanyuan.

289
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,180
I feel sorry for her

290
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,060
for having a dad like you.

291
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,460
It's over.

292
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:34,740
Ji Chengchuan.

293
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,180
Although your intention

294
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,180
was to expose the real culprit,

295
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,420
the methods you employed

296
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,260
were too extreme.

297
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,140
It's downright unacceptable.

298
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,180
What if

299
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,340
you lost control of the situation

300
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,300
and caused irreversible consequences?

301
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,060
I was too rash.

302
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,860
You'll have to

303
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,540
come with us.

304
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:49,420
Okay.

305
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,780
Ji Chengchuan.

306
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,460
Thank you for trusting me.

307
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,500
Thank you too

308
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,660
for believing in me in the end.

309
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:17,860
However,

310
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,780
that cup of water...

311
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,780
Sorry, I shouldn't have done so.

312
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,820
But I'm very useful, right?

313
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,100
I convinced Li Chen

314
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,460
at the most critical moment.

315
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,060
Song Yao!

316
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,100
Come on,

317
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,420
tell me

318
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,660
how did you convince Li Chen?

319
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,660
Did you use your spell on him?

320
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,500
My eyes have recovered.

321
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,860
Now, my eyes

322
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,140
are just normal and beautiful.

323
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,380
Okay, you've got beautiful eyes.

324
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,580
Though your eyes have recovered,

325
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,340
it seems like

326
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,300
you've become more narcissistic?

327
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,340
Yao, are you all right?

328
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,620
Did Li Chen harm you?

329
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,700
Let me see if you're hurt.

330
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,740
I'm fine.

331
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,980
I'm totally fine.

332
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,980
Yao, I was wrong.

333
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,620
I shouldn't have called you a busybody.

334
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,980
I was too young and naive.

335
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,060
That move

336
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,460
turns out to be the key.

337
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,860
With such exceptional foresight

338
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,500
and strategic vision,

339
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,380
you really should consider

340
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,460
doing some financial investments
with me.

341
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,780
Let's work to set Wall Street
as our dream workplace together.

342
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,580
We can make it.

343
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,300
Jiang Nanxuan.

344
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,460
It's already the last episode.

345
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,100
It's weird
you haven't ruined your public persona.

346
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,820
You bet.

347
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,500
I've been maintaining this persona
for more than 20 years.

348
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,820
Who knew

349
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,780
that the story could turn out this way?

350
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,860
This is what you call,

351
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,620
one good turn deserves another.

352
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,780
By the way, Qin Hao,

353
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,900
when did you cooperate with the police?

354
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,460
I guess

355
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,060
it was before he faked his death.

356
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,220
The police didn't have solid proof
of Chen Jinghui's crimes.

357
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,420
So I helped them gather evidence.

358
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,100
You should've told us.

359
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,820
We could've worked
with the police together.

360
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,980
That wouldn't do.

361
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,740
Your acting skills are so terrible

362
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,180
that Chen Jinghui
would've noticed it long ago.

363
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,620
The police asked me to keep it secret.

364
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,820
So I didn't say anything.

365
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,140
He even kept it from me.

366
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,260
I'll have to think
of how to make you pay.

367
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,430
[Chen Jinghui was arrested.]

368
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,760
[Ji Chengchuan used a knife to coerce
and intimidate others in public,]

369
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,000
[and engaged in provocative
behavior, making it a serious offense.]

370
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,580
[However, since his behavior did not
cause anyone injured,]

371
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,900
[he was only detained for 15 days
and his knife was confiscated.]

372
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,640
[Song Yao and the others received \
harsh criticism from the police]

373
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,180
[for their inappropriate behavior
in the incident.]

374
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,320
[They reflected on what they did]

375
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,080
[and took the initiative
to settle with the parties involved.]

376
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,620
[Lantern Festival]

377
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,500
