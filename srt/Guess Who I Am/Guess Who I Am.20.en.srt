00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,940
it's been 15 years.

193
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,700
I borrowed your son's identity.

194
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,860
I'm sorry.

195
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,580
Thank you for raising me

196
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,820
and keeping me alive all these years.

197
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,620
I finally remembered everything,

198
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
and I'm not afraid of fire anymore.

199
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,780
I promise you

200
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,180
I won't let you

201
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,900
and Qin Hao die in vain.

202
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,180
There you are.

203
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,700
Lin Shu,

204
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,140
I've come to see you.

205
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,340
Our son has grown up.

206
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,620
I've grown old.

207
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,740
I'm sorry for what happened

208
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,860
at that time.

209
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,060
Chengchuan,

210
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,380
when I went back to see your mother,

211
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,980
I was trying to get remarried with her.

212
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,300
Do you think I would believe that?

213
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,980
But no one could have expected

214
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,540
that accident to happen.

215
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:34,820
Accident?

216
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,420
Mr. Ji,

217
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,100
don't you find yourself ridiculous?

218
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,580
Do you really think

219
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,660
I didn't see anything

220
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,940
or know anything at that time?

221
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,180
Ms. Song.

222
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,500
Is there anything else wrong

223
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,820
with your eyes?

224
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,220
No.

225
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:26,980
Okay, then.

226
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,300
Just have more rest these days.

227
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,540
Try not to overuse your eyes,

228
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,020
all right?

229
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:30,900
Thank you.

230
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,220
Why are you here?

231
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,980
Why can't I be here?

232
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,260
Where's my brother, Ji Chengchuan?

233
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,020
What do you want?

234
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,220
My mom heard he was in the hospital,

235
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,460
so she asked me to visit him.

236
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,940
As if you and your mother
care about him.

237
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,220
Fine.

238
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,580
I just came to see

239
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,740
if he's still alive, all right?

240
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,540
Well, you might be disappointed, then.

241
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,700
Go back and tell your mom

242
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,420
and your uncle

243
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,580
Chengchuan is pretty well.

244
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,700
Go away.

245
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,740
You're not welcomed.

246
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,460
What's going on?

247
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,340
He looked me in the eyes.

248
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,740
That's not normal.

249
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,420
Does he have no feelings?

250
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,500
Ji Cheng'an!

251
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,300
What?

252
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,220
Do you have any shares
of Chengtian Group in your name?

253
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,580
Shares of Chengtian Group?

254
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,580
Are you mocking me?

255
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,780
I am the second young master
of Chengtian Group.

256
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,260
How could I not have shares
in Chengtian Group?

257
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,220
Do you think you're handsome?

258
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,340
Of course.

259
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,980
Then he must be a wealthy liar.

260
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,060
Look me in the eyes!

261
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,180
Are you insane?

262
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,500
Weirdly, nothing happened.

263
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:17,900
What's wrong?

264
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,420
What happened to your eyes?

265
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:23,940
Nothing.

266
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,740
Are they uncomfortable?

267
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,300
No.

268
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:40,940
What?

269
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,500
My eyes have recovered.

270
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,660
They've recovered.

271
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,500
Are you…

272
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,260
I love you.

273
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,500
All right, then.

274
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,060
What did he say?

275
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,300
He agreed to meet.

276
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,180
He asked us to meet him at…

277
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:42,500
Wait.
