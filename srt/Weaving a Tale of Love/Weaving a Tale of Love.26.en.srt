[Episode 26]

4
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,550
- Adoptive Father.
- Yes.

5
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,400
Xiao Douzi, quickly rise. Get up.

6
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,030
Why are you doing this for Xiao Douzi?

7
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,850
Adoptive Father, I know you wanted to get rid of Pei Xingjian for me,

8
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,990
but I beg you to not have any bad intentions to him again.

9
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,140
Pei Xingjian already knows of my female identity.

10
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,490
When I left the palace, he already knew.

11
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,900
He has no bad intention towards me. He has saved me several times.

12
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,290
You almost have caused great trouble, making me a criminal.

13
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,800
Pei Xingjian already knew you were a female?

14
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,500
This Pei Jingxian has investigated your mother's old files.

15
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,290
He might have already known you are Attire Expert An's daughter.

16
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,160
This is too dangerous. We have to think of a way to make him be quiet.

17
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,260
Adoptive Father, not only Pei Xingjian knows now, even Talented Lady Wu knows.

18
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,590
What? What? Even Talented Lady Wu knows?

19
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,030
Adoptive Father, don't worry. Pei Xingjian and Talented Lady Wu are good people. They won't harm me.

20
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,910
In the palace, it is full of danger, I know.

21
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,440
I have two more friends I can rely on. Isn't that a good thing?

22
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,380
You girl! You are the same as your mother.

23
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,990
Always thinking others are as kind as yourself.

24
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,910
You don't know the evils of people. You think they are easy to distinguish.

25
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,640
Adoptive Father, I know you love me most.

26
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,050
I promise you. I will be careful everywhere and I won't have danger.

27
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,720
But you also have to promise me you cannot harm Pei Xingjian again.

28
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,790
You also cannot harm Talented Lady Wu again.

29
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,840
Oh, my child.

30
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,450
Can I not promise you now?

31
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,380
Now even Talented Lady Wu knows your background.

32
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,950
I can't kill everyone that knows.

33
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,350
Even if I have the intention, I don't have the skills.

34
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,130
Adoptive Father, don't be angry.

35
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,330
Child,

36
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,550
can't you let me be less worried?

37
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,690
I know.

[Bureau of Imperial Attire]

39
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,480
The matter of dreaming a fairy,

40
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,550
you talk of it as if it is real.

41
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,690
These few days, has the fairy taught you any new skills in your dream?

42
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,990
Even if you don't ask, I wanted to tell you.

43
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,180
Ever since Fairy told me the sewing skills last time,

44
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,950
she hasn't shown up in several days. I am also worried.

45
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,760
I thought if Fairy doesn't come to my dream,

46
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,460
then how would I tell Attire Expert Zhuo?

47
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,520
Last night, before I slept, I burned incense sticks for respect.

48
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,880
I begged that Fairy to come into my dream.

49
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,300
Then, Fairy really did come.

50
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,240
She taught me how to do long and short stitches.

51
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,230
Then as the fairy said in the dream,

52
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,020
I used the long and short stitch to fill in the wings of the butterfly.

53
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,610
It really is beautiful and real looking. Have a look Attire Expert Zhuo.

54
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,680
Madam An taught me this long and short stitch before.

55
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,520
But I have never taught anyone in the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

56
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,250
How did Xiao Douzi learn?

57
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,220
Unless the fairy coming to the dream to teach sewing is real?

58
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,950
The long and short stitch...

59
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,870
How rare is this?

60
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,180
Then, my master taught me.

61
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,170
Does it need a fairy to teach you in a dream?

62
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,760
I think you

63
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,920
are just making up things and have heard it from others.

64
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,090
Attire Expert Zhuo, so you know this sewing method?

65
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:21,060
But I haven't seen anyone else in the Bureau of Imperial Attire use this sewing method.

66
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,300
That is because I have never taught them.

67
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,150
Learning a skill starts from the basics.

68
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,360
When they know the basics well,

69
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,520
I will naturally teach them one by one.

70
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,170
So Mother taught this method to Zhuo Jinniang.

71
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,410
Yet Zhuo Jinniang is selfish.

72
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,370
She doesn't teach the methods to others in the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

73
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,440
The experts all think alike.

74
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,760
That's what the fairy also said in the dream.

75
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,060
She said I haven't gone through actual training and my basics were not good.

76
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,260
So, the fairy had to start from the basics to teach me.

77
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,250
The fairy said, other than the long and short stitch,

78
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,730
there is also stuff like brick stitch, fishnet stitch, and interlaced herringbone.

79
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,800
These are sewing methods teacher once taught me.

80
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,270
Then, did the fairy in the dream say it as so?

81
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,180
Really.

82
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,130
Then... the fairy in your dream,

83
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,310
what does she look like? How old is she?

84
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,090
Has she told you

85
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,620
when she was alive,

86
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,120
what she her name was, what her surname was?

87
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,680
Her magic breath was lingering in my dream. No matter how much I tried,

88
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,480
I had no way to see her appearance clearly.

89
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,430
I could not bring up her surname and her age.

90
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,070
Of course, I did not dare ask so many questions!

91
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,440
But the fairy said... said that I was gifted and bright.

92
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,010
The elementary skills I have, can't be mastered within a few months!

93
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,410
The sewing methods that have already disappeared in the world, she will

94
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,350
teach them to me.

95
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,630
Teach them slowly?

96
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,740
Then, did the fairy in the dream really say so?

97
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,780
Master, the eunuch from Hua Qin dropped by.

98
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,690
They asked if Consort Yang's pillow was finished.

99
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,830
My injury is still not healed, I cannot sit for a long period of time.

100
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,170
Qiniang.

101
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,430
- Master, slowly.
- You go

102
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,500
with this design

103
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,410
to make a new pillow for Consort Yang.

104
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,270
Yes. I will do my best.

105
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,000
Wait.

106
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,280
I haven't taught you how to stitch the wings for this butterfly.

107
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,270
Although, you have not taught me,

108
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,750
but I can try.

109
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,140
This is Consort Yang's pillow! How can we be careless!

110
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,400
With your skills, it'll be a disaster.

111
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:46,050
It's all right. You should bring this design to Xiao Douzi.

112
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,050
Ask him to try.

113
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,530
Yes.

114
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,170
Xiao Douzi, this is the design for Consort Yang's pillow.

115
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,110
I have already finished drawing it. You may have a look.

116
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,530
This Xiao Douzi really is outstanding.

117
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,640
As long as it involves embroidery,

118
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,140
nothing can stop him.

119
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,250
If he has nothing to do with Attire Expert An,

120
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,160
where would he have these skills from?

121
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,480
Madam An has died.

122
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,770
Her daughter Liuli has also died.

123
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,470
Then, who else could it be?

124
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,350
Not right.

125
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,460
I was never able to find my master's book and golden needle.

126
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,340
Did Master really hand these treasures to someone else?

127
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,250
Now that I say it,

128
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,050
Xiao Douzi's sewing skills and methods,

129
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,770
may really have originated from Master.

130
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,040
Sister Qiniang,

131
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,110
can you help me sew Consort Yang's pillows?

132
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,310
- Really?
- Of course!

133
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,610
Don't let Attire Expert Zhuo know for now. We'll secretly embroider it.

134
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,970
If Attire Expert Zhuo cannot tell, then it means your skills really have improved.

135
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,370
But... can I do it?

136
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,400
How can you not? I have told you about the methods.

137
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,990
Now you have a chance to practice. This is great!

138
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,130
If my master treated me half as well as you,

139
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,940
then that would at least repay for my service for so many years.

140
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,030
Xiao Douzi, if we really were to think about it,

141
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,820
you are my real master.

142
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,110
Be careful to not let her hear.

143
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,630
I'm willing to teach you.

144
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,740
But I don't want you to offend your master because of this.

145
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,480
Let me tell you something.

146
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,080
Attire Expert Zhuo is wicked. She is not someone kind.

147
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,090
Being by her side, you have to be more careful.

148
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:49,200
Don't be used by her and be harmed without knowing.

149
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,550
Idiot boy.

150
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,680
He's in danger himself yet he doesn't care, and was only worried about me.

151
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,490
I am not someone brilliant. My master won't notice me.

152
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,320
The one that Master fears is you.

153
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,710
Master, did you have a nightmare?

154
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,250
I dreamed of Attire Expert An.

155
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,990
I dreamed that Attire Expert An was looking for me.

156
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,400
She already died, yet she dares to enter my dreams to scare me!

157
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,800
She said... She said I need to give her my life.

158
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,230
Why would Attire Expert An want you to give her your life?

159
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,030
Could it be...

160
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,360
That time

161
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,320
I betrayed my family for righteousness. I did nothing wrong.

162
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,250
That Attire Expert An sought her own death.

163
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,530
What does it have to do with me?

164
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,520
That's right.

165
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,770
She's scaring me.

166
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,060
Yes, she's just scaring me.

167
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,740
She's already dead. What could she do to me?

168
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,990
No matter what, we must honor the dead.

169
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,950
If Attire Expert An came to master in a dream,

170
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,520
then Master can light some incense for her, to send her spirit in peace.

171
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,160
Qiniang,

172
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,230
what day is it today?

173
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,030
Today's the eighth.

174
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,250
The eighth...

175
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,230
It's exactly the anniversary of An Shi's death.

176
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,280
Then, is it really that Madam An died with regrets

177
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,960
and came to take revenge on me?

178
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,990
Q-Qiniang.

179
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,530
What you said is right.

180
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,710
In any case, she was my teacher.

181
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,380
Go, go.

182
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,630
Prepare some incense and paper money for me.

183
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,810
I will honor her.

184
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,670
Master, the palace is heavily guarded.

185
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,170
Where are we going to honor her?

186
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,630
Hall of Thinking Heart.

187
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,910
Hall of Thinking Heart?

188
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,130
That palace that's haunted?

189
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,840
Xiao Douzi said his skills

190
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,490
all came from a fairy.

191
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,590
That fairy said her vengeful spirit

192
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,130
is located in the Hall of Thinking Heart.

193
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,150
Looking at this situation,

194
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,930
it's 80% guaranteed to be Attire Expert An.

195
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,560
Hall of Thinking Heart is haunted.

196
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,980
Few people go.

197
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,700
We can go to Yixing Palace to honor her.

198
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,840
That's the best location.

199
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,900
People have desires and nightmares.

200
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,970
Attire Expert An's death probably is related to Master.

201
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,980
Today is the anniversary of her death.

202
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,950
No wonder Master is so scared and panicked.

203
00:15:53,340 --> 00:16:01,950
[Hall of Thinking Heart]

204
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,800
Mother,

205
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,520
Liuli entered the Bureau of Attire

206
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,040
to avenge you,

207
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,610
to clear your name.

208
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,340
When you have your rightful revenge,

209
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,300
I will find

210
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,190
the young man who saved me back then.

211
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:28,600
And ask him to return the golden needle and book I stored with him.

212
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,590
So, I can pass on

213
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,210
your embroidery skills.

214
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,520
Come quickly.

215
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,940
Hurry.

216
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,780
- But I haven't finished burning the money yet.
- There's no time.

217
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,140
- Master, slow down.
- Quiet.

218
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,290
What is that?

219
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,090
Go.

220
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,050
Hurry!

221
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,750
Master, apart from us,

222
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,660
could there be others here to honor her?

223
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,330
It couldn't be. That's too coincidental.

224
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,670
Why also today?

225
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,290
This...

226
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,000
Hu-style bread?

227
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,390
This Hu-style bread was An Shi's favorite food.

228
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,540
Could it be? That this person

229
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,320
is also related to Attire Expert An?

230
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,670
Look at this. They must've left in a hurry.

231
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,950
They mustn't have gone far. Qiniang, hurry.

232
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,700
Hurry and chase them! Quickly! Go after them!

233
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,480
Yes.

234
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,630
Sister Qiniang, it's me.

235
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,010
Xiao Douzi?

236
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,330
Why would you two be here?

237
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,450
Today is Attire Expert An's death anniversary.

238
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:59,670
Then, are you really related to Attire Expert An?

239
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,600
- Sister Qiniang, please listen to me.
- Qiniang!

240
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,510
Did you find something?

241
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,670
You two, hurry and run away. I'll distract Master.

242
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,320
Okay.

243
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,590
Qiniang, did you find anything inside?

244
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:26,220
I searched the insides and outsides carefully, afraid that I would leave something out,

245
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,160
but I still didn't find anything.

246
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,760
Master, honoring the dead secretly in the palace is not uncommon.

247
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,890
What happened today, maybe it's just a coincidence.

248
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,320
But today is the anniversary of Attire Expert An's death.

249
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,380
And that Hu-style bread was her favorite food when she was alive.

250
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,440
I don't believe it. How could there be such a coincidence?

251
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,290
Xiao Douzi! It must be Xiao Douzi.

252
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,780
Master, Xiao Douzi is still so young.

253
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,930
But An Shi already passed away many years ago.

254
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:01,070
How could he learn embroidery from An Shi?

255
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,130
Maybe when Attire Expert An was alive,

256
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,160
she left some book on embroidery

257
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,860
and Xiao Douzi found it.

258
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,350
That's how he could have such prodigal embroidery skills.

259
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,430
That's right. There's also the golden needle representing the "Number One Needle in the World".

260
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,620
Maybe, they're in Xiao Douzi's hands.

261
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,510
Right, Xiao Douzi.

262
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,130
Y-You're so smart.

263
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:37,390
You definitely already guessed that my mother

264
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,650
is the Attire Expert An that Attire Expert Zhuo talked about earlier.

265
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,600
I told you that someone killed my mother

266
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,300
and wanted to steal my mother's precious items.

267
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,690
That person is Zhuo Jinniang.

268
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,460
Zhuo Jinniang was jealous of my mother's embroidery skills and wanted to steal

269
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,970
the golden needle that represented her status as "Number One Needle in the World."

270
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,300
So she's been looking for me all these years.

271
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:07,060
Do you know how much danger you are in?

272
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,630
I left my mother's golden needle and book

273
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,630
with someone who saved my life.

274
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,060
Though I don't know his name or where he lives,

275
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,980
but I will definitely be able to find him and get my mother's gems back.

276
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,660
Right now, Zhuo Jinniang cannot find the book or the needle from me.

277
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,870
So she can't confirm my identity.

278
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,170
Even if Attire Expert Zhuo hasn't confirmed your identity, this doesn't eliminate her suspicion towards you.

279
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,260
This will only be more dangerous.

280
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,530
Yu'er, I'll send you out of the palace to somewhere safe.

281
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,100
No.

282
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,470
I want to stay in the palace. I want to avenge my mother.

283
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,020
I need to clear my mother's name.

284
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,760
If I can't do this, I will not leave the palace.

285
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:09,230
Master, didn't we already search his room last time?

286
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,010
Last time we were looking for clothes. This time we are looking for sewing supplies.

287
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,170
Is finding clothes and finding a needle the same?

288
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,170
Anywhere that can hide a needle,

289
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,630
we cannot miss it. Understand?!

290
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,240
Yes.

291
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:29,410
Then, master, if we really find the golden needle here at Xiao Douzi's place,

292
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,850
what do you plan to do?

293
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,360
If we really find the golden needle,

294
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,260
it means that Xiao Douzi is Attire Expert An's successor.

295
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,570
If he didn't come to the Bureau of Imperial Attire to look for trouble,

296
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,930
then he came to fight for the "Number One Needle in the World" title.

297
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,850
No matter which one it is, he must die!

298
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,900
Master, I've already finished searching that side.

299
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,920
I haven't found any golden needle.

300
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,090
Did you think I would let Xiao Douzi go if I can't find the golden needle?

301
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,500
As long as there's one day that I can't find the golden needle,

302
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,330
Xiao Douzi is the most suspicious.

303
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,320
If Xiao Douzi is Attire Expert An's disciple,

304
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,230
then he'll be my archenemy in the future.

305
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:22,980
I am An Shi's only disciple! There will always only be me!

306
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,000
If I am soft-hearted now and let him go,

307
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,860
it will be planting the seed of disaster for my future. Understand?

308
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,860
I understand.

309
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,710
Hurry and search! Why are you still staring?

310
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,770
Xiao Douzi, what did you do last night?

311
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:56,810
I have asked you to sew the pillowcase for Consort Yang. Have you finished?

312
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:03,530
Reply to Attire Expert Zhuo, I stayed up last night. I have already finished.

313
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,930
Where's the pillowcase? Bring it over and let me see.

314
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,550
The pillowcase is with Sister Qiniang.

315
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,130
I asked you to embroider the pillowcase. Why would it be with Qiniang?

316
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,210
This pillowcase is embroidery for Consort Yang.

317
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,830
After I finished, I didn't dare to send it myself.

318
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,580
So I gave the finished pillowcase to Sister Qiniang,

319
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,000
so that Attire Expert Zhuo can decide.

320
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,430
Master, the pillowcase is finished.

321
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,020
Here. Hurry and send it to Consort Yang then.

322
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,650
Yes, I'll get going now.

323
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,940
It is a success! The pillowcase I embroidered finally is kept a secret from Master.

324
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,190
Xiao Douzi, it is thanks to your great teachings.

325
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,270
I should thank you.

326
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,200
Last night, thanks to you.

327
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,310
Xiao Douzi, come out with me for a bit.

328
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,370
I have something to ask you.

329
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,790
Xiao Douzi, tell me the truth.

330
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:38,070
Are you Attire Expert An's successor after all?

331
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,500
That's right. My skills indeed stem from Attire Expert An.

332
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,650
The skills I have taught you are Attire Expert An's unique skills.

333
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:54,090
Then that means that Attire Expert An did keep a secret book.

334
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,420
Is the golden needle also in your hands?

335
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,680
Don't worry, I don't mean to know your secret.

336
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,050
It's that Master already has suspicions about you.

337
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:11,040
Just now, she has looked everywhere in your room.

338
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,400
She wants to find the secret book and the golden needle.

339
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,200
Don't worry, Sister Qiniang. I don't have that golden needle.

340
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,030
As for the secret book, I had already lost it.

341
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,150
Now, Attire Expert An's embroidery techniques are all inside my head.

342
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,910
If Attire Expert Zhuo wants to find it, she won't be able to.

343
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,460
Master is always suspicious.

344
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,780
Even if she doesn't find the golden needle, she will suspect

345
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,640
that you hid it.

346
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,180
She won't eliminate her wariness towards you.

347
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:41,150
Xiao Douzi, being at the Bureau of Imperial Attire, you will be in great danger.

348
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,660
You should quickly think of a way to leave this place.

349
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,200
Thank you for your reminder, but I cannot leave.

350
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,400
Other than the Bureau of Imperial Attire, I won't go anywhere else.

351
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,890
You... Why are you so stubborn?

352
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,410
Female Officer Qiniang.

353
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,050
I don't mean to startle you.

354
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:17,380
I don't have any evil intentions. Can we talk?

355
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:25,040
I know that you are Physician Dou's trusted friend.

356
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,660
Actually, you didn't know that Physician Dou and I...

357
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,310
We are also good friends.

358
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:37,170
I just learned today, that she is Attire Expert An's descendant.

359
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:40,340
Everything that he has taught me is Attire Expert An's unique skill.

360
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,470
Such precious unique embroidery skills,

361
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,600
Physician Dou has unreservedly taught me.

362
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,490
His kindness...

363
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,530
I won't let him down.

364
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:54,030
Imperial Guard Leader, you can rest assured. About Physician Dou's secrets,

365
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:57,220
I won't tell Master.

366
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:02,770
You stand firm between good and evil. Thank you on behalf of Physician Dou.

367
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,690
But even if I don't tell her,

368
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,730
my master is already suspicious of him.

369
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,870
He is in a very dangerous situation now.

370
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,820
You should convince him to leave the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

371
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,030
I have tried, but he doesn't wish to leave.

372
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,010
So I risked coming to see you.

373
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,580
I have a plan that can help him escape the danger.

374
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,640
I wonder if you are willing to help me to help Physician Dou?

375
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,680
I'm willing!

376
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,460
It's just that this plan must be kept secret from him.

377
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,510
Are you able to do that?

378
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,530
If I can help Physician Dou avoid danger, I won't tell him then.

379
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,190
Even if he hates you after,

380
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,760
are you still willing?

381
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,240
I don't know.

382
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,510
What plan is it that you are talking about?

383
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:58,290
If you don't agree, I cannot say.

384
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,110
Okay. As long as it can help him,

385
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,120
I'm willing.

386
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,780
Eunuch Sun.

387
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,440
I risked coming today,

388
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,920
because I want to ask you for a favor.

389
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,650
I don't like socializing with people.

390
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,720
I am also not someone warm-hearted.

391
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,950
It's better if you keep your mouth closed.

392
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,140
The person I'm helping is Liuli.

393
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,810
Eunuch Sun, do you not want to listen?

394
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,200
Come, come.

395
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,100
Come, take a look! Take a look!

396
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,970
[Xingyu Silk Fabrics Store]

397
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,840
You don't need to be nervous.

398
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,210
This shopkeeper doesn't know the truth.

399
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:12,600
So if Attire Expert Zhuo wants to investigate this case, there won't be anything.

400
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,790
I think this orange one is pretty nice. I would like these two.

401
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,840
Okay, here.

402
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,810
I thought you would come after some time.

403
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,840
I didn't think you'd be here so early.

404
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,190
The last time when I went shopping, I forgot to buy something.

405
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,290
So I can only come again.

406
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:36,340
You have come on time. There was someone who asked about you yesterday.

407
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,980
Inquired about me?

408
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,920
That Buddhist Master heard that the female officer from the Bureau of Imperial Attire in the palace

409
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,440
often comes to my store to make purchases, so she came here.

410
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,380
They said someone is ill and needs a large sum of money to save them.

411
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:53,060
So they were willing to part with a cherished item and asked the Buddhist Master to sell their inherited treasure.

412
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:57,370
This item is a treasure, but others don't recognize why it is precious, so it hasn't fetched a good price.

413
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,790
Only people who work at the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

414
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,760
know it is a valuable item.

415
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,130
Then you are saying...

416
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,580
Is it truly the golden needle?!

417
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,110
Yes, exactly. The person is talking about the golden needle.

418
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,380
He even gave the shopkeeper his address.

419
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,920
It is only because I came to report to you in a hurry,

420
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,490
I didn't have time to investigate.

421
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,840
Okay, good.

422
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,640
Great.

423
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,310
Yue'er.

424
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:00,620
How come it's you? It was Qiniang who asked me to come here.

425
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,170
She told me she had something important to give me.

426
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,070
It was me who asked Qiniang to call you out.

427
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,750
I do have something important to give you.

428
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,920
What is it?

429
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,510
This... Why is this in your hands?

430
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:37,490
- Unless, you are–
- That's right.

431
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,110
I am the person who brought you out of Wu Manor.

432
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:51,060
You are the person that saved me 11 years ago.

433
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,830
Thank you.

434
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,750
Thank you for keeping it for me for 11 years.

435
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:05,260
Do you know how important these are to me?

436
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:09,760
This is my mother's treasure, and also my most precious thing.

437
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,780
Although I wanted to find it, I was thinking one day

438
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,150
I might be able to find it.

439
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,760
But I really never thought...

440
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,780
I never thought this day would come so soon.

441
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,280
This is not right.

442
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,080
Golden needle... There should be

443
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,830
a golden needle that is bestowed by His Majesty to symbolize my mother's title as Number One Needle in the World.

444
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,530
Have you seen it?

445
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,240
Don't look for it anymore.

446
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,380
The golden needle isn't in there.

447
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:53,410
Where is the golden needle? Where is it?

448
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:58,730
Those years ago... I know I put the needle in there.

449
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,910
Liuli,

450
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,910
don't be impatient yet. Hear my explanation first.

451
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,850
Liuli? How do you know my real name?

452
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,760
Foster Father said

453
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,000
that you secretly investigated my mother's case.

454
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,620
This means...

455
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,230
that you knew my identity and secret long before?

456
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:27,310
That's right. I already knew.

457
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,190
I also guessed

458
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,910
that your mother died because of a false charge.

459
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,540
You risked death to go to work in the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

460
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,290
It's also to revenge against Zhuo Jinniang.

461
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:42,450
As soon as I found out about your identity, I wanted to immediately give you the golden needle and the journal.

462
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:47,210
But that day, I happened to see Zhuo Jinniang searching through your room.

463
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,160
So I changed my plan.

464
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,620
Because as soon as Attire Expert Zhuo finds out that you are related to Madam An,

465
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,450
these items

466
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,750
will bring you danger.

467
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,610
Just now, you spoke of the golden needle. This means...

468
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,760
The golden needle wasn't lost, right?

469
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,060
The golden needle indeed used to be with me.

470
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:21,740
By now, Attire Expert Zhuo must have already gotten the golden needle.

471
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,660
What are you saying?

472
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,720
For your safety,

473
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,950
it's best to temporarily give up the golden needle for now.

474
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:37,820
I am very sorry. You came late.

475
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,460
I'm not selling the golden needle anymore.

476
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:47,500
What? Buddhist Master, are you fooling me?

477
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,070
How dare I fool a female palace official?

478
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,200
Previously, I was entrusted by the owner of the golden needle

479
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,840
to sell the needle for her to treat her illness. I went to a few pawn shops.

480
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,270
They all said that the golden needle is worth only a few gold coins.

481
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:04,590
It couldn't be sold for much, and so wouldn't get enough money to treat illness.

482
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:08,590
Only then did the owner of the golden needle ask me to go into the palace to find you two.

483
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:12,940
She said only the people in the Bureau of Imperial Attire would know the origin of the golden needle,

484
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,240
and it could be sold for enough money to help treat her illness.

485
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:20,610
Unexpectedly, before you came,

486
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,610
she already died of her illness.

487
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,550
I'm telling you.

488
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,620
His Majesty bestowed it to my master, Attire Expert An.

489
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:33,490
It's a token that represents Number One Needle in the World.

490
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,590
Today,

491
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,830
it will be good if you give me

492
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,290
this needle. Otherwise,

493
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:47,300
you and your tiny Buddhist shrine

494
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,990
will never see peace.

495
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,700
Let me go!

496
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,180
I don't want to hear you explain. Since I chose to come back into the palace to get revenge,

497
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,600
I have not been afraid of death.

498
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,290
How can I be so concerned about my safety

499
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:08,380
that I give Mother's golden needle to her enemy that killed her?

500
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,510
Compared to killing me, this hurts me more!

501
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:14,490
Liuli, calm down and think about it.

502
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,920
The golden needle is an object.

503
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,500
You are weak by yourself inside the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

504
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,430
Once Zhuo Jinniang decides to kill you, even if Crown Prince and Talented Lady Wu want to save you, they would be too far away to help.

505
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:30,060
If you die, how will you avenge your mother?

506
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,880
How will your mother's grievance be exonerated?

507
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:37,440
I don't want to hear your big principles.

508
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,340
Those years ago, in order to save me,

509
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,900
Mother gave up her last hope to live.

510
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,630
And me?

511
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:52,800
In order to keep the hope to stay alive, I had to sell Mother's token

512
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,230
and sell her diginity.

513
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:59,680
To live under such shame, you might as well kill me.

514
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:05,160
I can't let Attire Expert Zhuo find mother's golden needle.

515
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,640
- No!
- Liuli, calm down.
- Let me go!

516
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,270
Liuli!

517
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:25,940
I'm sorry, Liuli. If there were a better way,

518
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,990
I wouldn't want to see you in so much pain.

519
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,850
You can hate me,

520
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,450
but you must live on.

521
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,610
As long as you live,

522
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:48,520
there will be hope.

[Liuli's Memorial Tablet]

524
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,240
[Liuli's Memorial Tablet]

525
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:38,920
[Liuli's Memorial Tablet]

526
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,500
[Liuli's Memorial Tablet]

527
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,920
Yes.

528
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,870
Yes.

529
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,740
This is it! I've found it.

530
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,160
It is the one!

531
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,800
I've looked for you for ten years.

532
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:46,470
This is the golden needle that represents the status of the Number One Needle in the World.

533
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,590
I've finally found it!

534
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:58,290
It should be mine. It's finally mine.

535
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:04,260
Sooner or later, it is mine.

536
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,700
That Buddhist Master can be trusted.

537
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,840
I saved her life a few years ago, so she will do her utmost to help us.

538
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,290
Once this is over, I will send the Buddhist Master away from this troublesome land

539
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,700
to guarantee her safety.

540
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,000
Buddhist Master,

541
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,600
what is your relationship with this Liuli

542
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,740
that you are so considerate for her

543
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,800
and set up a memorial table for her?

544
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,800
Eleven years ago, in the early morning,

545
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,970
I opened the shrine's door

546
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:57,590
and saw a young girl lying sick in front of the door.

547
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:05,480
She was covered in blood, with a high fever that wouldn't recede and she was unconscious.

548
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:11,350
I pitied her and kept her in the shrine to let her get better from her illness.

549
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:14,820
This child said her name was Liuli.

550
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,640
She survived by climbing out of a mound of dead bodies.

551
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:23,730
When I asked more, she wouldn't say a word.

552
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:28,530
Most of the time through these years, she was in bed

553
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,970
and stayed alive by drinking medicinal soup.

554
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:37,790
You've seen it, too. My shrine is impoverished.

555
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:40,620
I really didn't have money to buy more medicine.

556
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:46,300
Liuli gave me the golden needle and said it was a treasure that could be exchanged for money to treat her illness.

557
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,720
But before the golden needle could be sold,

558
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,830
she already passed away.

559
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:58,590
Buddhist Master, among Liuli's remaining items,

560
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:01,870
did you see a journal of dressmaking secrets?
