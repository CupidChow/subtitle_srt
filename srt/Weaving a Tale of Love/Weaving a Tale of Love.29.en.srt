[Weaving a Tale of Love]

3
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,940
[Episode 29]

4
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,080
Who is so bold

5
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,710
as to dare wear a cape in front of His Majesty?

6
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,900
The person is Talented Lady Wu.

7
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,980
However, this hexagram for Your Majesty is indeed very dangerous.

8
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:49,210
Fortunately, Talented Lady Wu is full of sincerety, has shaved her hair to follow Buddha,

9
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,380
and also offered her blood to induce the medicine.

10
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,460
That's how I was able to refine the elixir to offer to Your Majesty.

11
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,870
I plea to Your Majesty to permit me to enter Ganye Temple

12
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,840
for Your Majesty and for Great Tang.

13
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,320
I am willing to abide by my oath

14
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,050
to take refuge in religious life

15
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,110
and leave the mortal life of worldly riches.

16
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,310
I only wish for Great Tang to prosper for the millennium

17
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,090
and Your Majesty can continue to benefit for hundreds of years.

18
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,990
Enter the world of emptiness with a void that is as deep as the four seas.

19
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,750
Meiniang becomes a female monk,

20
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,700
so she will leave all the ties in the mortal life.

21
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,950
Not to mention becoming a female monarch,

22
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,900
she won't even be able to

23
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,280
live as an ordinary woman.

24
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,090
Meiniang,

25
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,850
you are still young

26
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,280
and will stay by Buddha for the rest of your life.

27
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,740
Will you really not regret this?

28
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,180
I shaved my head already in order to show my sincerity to Your Majesty.

29
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,050
To be able to live my life for Your Majesty,

30
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,570
for Great Tang,

31
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:30,010
it's my great honor. I shall not regret it.

32
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,040
All right.

33
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,410
From today now on

34
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,920
you will cultivate inside your Hall of Sunset Pool.

35
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,510
Pray for me. Pray for Great Tang.

36
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,640
As for Ganye Temple, didn't Sir Xuan Ling say

37
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,720
that I still have several dozens of mortal lives?

38
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,760
Once I pass on, you can still go there.

39
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,200
This concubine accepts the decree and thanks Your Majesty's grace.

40
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:24,330
Smart Wu Meiniang! You actually thought of a way to save your life.

41
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,130
So what if you temporarily stay alive?

42
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,330
Once I sit on the throne,

43
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,690
I will still kill you.

44
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,760
Let's go.

45
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,290
What happened? Sister Wu enters Buddhist life.

46
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,650
Isn't her life ruined then?

47
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,170
How should I help her? Can I help her?

48
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,400
Who is that? What are you doing?

49
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,890
Open the door!

50
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,990
Let me out! Open the door!

51
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,910
Open the door!

52
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,830
A'Bi, I saw you.

53
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,750
Open the door!

54
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,390
Xiao Douzi, if you win the competition again,

55
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,560
not only will Qiniang get doomed with you,

56
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,320
I will get doomed, too.

57
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,170
Everyone in the Bureau of Imperial Attire will be doomed along with you.

58
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,830
What kind of person is Attire Expert Zhuo? Don't you think

59
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,700
if you let her get such a huge embarrassment,

60
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,790
she definitely won't let you go.

61
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,600
Don't worry. Once the competition is over, I will let you out.

62
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,650
I-I'm doing this for your sake, too.

63
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,680
You–

64
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,870
A'Bi, the competition is about to start.

65
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,210
Hurry and open the door. Open the door!

66
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't leave! Let me out!

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,690
[Bureau of Imperial Attire]

68
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,680
Good brother, do you hear any sound?

69
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,020
I don't hear anything.

70
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,550
I must be too worried about Liuli.

71
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,520
That's why I feel suspicious about everything.

72
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,700
It's fine. We can go.

73
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,880
What's going on?

74
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,380
Why isn't he here yet?

75
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,350
How can this be?

76
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,070
Attire Chief Lin, why hasn't Xiao Douzi come yet?

77
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:05,170
Grand Consorts, Xiao Douzi was originally a physician working as a sanitation medical officer in the Courtyard of Misfortune.

78
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:09,400
His status is lowly and has never followed rules.

79
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,140
Now that Attire Chief Lin supports him

80
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,870
and set a precedent by letting him overstep to compete with me,

81
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,960
who would have guessed that Xiao Douzi would become even more arrogant.

82
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,170
He would even look down at you two grand consorts and make you wait for him.

83
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,030
How is this adherence to etiquette?

84
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,760
As I see it,

85
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,710
we should cancel her eligibility to compete

86
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,500
as a warning and punishment.

87
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,470
Attire Chief Lin, what do you think?

88
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,060
Canceling Xiao Douzi's eligibility to compete

89
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,330
is a good solution.

90
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,080
It's just that if we do this, Attire Expert Zhuo

91
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,590
will actually suffer a loss.

92
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,680
Oh? What do you mean?

93
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,060
Attire Expert Zhuo should be winning based on her skills.

94
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,400
If she wins without competing,

95
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,410
there will definitely be people criticizing her for winning without fighting.

96
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,010
That makes sense.

97
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,580
Attire Expert Zhuo, what do you think?

98
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,330
This servant will abide by the two grand consorts' decision.

99
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,370
Hurry and get someone to rush him then.

100
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,800
I will go rush him.

101
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,280
Wait. A'Bi is faster.

102
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,110
It's better for A'Bi to go.

103
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,800
Yes.

104
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,390
Someone help me, please!

105
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,320
Who is here to help me?

106
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,650
Quickly open the door!

107
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,650
I beg you, quickly let me out!

108
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,780
Let me out!

109
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,910
[Bureau of Imperial Attire]

110
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,200
Why is she coming back alone?

111
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,470
Where is Xiao Douzi?

112
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,470
A'Bi, why is it only you who came back?

113
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,100
Where is Xiao Duozi?

114
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,420
Attire Chief, I went to look,

115
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,640
but couldn't find him.

116
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,830
This Xiao Douzi is too unruly.

117
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,460
This is out of order.

118
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,700
I think Xiao Douzi is probably afraid of losing,

119
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,360
so he is hiding and not coming.

120
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,780
Since Xiao Douzi forfeits, this round's winner is Attire Expert Zhuo then.

121
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,790
Thank you, Grand Consorts, for your wise decision.

122
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,720
The competition is based on two wins out of three rounds.

123
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,620
Two rounds have completed.

124
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,660
Attire Chief Lin, is the final win decided already?

125
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,550
Grand Consorts,

126
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,610
in the first round,

127
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,640
Xiao Douzi was the winner.

128
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,590
Xiao Douzi?

129
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,870
Why did he win?

130
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,500
Xiao Douzi?

131
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,900
So the current score is one to one; even.

132
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,340
To know the final winner,

133
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,210
the third round must be completed.

134
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,690
That beautiful and elegant shoulder wrap of rosy dawn

135
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,390
was dyed by Xiao Douzi?

136
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,480
- Yes.
- We thought that shoulder wrap of rosy dawn

137
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,190
must have come from Attire Expert Zhuo.

138
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,860
It seems that we were mistaken.

139
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,750
That's so unexpected that Xiao Douzi would be so skilled at such a young age.

140
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,030
As it is then, I am really anxiously awaiting

141
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,550
the third round then.

142
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,820
Grand Consorts, please name the topic for the third round.

143
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,040
The third round will compete on

144
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,270
embroidering the dragon robe.

145
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,630
What? Embroidering the dragon robe?

146
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,040
It's so difficult.

147
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,940
Embroidering the dragon robe?

148
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,930
- That's so difficult.
- Right.

149
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,590
Since Xiao Douzi has strong skills,

150
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:29,260
then it doesn't seem that he didn't show up out of fearing losing today.

151
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,830
Attire Chief Lin, you must find out clearly.

152
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,930
If this happens again, then he must be punished.

153
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,490
- Yes.
- Once you find Xiao Douzi,

154
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,270
bring the dresses made by Xiao Douzi and Attire Chief Zhuo

155
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,260
to show us.

156
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,540
I am very curious about it.

157
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,170
Yes.

158
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,280
Respectfully sending off Consort Dowager

159
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,300
Xiao Douzi is inexperienced,

160
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,300
so she has never embroidered the dragon robe. This topic isn't fair.

161
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,600
Are you siding with Xiao Douzi?

162
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,400
If Xiao Douzi can win in a counterattack,

163
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,500
then we will all have the chance to reach the sky in the future.

164
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,950
I came to bid farewell with Your Highness.

165
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,200
Starting tomorrow,

166
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,300
I will abide by decree to cultivate in solitude in the Hall of Sunset Pool.

167
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,400
I will not interfere in mortal affairs.

168
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,600
I heard Chief Eunuch Gao say that

169
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,100
His Majesty's condition has greatly improved.

170
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,940
Why is Talented Lady Wu in such a hurry to accept the decree to cultivate?

171
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,200
Sir Xuan Ling's elixir

172
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,200
can only let His Majesty momentarily increase his vitality

173
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,200
and improve his energy. His illness appears to improve,

174
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,600
but the root of the illness isn't cured.

175
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,200
To say it disrespectfully,

176
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,500
His Majesty's illness can't be cured even if an immortal comes to help.

177
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,800
Once His Majesty's illness returns,

178
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,300
I probably won't even be able to keep my life.

179
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,800
Your Highness, when I start cultivating in solitude,

180
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,200
I still worry about you the most.

181
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,200
I worry that your situation will become even more dangerous.

182
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
His Majesty doesn't have much time left.

183
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,400
Prince of Cao will definitely find ways to block Your Highness from successfully ascending the throne.

184
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,100
You must be careful and protect yourself, Your Highness.

185
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,700
You must not let Prince of Cao get his way.

186
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,520
You've already reached this stage,

187
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,210
but you are still worried about my safety.

188
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,400
Talented Lady Wu, you are still in your prime but must shave your head to become a female monk

189
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,000
and enter religioius life?

190
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,600
Your Highness, you need not fault yourself.

191
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,000
Thanks to Pei Xingjian's advice,

192
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,800
it's already fortunate that I can stay alive.

193
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Besides, I couldn't bear children for His Majesty.

194
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,200
Sooner or later I would have had to shave my head and become a female monk.

195
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,000
Once His Majesty passes on,

196
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,200
I will eventually have to enter Ganye Temple.

197
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,200
If I, Li Zhi, can ascend the imperial throne one day,

198
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I will bring you back from Ganye Temple.

199
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,000
Really?

200
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,500
Yes.

201
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,600
To be able to hear this from Crown Prince,

202
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,700
I have not wasted my life. It's enough.

203
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,200
Sister Yu Liu, is Talented Lady Wu really going to cultivate in solitude?

204
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,200
You've come at the right time. I was just about to find you at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

205
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,900
Talented Lady Wu, you...

206
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,400
You have really shaved.

207
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,200
From now on, you can call me Sister Wu again.

208
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,400
Sister Wu, I don't want you to shave your head.

209
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,600
If you are locked up in this Hall of Sunset Pool

210
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,600
and never enter mortal life again, I will be

211
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,400
even more lonely in the palace.

212
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,200
Liuli, have you

213
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,000
thought of staying by my side?

214
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,400
Come here?

215
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,800
Yes, come to the Hall of Sunset Pool.

216
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,400
Stay away from the squabbles in the palace

217
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,500
and never worry about anyone hurting you.

218
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,200
I am accepting His Majesty's decree to cultivate in solitude.

219
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,800
It's still possible to get someone here.

220
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,000
From now on, this Hall of Sunset Pool

221
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,900
will be a pure land that is far from the maddening world.

222
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,790
When I find an opportunity, I will send you out of the palace.

223
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,000
You will be able to life a carefree life,

224
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,200
and never worry about anyone harming you.

225
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,550
Sister Wu has encountered a calamity,

226
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,400
but you are still thinking and planning for me.

227
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,700
I will remember your grace.

228
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,900
It's just that... Mother's golden needle is in sight.

229
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,600
I cannot leave just like this.

230
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,000
I will defeat Zhuo Jinniang,

231
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,800
snatch back Mother's Number One Needle in the World,

232
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,600
vindicate Mother, and avenge Mother.

233
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:01,000
Liuli, this is your one chance to leave the palace. You must think clearly.

234
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,200
To be honest, shaving my head to become a monk

235
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,600
and staying by Buddha wasn't my original intent.

236
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,300
However, I must do it in order to stay alive.

237
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,800
Liuli, even if you defeat Zhuo Jinniang, so what then?

238
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,900
Just defeating Zhuo Jinniang won't exonerate your mother.

239
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Sister Wu,

240
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,100
if I escape from the palace, I will only be able to live with grievances.

241
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:38,200
Those years ago, didn't Mother also compromise to leave the palace?

242
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,800
She hid her identity and only wished to live a regular person's life.

243
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:49,200
But the result? The tree wants to rest but the wind won't stop blowing.

244
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,600
Even though Mother escaped from the palace,

245
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,400
she couldn't escape from a fate in which she was harmed by schemers.

246
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,200
Therefore, I understood something.

247
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,000
Only when I challenge evil people and defeat them,

248
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
that's the best protection I can give myself.

249
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,700
I am not only avenging for Mother,

250
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,400
I am also eliminating evil for the people.

251
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,000
In that case, I will pray for you daily

252
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,300
in the Hall of Sunset Pool.

253
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,400
You should also take good care.

254
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,100
We will let fate allow us to meet again.

255
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,100
I embroidered this sachet myself.

256
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,000
There are some herbs inside.

257
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The fragrance will prevent filth and keep your spirit alert.

258
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,600
I'll gift it to Sister Wu to remember me.

259

[Safe and Sound]

260
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,000
This is the word "Fortune" embroidered by combining the two words, "safe" and "sound."

261
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,500
You are really ingenious and crafty.

262
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,200
The journey that I've taken to be here today,

263
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,000
all I ask for is no more than being safe and sound.

264
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:22,610

[Hall of Morning Sun]

283
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:47,320
Attire Expert's dress is elegant and not ordinary. It makes people set their eyes on it.

284
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,670
It really is a work of labor.

285
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:54,620
But I don't know why, but Xiao Douzi's plain dress,

286
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,850
I like it more.

287
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,800
I didn't think with the red shawl

288
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,220
it can also make this type of elegant feel.

289
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,140
If I were to wear this dress, it would capture the public's attention more.

290
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,010
At the same time, it can show the person who wears it their inner self.

291
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,320
Compared to Attire Expert Zhuo's brocade with flourishing blooming flowers,

292
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,630
Xiao Douzi really is better.

293
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,540
Why would it be like this? The dress Xiao Douzi is rushing to make

294
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,560
is actually a simple dress that beats a complex one.

295
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,730
Then he was making it a show for me, so I would make mistakes.

296
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,420
Xiao Douzi, why were you absent from the competition today?

297
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,460
And why couldn't we find you?

298
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,680
Why don't you hurry and explain everything to the two grand consorts?

299
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,410
The topic given by the two grand consorts appears to be simple.

300
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,330
I kept thinking about what the people I was sewing the clothes for were thinking.

301
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,070
I thought really hard till I thought

302
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,980
that this plain dress with the red shawl

303
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,820
can only be so that one doesn't steal attention from the other.

304
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,650
It has the primary and the secondary, tension and relaxation. It suits either simplicity or extravagance.

305
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:06,170
This suits rich people's daily outfits.

306
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,530
Who told you to say this?

307
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:16,310
Both Grand Consorts came to the Bureau of Imperial Attire to host the competition.

308
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,520
It is our Bureau of Imperial Attire's luck.

309
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,560
But this Xiao Douzi dares to look down on Your Highnesses.

310
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,290
He dares to be absent from the competition.

311
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,430
If Xiao Douzi speaks about being locked inside her room,

312
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,890
I am not sure if she will believe me or him.

313
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:41,760
No matter what, I cannot give in and lose this competition.

314
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,020
I have already lost in this competition.

315
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,150
If I tell the matter of A'Bi locking me in my room,

316
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,530
Zhuo Jinniang can also make it seem she has nothing to do with it.

317
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:53,220
I have no evidence. Not only can I not get justice,

318
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,360
I might even have the suspicion of framing Zhuo Jinniang.

319
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,710
Replying to the two Grand Consorts,

320
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,980
I knew the difficulty of the problem, so I thought much.

321
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,670
Only until late last night, I thought of this idea.

322
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:09,930
I rushed to sew this dress in time. Yet because I was so tired,

323
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:13,640
when I rushed to the competition, I fainted. The place is far.

324
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,800
No one noticed, so I delayed the competition.

325
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,400
Mouth full of lies! Last night he already...

326
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,500
Attire Expert Zhuo, I believe what Xiao Douzi is saying is the truth.

327
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,150
If it is like so, he has no reason to give up on the competition.

328
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:31,360
Giving this win to others.

329
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,870
Since it is like so, it is worth thinking about.

330
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,780
Now, you both have won a round.

331
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,270
You two are tied for now.

332
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,240
After, prepare to

333
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,350
sew an imperial robe to make out who wins.

334
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,220
- Yes.
- Yes.

335
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,720
That beautiful wrap of rosy dawn

336
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,420
was dyed by Xiao Douzi?

337
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,090
We thought the wrap of rosy dawn

338
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,370
was from Attire Expert Zhuo.

339
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:34,030
It looks like we mistook it.

340
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:38,960
I really can't believe Xiao Douzi is so young and has so many skills.

341
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,950
Now that I see it, I am looking forward to the third round.

342
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,080
Compared to Attire Expert Zhou's brocade with flourishing bloom,

343
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,240
Xiao Douzi's really is better.

344
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,750
Attire Expert Zhuo.

345
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,430
Come, come, hurry.

346
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:14,840
Hurry. Help me remove this dragon's claw.

347
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,040
Master, this dragon claw is sewn well.

348
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,890
Why do you have to remove it?

349
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:26,860
Good, good, good! Every time I ask you, you only know to say good.

350
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,590
It made me careless.

351
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,730
Making Xiao Douzi take advantage.

352
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:36,370
This time, I have to do my best

353
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:39,940
to make a perfect dragon robe.

354
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,030
Why are you still standing? Hurry up and help me remove it!

355
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,830
Yes.

356
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:02,480
Right, do you know where Xiao Douzi is sewing?

357
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,030
I heard that Attire Chief Lin arranged a sewing room for him.

358
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,610
What?

359
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,620
H-He... What status is he?

360
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,860
Why can he get his own sewing room?!

361
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:16,020
Unless, does he want to be equal with me?!

362
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,400
What's with her?

363
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,860
Xiao Douzi...

364
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,190
Yes.

365
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,900
Then, what now?

366
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,730
What is going on?

367
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:37,000
You shouldn't be too close to me in front of others.

368
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,220
You will also have trouble.

369
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,810
Just him?

370
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,090
Is it possible?

371
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,950
Who do you think will win between those two?

372
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:59,760
In my opinion, it isn't bad that Xiao Douzi can win.

373
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,780
What sewing skill is this?

374
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,860
It can actually make the azure dragon look so alive

375
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,940

If this goes on, there is no doubt I will lose.

379
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,860
No, I cannot lose.

380
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,960

Sister Qiniang,

392
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,780
have you come to terms with Attire Expert Zhuo?

393
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,130
What do you mean by this?

394
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:52,090
These few days, I haven't seen Attire Expert Zhuo's actions. She hasn't told me anything.

395
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:55,930
Unless you are afraid I will steal your status,

396
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,800
so you said bad things about me in front of Attire Expert Zhuo?

397
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,520
This means you have also not seen Teacher in two days?

398
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,100
These few days, not only have I not seen Attire Expert Zhuo,

399
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,520
even Xiao Douzi I haven't seen.

400
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,350
Do you know where Xiao Douzi is?

401
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,250
Sister Qiniang, this is tiring.

402
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,600
Tasks like bringing meals, I should do.

403
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,630
But... I don't know where Master is.

404
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,350
I will give it to her.

405
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,310
Then thank you.

406
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,760
Sister Qiniang, you still haven't told me where Attire Expert Zhuo is!

407
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,390
I also don't know where Master is. You look for her.

408
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,100
I have already looked for two days.

409
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,150
Since Master looks so highly on you, you should serve her well.

410
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:57,170
Sister Qiniang must know where Attire Expert Zhuo is.

00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,780
She is just afraid I will steal her spot.

412
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,450
So she doesn't tell me on purpose.

00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,800

417
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,100
I advise you to be more clever.

419
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,100
then help me finish sewing my imperial robe.

420
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,700
Attire Expert Zhuo, you want me to sew the dragon robe in front of you,

421
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,600
you just want to learn my skills.

422
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,900
So what! You are about to die and you are still trying to be smart!

423
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,400
You know you are not as good as me. You should admit defeat.

424
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,200
Why are you so shamless and despicable?

425
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,200

427
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,000

428
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,200

there never was a win or lose concluded by skills.

432
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,200
Her sewing skills

433
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,400
were the best in the world

434
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,300
But in the end, what could she do?

435
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,100
The person who manages the Bureau of Imperial Attire is me.

436
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:17,500
The title "Number One Needle in the World" will also be me.

437
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,300
And Madam An, when everyone envied her,

438
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:27,000
she was only a criminal who died!

439
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:33,000

This dragon robe, are you going to sew or not sew!

448
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,000
A wise man knows when to retreat. I will sew it!

449
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,140

453
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,200
Only when I eat well, can I sew pretty.

454
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,200
So, I want to eat lamb ribs, roasted chicken, and osmanthus cake.

455
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,200
Anyway, anything that is good, bring it all to me! You cannot miss one thing!

456
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,400
Sure. How hard is this?

457
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,300
Also, when I am working, I hate when there are people interrupting on the side.
