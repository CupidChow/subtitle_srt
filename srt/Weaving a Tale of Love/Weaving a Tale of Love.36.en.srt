00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,050
[Episode 36]

4
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,050
Why is your hand so cold?

5
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,990
Servants! Servants!

6
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,610
Replying to His Highness. The reason Liuli is still unconscious and very cold

7
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,130
is that she has developed a drug dependency.

8
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,820
Taking this drug long term

9
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,100
can affect her health severely and make her disabled.

10
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,840
She must have become aware of that,

11
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,890
so she tried to resist the pain caused by drug addiction and cut off the drugs.

12
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,170
But cutting off drugs is easier said than done.

13
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,170
She is now in excruciating pain and fell into a coma.

14
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,730
It can get even worse.

15
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,760
Leading even to...

16
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,480
Imperial Physician Jiang... I have already understood the gravity of the situation.

17
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,150
Liuli's drug addiction is the result of falling victim to the evil scheme of malefactors.

18
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,780
Since we now know what the cause of her disease is, what method do you have to cure it?

19
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,520
Your Higness, my decoction...

20
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,290
could only temporarily ameliorate the pain triggered by the drug addiction

21
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,560
and help her gain more strength.

22
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,900
As for curing the poisonous effects of the drug...

23
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,900
I am afraid... we should look for an expert in pharmaceuticals.

24
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,890
You two are the heads of the imperial physicians.

25
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,840
You mean you can't find a cure for her?

26
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,350
Pardon our offense, Your Highness!

27
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,790
The drug Liuli has taken was created by a master hand.

28
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,490
Your ignorant servants have never seen such a thing!

29
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,910
Come. Be careful!

30
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,060
Pay attention to your steps!

31
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,090
Your Highness, the Old Medicine Master wants to see you.

32
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,950
My entire body is full of sins and guilt!

33
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,410
Pardon my offense, Your Highness!

34
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,510
Come! Elder! Elder!

35
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,310
I heard Shouyue saying

36
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,990
you have pure intentions. You empathize with common people.

37
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,680
Even though the sycophants within the court tried to coerce you, you have never turned against His Majesty.

38
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,840
I am thanking you on his behalf.

39
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,100
I am asking you to express your good intentions by curing Liuli.

40
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,020
Old Medicine Master, please save Liuli's life!

41
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,750
You are her only hope!

42
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,460
The dying cannot be cured.

43
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,000
I will use the skills I have gained throughout my entire living

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,410
to find a cure for her.

45
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,180
This way I will atone for my misdeeds!

46
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,400
- Just that...
- Just that what?

47
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,000
Old Medicine Master, if you have any demand, just say it!

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,660
Just that... I need a rare ingredient.

49
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,600
The cane growing in the Thunder God Precipice.

50
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,180
I have seen this ingredient only in medicine books.

51
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,180
I have never seen it in person.

52
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,600
According to the recordings, the cane of the Thunder God Precipice

53
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,840
grows in a strange and precipitous place.

54
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,390
If we can find it,

55
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:46,230
Liuli might have a chance to live.

56
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,950
Please describe the appearance of this cane to me.

57
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,750
I am worthless, yet I want to go and look for it!

58
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,590
If there is any hope, I want to have a try!

59
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,260
I am asking for the permission of the crown prince so I can exit the palace and go search for it!

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,290
- Your Highness!
- What happened, A'Sheng? You look flustered.

61
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,420
Pay attention to your steps!

62
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,580
- What happened?
- Your Highness, I have just returned from the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

63
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,390
The person who was in charge of attending Pu Banu came with a report.

64
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,530
Pu Banu...

65
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,160
died after cutting off drugs.

66
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,660
How could this happen that fast?

67
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,300
Your Highness, Pu Banu used to practice martial arts.

68
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,830
He had a stronger physique than most people.

69
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,530
Once she stops the drug and the addiction comes,

70
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,380
it'll be more serious than ordinary people for sure.

71
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,850
Liuli started after she got seriously injured

72
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,870
to eat this drug.

73
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,610
In order to cure her, the amount eaten was much greater.

74
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,000
In comparison to Pu Banu, it is not much better.

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,270
If we can't find the cane of the Thunder God Precipice right away,

76
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,730
I am afraid she won't be able to endure it anymore.

77
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,830
Your Highness, please let me exit the palace to go find this medicine!

78
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,770
Shouyue, I am handing you over Liuli's hope.

79
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,750

What's wrong with you today?

82
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,990
Why are you always laughing at me?

83
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,000
What?  I did not, Your  Highness!

Treat her well!

87
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,940
I have just remembered that once Xiao Douzi almost got killed by the Prince of Cao's people.

88
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,320
After you knew, your heart shattered like ashes, you just wanted to see Xiao Douzi,

89
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,690
but you thought it would not be right, so you asked me to bring Xiao Douzi to the East Palace.

90
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:48,390
Then it caused Xiao Douzi to stand outside for half a day.

91

178
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,700
It has protected me to go through each obstacle.

179
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,630
Now,

180
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,040
I will give it to you.

181
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,120
I will cherish this sachet well.

182

intended to climb up by overstepping boundaries to make the pheasant robe for the empress

to appease Consort Yang. Attire Expert An

189
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,790

00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,250
agreed to make alterations to the gown while being aware of violating imperial rites.

192
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,740
However, the wrongdoing was exposed.

193
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,260
His Majesty was angry. To protect themselves, Lin and Zhuo

194
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,280
had framed Madam An.

195
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,110
The mother and daughter were separated. This is not fair.

196
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,910

for about ten years, to console her mother's aggrieved spirit

and find the criminal's crimes.

202
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,270
She already has evidence. It is irrefutable proof.

203
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,060
The crime is confirmed and cannot be forgiven.

204
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,210
Now, we are taking Lin and Zhuo to the palace jail

205

209

No. Impossible!

How could Xiao Douzi be a female?

211
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,890
You must be joking with me. This is not possible!

212
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,060
How could Xiao Douzi be Madam An's daughter?

213
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,520
Madam An's daughter, Liuli, has already died.

214

Impossible!

- I accept.

- Take her out!
- Liuli has already died!

00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,380
She died over a decade ago!

222
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,830
It is impossible that Xiao Douzi is Liuli.

00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,720
Liuli has already died!

00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,330

Xiao Tan, why are you here?

229
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,020
I just heard from the folks

230
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,480
that the crown prince is having a retrial on Siniang's case.

231
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,390
The Court of Judicial Review is giving a retrial on Siniang's unjust case?

232
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,430
Liuli. It muse be Liuli.

233
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,030
Yes. It must be Liuli.

234
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,860
Liuli has said that she would help reverse Attire Expert An's verdict for revenge.

235
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,810
She really did it!

236
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:23,340
Sir's niece, Liuli, really is alive?

237
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:28,110
This means that the hearsay is only 80-90% real.

238
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,500
What hearsay?

239
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,200
They said Liuli not only did not die,

00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,030
she is also this case's important figure.

But what? Hurry up and say!

But... Liuli is greatly injured and is unconscious.

244
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,300
So the case can only be on hold,

245
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,320
to wait to when Liuli wakes up and can accuse the guilty.

246
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,140
Liuli has been greatly injured?!

247
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,610
It must be. Or else such happy news,

00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:41,960
I know that it's difficult for you.

257
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,700
But if I don't say it now,

258
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:48,610
it will be too late in the future.

259
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,410
I am willing to give 14th Younger Brother another chance.

260
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,920
As long as he behaves going forward,

261
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,370
I will keep him alive.

262
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,660

Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

Zhi'er, you are kind and compassionate.

268
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,960
I have assessed you correctly.

269
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,200
Even though your 14th younger brother is the Prince of Cao,

270
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,940
but because his mother's status is unique,

271
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,560
he has suffered as a result

272
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,970
and felt a sense of unfairness.

273
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,780
This is his fate.

274
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,210
It's also what I owe to him and his mother.

I know that it's because of respecting me

that you are sparing Ming'er.

for the sake of Great Tang's safety, you won't need to be soft on him.

00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,570
how is Liuli's condition?

289
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,410
The palace maid who is taking care of Liuli said that Liuli woke up for a bit yesterday but was unconscious soon after.

290
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:57,370
The Old Medicine Master said that this is the sign that the poison has attacked the heart and the veins.

291
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:01,270
The only method now is to keep feeding her the poisonous drug to extend some time for her.

292
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:04,750
What? Keep feeding her the poisonous drug?

293
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,120
Yes. The Old Medicine Master said,

294
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,900
this is the only way to keep Liuli alive for now.

295
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,170
This method is too risky. He doesn't dare to make the decision by himself.

296
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,910
He's asking for Your Highness's opinion.

297
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,620
He is gambling

298
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,590
to see whether the poisonous pill will work faster or Pei Xingjian will come back sooner.

299
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:28,160
Then... what does Your Highness decide?

300
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,140
Yes.

You are the only person that I can rely on now.

Eunuch Wang, please be generous and let us enter and see Liuli.

304
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:02,800
Eunuch Sun, you are like a father to Liuli. I understand how you feel.

305
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,640
But Liuli has been unconscious all this time.

306
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,380
Even if you go in, you still can't talk with her.

307
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,400
Even though we can't talk, just let us take a look.

308
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,980
Please allow us this favor, Eunuch Wang.

309
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,690
Eunuch Sun, it's not that I'm deliberately making it difficult for you.

310
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:20,010
It's really not very convenient.

311
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:25,030
Eunuch Wang, why is that?

312
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:32,540
To be honest, His Highness has transferred Liuli to his inner palace's sleeping quarters.

313
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:36,530
It's where His Highness's consorts live. Other than the maidservants and imperial physicians,

314
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:40,260
outsiders cannot easily go in to visit.

315
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,490
Even though Liuli is meritorious in saving His Highness, but she is just a palace maid.

316
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:47,400
It's a violation of palace rules for her to be sick and live in the palace.

317
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,850
It's thanks to His Highness for this exception to get this permission

318
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:55,560
and even receive treatments by the imperial physicians. But to stay in His Highness's inner palace,

319
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,420
how is this proper?

320
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,590
Xiao Shunzi is right, Eunuch Wang. His Highness is kind to Liuli

321
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:05,370
but Liuli is just a palace maid. His Highness treats Liuli so well,

322
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,650
I'm afraid it will just raise jealousy against her. Later, if she is caught in any mistake,

323
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,320
she will still be the one who suffers.

324
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,020
How about...

325
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,600
How about if Eunuch Wang reports to His Highness and lets Liuli

326
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,030
go back to the Courtyard of Misfortune to recuperate? What do you think?

327
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,330
Eunuch Sun, you are Liuli's foster father, so I'll tell you this.

328
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,250
His Highness has his own wishes.

329
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,480
Eunuch Wang, you mean...

330
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,260
If Liuli weren't still sick, His Highness probably would have already issued a decree.

331
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:48,400
Liuli's status would be noble by now.

332
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,460
You should rest assured and go back.

333
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,810
Liuli has palace maids serving her. She is getting the best food and clothing.

334
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:01,760
There is also Old Medicine Master from the past to treat Liuli.

335
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,920
His Highness is so concerned about Liuli that he visits her daily.

336
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,350
All we need now is for Pei Xingjian to return with the miracle medicine to cure her.

337
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:14,480
You can just be at ease. Go back and wait for the good news.

His Highness the Crown Prince will take Liuli as his consort.

00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,900
Then... What about Pei Xingjian?

343
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,510
As I see it, Liuli only has feelings

344
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,890
for Pei Xingjian.

345
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:58,570

She can't tell His Highness what she wants.

350
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,590
Pei Xingjian. Pei Xingjian.

351
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,180
Pei Xingjian!

352
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,720
What's wrong?

353
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,160
Is Liuli getting better?

354
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,860
Leave then.

355
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,490
So clumsy.

356
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,660
Pei Xingjian.

357
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,420
Pei Xingjian. Pei Xinjian...

358
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,550
Pei Xinjian.

359
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,340
A'Sheng.

360
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,230
- Your Highness.
- How is Liuli?

361
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,030
Replying to Your Highness.

362
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:33,800
Liuli is still not improving just like before.

363
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,350
A'Sheng, what is the status of what I asked you to check?

364
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,100
Replying to Your Highness. I've already checked clearly.

365
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:00,170
Liuli's father is surnamed Kudi, and the Kudi family used to be a prosperous clan.

366
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:04,210
It's been declining in recent years. Liuli's father is named Kudi Yanzhong.

367
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,960
He has been staying at home for many years.

368
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,010
That's why he married Attire Expert An as his official wife those years ago.

369
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,630
Attire Expert An used to be a female official in the palace.

370
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:17,620
She was also bestowed as Number One Needle in the World. Why would she consider Kudi Yanzhong?

371
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,230
Your Highness, Attire Expert An was a Hu woman.

372
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:29,450
Therefore, Liuli is half Hu.

373
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,690
Her father isn't an official.

374
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,200
If I want to properly keep her by my side

375
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,290
and confer her with consort or concubine,

376
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,240
it will probably be difficult.

377
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:46,480
It seems that I need to do something for Kudi Yanzhong soon.

378
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,490
Pei Xingjian...

379
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,740
Pei Xingjian...

380
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,450
A'Sheng.

381
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,780
Your Highness, forgive me. I also heard it just now

382
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,130
that Liuli is calling for Pei Xingjian in her unconscious state.

383
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:17,150
I am also surprised, but then I remembered that Liuli and Pei Xingjian

384
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:21,020
used to help each other to save Your Highness from peril, so they were already close friends.

385
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,710
Liuli knows that Pei Xingjian left the palace to search for medicine for her.

386
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,430
For her to think about him, it is also...

387
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:29,000
Liuli knows that Pei Xingjian left the palace to search for medicine for her?

388
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:33,730
Yes. Before Pei Xingjian left the palace, he came here to visit Liuli.

389
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,840
Liuli woke up once, and it was at that time.

390
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,670
I've seen this jade somewhere.

391
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,070
This is Young Master Pei.

392
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,990
Your Highness, you don't need to worry.

393
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:34,510
Pei Xingjian already has a sweetheart.

394
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:39,500
When he was hurt by Pu Banu in the martial arts competition, I was serving by his side.

395
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,690
Pei Xingjian kept calling for a woman named Yu'er.

396
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:48,340
I think Yu'er must be Pei Xingjian's sweetheart.

397
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,990
- A'Sheng.
- Present.

398
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,050
Investigate clearly right away.

399
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,590
When Liuli escaped from the palace last time,

400
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,400
did she go around as a man or as a woman?

401
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,850
What was the name she used?

402
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,690
Yes, yes, I'll go investigate right away.

403
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,490
A'Sheng.

404
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,810
Your Highness.

405
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,840
No need to investigate anymore.

406
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,600
Yes.

407
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,620
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

408
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,480
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

409
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,490
Greetings, Your Highness.

410
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:09,850
Imperial Physician Jiang, are you here to take His Majesty's pulse?

411
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:12,710
Replying to Your Highness, yes, indeed.

412
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,790
How was His Majesty's sleep last night?

413
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:18,880
His Majesty was most energetic last time. It was the best since several months ago.

414
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,590
He even said he was hungry last night, and ate half a bowl of swallow nest soup.

415
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:25,090
He was fine for the whole night.

416
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,930
Go ahead and take His Majesty's pulse.

417
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:29,740
Yes.
