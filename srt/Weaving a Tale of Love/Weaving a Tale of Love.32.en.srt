3
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,530
[Episode 32]

4
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,790
You are young and also a person that practices martial arts.

5
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,880
Why would you have gout? Tell the truth!

6
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,550
My person commits a wrongdoing, so I will discipline him.

7
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,740
Pei Xingjian,

8
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,000
you are a mere imperial guard leader! How dare you overstep your authority?

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,380
You are quite bold.

10
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,340
Greetings, Prince of Cao.

11
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,180
Pu Banu barged through the palace gate and appeared to be insane.

12
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,050
He hit and hurt several guards. I was concerned that he committed a big crime

13
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,540
so I arrested him.

14
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,190
I will take him back and severely punish him.

15
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,330
- Xiao Liuzi.
- Yes.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,410
Pei Xingjian, how dare you!

17
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,880
Your Highness, please allay your anger.

18
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,080
Didn't I give you the drug?

19
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,980
Why didn't you take it?

20
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,240
Your Highness, that's not a drug,

21
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,380
it's poison.

22
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,640
If I keep taking it, I'll be disabled.

23
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,580
I'll be useless.

24
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,260
You are the first person to take this drug.

25
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,020
I don't know the exact consequence of taking this drug continuously.

26
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,120
However, looking at your half dead condition,

27
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,250
if you quit taking the drug,

28
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,910
you will definitely die.

29
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,410
Your Highness.

30
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,690
Your Highness.

31
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,350
- Didn't he eat it?
- Yes.

32
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,090
I didn't know this drug's effect would be so strong.

33
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,730
It may be put into good use later on.

34
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,360
Too bad that Pu Bano is probably worthless now.

35
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,640
This son and subordinate greet Mother.

36
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,880
Is there something that displeases you?

37
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,660
Why does your face look so sullen?

38
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,760
Today, we were so close to being successful.

39
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,980
What was wrong?

40
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,040
I wonder if Li Zhi has noticed something.

41
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,760
I saw him holding the medicinal soup and almost took it to His Majesty's mouth.

42
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,750
But suddenly, he said his hand was trembling.

43
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,670
He pushed the task of feeding His Majesty to me.

44
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,990
Fortunately, I reacted fast and spilled the soup bowl.

45
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,700
How could it be so coincidental?

46
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,460
His hand suddenly trembled at a crucial time.

47
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,690
He said that his hand was hurt because he had been copying the scriptures to pray for blessings for His Majesty.

48
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,840
That's why his trembling problem recurred.

49
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,560
As it is, our plan will probably fail then.

50
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,450
His Majesty's energy is getting worse and worse every day.

51
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,330
This matter is urgent.

52
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,320
We can't keep waiting or it'll be too late.

53
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,160
This is precisely why I'm worried.

54
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,950
Perhaps...

55
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,040
we should prepare both hands.

56
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,950
In case His Majesty dies, we will send troops to control Black Tortoise Gate,

57
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,480
and then announce the decree to say

58
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,570
before His Majesty passed away, he discovered that Li Zhi could not bear his important duties.

59
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,750
Therefore, he left his last will to pass the throne to me.

60
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,440
This is a clear-cut way.

61
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,350
The Director of the Directorate of Eunuchs, Pan Qinhan, is our person.

62
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,850
He can testify that the last will is written by His Majesty himself.

63
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,160
Understood.

64
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,870
You must not neglect anything in positioning the troops.

65
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,380
Hurry with the plan to mobilize them.

66
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,400
Pu Banu is addicted to the poisonous drug and is about to become useless.

67
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,280
I need to find another able person to replace him.

68
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,560
Is that drug so powerful?

69
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,300
He wanted to secretly quit the drug,

70
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,620
but he turned out to act so crazy today

71
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,510
and almost committed a big disaster.

72
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,830
Boss, do you know a Heng Tai Clinic nearby?

73
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,400
Heng Tai? It's straight ahead, not far from here.

74
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,140
You've come a little late.

75
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,500
The people who want to see Physician Heng have queued to tomorrow already.

76
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,010
Is this Physician Heng really good?

77
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,440
Of course.

78
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,390
Physician Heng is especially good at treating unusual illnesses. Many people from out-of-town

79
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,360
come here because of his reputation.

80
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,020
Thank you.

[Zhen's Ink-Stone and Knots]

83
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,250
Physician Heng, this man is unreasonable. He insists on barging in.

84
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,390
Sir, if you come to Heng Tai Clinic for your illness,

85
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,990
you should abide by our rules.

86
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,300
This is my rule. They are here to see about illnesses.

87
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,390
I'm here to save a life.

88
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,090
Leave here.

89
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,730
Go.

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,130
Hurry and go.
[Heng Tai Clinic]

91
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,690
Did someone named Pei Xingjian come to you to get treated?

92
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,690
Do you mean the heir to the Pei family,

93
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,160
- Young Master Pei?
- That's him.

94
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,760
What is his illness?

95
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,230
Here.

96
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,360
He wasn't getting treated for himself.

97
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,760
If it's not for himself, why didn't the patient come?

98
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,680
Before Young Master Pei left, he repeatedly reminded me not to reveal it.

99
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,200
Besides, safeguarding the patients' secrets

100
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,690
is the duty of medical practitioners.

101
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,050
Sorry, but I can't tell you.

102
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,120
I'll talk, I'll talk.

103
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,890
He was asking for a young lady's illness.

104
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,790
That young lady had suffered serious external wounds,

105
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,860
and in addition, congested liver flows. She almost died.

106
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,780
She probably has sepsis. Normally,

107
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,030
treating a patient involves looking, listening, inquiring, and pulse-taking.

108
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,990
Without seeing the person, I really can't treat the patient.

109
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:22,910
But Pei Xingjian kept begging and was very sincere,

110
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,170
so I made an exception and made a diagnosis.

111
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,870
A young lady? You didn't even see her.

112
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,360
How do you know it's a young lady?

113
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,300
You don't know this, but

114
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,900
prescribing for male patients, you must pay attention to the airflow and the kidneys.

115
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,960
Prescribing for female patients, however, must pay attention to the liver and blood.

116
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,320
Many mediocre physicians do not differentiate between males and females.

117
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,640
I won't ruin my reputation by being careless.

118
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,690
I must be sure in order to prescribe the correct medicine.

119
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,090
Sir, you are bulky like an ox with hands strong like iron.

120
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,010
You don't look like a sick person.

121
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,110
Why do you want to cause me trouble?

122
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,550

[Hall of Shining Virtues]

124
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,910
Your Highness, we don't have many remaining crude drugs as Pu Banu required.

125
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,730
What about giving orders to get some new ones ready? So we keep this up.

126
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,050
Pu Banu is good-for-nothing.

127
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,050
The costs of producing medicine are not low. I don't need it anymore.

128
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,250
Yes.

129
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,750
Don't waste time. Find someone to replace Pu Banu.

130
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,740
Your Highness, what do you mean?

131
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,900
I am letting go of Pu Banu.

132
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,910
The one who can create this pill

133
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,070
is for sure a matchless expert!

134
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,560
Would you be kind enough to recommend someone to me?

135
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,470
If I had known where he was at,

136
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,830
I would have got him dismembered by horses!

137
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,070
I have used all my rare skills to make this pill. Yet Yin and Yang forces are clashing.

138
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,730
But even though this goes against the principles of pharmacology,

139
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,200
using this pill for the short-term will be extraordinarily efficient.

140
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,900
It can cure all diseases regular people have found no cure for!

141
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,270
The efficacy of this drug is obvious, as well as its toxicity.

142
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,350
Using it for a long term triggers dependency.

143
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,930
Even though it's medicine for the soul, it is more of a poison.

so your illness can be cured,

146
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,590
but you have to think it through.

147
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:07,230
The only way to achieve permanent healing is by giving up your drug addiction.

148

It's just that...

What's wrong?

150
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,730
Just that giving up drugs is definitely not an easy task.

I know you are angry

156
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,350
but have you ever thought

157
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:45,210
about how angry your mother who stares down on you from Heaven would be

158
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,270
if she sees how shut-in and easily defeated you have become?

159
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,480
How disappointed, too.

160
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,820
I'm timid.

161

There are many things I don't dare to do

162
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:09,590
but it's different for you. Although you are a girl,

163
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,140
you don't fear Heaven and Earth.
(You are fearless)

You are frank and outspoken.

You never mix drinking water with mud. You never lament over things. (You get things done properly.)

There is nothing to worry about.

176
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,360
But lately... you have been so demoralized,

177
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,390
dispirited, and listless...

178
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,110
You let me and Master...

179
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,950
see how much pain you have been hiding in your heart!

180
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,590
Aren't you here only to convince me to take the medicine?

181
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,060
Is it really necessary to be so long-winded and whiny? You are wasting your whole energy!

182
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,330
Then you should first have a meal to fill up your stomach.

183
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,140
Eat your medicine afterward.

184
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,710
This medicine Pei...

185
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,380
This medicine was taken from a famous physician, an expert of martial arts.

186
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,300
I begged him to write out a prescription for you.

187
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,720
It will definitely cure your illness.

188
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,300
Has Xiao Douzi agreed to eat?

189
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,400
Does Physician Heng's medicine work?

190
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,750
Her mood has improved. She has just eaten the decoction.

191
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,800
I can't say precisely how the medicine is working out so far.

192
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,120
This is great.

193
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,070
Brother Pei!

194
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,600
Younger Brother! What is wrong?

195
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,320
His Majesty is suddenly calling in the crown prince.

196
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,220
Also, Zhangsun Wuji, Chu Suiliang, and other important court ministers.

197
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,370
Thank you, Xiao Shunzi.

198
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,910
- Please lead the way.
- All right.

199
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,620
How come there was no further notice about it? So sudden!

200
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,890
Consort Yang asked Your Highness to go to the Hall of Immortal Nectar now.

201
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,150
Where is Pu Banu? Call him in, just in case he is needed.

202
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,830
Yes.

203
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,130
Pu Banu, His Highness wants to enter the palace and wants you to accompany him.

204
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,830
Pu Banu!

205
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,850
Reply, I'll be there immediately.

206
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,570
Along ten thousand miles of sad Autumn, I pity my thin reflection.

207
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,920
I have been ill for a long time. My energy is weakening,

208
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,860
and I'm too exhausted to govern the country.

209
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,790
Crown Prince, Li Zhi is intelligent.

210
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,740
He is kind, righteous, and dutiful.

211
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,970
He’s known for his benevolence.

212
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,000
He’s shown his respect to me and is very knowledgeable.

213
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,410
He’s also skilled in tactics as well as in literature.

214
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:00,290
However, it's rare for a young person to make achievements early.

215
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,340
Imperial Minister of State, acting Head of the Secretariat,

216
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,980
and Duke of Henan, Chu Suiliang, and Shangdang Prefecture Governor

217
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,230
Great General Zhangsun Wuji

218
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,760
are virtuous, capable as the court's loyal pillars, and

219
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,700
and dedicated. They have led the Secretariat and Chancellery,

220
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,270
and have written books to educate other officials.

221
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,210
As ministers-regent to work in one united heart

222
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:26,440
to fulfill their duties, this is an announcement to the nation

223
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,910
is to be implemented as stated.

224
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,040
This subject, Zhangsun Wuji,

225
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,500
Chu Suiliang, accept the decree.

226
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,810
- This subject accepts the decree.
- This subject accepts the decree.

227
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,550
We shall not disappoint what Your Majesty has entrusted in us

228
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,810
to do our best to fulfill our duty.

229
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:58,000
We will help the Crown Prince to take care of national affairs.

230
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,790
Zhi'er.

231
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,890
Zhi'er.

232
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:29,500
You must rely on these two ministers going forward.

233
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,020
You have to have the world in mind.

234
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,960
Be humble in accepting advice.

235
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,220
Be a wise ruler.

236
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,660
Protect my Great Tang's

237
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,820
mountains and people.

238
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,880
Son.

239
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,390
Your Majesty,

240
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,360
this son and subordinate will remember it to heart.

241
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:08,820
[Hall of Gentle Breeze]

242
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:15,900
His Majesty suddenly appointed Ministers-Regent.

243
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,890
It was so sudden.

244
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,100
We are one step behind.

245
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,560
If we announce the fake last will,

246
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,400
no only won't the people believe it,

247
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,290
the two ministers-regent who hold high powers...

248
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,850
They won't do anything about it.

249
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:43,330
Mother, what is left for us is the last path.

250
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,540
To think of a way to show East Palace having thoughts to overthrow the emperor.

251
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,280
It has to be hard evidence.

252
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,010
Li Zhi must not be able to deny it.

253
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,000
The people and the two ministers-regent must

254
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,180
have nothing to say.

255
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,350
Raise the troops to rebel?

256
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,170
The Black Tortoise Gate is a good place to start a coup.

257
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,830
We can replay

258
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,840
history.

259
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,240
Back then, His Majesty mobilized troops at the Black Tortoise Gate and killed the crown prince

260
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,750
and forced Emperor Gaozu to abdicate. That's how he ascended the throne.

261
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,630
It's been so many years now, the Black Tortoise Gate has always been

262
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,690
a taboo for His Majesty, and a permanent thorn in his heart.

263
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,130
Now, we only have to make East Palace

264
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,460
use troops to show power.

265
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,760
What do you think His Majesty will think?

266
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,620
When that time comes,

267
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,130
even if Li Zhi has a body of mouths, he cannot clear himself.

268
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,510
The two ministers-regent will rush to protect themselves.

269
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,720
They will break their ties with Crown Prince.

270
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,950
Seems like this is the only way.

271
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,990
But the troops in East Palace are in Pei Xingjian's hands.

272
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,950
Pei Xingjian is loyal to Li Zhi.

273
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,310
To change the direction of East Palace's troops,

274
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,400
how would it be easy?

275
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,900
Pei Xingjian.

276
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,590
I will find someone to have him killed,

277
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,830
so he won't block my path.

278
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,250
Pei Xingjian's martial arts are great,

279
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,560
even Pu Banu cannot fight him.

280
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,340
Consort Yang, Guard Pu has gone mad.

281
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,680
Please hurry and have a look.

282
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,410
Master Pu, spare me!

283
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,860
I won't dare to do it again.

284
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,090
Give me the medicine.

285
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,480
Give me the medicine!

286
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,490
The medicine is on the ground!

287
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,460
Please spare me.

288
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,640
Give me medicine!

289
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,890
Give me medicine!

290
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,090
Give me medicine!

291
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,610
- Arrest him.
- Yes.

292
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,250
He has gone mad!

293
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,000
[Hall of Gentle Breeze]

294
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,780
Pu Banu,

295
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,780
you dared to enter the palace to create a scene.

296
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,850
Have you really gone mad?

297
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,790
Your Highness,

298
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:17,250
I feel like a hundred bugs are biting my heart.

299
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,840
I am trying hard to break the medicine's addiction.

300
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,100
But I really cannot hold back!

301
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:29,900
Your Highness, on behalf that

302
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,240
I have done so many things for you, please give me the medicine.

303
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,430
Please save me!

304
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:39,760
- Please save me!
- Useless.

305
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,390
Arrest him, shut his mouth,

306
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:46,760
- bring him back to the manor!
- Yes!

307
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,940
Wait, wait! I have Pei Xingjian's secret!

308
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,580
I have Pei Xingjian's secret! I have Pei Xingjian's secret!

309
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,240
Wait!

310
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,120
I am not useless, Your Highness. I am not useless.

311
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,920
What secret? Speak.

312
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,020
Your Highness,

313
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,200
the person who gave me this medicine, was you, Your Highness.

314
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,290
It is to win Pei Xingjian in the competition.

315
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,050
For your gain,

316
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:30,990
I had no complaint of trying the medicine myself.

317
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:35,960
I know. I know that the medicine addiction is hard to break now. It is useless.

318
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,660
But, Your Highness, I only want to beg you of one thing.

319
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:43,470
Don't kill the deer after you have succeeded in your plan.

320
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,570
Your Highness, I will do everything I can.

321
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:52,030
I will repay you for your kindness, Your Highness.

322
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,720
Pu Banu, as long as you are loyal to me,

323
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,770
however much medicine you want, there is.

324
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,480
Please give me the medicine, Your Highness.

325
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:59,120
Buddha, eleven years ago,

326
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,340
I altered Liuli's fortune stick in front of you.

327
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,000
Eleven years later, I made decisions without asking,

328
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,660
giving Liuli's mother's golden needle to Zhuo Jinniang.

329
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,080
I kept thinking this was for Liuli's good,

330
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,750
so that disasters could be avoided.

331
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,970
In the end,

332
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,320
Liuli was harmed because of me.

333
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,070
Everything is all my own fault.

334
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,880
If you want to punish,

335
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:33,590
then punish me alone. I...

336
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:36,360
am willing to cut a few years of life

337
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,240
for Liuli to block every disaster.

338
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,810
Please grant it.

339
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,940
Liuli, what happened to your leg?

340
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,910
Are the meridian channels injured?

341
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,850
- Why didn't you tell anyone?
- This is my own matter.

342
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,700
I don't need you to care.

343
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,810
Here, I'll help you onto the bed.

344
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,370
I said I don't need you to care!

345
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,650
Liuli, don't be afraid.

346
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,450
There are so many miraculous medicines and doctors in the world,

347
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,180
your wound will for sure heal.

348
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:28,900
Leave. I don't want to see you.

349
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:42,870
I got this safety talisman from Da Ci'en Temple.

350
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:46,140
I promised hard in front of Buddha.

351
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,060
Buddha will surely protect you.

352
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,190
No need. Their fortune sticks don't work.

353
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,560
How would your wish be fulfilled?

354
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:01,110
Who said their wish grants don't work?

355
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:05,390
When you were in front of Buddha,

356
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:08,070
you got a bad fortune stick.

357
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:11,400
For consecutively two times, I secretly blocked them.

358
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,250
That's why you eventually got a good fortune stick.

359
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,600
[Bad Fortune]

360
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,570
What did you say?

361
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,920
When I was drawing the fortune stick,

362
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,100
you were there, too?

363
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:53,800
Then, I shot down your fortune stick,

364
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:58,430
I almost couldn't be accepted as General Su's disciple.

365
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:02,740
So, there was a meeting between us two.

366
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:10,190
Our fate had already started at the temple.

367
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,660
This lucky charm,

368
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,890
it has my promise.

369
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,650
Buddha will definitely make sure you are safe.

370
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:35,700
Have a good rest and recuperation.

371
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,510
Don't be impatient and reckless.

372
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,470
I'm leaving.

373
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,860
Pu Banu,

374
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:32,570
you said earlier you have Pei Xingjian's secret.

375
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,630
What's the secret?

376
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,010
Continue to talk.

377
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,170
From what I see,

378
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,630
the relationship between Pei Xingjian and the young lady

379
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,140
is not ordinary.

380
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,810
Pei Xingjian is young and energetic,

381
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:57,540
and has not gotten married after his wife died,

382
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,830
unless that girl is someone he likes?

383
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,980
It really is fate.

384
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,320
When we have no idea how to deal with Pei Xingjian,

385
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,630
Pu Banu has given us such a great pawn.

386
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,030
What you are saying is you want to use this girl

387
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,270
to threaten Pei Xingjian?

388
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,120
But Pei Xingjian is loyal to Li Zhi.

389
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,360
Why would he betray the crown prince because of a girl?

390
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,400
Mother, you are right.

391
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:37,760
Pei Xingjian is loyal to the crown prince and won't betray the crown prince because of personal matters.

392
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,890
But have you thought, Mother, that because of his love and righteousness

393
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:45,750
to let him see his beloved with his own eyes,

394
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,320
because of his mistake,

395
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,000
he will suffer what ordinary people can't bear.

396
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,370
Seeing the girl he loves,

397
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,370
because of his mistake,

398
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,900
as good as dead,

399
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,590
then what do you think he would do?

400
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:08,270
Pei Xingjian does not owe anything to the crown prince.

401
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,410
But he will soon owe that girl.

402
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:17,070
What he owes, he won't be able to repay.

403
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:23,200
When that time comes, what will a man with feelings choose?

404
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:28,200
Will he choose his career,

405
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,590
or the loved one he owes too much?

406
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,800
Pu Banu.

407
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,260
Yes.

408
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,450
Help me

409
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:46,220
deal with this well.

410
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,430
Doctor Heng.

411
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,730
Mr. Pei.

412
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,800
This is the reward money.

413
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,890
Please take it back.

414
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:20,120
I don't feel good taking it.

415
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:24,720
Physician Heng, your medical skills are outstanding and even made an exception for me.

416
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,290
I once said that if the medicine works,

417
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:30,540
I would give you three times the money to express thanks.

418
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,980
I am only fulfilling my promise.

419
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,470
Doctor Heng, no need to say no.

420
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:40,820
How is the girl doing?

421
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:47,030
If she is almost done, then she only needs to rest.

422
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,500
She doesn't have to eat medicine.

423
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:54,560
The saying goes medicine has three portions of poison.

424
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,780
Please do the good thing to the end. No need to reject.

425
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:03,740
Although the patient has eaten medicine for three days, she cannot move well.

426
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:07,450
It seems that her meridian channels are damaged and the tendons are injured.

427
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:13,790
Doctor Heng, if you think the money is not enough, I will try my best.

428
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:17,090
No, no, no!  That's not what I mean.

429
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,250
I still have another medicine.

430
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,400
For people with great injury,

431
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,160
it has a cure to help strengthen the tibia.

432
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,680
Here you go.

433
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,450
How many each day? How many each time?

434
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,400
Please tell me, Doctor Heng.

435
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,800
I will write it down for you.

436
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,270
I have said that medicine is three portions of poison.

437
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,950
If not the worst-case scenario,

438
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:48,550
if you can eat less, then eat less.

439
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,460
Here, please keep it well.

440
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:56,110
I remember.

441
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,780
Physician Heng, they call you Devine Hua Tuo.
(Hua Tuo was a famous physician in the Han dynasty)

442
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,470
From what I see today, you really are as the people say.

443
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,990
Thank you.

444
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,920
You're welcome.

445
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:15,410
I will leave for now.

446
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:32,770
Liuli doesn't dare to come off the bed. She says that she has a headache.

447
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:37,260
I thought she was afraid I would be worried.

448
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,150
So she kept on keeping it a secret.

449
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:45,370
I really am useless. I should have thought of it earlier.

450
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,000
She is someone who is so afraid of boredom,

451
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,670
how would she stay on the bed?

452
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,990
This is the pill Doctor Heng has created.

453
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:01,170
It has a cure to strengthen the tibia. Give it to her.

454
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,860
But don't say that I brought it,

455
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,550
or else... she won't dare to eat it.

456
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,760
- Okay.
- Hurry!

457
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,260
Imperial Guard Leader, you are true with Liuli.

458
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,640
I have misunderstood you.

459
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,630
I haven't apologized to you these few days.

460
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,340
Please accept my bow.

461
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,010
This is all the past.

462
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:37,390
Eunuch Sun, you don't need to keep it at heart.

463
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:42,060
Before, for Zhuo Jinniang to not know Liuli's identity,

464
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,490
it was me who asked Eunuch Sun and Qiniang to set up the plan

465
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:49,270
to give Liuli's golden needle to Zhuo Jinniang.

466
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,170
Seeing how painful she is now,

467
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,500
I don't know if I helped her...

468
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,950
or harmed her.

469
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,570
Xiao Douzi, do you feel better today?

470
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,860
You are laying all day long. Are you bored?

471
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,550
Bored?

472
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:11,680
I have waited so long for these fairy-like days.

473
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,550
- Fairy-like days?
- Yes.

474
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,840
I have the crown prince who looks after me and you to serve me.

475
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,360
When I wake up, I eat; then I sleep.

476
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,430
I don't need to sew clothing and I don't need to hear Zhuo Jinniang get mad at me.

477
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:25,630
I don't need to step and I have food in my mouth, and my hands are full.

478
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,740
In the whole palace, people who can have these fairy-like days,

479
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,010
other than His Majesty who is sick, then there is only me.

480
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,960
Why are you crying?

481
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,010
Of course because of you.

482
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,920
If you continue to lay,

483
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,460
my two legs will become thin like hemp sticks.

484
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,920
Sorry, Xiao Shunzi.

485
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,580
It is all my fault for letting you suffer.

486
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:11,200
If you feel bad for me,

487
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,530
then eat this medicine.

488
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:32,550
I don't know where you get this weird medicine from.

489
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,000
What medicine is this?

490
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,930
This medicine pill comes from a big background.

491
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:41,370
This is given by the famous doctor that gave you the previous medicine.

492
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:45,620
The doctor said this medicine for the greatly injured.

493
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:49,070
It has a cure to strengthen the tibia.

494
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,960
- Really?
- Yes.

00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,530
almost met a disastrous end, but luckily received immortal elixir.

498
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:28,740
After a few days, there will for sure be a miraculous cure."

499
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:33,630
I don't know after you recovered,

500
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:37,320
will you grant a reward?

501
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,010
Reward? Of course, a reward,

502
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:43,320
Say it!  What reward would you like?

503
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,130
I am not good with my words and always upset you.

504
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,660
So, I don't dare to ask for rewards.

505
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:52,630
I only wish to compensate for my wrongdoings with the medicine.

506
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:55,560
The good from before, keep it.

507
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,220
The bad, forget it. Okay?

508
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,950
You are still thinking about the past?

509
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:06,130
How would I be someone so narrow-minded?

510
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:09,990
Just say whether or not you agree to use this medicine for compensation.

511
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,500
I agree.

512
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,890
Saying you are dumb, I am not accusing you.

513
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:17,360
Such a great chance, and you don't take advantage.

514
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,430
You should be dumb to death.

00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,980
Pu Banu, a few days have passed.

517
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,370
Is there any news on Pei Xingjian's side?

518
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,680
The number of times Pei Xingjian gets medicine is more and more.

519
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,620
From what I see, the person who eats the medicine must be addicted.

520
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,480
They cannot break it.

521
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,210
