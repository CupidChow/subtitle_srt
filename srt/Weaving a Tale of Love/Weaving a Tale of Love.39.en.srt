[Weaving a Tale of Love]

3
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,980
[Episode 39]

4
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,640
The mother-in-law told her daughter-in-law to pay attention to Pei Shouyue's marriage intentions.

5
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,540
She shall not neglect him.

6
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,030
If any problem arises, she has to report it to her mother-in-law.

7
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,670
That Lu Qiniang died a long time ago.

8
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,790
Ever since then, Pei Shouyue has been all alone.

9
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,910
Could it be that he wants to get married again?

10
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,000
Pei Shouyue has just brought a young lady from the palace today.

11
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,820
He has already taken her to the mansion of General Su,

12
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,310
to greet the general and his wife.

13
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,040
I have heard that His Majesty has already approved of their marriage.

14
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,900
This Pei Shouyue wants to get married all of a sudden!

15
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,590
He kept it a secret early,

16
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,260
but as soon as she is out of the palace, she is taken to General Su's manor.

17
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,750
He probably wants to protect that girl.

18
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,670
Pei Shouyue is doing this, probably because of Lu Qiniang years ago.

19
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,120
For this, he is really regretful.

20
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,320
I think this is to protect her in case.

21
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,110
Does this mean that Grand Princess Linhai has been spending Shouyue's estate?

22
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,500
So... she doesn't want Shouyue to marry and have kids.

23
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,580
Once he marries, then he will have to fulfill his promise,

24
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,240
to return this great family's assets to its rightful owner.

25
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,830
Exactly, that is the reason.

26
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,450
This Grand Princess Linhai is rather scheming.

27
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,950
When she knew that Shouyue wanted to marry Lu Qiniang,

28
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,180
she accepted Qiniang as an adopted daughter.

29
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,050
We thought she did this out of kindness and did not take any precautions.

30
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,730
Who thought that in appearance she gave some assets to Qiniang to manage,

31
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,870
but secretly she asked some servants and farmers to go into debt

32
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,740
to exhaust all funds and have nothing left.

33
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,220
Making Qiniang have hardship but couldn't say it.

34
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,270
Qiniang was an honest child and had a heavy burden.

35
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,650
To these bad things, she didn't mention anything to her family.

36
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,500
She also had kept it from Shouyue.

37
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,800
On the one hand, Qiniang wanted to maintain her family's finances

38
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,030
and at the same time help those noble family members,

39
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,060
the selfish, greedy family members.

40
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,840
After not so long, she died from depression.

41
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,060
Shouyue has suffered so much. Who thought

42
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,340
this Grand Princess Linhai purposely carved

43
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,290
a "to kill" father, "to kill" mother, "to kill " brother, "to kill" sister, "to kill" spouse, "to kill" word.

44
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,120
This saying of killing people around her,

45
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,940
making her have a bad reputation everywhere, making no one dare to marry her.

46
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,270
From then on, she lived a lonely life.

47
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,720
Even if Pei Shouyue is extra careful this time,

48
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,410
he has also found someone like General Su to depend on.

49
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,260
He thought he could make it flawless.

50
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,130
But... he doesn't know how exceptional you are.

51
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,420
Then wasn't that Lu Qiniang also obeying you in every way?

52
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,180
She was a toy in your hands.

53
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,000
This time, this girl

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,280
is also for sure not your opponent.

55
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,860
You have to watch carefully.

56
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,340
Since he wants to marry, he will for sure report to me, his elder.

57
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,510
Wait till then before you cross-examine.

58
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,060
Yes.

59
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,690
Now you know why we want you to live at the general's manor.

60
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,280
That Grand Princess Linhai is arrogant and overbearing.

61
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,250
Although your uncle is wealthy, he is still a common person.

62
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,850
If she uses a few tricks,

63
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,000
I am afraid...

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,310
I understand. Thank you General Su and Madam Yu

65
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,510
for helping me think so precisely.

that I want to accept you as my adopted daughter.

If I do not accept you as my adopted daughter now,

I am afraid this Grand Princess Linhai

72
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,890
will treat you like Qiniang.

73
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,950

00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,930
I had lost my mother since I was young.

79
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,200
From today onward, I finally have a mother's love again.

83
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,910
Why have you come, Lord Pei?

84
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,660
I have come to see Grand Princess Linhai.

85
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,860
Will Madam Heir-Apparent please convey the message?

86
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,530
Grand Princess has the habit of taking an afternoon nap.

87
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,690
Even thunder cannot wake her. Have you forgotten?

88
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,280
I see.

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,170
I came in a rush to report,

90
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,160
yet I forgot about this. I really am careless,

91
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,770
but I am in a rush to go to the palace.

92
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,610
I'm afraid that I have to ask Madam to convey the message.

93
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,930
I wonder what it is, that has made you careless?

94
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,720
I am fulfilling my mentor's orders and marrying my mentor's wife's foster daughter.

95
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,690
Grand Princess Linhai is my elder.

96
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,700
So I came especially to report to you.

97
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,400
A few days ago, I did hear that Madam Yu had fostered a daughter.

98
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,130
But... I didn't know who that girl was.

99
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,490
Being able to have approval from Madam Yu,

100
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,560
and being able to be Lord Pei's other half.

101
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,020
My fiancé's name is Kudi Liuli.

102
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,420
She is the general, Kudi Yanzhong's eldest daughter.

103
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,570
Kudi Yanzhong?

104
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,160
Kudi Yanzhong.

105
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Do you mean Kudi Yanzhong from the Chonghua Neighborhood?

106
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,120
Exactly.

107
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,650
This Kudi Yanzhong is just a small general.

108
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,070
How did you recognize him?

109
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,160
You just said Kudi Yanzhong's eldest daughter?

110
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,590
This means...

111
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,900
that Kudi Yanzhong has more than one daughter?

112
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,480
Liuli is Kudi Yanzhong's official wife Madam An's daughter.

113
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,160
As far as I know, she has a sister called Shanhu.

114
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,110
A few years ago, Ruzhuo wanted to get a concubine.

115
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,060
In the end, you rejected her.

116
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,660
It was really embarrassing.

117
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,170
Isn't that Kudi Yanzhong's daughter?

118
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,080
Doesn't the Kudi family only have one daughter?

119
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,070
I still have to enter the palace for tasks.

120
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,900
I'll have to ask Madam to help me pass on the message then.

121
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,900
This Lord Pei's manor is only one manor difference from here,

122
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,680
but you two have to hide from each other. You cannot see each other often.

123
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,450
Or else, people will talk.

124
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,200
Liuli, you just said you wanted to have a look at your uncle's place.

125
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,540
You should go back to have a look.

126
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,790
How about this? Later you will ride on the general's cart,

127
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,830
bringing my maids and servants.

128
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,330
I will let them watch over you well.

129
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,590
Liuli, you are my General Su Manor's adopted daughter.

130
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,060
You are also the Pei family's soon-to-be daughter-in-law.

131
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,370
This will make people speak less.

132

it will involve a noble class like Hedong's household.

His Majesty has an urgent matter to see me. I wanted to tell you

00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,920
so I went to the general's manor.

Then I knew that you went to Ruyi Resist Dye Shop.

226

So I picked you up in between

to ease my lovesickness.

228
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,760
Why did His Majesty ask for you?

229
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,220
Is he regretful?

230
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,730
His Majesty is a wise man. How would he be inconstant with his words?

You are my wife.

No one can take you from me.

Then, why did His Majesty ask for you?

234
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,200
Lady of Bright Deportment Wu and His Majesty have strong affection and respect for each other.

235
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,250
Naturally, she has garnered jealousy from Empress Wang and Concubine Xiao.

236
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,840
Empress Wang and Concubine Xiao disregarded their prior conflicts

237
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,640
and have united to oppose Lady of Bright Deportment Wu.

238
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,360
Even though Lady of Bright Deportment Wu doesn't say anything, but His Majesty can't stand it.

239
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,960
Since Sister Wu went back to the palace,

240
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,630
she has been loved by His Majesty.

241

Now that His Majesty is displeased with Empress Wang...

242
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:55,210
- Unless he wants to...
- You have guessed correctly.

243
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,920
His Majesty really has had the thought to remove the empress.

244
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,280
His Majesty really wants to make Sister Wu empress?

00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,850
Let's chat slowly.

348
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,490
Hurry to warm up inside.

349
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,360
Do you have any manners?

350
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,140
Put them all down.

351
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,530
These are bestowed from His Majesty. How can you use them?

352
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,710
This is Liuli's gift to the master.

353
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,880
Master hasn't even looked at them. How dare you distribute them among yourselves?

354
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,390
Let me tell you. Not a single piece can be missing.

355
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,770
Otherwise, watch out for your skin!

356
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,990
Good. This is a good marriage.

357
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,460
Lord Magistrate Pei isn't just the heir to the Zhongjuan Pei branch of the Pei clan,

358
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,420
he is also popular with His Majesty

359
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,700
and General Su Dingfang's beloved disciple.

360
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:23,010
He excels in literature and martial arts and he is good-looking. He has a great future!

361
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,860
He is Liuli's ideal husband.

362
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,880
What's so great about that?

363
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,810
She ruined my marriage, but she does well for herself

364
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:34,110
and found a good family to marry into.

365
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,300
What do you mean by "your marriage?"

366
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,750
Back then, you sisters were the ones liked by both the Duke of Hedong's Manor and Commandant Pei's Manor.

367
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,670
Other people don't know, but you don't know it either?

368
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:51,270
Older Brother, you only know that Pei Xingjian comes from a renowned family.

369
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:55,360
But do you know that he is called a "disaster star?"

370
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,930
Liuli, I live in a noble family,

371
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,620
and I've heard a lot about the Zhongjuan Pei branch of the Pei clan

372
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,280
having conflicts with the Grand Princess who is Madam of the Duke of Hedong's household.

373
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,950
Lord Magistrate Pei is good, but he is the heir to the Zhongjuan Pei branch.

374
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,760
Do you know how his former wife died tragically?

375
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,030
Liuli, this matter concerns your life.

376
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,800
You must not make the wrong decision.

377
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Daughter, don't listen to your auntie's nonsense.

378
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,830
Fifth Madam, what are you doing?

379
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,900
Is it because Liuli didn't marry into your Commandant Pei's household as a concubine

380
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,210
that you want to ruin her marriage with Pei Xingjian? You can't do this!

381
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,550
I am wholeheartedly worried for Liuli. What did I say wrong?

382
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,220
I only just found out today.

383
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,480
Relying on Liuli's blessing, you entered the Ministry of War as a small official.

384
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,820
As I see it, you are not content and want to have a higher position.

385
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,470
You probably want to rely on the future son-in-law to climb up even higher.

386
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,340
No, this–

387
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:53,440
Back then, your whole family disregarded Liuli and her mother

388
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,360
and evicted them out of the household.

389
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,200
Now, you are disregarding Liuli's life again

390
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,110
and letting her marry the "disaster star," and you claim I am harming her?

391
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,600
I have never seen such a selfish and greedy father!

392
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,680
This–

393
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:13,080
Thank you for your concern, Auntie.

394
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,230
I accept it in my heart.

395
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,710
I am not talented and took over ten years

396
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:21,570
to finally exonerate Mother's grievance.

397
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,090
From now on, Mother and I

398
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,970
- will no longer be sinners in the Kudi family.
- Yes, yes.

399
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,640
I also won't owe anything to the Kudi family.

400
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,920
Daughter, rest assured.

401
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,720
I have already put your mother's memorial tablet

402
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,330
in our Kudi family's ancestral hall as my official wife,

403
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:43,230
to console your mother's spirit in Heaven.

404
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,670
Daughter, in the past,

405
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,080
it was my fault.

406
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,600
I let you suffer.

407
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,350
Even though I suffered, but I am ultimately a daughter of the Kudi family.

408
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,950
Now, I will also marry from the Kudi family to the Pei household.

409
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,350
What's in the past is the past.

410
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:06,390
However, I'd like Father to remember

411
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:10,100
the Kudi family will share the glory and downfall together.

412
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,220
If Father wants to live well,

413
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,180
then you must not be like in the past

414
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:18,650
and neglect your daughter's safety and comfort because of your own needs.

415
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,330
Yes, yes.

416
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,180
Daughter, you are right.

417
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,420
Father will remember it to heart.

418
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,380
[Su Manor]

419
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,550
I have heard of the Eldest Young Lady Kudi's fame.

420
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:47,100
When I see you today, you indeed look like a fairy.

421
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,370
I don't deserve Madam's compliments.

422
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,930
What Madam? We are ranked in the same generation.

423
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,210
You can just call me A'Cui.

424
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,690
I don't dare to overstep. Please sit, Madam.

425
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,880
Even though this Hu girl is very beautiful,

426
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,460
but she is missing an elegant aura,

427
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,310
making her look like a pretty daughter from an ordinary family.

428
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,820
I heard that Young Lady's auspicious day is coming up.
(T/N: wedding day)

429
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,550
I wonder which day it will be.

430
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,990
It is right after the Lantern Festival.

431
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,750
It's coming very soon then.

432
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,280
Grand Princess was even saying

433
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,870
that she wanted to invite you for a simple visit at the Duke of Hedong's Manor.

434
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,600
She was afraid that you were shy, so she asked me to come.

435
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,740
First of all, we are about to be in the same family.

436
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,650
We should visit each other often and become closer.

437
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:58,800
Secondly, Grand Princess has a token of affection

438
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,980
that she wants me to pass to you.

439
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,850
I have never met Grand Princess.

440
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:07,720
How can I accept a gift from Grand Princess?

441
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,470
Don't decline yet. Open it and take a look first.

442
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:31,880
House in Yongning Neighborhood,

443
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,060
512 meters from east to west,

444
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,550
800 meters from north to south.

445
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,150
This... It's not right. It's not right.

446
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,320
How can I accept such a big gift?

447
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,250
This house is even bigger than the general's manor.

448
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,580
It's ten times the size of my old home.

449
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,340
Eldest Young Lady, why are you so courteous?

450
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,090
Grand Princess already said that this house isn't worth much.

451
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:00,510
Just consider it as your dowry.

452
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:04,120
Shouyue originally grew up in the Duke of Hedong Manor.

453
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,330
Grand Princess thinks of him as no different from her own sons.

454
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,890
Shouyue's former wife, Madam Lu,

455
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,910
was even Grand Princess's foster daughter.

456
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,850
The house that she gave as a gift at that time

457
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,720
was even bigger by three to five times than this one.

458
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,790
Not to mention all the opulently decorated pavilions and halls inside.

459
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:28,300
It's one of the best houses in Chang'an City.

460
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,960
Madam Lu accepted it.

461
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,360
Your marriage came a bit rushed this time, so the house was bought in a hurry.

462
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,610
Even though it's a little smaller than the previous one,

463
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:43,960
but your Kudi family isn't as high as the Lu family.

464
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,680
So there shouldn't be many demands.

465
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,620
Grand Princess also said

466
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,920
- if Madam Yu didn't get ahead of her,
- Luckily Godmother

467
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,240
thought of it in advance. Now I can see that

468
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,240
Grand Princess is using the same method she used on Madam Lu

469
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,290
to deal with me.

470
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,520
I came from a small and lowly family.

471
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,270
I've never seen such a large manor.

472
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,840
I feel so undeserved.

473
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,960
What are you looking at, Madam?

474
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,470
I was looking at you when you lowered your head.

475
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:31,210
You looked quite similar to Lu Qiniang.

476
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,240
Lu Qiniang has been gone for ten years.

477
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,490
Shouyue has never been moved by other women.

478
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,650
Grand Princess and we were finding it strange

479
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:43,960
that Shouyue was suddenly going to remarry.

480
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,420
So this must be the reason why.

481
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,430
After Lu Qiniang died, Shouyue sold that big house

482
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:55,710
and never mentioned the heartbreaking past again to anyone.

483
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:00,680
Therefore, you must accept this house

484
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,370
so that you can rebuild a love nest with Shouyue.

485
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,290
If you don't accept it,

486
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:09,390
how can I go back to tell Grand Princess?

487
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,770
If I don't accept this deed to the house,

488
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,880
Grand Princess will think that I'm full of ideas.

489
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,400
She might cause more trouble.

490
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,720
The elder bestows. I don't dare to decline.

491
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,040
I thank Grand Princess's grace.

492
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,890
Eldest Young Lady is indeed candid.

493
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,330
As it is, and I've seen Eldest Young Lady,

494
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:41,470
I should go back to report to Grand Princess.

495
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:51,320
[Su Manor]

496
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,020
My poor memory!

497
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,380
I forgot another happy event.

498
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,420
Eldest Young Lady, in a few more days,

499
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,850
we may even become family on top of family.

500
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,620
Family on top of family? What does Madam mean?

501
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,250
Your father didn't mention such a big event to you?

502
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,800
This auspicious event is also Grand Princess's idea.

503
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,050
Grand Princess said since Eldest Young Lady is so good and can be highly regarded by Shouyue,

504
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,240
then the other one must be good, too.

505
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,940
It's quite a coincidence.

506
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,500
The Heir Apparent is missing a good person by his side.

507
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,250
So I followed Grand Princess's bidding and went to your family to propose marriage.

508
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,090
Your father agreed right away

509
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,680
to let Shanhu marry the Heir Apparent as a concubine.

510
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:43,210
Don't you think this is great to become a family on top of family?

511
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,980
Shanhu is more clever than I am,

512
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,500
but she is also a daughter from a small family.

513
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,150
If she climbs high to get into the Duke of Hedong's household,

514
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:57,780
I'm afraid she will show fear in front of Grand Princess and the Heir Apparent eventually.

515
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,120
With you here, your younger sister is someone who really knows you.

516
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,600
Once she marries into the Duke of Hedong's household, she will be a big help to me.

517
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:11,150
Rest assured. Once your sister comes into our household, she will be a respected concubine.

518
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,870
Whatever I have, I won't let her miss anything.

519
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:17,250
She will definitely not suffer.

520
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,250
Thank you for such affection from Madam and Grand Princess.

521
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,970
I am feeling such a pleasant surprise.

522
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,940
I'm leaving then.

523
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:37,410
Grand Princess is indeed thorough in her thinking.

524
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,560
She can't get me as her foster daughter,

525
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,500
so she gets Shanhu married into the Duke of Hedong's Manor

526
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,890
so that I would be afraid of making trouble.

527
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,030
Or they'll even use Shanhu to deal with me.

528
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,160
This technique is really a danger to guard against.

529
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,540
Madam, Kudi Shanhu is here to greet Madam.
[Duke of Hedong's Manor]

530
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,880
[Glory and Bright Harvest]

531
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,640
- Greetings, Madam.
- Shanhu greets Grand Princess.

532
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,960
I hope Grand Princess is in good health.

533
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,050
You may rise.

534
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,990
Come over here.

535
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,180
You are Kudi Liuli's younger sister?

536
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,690
Yes.

537
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,710
Even though you are not born by the same mother,

538
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,860
but I would imagine the sisterly feelings

539
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,260
should be quite good, right?

540
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,360
Replying to Grand Princess.

541
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,780
Liuli left home at the age of eight.

542
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,720
Not too long ago, she suddenly returned.

543
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,180
We haven't been together for many years.

544
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,940
Naturally, we don't have much of a bond.

545
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,410
Our Duke of Hedong's household is really strict with rules.

546
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,020
Once you enter the Duke of Hedong's household in the future,

547
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,050
your elbow must not be turning outside.
(Must not be loyal to outsiders)

548
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:22,280
Even if it's your own sister, it won't be acceptable.

549
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,940
What I've said... do you understand?

550
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:30,350
Even though I'm ignorant and slow, but I understand what it means to obey the husband when a woman is married.

551
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,460
Once I enter the Duke of Hedong Manor,

552
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,710
I will naturally do whatever Grand Princess orders

553
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,170
and I definitely won't be disloyal.

554
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:40,370
You are clever.

555
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,870
Then let me remind you of something.

556
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:49,250
When you go back, you must prepare it for me.

557
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,680
Yes, I will listen to whatever Grand Princess says.

558
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:59,390
Come, come.

559
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,570
It's starting.

560
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,130
So fun!

561
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:50,760
It's so jovial and bustling outside.

562
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,000
Foster Mother, I was busy dressmaking in the palace.

563
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,520
I have never cut figures.

564
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,750
If I don't cut well, please don't laugh at me.

565
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,820
It's nothing big if you don't cut well.

566
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:07,600
It's just for good luck.

567
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,020
The legend says, when Goddess Nuwa created people,  (Chinese mythology)

568
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:15,270
she created chickens on the first day, dogs on the second day,

569
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:19,980
pigs on the third day, goats on the fourth day,

570
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,510
oxen on the fifth day, horses on the sixth day,

571
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:26,980
and it's on the seventh day that she finally created people.

572
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:32,050
That's why the seventh day of the new year is called, "People's Festival."

573
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:36,640
Every year at this time in Chang'an, in everyone's hair,

574
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,820
on every family's screen,

575
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,520
there will be figures cut from the colorful silk

576
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,750
and the gold and silver foil.

577
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,810
Miss, you have such great skills.

578
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:52,070
The figurines you cut look alive.

579
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,750
You are indeed the successor to Number One Needle in the World.

580
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,570
You are so clever.

581
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,490
Ever since I was young,

582
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:03,490
my scissor-cutting skills have been considered good.

583
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:08,520
But now, when I place mine next to the beauty you cut,

584
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,250
it can only sweep the floor and hold the horse's leash for her.

585
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:15,780
Foster Mother is joking. Foster Mother cuts better.

586
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,440
Come, show me.

587
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:39,360
Go. Send it to Lord Magistrate Pei next door.

588
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,030
Let him cherish these.

589
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,660
Yes.

590
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,800
A'Cheng just sent this over.

591
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,940
A'Cheng said the gold-foil figure was made

592
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,640
by Lord Pei for Miss  Kudi by himself.

593
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,300
He asked Miss Kudi to accept it.

594
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,410
In a few days, it will be your wedding.

595
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:22,370
From then on, you will be together every day.

596
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:26,190
But don't become the weaver girl and the cowherd. (The couple in the fairy tale can only meet once a year)

597
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:31,090
I would become the Celestial Empress who separated the couple.
