[Weaving a Tale of Love]

3
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,110
[Episode 35]

4
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,630
Your Highness, it's people from the East Palace.

5
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,390
Shouldn't the East Palace's troops be inside the Black Tortoise Gate now?

6
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,670
I'm afraid we've been trapped by the crown prince.

7
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,450
Pei Xingjian, aren't you afraid of dying?

8
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,500
Prince of Cao, you should worry more about your own life.

9
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,100
Guards, take down the rebels and await His Majesty's decision.

10
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,510
- Yes!
- Yes!

11
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,910
- How dare you!
- Why can't he?

12
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,900
Prince of Cao, Li Ming, raises troops without authorization at the Black Tortoise Gate.

13
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,030
All the officers and soldiers at the Black Tortoise Gate,

14
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,200
and the two Ministers-Regent Zhangsun Wuji and Zhu Suiliang are witnesses. The evidence is confirmed.

15
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,030
Anyone can take down rebels and kill them. Take down the rebels!

16
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,640
Yes.

17
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,780
Wait!

18
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,560
[It's time to take action]

19
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,020
Both of you must not be fooled by Li Zhi's treacherous scheme.

20
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,300
The rebel that should be executed is clearly Li Zhi.

21
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,970
His Majesty has discovered the truth about him.

22
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,700
He has written a decree to pass the throne to me.

23
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,600
If you two don't believe it, you can just go to the palace with me

24
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,740
and see His Majesty together.

25
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,130
Right or wrong, truth or lies,

26
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,400
you will see at that time!

27
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,890
Pure nonsense! I am the crown prince proclaimed by His Majesty himself

28
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,280
as Great Tang's successor.

29
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,040
A few days ago, His Majesty appointed Zhangsun Wuji and Zhu Suiliang as Ministers-Regent

30
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,990
to assist me in governing state affairs.

31
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,260
Everyone in the nation knows about this.

32
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,020
When has His Majesty ever said that he will pass the throne to you?

33
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,570
This is pure nonsense!

34
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,090
Li Zhi,

35
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,340
those took place before His Majesty discovered the truth about you.

36
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,200
You have been exposed in front of His Majesty.

37
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,470
His Majesty has discovered that you've always harbored treason.

38
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,500
Why would he still pass the throne to you?

39
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,570
Crown Prince and Prince of Cao each state a different story.

40
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,380
We are willing to follow the two princes to the palace

41
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,740
- and ask His Majesty to make a judgment.
- Right!

42
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,510
The best way is to go to the palace together and see His Majesty

43
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,570
and let him make the judgment. What I wonder is whether Li Zhi

44
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,580
has the guts to go see His Majesty together?

45
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,800
What a joke! I am honest and upstanding. Why wouldn't I dare?

46
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,270
As it is, let's all enter the palace together.

47
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,030
We'll ask His Majesty to judge.

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,740
[It's time to take action]

49
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,800
Why are you still dawdling? Hurry and feed the medicine to His Majesty.

50
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,660
Prince of Cao, Crown Prince, and Zhangsun Wuji and Zhu Suiliang

51
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,230
are coming over here with people now.

52
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,170
This way.

53
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,160
It's here.

54
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,400
Pei Xingjian is indeed right.

55
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,500
This person is the one who can stop our addiction.

56
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,950
All these many years, in this jail cell,

57
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,850
other than the Prince of Cao, Li Ming, and the food delivery maid,

58
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,300
there has never been anyone else who has come here.

59
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,970
Who are you people?

60
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,180
I and a young lady here

61
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,370
have been suffering thanks to the poison you made.

62
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:30,640
We've been looking for you. Of course, it's to get antidotes to eliminate our addiction.

63
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,210
Senior, looking at your situation,

64
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,280
we can see that you've been imprisoned by the Prince of Cao here.

65
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,210
You must have been forced by the Prince of Cao to make the poison to harm people.

66
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,450
If you help to detoxify us, we will rescue you out of here.

67
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,080
From now on, you won't need to harm people anymore. How about it?

68
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,500
You can believe me or not,

69
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,760
but the poison in your bodies is incurable.

70
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,750
They imprisoned me here to make the poison,

71
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,610
but they have never asked me to make the antidotes.

72
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,180
As for me, I've long been a living dead.

73
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,800
I have never thought of leaving here.

74
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,430
What good is the antidote to me?

75
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,820
Everyone, listen to the imperial decree.

76
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,840
This son and subordinate receive the decree.

77
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:44,570
The imperial decree is here. Why don't all of you kneel immediately to receive the decree?

78
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,970
Are you disobeying the decree?

79
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,890
His Majesty has decreed, Crown Prince Li Zhi

80
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,550
is atrocious, rebellious, has committed patricide,

81
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,060
has betrayed the nation and the monarch, so is immediately abolished as the crown prince.

82
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:18,600
Prince of Cao is both talented and virtuous, extremely sincere and filial.

83
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,940
As I am lingering upon death, I wish to protect and support the nation from disaster.

84
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,940
I respectfully announce to Heaven, Earth, ancestors, and all people

85
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,400
that I proclaim Li Ming as Crown Prince

86
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,210
to be installed in the East Palace and inherit the throne.

87
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,440
This son and subordinate accept the decree.

88
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,270
His Majesty must have been fooled by the treacherous.

89
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,020
How could I have committed patricide?

90
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,930
Furthermore, I couldn't have committed any conspiracy.

91
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,860
I want to see His Majesty.

92
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,920
The imperial decree is here. Li Zhi, how dare you disobey the decree.

93
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,650
Guards, arrest Li Zhi.

94
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,050
If he disobeys, execute him without mercy.

95
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,910
Who would dare?

96
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,890
To tell you the truth, His Majesty has already passed.

97
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,260
Impossible. Impossible.

98
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,160
Heaven blesses Great Tang so that, before His Majesty passed,

99
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,890
he found out that Li Zhi bribed the previous Director of the Directorate of Eunuchs, Gao Quan,

100
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,170
to poison his imperial father.

101
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,630
Therefore, he installed a different crown prince and entrusted the nation

102
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,070
to Prince of Cao, Li Ming, who is both intelligent and virtuous.

103
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,390
This is impossible.

104
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,290
I don't believe it. I want to see His Majesty.

105
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,990
His Majesty's death is absolutely true.

106
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,530
It's all thanks to you and Gao Quan uniting to poison him.

107
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,560
Consort Yang, murdering His Majesty is such a high crime.

108
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,620
How can the crown prince be accused of such a charge

109
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,850
with just your words?

110
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,580
This old minister is the lead Minister-Regent,

111
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,630
but I have never heard His Majesty mention this matter.

112
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,070
As for the last decree, whether it's real or fake,

113
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,600
it must be inspected for confirmation.

114
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,800
How Li Zhi bribed Gao Quan to poison His Majesty,

115
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,160
how His Majesty discovered

116
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,980
and was heartbroken yet considered for the sake of his people

117
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,820
that he changed the crown prince despite his sickly body, the entire process

118
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,860
is all known to the current Director of Directorate of Eunuchs, Pan Qinhai.

119
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,920
He can bear witness.

120
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,300
Pan Qinhai, it's time for you to be loyal to His Majesty

121
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,570
and expose Li Zhi's true face to everyone now.

122
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,700
Your Majesty, please just take me along with you

123
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,380
to the other side.

124
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,200
Let me continue to serve you.

125
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,020
Consort Yang, spare me. Consort Yang, spare me.

126
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,550
Even though I am greedy and vain,

127
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,480
I have never had anyone's blood on my hands.

128
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,890
How could I dare to commit regicide?

129
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,890
Useless fool.

130
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:35,890
As things are now, do you think you'll be free even if you don't personally feed him the poison?

131
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,690
Not to mention Pan Qinhai who can't even speak a complete sentence now,

132
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,330
even if he opens his mouth to speak,

133
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,400
how are one eunuch's words believable?

134
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,620
Crown Prince is right. Consort Yang,

135
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,360
you mentioned two things:

136
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,640
Crown Prince's patricide, as well as installing Prince of Cao as Crown Prince.

137
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,510
They are both too serious.

138
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:04,300
Excuse us old ministers that we cannot be convinced solely by your words.

139
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,930
Zhangsun Wuji, what do you mean?

140
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:10,090
Crown Prince rebels, so you also follow him to rebel?

141
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,430
Or perhaps you are already colluding with him.

142
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:18,450
He commits regicide and you participated?

143
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,070
Don't keep talking about those grandiose reasons.

144
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,990
When you kill, you pay with your life. When you owe a debt, you pay the money back.

145
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,980
You made the poison, so you should detoxify it.

146
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,460
If you don't find a solution,

147
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,010
I will let you live where you wish you were dead but can't die.

148
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,960
Let him go.

149
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,070
Senior, I know that you don't want to go out.

150
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,700
You also don't fear death.

151
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,650
But you said you committed sins.

152
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,830
I can tell that you are not someone without a conscience.

153
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,030
You were forced to make poison to harm people.

154
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,990
I still remember when I was young,

155
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:59,150
Mother told me the story of Zhou Chu killing the three monsters.

156
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,400
My memory is limited, but I still recall two sentences.

157
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,120
One was: When I want to study hard but I am already getting old,

158
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,500
I fear that I won't achieve.

159
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,100
The other was: The ancients value understanding wisdom so much even if one learns in the morning and dies at night.

160
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,210
Besides one's future is still open,

161
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,340
what one should fear is not having a goal,

162
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,460
why fear one that cannot establish a good reputation?

163
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,110
Senior, you possess unique medical knowledge.

164
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,030
I would like to plead with you to think of a solution

165
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,070
to save the two of us.

166
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,430
It can also serve as redemption for your sins.

167
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,810
Your mother must have been

168
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,440
a compassionate and knowledgeable person.

169
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,340
The story she told me is very good.

170
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,890
Liuli's mother was Attire Expert An of the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

171
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,690
She was harmed by evil people.

172
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:52,300
Liuli wanted to avenge her mother and ended up this way now.

173
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,250
You are... Attire Expert An's daughter?

174
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,020
Yes. Senior,

175
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,400
did you know my mother?

176
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,760
More than knowing her,

177
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,560
your mother and I were close friends.

178
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,750
Years ago, I was the best pharmacist in the palace.

179
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:17,460
Attire Expert An was the best dressmaker.

180
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,410
We both got tired of living in the palace

181
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,730
and wanted to resign our jobs and leave the palace

182
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,580
to live an ordinary life.

183
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,240
Not long after, your mother left the palace,

184
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,240
and I also resigned from my position.

185
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,400
Unexpectedly, just as I left the palace,

186
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,530
I was captured by the Prince of Cao

187
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,640
and jailed in this dungeon

188
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,320
to make poisons for him.

189
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,000
Later, my eyes gradually became blind.

190
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,250
I continued to be forced by him every day

191
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,160
to commit sins.

192
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,430
You are the Medicine King from years ago?

193
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,580
- You are...
- Medicine King,

194
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,730
I am Sun Decheng of the Courtyard of Misfortune.

195
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,610
Do you still remember me?

196
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:10,110
Eunuch Sun, I remember. Of course, I remember.

197
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,050
Senior, rest assured, we will rescue you

198
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,860
and go to His Majesty to expose Prince of Cao's evil doings.

199
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,130
His Majesty?

200
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,710
Prince of Cao is vicious. He made me concoct a poison

201
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,190
to be used on His Majesty.

202
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,600
I'm afraid it's today.

203
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,910
This old minister watched Crown Prince grow up.

204
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,590
Crown Prince is kind and compassionate. His Majesty is very fond of him.

205
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,220
This old minister will never believe

206
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,500
that Crown Prince would commit regicide and rebellion.

207
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,740
If anyone dares to set up a scheme to frame the crown prince

208
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,760
and stain the crown prince's innocence and embroil him in dishonor and disloyalty,

209
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,680
we ministers will never stand by and watch.

210
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,820
Zhangsun Wuji, you are the older brother of Late Empress Zhangsun

211
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,490
and Li Zhi's own uncle, of course you would take his side.

212
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,910
Who's to know that maybe you are the mastermind behind Li Zhi's regicide?

213
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,490
Li Zhi poisons His Majesty. Of course, it's because he couldn't wait

214
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,040
and wants to ascend the throne sooner.

215
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,220
Today, I will clean house for His Majesty.

216
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,970
Guards, take down Zhangsun Wuji and Li Zhi

217
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,850
- together!
- Yes!

218
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,390
How dare you!

219
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,100
Zhu Suiliang!

220
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,570
If you dare block them, you will be arrested, too!

221
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:29,870
Consort Yang, this old minister has counseled His Majesty for more than 30 years.

222
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,980
I am deeply trusted by His Majesty.

223
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,700
I was also appointed by His Majesty as a Minister-Regent.

224
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,970
I'm not someone that you can smear and denigrate based on your words without evidence.

225
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:43,800
Pan Qinhai, Dan Qing, Qing Hua can all prove what my mother said.

226
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,740
The handwriting on the decree can be confirmed by court ministers.

227
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,780
Handwriting can be faked.

228
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,570
The eunuchs and palace servants are your people.

229
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:57,210
How are they believable as witnesses?

230
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,270
Stop! Who are you?

231
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,230
Xiao Douzi is here to see Consort Yang.

232
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:05,090
Crown Prince, I have something urgent to report.

233
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,160
His Majesty has passed away. Miscellaneous people are—

234
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,000
Let her come in.

235
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,920
Xiao Douzi, didn't you say you had something urgent to report to me?

236
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,490
Speak.

237
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,640
His Majesty isn't dead.

238
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,640
As long as we all go see His Majesty,

239
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,030
who is rebellious, who is loyal, His Majesty will be able to judge.

240
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,070
What nonsense is that?

241
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,210
I am not speaking nonsense.

242
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,160
Whether HIs Majesty is alive or dead,

243
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,370
who wants to murder His Majesty,

244
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,660
as long as we all go to His Majesty,

245
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,830
everything will be cleared up.

246
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,460
His Majesty has passed. How dare you spew nonsense here?

247
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,400
Guards, drag her out and cane her to death.

248
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,030
Impudent!

249
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,230
Don't forget that we are in front of the Hall of Immortal Nectar.

250
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,440
Consort Yang, you are going to openly

251
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,950
kill someone to shut them up?

252
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,350
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

253
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:57,490
Your Majesty, can you hear this old minister speak?

254
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,650
Your Majesty...

255
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:09,660
This old minister came too late.

256
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,450
Imperial Father,

257
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,400
wake up. Take another look at me.

258
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,160
Imperial Father.

259
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,400
Prince of Cao forced me to make so many poisons.

260
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,590
After all, I am a medical practitioner.

261
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,630
I detest killing and harming people.

262
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,890
Besides, Prince of Cao wanted to kill His Majesty.

263
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,660
So, in the poison that Prince of Cao forced me to make,

264
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,760
I played a trick.

265
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,560
What I gave Prince of Cao wasn't poison,

266
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,150
but sleep-inducing,

267
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,480
comforting pills.

268
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,320
Thank you for your kindness, Senior.

269
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,480
On behalf of Crown Prince, Pei Xingjian,

270
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,540
and all of Great Tang's people, I thank you.

271
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,440
Don't rush to thank me.

272
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,100
After all, I was a friend of your mother's.

273
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,510
I don't want to endanger you, either.

274
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,530
Listen to my advice. Don't get involved in this mess.

275
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,700
His Majesty is near the end of his natural life.

276
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,370
Right now, he cannot withstand any trouble.

277
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,820
He can pass away anytime.

278
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,820
If you go to the palace now, and if you are unlucky

279
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,710
and His Majesty happens to die,

280
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,750
you would be wasting your life for nothing.

281
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,670
Even if it's a mountain of blades or a sea of flames, I still have to go.

282
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,450
I cannot see the crown prince and Pei Xingjian fall into a trap.

283
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,360
I have to save them.

284
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,270
What else is there to say?

285
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,830
Guards!

286
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,690
Notify the entire palace that His Majesty has passed away.

287
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,920
Prepare for his funeral.

288
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,460
How dare you!

289
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,610
What do you want to do?

290
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,980
I am a medical officer, so I can take His Majesty's pulse.

291
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,530
There are many imperial physicians in the palace. You don't get to do it.

292
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:25,120
Xiao Douzi, come here.

293
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,440
His Majesty still has a pulse.

294
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,900
His Majesty isn't dead!

295
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,580
Impossible...

296
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,500
- How is it possible?
- Consort Yang.

297
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,630
Your Majesty.

298
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,980
What is happening?

299
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,330
It's so noisy.

300
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,500
- Your Majesty.
- Why are you all here?

301
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,300
Your Majesty, you are awake?

302
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,950
He's alive.

303
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:40,210
Long live Your Majesty for ten thousand years and many more!

304
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:50,820
We survived the danger. We survived the danger.

305
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,560
Zhi'er, why are you crying?

306
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,730
You are the future emperor of Great Tang.

307
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,910
Crying like this will make you a laughingstock.

308
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,840
Your Majesty, if you didn't wake up,

309
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,170
Crown Prince would have been framed and killed.

310
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,050
What do you mean?

311
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,140
Your Majesty, you didn't know about this.

312
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,510
Just now Consort Yang already announced your death

313
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,960
and also read a last decree

314
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,270
that abolished Crown Prince Li Zhi to be jailed forever,

315
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:28,040
and installed the Prince of Cao as the crown prince.

316
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,710
Slowly, Your Majesty.

317
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,260
Slowly.

318
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,260
Did this really happen?

319
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:58,310
Falsifying an imperial decree to install another crown prince?

320
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:02,150
Announce that I already passed away?

321
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:05,210
And then what were you going to do with me?

322
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,970
Strangle me to death? Poison me to death?

323
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,860
No, no, no.

324
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,600
Your Majesty is wise.

325
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,200
Please look at this.

326
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:42,580
Your Majesty, please allay your anger. I am ignorant

327
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,350
and really believed that you had passed.

328
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,900
I was so sad

329
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,770
and couldn't help but announce the news.

330
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:54,550
As for the last decree, it is because...

331
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,790
because I discovered that Crown Prince intended to rebel.

332
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,810
He is not loyal nor filial.

333
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,450
But as a woman in the inner palace,

334
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,850
all the court officials are close to the crown prince.

335
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,680
They obviously wouldn't listen to me.

336
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,200
For the sake of Great Tang and its people,

337
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,090
I couldn't help but come up with this plan.

338
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,620
In other words, I should thank you and the son

339
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,750
for your wholehearted loyalty to me

340
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,080
and will organize my funeral?

341
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,410
Your Majesty! Your Majesty, don't get agitated.

342
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:30,080
I am fine.

343
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,070
I won't die yet, for now.

344
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,530
The evidence is irrefutable.

345
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:49,020
Your Majesty, what I say is true.

346
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,490
Crown Prince conspired to rebel, but Your Majesty was unconscious.

347
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,930
I temporarily lost my sense of judgment

348
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,140
and wanted to discipline Crown Prince on behalf of Your Majesty.

349
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,960
You keep saying that Crown Prince conspired to rebel.

350
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,700
Do you have any proof?

351
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,760
Under his cape, Crown Prince is wearing a dragon robe.

352
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,750
His conspiratorial intention is clear.

353
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,600
Your Majesty is wise. Just inspect it now

354
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,100
and my words will be proven true.

355
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,140
[Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m., Prince of Cao will raise troops at Black Tortoise Gate]

356
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,210
[Tricks]

357
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,870
This "Dou" word is different from what Xiao Douzi previously embroidered.

358
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,830
Why is there an extra dot?

359
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,180
This is where it is extra.

360
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,450
This serpant robe has an extra toe on the claw.

361
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,310
A serpent has four-toe claws.

362
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,900
A dragon has five-toe claws. Prince of Cao and his mother are so vicious.

363
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,340
This is almost an unnoticeable point.

364
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,230
If I were to wear this robe, I would be conspiring to rebel.

365
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,650
Xiao Douzi must have been forced. She couldn't help it

366
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:17,250
so thought of this idea to remind Your Highness.

367
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,720
Luckily Xiao Douzi is smart.

368
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,320
Also, luckily that you saw through Xiao Douzi's puzzle.

369
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,010
Otherwise,

370
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,010
I would be sent down to the abyss.

371
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,000
Your Majesty, I am wearing a serpent robe with four-toe claws.

372
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,710
I have never harbored any intent to be unfilial and disloyal.

373
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,360
Why would I overstep boundaries on my clothing?

374
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:56,170
Consort Yang, you saw it all.

375
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,380
Do you have anything else to say?

376
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:22,110
Prince of Cao, your manor's troops have all been arrested.

377
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,260
You lost. Don't waste any effort now.

378
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,210
Your Majesty, as it is now, the truth has been revealed.

379
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,750
The conspirator isn't His Highness the Crown Prince,

380
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,070
but Prince of Cao and Consort Yang.

381
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:44,620
What a waste that I favored you for so many years.

382
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:49,210
You would actually commit such an immoral high crime.

383
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,540
You disappoint me so much!

384
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:02,540
Your Majesty, Prince of Cao shot a whistle arrow in the courtyard just now

385
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,550
to send a signal to his troops that are stationed outside Taiji Palace.

386
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:09,560
He got taken down by Imperial Guard Leader Pei Xingjian and is awaiting your decision.

387
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,620
Consort Yang.

388
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:23,990
Fine. Fine.

389
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:28,260
What a good son that I loved for many years!

390
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,720
Good son.

391
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,400
Good son...

392
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,940
Your Majesty.

393
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,560
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

394
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,260
All the conspiracy today

395
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,870
was committed by me alone.

396
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,730
It has nothing to do with Ming'er.

397
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,520
I am afflicted with a serious illness and won't have much time left.

398
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:10,950
I know that my status in the inner palace is low.

399
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:17,060
Even though I received Your Majesty's affection, but I was often criticized.

400
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:22,010
With Your Majesty around, others won't dare to do anything to Ming'er.

401
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,870
But...

402
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,860
both our bodies

403
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:31,220
won't last long.

404
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:36,320
Ming'er and the crown prince haven't been close.

405
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,380
I have been afraid

406
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,550
that after we are gone,

407
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,170
Ming'er might lose his life.

408
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,610
That's why I came up with this bad plan.

409
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,770
Your Majesty, please be merciful.

410
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,050
Just punish me, only me.

411
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:58,080
In consideration of your father-son relationship,

412
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,040
spare Ming'er.

413
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,040
What I've been most afraid of

414
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:20,030
still happened.

415
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,150
Transmit my edict.

416
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,760
Separately imprison Consort Yang and Prince of Cao.

417
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:42,670
Let Crown Prince thoroughly investigate this incident.

418
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,460
This is my family affair.

419
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:50,780
The imperial family's scandal, if spread outside,

420
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,800
will damage the dynasty's dignity.

421
00:33:55,410 --> 00:34:00,550
All my advisors... watch your mouths.

422
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,500
Do not reveal anything to the outside.

423
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,870
We obey Your Majesty's edict.

424
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,270
[Hall of Immortal Nectar]

425
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,630
I can't believe this happened.

426
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,580
Be careful.

427
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,770
- Your Highness.
- Be careful.

428
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,920
- Xiao Douzi!
- Xiao Douzi.

429
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,430
Summon the imperial physician to the East Palace.

430
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,540
- Hurry!
- Yes.

431
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,440
Your Highness, don't be impatient.

432
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,760
Both imperial physicians are here from the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

433
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,320
Your Highness, don't be overly concerned.

434
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,420
Summon the imperial physicians.

435
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,880
My medical skills are weak.

436
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,990
I dare not speak nonsense.

437
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:24,220
Replying to Your Highness. My medical skills are not strong.

438
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,030
I really don't care to speak nonsense to you.

439
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,060
Imperial Physicians, you know my temper.

440
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:38,420
I detest those who try to protect their positions but hide the truth.

441
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,810
No matter what difficulty is involved with Xiao Douzi's illness,

442
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:43,030
please go ahead and candidly tell me.

443
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,950
To be honest with you,

444
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,720
this Xiao Douzi

445
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,140
has saved my life several times, so I regard him highly.

446
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,690
If you dare to hide anything about his illness,

447
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:56,350
I will severely punish you.

448
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,720
If you don't explain to me about Xiao Douzi's illness,

449
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,500
then don't dream of leaving the East Palace.

450
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,280
- Your Highness, please forgive us.
- Your Highness, please forgive us.

451
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,970
Speak!

452
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,260
This subject deserves to die.

453
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,890
I do not dare poke into Your Highness' privacy

454
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,020
and only wish to save the patient.

455
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,960
I boldly ask Your Highness to confirm.

456
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,770
Xiao Douzi is a woman, right?

457
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:39,030
Male and female bodies are naturally different.

458
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,560
Before a medical practitioner prescribes medication,

459
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,280
if we cannot distinguish if the patient is male or female,

460
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,040
we cannot cure the illness

461
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,750
and save the life.

462
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,150
This... Xiao Douzi

463
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:55,210
is a man. How can he be a woman?

464
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:58,820
Your Highness, men tend to have

465
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,380
abundant yang energy, while women have

466
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,400
stronger yin energy.

467
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,650
Based on the pulse, Xiao Douzi

468
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,460
must be a female.

469
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:16,880
This is a serious matter. You two imperial physicians had better not be mistaken.

470
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,140
Does Your Highness really not know that Xiao Douzi is a woman?

471
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,780
We see how Your Highness is concerned about Xiao Douzi,

472
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,290
so we thought you had an unspeakable difficulty

473
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,970
and deliberately hid the fact that Xiao Douzi was a woman.

474
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:34,790
But Xiao Douzi is seriously ill now. If we cannot ascertain her gender,

475
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:39,770
we really don't dare to randomly prescribe medications.

476
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,200
Your Highness, Prince of Cao's rebel troops have been taken care of.

477
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,330
They are being questioned by the Court of Judicial Review.

478
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,030
Your Highness, Xiao Douzi is indeed a woman.

479
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:09,980
The situation is urgent. Please save Xiao Douzi's life first, Imperial Physicians.

480
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,210
As for the hidden reason,

481
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,850
please allow me to report to you, Your Highness.

482
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,960
Xiao Douzi is a woman?

483
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,460
Shouyue, what is going on?

484
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,020
Tell me quickly.

485
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,460
You heard what we said.

486
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,560
Xiao Douzi is female. She is a woman.

487
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,270
I'll entrust Xiao Douzi to you two.

488
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,790
Please do your best to save her regardless of cost.

489
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:36,130
- Shouyue, follow me.
- Yes.

490
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,750
Your Highness, this is Liuli's background.

491
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:46,610
She hid her identity, and her helplessness and sadness in hiding in the palace.

492
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,840
I have told you all about it.

493
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:56,450
I plead with Your Highness to consider how Liuli, despite her powerless situation, still upholds justice

494
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:00,850
and has saved Your Highness many times. Please forgive her crime of deceiving you.

495
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:06,170
Shouyue, do you understand

496
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:10,080
how happy I am to find that Xiao Douzi is a woman?

497
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,000
Your Highness, you won't fault Liuli?

498
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,920
Of course not.

499
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:21,610
On behalf of Liuli, I thank Your Highness for your generous kindness.

500
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,900
Not only won't I blame Liuli,

501
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,010
on the contrary, Liuli's grievance,

502
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:33,280
her mother's grievance, I will take charge for her.

503
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,690
Shouyue, you are right.

504
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,050
Liuli has been powerless and endangered,

505
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,690
but she has strived to live positively

506
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:45,200
and has never given up pursuing the truth and facts.

507
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,150
I will not disappoint her.

508
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,660
Thank you, Your Highness.

509
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,510
Shouyue. A'Sheng.

510
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,910
I want the two of you to separately do something for me.

511
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,990
- Yes.
- Yes.

512
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,030
How is it now?

513
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,390
I just fed her medicine.

514
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,750
The two imperial physicians said, whether she will wake up, we need to wait

515
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,200
and see how the medicine takes effect.

516
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,720
- You can leave.
- Yes.

517
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,720
His Majesty isn't dead.

518
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,280
His Majesty isn't dead. His Majesty isn't dead.

519
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,660
Crown Prince has been framed.

520
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,980
Crown Prince has been framed.

521
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,760
Liuli,

522
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,410
I am fine.

523
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:51,030
His Majesty is fine, too.

524
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:54,640
Don't worry, just rest well.

525
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:00,240
♫  The night is quiet and the sky is clear  ♫

526
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,240
♫  When I'm next to you  ♫

527
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:12,300
♫  In the middle of the night the moon worries  ♫

528
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:17,250
♫  It has nothing to do with you  ♫

529
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:24,330
♫  The long journey is long and quiet  ♫

530
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:30,410
♫  Slowly appearing like ripples  ♫

531
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:36,220
♫  To imitate the sorrow of fate and entering the spring river  ♫

532
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:42,430
♫  Like stumbling along the way  ♫

533
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:49,780
Why haven't I ever thought that you were a woman?

534
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,280
I should have realized a long time ago.

535
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,110
You are so good-looking.

536
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,190
How could there be such a good-looking man in this world?

537
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:06,740
♫  I hope I’m your shining star  ♫

538
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:12,630
♫  The silk cotton tree swaying in
the evening breeze is romantic  ♫

539
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,290
♫  My thoughts are silent but with a sigh it becomes waves  ♫

540
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:18,370
♫  My thoughts are silent but with a sigh it becomes waves  ♫

541
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:21,390
♫  It's hard to return to the past, but we can use the paper from agarwood tree to write a poem letter  ♫

542
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:24,800
♫  It's hard to return to the past, but we can use the paper from agarwood tree to write a poem letter  ♫

543
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,750
♫  As the drizzle rain complains to the brokenhearted  ♫

544
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,890
That day, others thought I was hurt by the enchanting incense.

545
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:56,350
But I know that...

546
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,270
I was truly moved.

547
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:11,630
How can enchanting incense so easily confuse my heart and mind?

548
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,960
It's so laughable.

549
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,640
Ever since then, I felt uncertain every day.

550
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,970
I wanted to see you but was afraid of seeing you.

''Moon Legend'' - Singer: Zhou Shen

553
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:52,330
♫  Watching the flowers bloom and fall in the courtyard  ♫

554
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:58,250
♫  How many loves, regrets, entanglements, separations,
reunions must we go through together  ♫

555
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:02,300
♫  Uncover the vicious cycle of the past  ♫

556
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:07,710
♫  Fate has its uncertainties  ♫

557
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:12,750
♫  I've spent this life with brush and ink in hand  ♫

558
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:18,420
♫  Writing about what love is  ♫

559
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,640
♫  Borrow from the relenting of the night  ♫

560
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:29,550
♫  To exchange for the certainty of a promise  ♫

561
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:35,280
♫  There are too many bumpy roads along the way  ♫

562
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,470
♫  The more twists, the deeper it is  ♫

563
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:45,190
♫  Breaking up and making up is like an illusion  ♫

564
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:51,080
♫  Resembles a traveler traveling through this life  ♫

565
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:56,750
♫  Time ignores everything including obsession  ♫

566
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:01,990
♫  With the candlelight flickering indefinitely  ♫

567
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:05,650
♫  With the candlelight flickering indefinitely  ♫

568
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:15,490
♫  A bright moon that makes one's heart tingle  ♫

569
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:19,440
♫  After the fire, there was only one thing left  ♫

570
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:30,030
♫  A bright moon that makes one's heart tingle  ♫
