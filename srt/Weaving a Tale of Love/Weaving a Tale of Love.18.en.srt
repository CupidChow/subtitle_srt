[Hall of Esteemed Virtues]

5
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,740
It is my fault.

6
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,020
Please forgive me, Crown Prince. I will apply medicine for you again.

7
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,910
Imperial Physician Zong, you may leave.

8
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,820
A'Sheng will apply the medicine for me.

9
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,990
Your Highness's order,

10
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,610
I wish to treat you well.

11
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,240
I don't dare to belittle it.

12
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,500
Since it is like this,

13
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,940
then I will report to him that your skills are not well.

14
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,840
So that he can ask another imperial physician to come instead.

15
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,940
Crown Prince, I... I... I...

16
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,630
Imperial Physician Zhong, Crown Prince asked you to rest because he thinks you are tired.

17
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,830
I can do something small like applying medicine.

18
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,590
Thank you, Crown Prince. Then please apply it well.

19
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,010
Please.

20
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,130
I am taking my leave.

21
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,620
Throw away all these things!

22
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,960
Please don't get mad, Your Highness.

23
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,580
Prince Cao dares to kill me so openly.

24
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,510
And he even wants to place his person in my palace.

25
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,630
Who knows if he will do it again?!

26
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,750
Your Highness, if you are not willing to use the imperial physician's medicine,

27
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,530
what about your wound? It is still bleeding.

28
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,370
It is almost going to be night.

29
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,830
- Where can we find a doctor?
- But it is better than dying randomly because of him!

30
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,240
Talented Lady Wu asks to meet with you.

31
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,020
I heard that you had gotten injured.

32
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,450
I came specifically to visit you.

33
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,850
Thank you for your concern.

34
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,410
This is a famous doctor in Chang'an, Physician Lu.

35
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,410
He is also generation alliances with the Wu Family.

36
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,450
If anyone in the Wu Family is not well,

37
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,550
we all ask him to treat us.

38
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,080
Today, I heard that you had gotten hurt.

39
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,730
Therefore, I specifically asked Physician Lu to come here to help.

40
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,780
His skills and personality,

41
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,030
I trust all of it.

42
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,800
If it's someone you trust, I also give my trust.

43
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,220
Greetings, Crown Prince.

44
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,890
Please, Physician Lu.

45
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,100
It hurts.

46
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,020
The arrow went deep into your arm.

47
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,520
But it's a good thing there was no poison on the arrow, so it is not a big issue.

48
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,890
I will give you a prescription; drink it.

49
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,920
After three days, your wound will heal itself.

50
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,240
After a month, then your arm can be like normal again.

51
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,220
Shulan, hurry up and take Physician Lu to prescribe the medicine.

52
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,840
Yes.

53
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,530
Physician Lu, please come with me.

54
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,820
A'Sheng.

55
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,360
Your Highness.

56
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,610
Give Hua Tian a good burial.

57
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,390
Place his memorial tablet in the temple.

58
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,670
You must take good care of his wife and children.

59
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,130
Hua Tian has been with me for many years, even till his death.

60
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,970
That day at the hunting field, he insisted on exchanging clothes with me.

61
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,010
He was prepared to die for me.

62
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,320
Not only Hua Tian,

63
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,880
also, the other soldiers were killed or injured because of me.

64
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,890
You have to take great care of them.

65
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,350
Yes.

66
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,820
Your Highness, Crown Prince's wound

67
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,580
is really deep. Luckily, it was only the exterior.

68
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,550
The palace also has great medicine to treat it.

69
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,670
As long as he takes the medicine on time and rests well,

70
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:43,180
the crown prince will get well soon.

71
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,580
This servant is here to greet Your Highness Prince of Cao. Greetings, Imperial Physician Zong.

72
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,240
Consort Yang asked me to ask Your Highness to see her at the Hall of Brilliant Joy.

73
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,660
Greetings, Mother.

74
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,340
I just went to see Imperial Phyician Zhong.

75
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,000
Your people came not long after.

76
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,970
You really know my whereabouts well.

77
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,080
I have no time to make excuses.

78
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,400
The crown prince getting injured at the hunting ground, was it your doing?

79
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,840
You went to find Imperial Physician Zong, did you want to use our Yang family's relations

80
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,700
to force him to hurt the crown prince?

81
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,900
You have thought too much, Mother.

82
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,880
Since I know your kinship with Imperial Physician Zong,

83
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,900
I would obviously avoid him.

84
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,280
How would I be stupid enough to ask Imperial Physician Zong to hurt the crown prince?

85
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,400
I went to find him

86
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,590
only to know about the crown prince's wound.

87
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,810
Then, what about the hunting ground?

88
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,260
You are admitting it?

89
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,290
I don't dare to hide it from you.

90
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,620
It was my doing.

91
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,490
You really have gone mad.

92
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,310
You are so daring and don't care about the consequences.

93
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,750
What can I do about you?

94
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,720
If you really think I should die,

95
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,490
then report me to Your Majesty. I will not blame you.

96
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,640
My life is not as good as Li Zhi's.

97
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,250
He is a weak and feeble person,

98
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,580
but he gets that extraordinarily intelligent Talented Lady Wu to assist him.

99
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,580
Your skills are not worse than that of Talented Lady Wu.

100
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,420
Eleven years ago, the emperor had thoughts about making you the empress,

101
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,570
but you didn't fight or steal.

102
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,110
You didn't think about my future.

103
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,530
If I could have your help,

104
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,610
then how would I be so alone?

105
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,320
How do you want me to help you?

106
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,680
You are willing to help me?

107
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,870
Since it has come to this,

108
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,830
what other choice do I have?

109
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,350
After the incidents with the secret hoarding of armor and the killing in the hunting ground,

110
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,200
You and the crown prince are water and fire.

111
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,370
If you fail, you will for sure face death.

112
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,150
Although you are young,

113
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:50,670
I have raised you since you were young, and think of you as my own.

114
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,410
Is there a mother in the world

115
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,640
that can watch their own child die?

116
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,440
Thank you, Mother.

117
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,200
There may be a wave of bloody battles in the palace.

118
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,380
Remember, you have to keep your distance from Prince Cao,

119
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,260
including the people near him.

120
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,040
For example, his mother, Consort Yang.

121
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,040
Don't show off when there is trouble. Don't make achievements nor mistakes.

122
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,480
This is the basic rule of survival.

123
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,230
Pei Xingjian said that the crown prince is in trouble.

124
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,160
He is right.

125
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,790
It looks like Prince Cao is the one that is making it hard for Crown Prince.

126
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,210
No wonder mother wanted to leave the palace faraway.

127
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,980
This really is not a safe place.

128
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,440
Even the crown prince can encounter danger.

129
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,230
I'm just a little medical officer.

130
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,230
What can I use to avenge Mother?

131
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,100
Maybe I'll just fight them to death.

132
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,860
Female Officer Qiniang.

133
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,780
Female Officer Shulan.

134
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,690
This... Isn't this the two sets of undergarments that were just sent over to the crown prince?

135
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,090
Why are they returned?

136
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,010
How did you do the task?

137
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,670
I have told you many times that on Crown Prince's body, there are wounds.

138
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,670
The opening to the sleeves must be made larger.

139
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,180
In the end, it is still small.

140
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,980
The moment Crown Prince wore it, he complained that it hurt.

141
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,180
Who sewed this clothing? So not caring.

142
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,460
It isn't hard to make the clothing larger,

143
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,240
but it might not look good on the crown prince.

144
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,090
Just make it larger.

145
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,590
Why do you ask so much? We have our own reasons.

146
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,730
Yes, I was careless.

147
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,180
Don't worry, Female Officer Shulan, I will tell them to make it again.

148
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,220
Also, it's not enough to have two sets for one day.

149
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,240
Starting today, add another set.

150
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,930
Yes. After the clothing is finished,

151
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,560
I will quickly send it over.

152
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,840
I am sorry, Qiniang. I will redo it now.

153
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,420
Hao Hao, go to the supply room to see if there is any fabric to make the clothes for Crown Prince.

154
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,040
If there isn't, then go to the Directorate of Eunuchs.

155
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,720
Yes.

156
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,090
I have been making clothes for the crown prince endlessly these days.

157
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,140
I've even delayed the embroidery work for the Yulanpen Festival,

158
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,200
and it still isn't done.

159
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,120
A'Bi, have you finished your sewing work?

160
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,300
You keep walking around, and you aren't afraid of Master getting mad.

161
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,560
Shh!

162
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,510
Can you be quiet? Master is bothered right now.

163
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,660
She asked me to prepare Xuemei Tea

164
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,800
to help clear her mind.

165
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,660
Attire Expert Zhuo has to even use Xuemei Tea to clear her brain?

166
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,670
It looks like she really did encounter a hard task this time.

167
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:53,170
Isn't Master making the dress for Consort Yang to wear in the Yulanpen Festival?

168
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,180
Why is she so annoyed?

169
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,380
Consort Yang has a good temper and never picks on the clothes.

170
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,210
But for whatever reason, she suddenly became serious this time.

171
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,660
She asked Attire Expert Zhuo specifically to design it for her.

172
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,900
Attire Expert Zhuo finished designing the sample and sent it to Hall of Gentle Breeze,

173
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,640
but Consort Yang was still unsatisfied.

174
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,280
She rejected all of them.

175
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,460
What is with Consort Yang?

176
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,780
Unless it is because Talented Lady Wu is being loved by the emperor and doesn't want to lose,

177
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,870
and wants to compete at the Yulanpeng Festival?

178
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,420
Shuang'er!

179
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,420
Go back and get to work.

180
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,370
Sister A'Bi.

181
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,280
Sister A'Bi, just let me do this kind of lowly work like serving tea.

182
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,880
You... just want to climb up when you see Attire Expert Zhuo.

183
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,830
You don't even miss the chance to make tea.

184
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,570
I just want to do some work for you,

185
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,670
and climb up your tall branch.

186
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,850
You are such a sweet talker. No wonder the higher-ups like you.

187
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,510
But... letting you do this type of thing, you can't do it anyway.

188
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,600
Why?

189
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,470
The tea Attire Expert Zhuo uses to clear her mind is not an ordinary tea.

190
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,970
During the coldest time of winter,

191
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,230
Attire Expert Zhuo will always accumulate the snow water from the plum flower petals,

192
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,380
put it in a jug and bury it underground.

193
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,390
Then she will get it out only after it has been covered for 3 years.

194
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,980
Then use the plum tree's roots to boil the snow water.

195
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,470
On a hot day,

196
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,980
brew tea using the plum flowers saved previously,

197
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,820
it can really detoxify the summer heat and the fragrance lingers within the lips.

198
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,420
A sip of tea needs so much work?

199
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,290
Of course, not only can this tea empty your mind,

200
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,320
it can also help you brainstorm creative ideas. One jug of snow water

201
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,700
can only make one pot of tea.

202
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,780
So Attire Expert Zhuo is never willing to let others drink it.

203
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,970
Besides, something like making tea is based on fire.

204
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,590
If the fire is too high or low, it is not good.

205
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:47,240
Such precise work, can you do it?

206
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,120
Sister A'Bi,

207
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,540
I am dumb, but helping you to run errands

208
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,110
and help out, I can still do.

209
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:57,010
Such refined work as making tea should still be done by Sister.

210
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,750
Okay, sure then. Then fetch me the tea water from that house.

211
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,110
It's in a small jar atop the cabinet.

212
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,840
Be careful to not break it.

213
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,440
I know, don't worry.

214
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,890
Xiao Douzi, did you find it yet?

215
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,640
Coming!

216
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,630
I heard that His Majesty is especially interested in this year's Yulanpeng Festival.

217
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,670
The royal harem is using all their efforts

218
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,630
to make this year's garments the best.

219
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,250
This year, Talented Lady Wu is favored and has become Consort Yang's helper at the Yulanpeng Festival.

220
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,640
All the concubines in the palace are looking at her with renewed attention.

221
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,950
She can't stand to lose.

222
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,810
Attire Chief Zhuo's dressmaking skill is already outstanding.

223
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,640
Why is Consort Yang still not satisfied?

224
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,000
That's because you've never seen the skill of Number One Needle in the World, Madam An.

225
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,220
That is called surprising.

226
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,800
Consort Yang compared the previous Attire Expert An and Attire Expert Zhuo...

227
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,850
She says Attire Expert Zhuo's skills are far from her master's.

228
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,750
How can Attire Expert Zhuo not be discouraged?

229
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,500
So what if her skills are good?

230
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,570
My grandpa and mother told me since I was little,

231
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,600
even if your skills are the best,

232
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,480
it can't compare to righteousness.

233
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,050
Madam An was treacherous

234
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,650
and committed acts of conspiracy which ended up harming others and herself.

235
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:57,640
How can a guilty person like this be able to have the title of the world's best embroiderer?

236
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,790
Zhuo Jinniang's death is worth it.

237
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,660
But if she dies like this,

238
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,960
even if I have taken revenge now,

239
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,030
Mother's innocence can never be given back.

240
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,220
Wouldn't Mother's death still not be exonerated?

241
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,170
Sister A'Bi.

242
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:16,420
- What's the matter?
- This tray is too heavy. Let me carry it for you.

243
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,310
No need.

244
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,760
No need. I can hold it myself.

245
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,360
What's wrong with you? You want to take credit so much that you've gone crazy?

246
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,900
Why are you like this? You do something wrong and blame me?!

247
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,250
A'Bi and Xiao Douzi, what's wrong with the two of you?

248
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,120
You guys can cause problems even when making tea.

249
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,760
Qiniang, it is all my fault.

250
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,040
It's nothing to do with Sister A'Bi.

251
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,720
I will make another cup of tea.

252
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,890
It is all your fault, and you are still pretending to be a good person now?

253
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,600
In the future, you don't need to care about my affairs!

254
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,730
Enough, stop talking.

255
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,850
Don't let Master see and give you a spanking.

256
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,900
Boil another cup.

257
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,500
Why am I so unlucky?

258
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,290
The Yulanpeng Festival is coming up soon.

259
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,220
You guys are all busy fighting for favor in the Royal Harem.

260
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,350
I end up with the work that no one likes and is easy to get criticized for.

261
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,270
It was so hard for me to finish fixing it.

262
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,830
If it gets dirty again,

263
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,040
I'll get criticized by Female Officer Shulan again.

264
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,920
I will go for you.

265
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,240
Go to West Market and get two more medicines using this prescription.

266
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,140
- Avoid people.
- Yes.

267
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,290
Eunuch Wang.

268
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,820
Physician Dou, why are you here?

269
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,710
Attire Expert Zhuo likes my dressmaking skill,

270
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,630
so she transferred me from the Courtyard of Misfortune.

271
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,160
So I'm working at the Bureau of Imperial Attire for now.

272
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,520
Eunuch Wang, just call me Xiao Douzi.

273
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,630
I heard the crown prince got injured, so I came to see in the name of sending clothes.

274
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:30,200
How is the crown prince's wound? Is it better?

275
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,190
You have come right on time.

276
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,100
Because his arm is injured, he is angry.

277
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,830
You can help me please him.

278
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,790
You are much better at this than I am.

279
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,530
Wait for him to finish changing medicine.

280
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,700
Crown Prince got injured so deeply.

281
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,270
What does the imperial physician say?

282
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,650
Your Highness doesn't trust the imperial physicians.

283
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,650
It is a doctor Talented Lady Wu found outside the palace.

284
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,250
He says his wound is all right and there was no poison on the arrow.

285
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,330
He prescribed internal and external medications.

286
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,110
Two days ago, he was fine.

287
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,770
Starting from the third day,

288
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,860
the wound started to worsen.

289
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,710
He has a high fever.

290
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,810
Your Highness forbids us to find an imperial physician.

291
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,600
What should we do?

292
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,510
Crown Prince! Crown Prince!

293
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,070
Eunuch Wang, Crown Prince has fainted again!

294
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,800
Your Highness. Your Highness.

295
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,310
Eunuch Wang, even though I'm a sanitation medical offier,

296
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,330
but I have read a few medical books before.

297
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,500
Can I have a look at his wound?

298
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,100
Right. You are also a physician.

299
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,300
Hurry up and have a look.

300
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,920
The wound is rotting, yet it cannot blacken.

301
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,510
This looks like a symptom of poisoning.

302
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:18,910
Last time the doctor said the arrow that wounded the crown prince did not have poison.

303
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,770
Also, after medical help, the wound seemed to get better.

304
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,070
But after two days, it began to worsen.

305
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,070
There must be something fishy within this.

306
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,610
What are things that can come in contact with the crown prince's wound?

307
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,800
It's only medicine, gauze, and undergarments.

308
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,090
The medicine was given by Physician Lu. The effects on the first 2 days were well.

309
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,950
The gauze is from East Palace's supply.

310
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,020
They have all been boiled in water.

311
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,910
The clothes are prepared and sent over by the Bureau of Imperial Attire every day.

312
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,180
Everyone is really careful. There shouldn't be any mistakes.

313
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,090
Reporting to Eunuch. Talented Lady Wu asks to visit.

314
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,500
Hurry up and ask her to come!

315
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,750
How is it? Is Crown Prince better today?

316
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,300
Talented Lady Wu, it's good that you have come.

317
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,990
Crown Prince just fainted. You have to help find a solution.

318
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,170
Xiao Douzi greets Talented Lady Wu.

319
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:14,240
This... I invited the physician from the city.

320
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,630
Why is Crown Prince's wound getting worse and worse?

321
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,680
I don't dare to come up with random ideas anymore.

322
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,110
May I speak up? I heard Eunuch Wang say that

323
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,830
Crown Prince was in good shape two days ago.

324
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,850
It means that the physician was fine.

325
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,140
Perhaps there is a problem somewhere else.

326
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,010
Now that Crown Prince is unconscious, we can't delay.

327
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,470
If the last physician wasn't good, then find another physician.

328
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:39,170
Chang'an is so large, there has to be a good physician.

329
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,050
Xiao Douzi is right.

330
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:44,280
Eunuch Wang, hurry and leave the palace to find Pei Xingjian.

331
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,180
Let him search to find the best physicians in Chang'an

332
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,310
and send them all to the palace to treat Crown Prince.

333
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:53,410
Let several of these physicians diagnose together, they shouldn't be wrong.

334
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,450
If the prescription has no problem,

335
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:58,090
then it has to be another place that has a problem.

336
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:01,120
Let's check it one after another, and we'll definitely find it.

337
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,470
Sure, I'm going to find him now.

338
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,500
When I go back, I'll ask that Physician Lu to come again.

339
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,170
If his prescription has a problem, I won't forgive him.

340
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:15,130
You are smart. Stay by the crown prince here

341
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,840
and don't let anything bad happen.

342
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,410
Yes.

343
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,020
Hey.

344
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,790
Why are your eyes closed?

345
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,990
Are you despising me?

346
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,820
Cro-Crown Prince is awake?

347
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,630
How do you feel? Are you feeling better?

348
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,150
If I close my eyes,

349
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,740
it's because I get dizzy at the sight of blood.

350
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,000
A physician that gets dizzy over blood.

351
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,080
I'm a lousy physician.

352
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,060
I've never seen such a severe wound.

353
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,280
I think dressmaking is still more suitable for me.

354
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,620
I've troubled you.

355
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:55,850
It's not just you. I'm scared, too.

356
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,890
I lost a lot of blood.

357
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,790
I'm afraid that if I sleep, then I won't wake up again.

358
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,160
Xiao Douzi,

359
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,680
I dreamed of my imperial mother just now.

360
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:15,160
Do you think she came here to pick me up?

361
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,290
Of course not!

362
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,320
How do you know she didn't?

363
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,810
When I was very young,

364
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:34,250
my mother died.

365
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,210
My mother was a very smart

366
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,190
and very kind woman.

367
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,480
She always told me that

368
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,220
life was the most precious thing.

369
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,450
But to a mother, her child is even more important than her life.

370
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,320
Therefore, if I'm truly a filial child,

371
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,050
I shouldn't just be good to her.

372
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,890
I also need to treat myself well,

373
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,190
protect myself well.

374
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,900
Only in this way can I let Mother be at ease.

375
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,470
So the late empress's love toward Crown Prince

376
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,400
must be this way, too.

377
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,280
When she came to your dream to visit you,

378
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,100
it was to encourage you.

379
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,630
Therefore, no matter how dangerous the road in front of you is

380
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,680
or how difficult the goal is,

381
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,500
as long as there is still a sliver of hope, we must not easily give up.

382
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,850
We can't disappoint our mothers who are looking down at us from Heaven.

383
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,870
We can't just live safely.

384
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,060
We also live to become what our mothers want us to be.

385
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,010
This is the best comfort to them.

386
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,470
You are right.

387
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,840
I can't disappoint my mother.

388
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,550
But do you know how hard that is?

389
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,420
As the crown prince,

390
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,140
I almost got killed by others,

391
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,510
but I still have to pretend nothing happened and socialize with them.

392
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,450
I am very frustrated,

393
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,200
but I don't know how to vent.

394
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,880
Xiao Douzi,

395
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,580
I remember you were good at taking things easily.

396
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,930
Let me ask you.

397
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,810
If this had happened to you,

398
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,530
could you still let it go?

399
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,920
Evil people wanted me to die, but I didn't die.

400
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,020
Didn't the evil people lose, then?

401
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,220
Therefore, I should go on living even better,

402
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,780
so that those evil people won't be happy.

403
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,210
Ten years aren't too long for a righteous person to seek revenge.

404
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,260
They worry that I will take revenge.

405
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,580
So they live in fear.

406
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,410
That's why they are the ones who should be afraid.

407
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,360
You mean,

408
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,440
the one who harmed me is also afraid now.

409
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,290
Yes, you are right.

410
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,600
When I think this way, I feel much better.

411

[Auspicious Morality Gate]

412
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,620
Young Master Pei, you are taking us to the palace.

413
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,440
Who do you want us to diagnose?

414
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,290
I'll tell you the truth now.

415
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:47,360
The person you're going to meet today is... the crown prince.

416
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,570
This...

417
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:52,530
Crown Prince?

418
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,750
I'll be mean first.

419
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,180
If you can cure the crown prince, there'll be a high reward.

420
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,310
But if you make a mistake,

421
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:03,260
you are holding your entire clan's lives in your hands.

422
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,970
Understand?

423
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,290
- Yes.
- Yes.

424
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,860
Be careful.

425
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,810
Reporting to Your Highness. Your wound is festering without healing, the blood won't stop and looks dark.

426
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:59,090
It is indeed a sign of poisoning.

427
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,160
But when His Highness got injured,

428
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,800
the wound wasn't poisoned.

429
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,020
I've been giving His Highness the best medicine for wounds, there is absolutely no toxin.

430
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,160
If Your Highness doesn't believe me, you can ask these three physicians.

431
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,480
I've looked at Physician Lu's prescription for Your Highness,

432
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,050
and I've looked at the medicine left by Physician Lu, there really isn't anything wrong.

433
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,440
Yes, that's right.

434
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,050
The medicine prescribed by Physician Lu

435
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,610
is the correct medicine for the wound.

436
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,070
Other than being expensive, there is no other problem.

437
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,310
Since the physician's medication has no problem,

438
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,600
why is Crown Prince's wound poisoned?

439
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,900
Your Highness, all the physicians are right.

440
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,390
The medicine, gauze, garment...

441
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,010
Which one of these three things has a problem?

442
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,020
We just need to test.

443
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,130
How do you test?

444
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:14,330
Your Highness, the wound that's covered with the medicine has already stopped bleeding.

445
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:18,330
So this means that Physician Lu's medicine is fine.

446
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,380
The medicine is good.

447
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,680
The gauze and the garment are also fine.

448
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,720
This is so strange.

449
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,430
Your Highness, give me a little more time.

450
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:34,050
I will definitely find out everything.

451
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,030
Hao Hao, go to the supply room and see if there is any fabric to make the crown prince's clothes.

452
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,300
If there isn't any, then go to the Directorate of Eunuchs to get it.

453
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,850
Yes.

454
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,400
I'll go take a look in the supply room.

456
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,230
Who?

457
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,580
Why are you here?

458
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,210
I thought for a long time. I think Crown prince's injury

459
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,230
has something to do with his garment.

460
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,570
That's why I came tonight to the Bureau of Imperial Attire to investigate.

461
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,700
I happened to see that palace maid come in with the fabric.

462
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,360
She looked sneaky the whole way to the supply room.

463
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,290
If you weren't so rash, I would have

464
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,990
already found out which palace she is from.

465
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:03,350
I recognized her. She is Cai Yue, works for Attire Chief Lin.

466
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,050
In that case, Attire Chief Lin probably knows something about this.

467
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,910
How does a mere Attire Chief dare to harm the crown prince?

468
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:18,660
I remember it now. One day, A'Bi and Shuang'er were gossiping.

469
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,540
They were saying that Cao Yue originally came from Prince of Cao's Manor.

470
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:26,160
She clearly doesn't even hold the embroidery needle correctly, but she is popular with Attire Chief Lin.

471
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,490
From Prince of Cao's Manor?

472
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,240
This is right.

00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,840

[Yellow Emperor's medicine journal]

476
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,920
Replying to Crown Prince, the arrow that shot you wasn't poisoned.

477
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,820
The medicine isn't toxic, either.

478
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:08,400
Even the herbs that the fabric is soaked in aren't toxic.

479
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,100
Except that these kinds of herbs are unique.

480
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,740
Once they are used alongside the medicine for the wound,

481
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,310
it will alter the nature of the medicine and spread a toxin.

482
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,750
Even though this toxin won't instantly kill you,

483
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,210
it can leave the wound to bleed and not heal.

484
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:24,180
When the toxin enters the bloodstream, it will make the wound fester

485
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,800
and eventually lead to sepsis.

486
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,890
At that time, even if Hua Tuo were alive, nothing could be done.
(Hua Tuo was a famous physician in ancient China)

487
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:44,790
Through the inside help at the Bureau of Imperial Attire, Prince of Cao was able to poison the crown prince's clothes.

This has been confirmed.

489
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:50,490
My suggestion is that Your Highness should not alert the snake in the grass.

490
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:54,020
You may as well pretend and let Prince of Cao think that he has succeeded.

Your Highness can use this period of time to fully recuperate

00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,100
The wound has already healed. I should be able to move normally in a few days.

521
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,750
It's just that I've been pretending to be still injured, hiding all day in this sleeping chamber.

522
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,180
I'm afraid the wound has recovered, but my brain is dulled.

523
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,350
Crown Prince, please be patient for a few more days.

524
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:05,900
You still need to send people to the Bureau of Imperial Attire and request a new change of clothing every day.

525
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,780
This is the only way to fool Prince of Cao and Consort Yang

526
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,750
- to avoid further trouble.
- Talented Lady Wu, please rest assured.

527
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:15,830
I just went to the Bureau of Imperial Attire yesterday and raised a ruckus.

528
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,750
I said Crown Prince's wound has gotten worse

529
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,670
and told them to make more new clothes.

530
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,670
Very good.

531
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,910
Could this be... Bao'er?
