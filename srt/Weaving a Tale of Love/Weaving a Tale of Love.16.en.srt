Come, come.

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,090
Xiao Douzi's design

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,310
- has nothing special.
- Exactly.

[Bureau of Imperital Attire]

9
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,150
Since both of you completed in time,

10
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,610
let's decide the winner based on the quality of the embroidery.

11
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,090
A'Bi, you start first then.

12
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,430
Within such a short time, these flowers

13
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,980
can be embroidered to be so lively,

14
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,780
and almost look like the real flowers.

15
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,540
It's truly extraordinary.

16
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,270
It's thanks to Attire Expert Zhuo's tutelage.

17
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,520
Good. Let us all

18
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,220
look at what Xiao Douzi did.

19
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,670
Just like real flowers.

20
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,790
So pretty.

21
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,650
Look.

22
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,720
His embroidery is so unique.

23
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,760
It's really good.

24
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,660
Xiao Douzi, tell everyone,

25
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,990
why did you embroider this way?

26
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,590
Attire Expert Zhuo's topic is the queen of flowers.

27
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,610
The topic looks simple, but not really so.

28
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,470
The queen of flowers is the most beautiful flower,

29
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,200
so it has unparalleled beauty.

30
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,410
Plus, it's embroidering the pillowcase used by a consort or concubine.

31
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,990
Therefore, it is even more meaningful.

32
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,830
It troubled me for a long time, and I finally applied some changes to the flowers.

33
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,180
On the one hand, it portrays the alluring beauty of the queen of flowers.

34
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,870
On the other hand, it needs to surpass the other flowers' brilliant beauty.

35
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,170
This way, it's clear to see which one is the queen of flowers.

36
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,170
There are 3,000 beauties in the inner palace.

37
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,430
Any one of them would like to surpass all the other beauties and become the emperor's favorite.

38
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,340
I think flowers are the same way.

39
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,920
Master uses queen of flowers as the topic,

40
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,590
so that's what it symbolizes.

41
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,110
Xiao Douzi, I didn't expect that, at such a young age,

42
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,080
you not only embroider such lively work,

43
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,590
you are also very thoughtful.

44
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,000
If you didn't come to the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,190
it would have been such a waste.

46
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,120
A'Bi, what Xiao Douzi just said,

47
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,990
I already told you once today. Do you remember?

48
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,800
Master told you to change the colors of the clouds on Talented Lady Wu's skirt.

49
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,930
It carries the same meaning as Physician Dou

50
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,460
changing the colors of the flowers.

51
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,410
No matter how pretty the support character is, it cannot overlead the leading character.

52
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,930
In this competition, Xiao Douzi has won.

53
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,710
Xiao Douzi, A'Bi's seat is yours now.

54
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,730
Attire Expert Zhuo, where do I sit then?

55
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,110
By ranking, it's not appropriate to make you sit at the end.

56
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,170
How about this, you sit behind Xiao Douzi.

I was asked by someone to help, so I fulfilled my promise.

Words aren't enough to thank you for such great benevolence.

79

From now on, if there is anything that I can help,

80
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,090
I will definitely do my best.

81
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,390
As soon as you entered the Bureau of Imperial Attire, you already impressively overwhelmed everyone.

I wouldn't dare to expect you to repay your kindness.

even Sister Qiniang has only gotten to do it a few times.

Don't think that you're all right since your seat hasn't changed.

108

It's because he hasn't found a chance to challenge you.

Don't talk anymore. Beware that Attire Expert Zhuo will hear it.

- Could he be tattling to Expert Attire Zhuo?

Attire Expert Zhuo, may I make an unreasonable request?

113
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,630
I'd like to ask Attire Expert Zhuo to withdraw the seating sequence.

114

Why?

117
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
I just came to the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

118
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,040
I don't want to offend everyone.

119
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,450
You are quite candid.

120
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,320
It's too bad that you've already offended everyone.

121
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,990
It's too late to yield to the others.

122
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,020
Do you know why you have offended people?

123
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,100
It's because you are too good.

124
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,270
You've shaken their existing statuses.

125
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,450
If you want to let them accept you again,

126
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,820
you will have to use your real abilities

127
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,240
to totally convince them.

128
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,580
Bureau of Imperial Attire is a place where one makes a living based on true skills.

129
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,290
Only those who have skills can enjoy privileges,

130

climb up, and become popular among people.

Otherwise,

132
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:34,140
just being a tolerant good person is not enough.

133
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,010
Understand?

134
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,250
I only want to do my job and perform my duty well.

135
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,940
I don't want to compete with anyone or fight over anything.

136
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,490
Why does this sound so familiar when I hear it?

137
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,430
Years ago, my master

138
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,880
was the Number One Needle in the World in charge of the Bureau of Imperial Attire, and was famous in the whole country.

139
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,950
Such glorious status!

140
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,340
But she was ignorant of the reality.

141
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,480
It is just the same as what you just said.

142
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,000
She insisted on resigning to leave the palace

143
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,480
in order to live a life where she didn't compete or fight.

144
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,870
But what was the outcome?

145
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,130
She had the top skills but no power.

146
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:30,010
In the end, she ended up losing her life and family, with a ruined reputation.

147
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,540
She couldn't even protect her own daughter.

148
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,920
It happened to the Number One Needle in the World, not to mention you!

149
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,510
Attire Expert Zhuo,

150
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,950
I heard that the Number One Needle in the World, Madam An,

151
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,820
committed the high crime of conspiracy and committed suicide.

152
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,320
Based on what Attire Chief Zhuo said,

153
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,010
there is another reason?

154
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,490
Why are you asking so many questions?

155
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,120
You only need to remember...

156
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,640
In this palace, you must have the desire to move up.

157
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,510
Otherwise, even if you were the Number One Needle in the World,

158
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,500
you would just be as minuscule as an insect or a blade of grass,

159
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,430
your lowly life expendable.

160
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,020
Thank you for your guidance, Attire Chief Zhuo.

161
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,130
She actually describes Mother as an insect or grass

162
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,800
whose life was expendable.

163
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,480
Zhuo Jinniang, I will make you pay for the blood debt.

164
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,210
Even if we die together,

165
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,660
I will get justice for Mother

166
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,760
and vindicate her of the false charges.

167
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,960
Coming.

168
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,990
Coming.

169
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,850
- A'Ni.
- Liuli.

170
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,560
A'Ni, I've missed you so much.

171
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,580
I've missed you, too.

172
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,060
Did you secretly run away from the palace again?

173
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,290
Don't worry. This time, I left the palace on duty.

174
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,280
I made purchases for the Bureau of Imperial Attire. Look!

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,950
Upon hearing that I returned to the palace, was Uncle very worried?

180
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,950
Now you ask. Because of you, the show owner is sighing all day.

181
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,340
He said that he didn't take good care of you and felt ashamed.

182
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,040
It's my fault.

183

But I couldn't help it.

A'Ni, I cannot visit Uncle today.

185
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,610
Otherwise, he will keep me and not let me go back.

186
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,140
Later, tell my uncle

187
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,470
that I don't just have Foster Father taking care of me,

Does Talented Lady Wu know who you are?

192

Talented Lady Wu is a good person. Even though she doesn't know

193
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,220
that I was that little girl who helped her with the auspicious dress many years ago,

194

a new layer of sorrow.

Today, I want to dress up prettier.

209

Is it because you are going to see Young Master Pei,

210
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,120
that's why you are making the effort to look nice?

211
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,590
I-I am thinking that, in returning to the palace this time,

212
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,170
I probably won't get the chance to wear a dress anymore.

213
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,580
That's why I want to spruce up some

I will make you up really beautifully.

I've already found out for you.

Even though Scholar Pei's wage is suspended,

219
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,960
but he said that he is under investigation,

220
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,660
so he still comes to Simen College every day to sign in without fail.

221
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,350
I don't know why he hasn't come today.

222
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,030
Perhaps he is delayed by something.

223
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,740

224
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,310

to withdraw the lawsuit against Scholar Pei.

226
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,820
Last time, I was reckless.

227
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,280
That's why I mistook him as a thief.

228
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,960
Now I've found out the truth, so I especially came to apologize to him.

229
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,790
Since Scholar Pei isn't here, then I need to find Assistant Professor Xue to withdraw the lawsuit.

230
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,930
It's quite an unfortunate coincidence. Something happened at Assistant Professor Xue's home.

231
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,730
I saw him ask for a leave at noontime.

232

It looks that I have to ask you

233
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,780
to give this letter to Scholar Pei and Assistant Professor Xue.

234
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,500
I wrote everything clearly about the incident.

00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,260
I hope it will help vindicate Scholar Pei of all the unfair charges.

236

When I think about it now, I feel really regretful.

Scholar Pei helped me several times,

but I treated him as a thief.

00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,900
That's the basic rule to stay safe and live on.

348
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:04,610
Someone is endangering the crown prince. Does it refer to Prince of Cao and his mother?

349
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,290
Don't keep asking.

350
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:10,190
Just keep to heart what I said, and we shall meet again.

351
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,080
Young Master Pei, I left the palace this time

352
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,040
specifically to withdraw the lawsuit to vindicate you.

353
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,350
I don't owe you anything else going foward.

354
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,150
"I, Sir Pei, chased you to the palace gate,

355
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,290
solely to express thanks to Artist Yu'er.

356
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:16,880
Artist Yu'er knows right from wrong, full of chivalrous spirit,

357
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,830
you are truly a heroine, an outstanding lady."

358
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,320
I, Young Master Pei, used to be impolite in many ways,

359
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,500
offending the artist several times.

360
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,370
I'd like to ask Artist not to hold a small person's mistakes to heart.

361
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:30,220
Please tolerate me.

362
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,190
What are you looking at?

363
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,750
I'm impatient, too.

364
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,920
Your Highness, there is news!

365
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,220
- You two can leave.
- Yes.

366
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,830
Your Highness.

367
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,970
Pei Xingjian sent over news about Mo Kun.

368
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,630
The first batch of paper supplies has arrived outside Chang'an City.

369
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,920
Looking at the speed right now, it will arrive at Chang'an at noon tomorrow.

370
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,410
Prince of Cao's men should be making their moves tonight

371
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,760
to mix the armor into the transporting vehicles.

372
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,980
After the armor arrives, it will temporarily be stored in the storage room in Simen College,

373
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,060
and later shipped to Prince of Cao's manor in good time.

374
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,150
Prince of Cao secretly transports armor.

375
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,680
This involves the safety of the palace and the safety of His Majesty.

376
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,340
There must not be any mistake this time. We have to get ahead in order to expose Prince of Cao's plot.

377
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,900
Yes.

378
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,950
Pei Xingjian asked about when Your Highness plans to take action so that he and Mo Kun can collaborate from the outside.

379
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,200
It's difficult to enter Prince of Cao's Manor.

380
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,050
It's best to take action inside Simen College.

381
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,540
Yes.

382
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,610
Adjutant Chen, it's getting late, and there is a wide space ahead of us.

383
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:54,080
Why not take quarter here tonight, then rush out early tomorrow morning.

384
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,020
Then we can reach Chang'an by noontime.

385
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,120
All right. Setup camp up ahead!

386
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,410
Setup camp up ahead!

387
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,140
Do you see?

388
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,500
Adjutant, water.

389
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,040
Adjutant Mo's carriages are up front.

390
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,700
He doesn't follow the carriages that he is responsible for,

391
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,150
but follows us instead.

392
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,480
Does he smell something?

393
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,430
He shouldn't have.

394
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:40,500
It's only paper supplies in the carriages.

395
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,360
There is no reason for him to suspect us.

396
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,290
He's been having stomachaches during this journey, that's why we're delayed.

397
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,810
Adjutant, don't worry. I've already told people.

398
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:04,730
No reckless move when there is a stranger among us.

399
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,860
Do this. When setting up camp, make one less.

400
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,060
Just say that we didn't prepare enough tents, tell him to stay with me.

401
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,610
Yes.

402
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,970
Adjutant Mo.

403
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,710
Adjutant Mo?

404
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,270
[Puzhou]

405
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,290
[Prince of Cao's Manor]

406
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,400
- Feed some grass to the horse.
- Yes.

407
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:59,900
[Pei Residence]

408
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,510
This batch of armor will arrive in Chang'an today.

409
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,020
What does the crown prince plan to do?

410
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,950
The crown prince plans to act today.

411
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,180
Today?

412
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,440
The Yulanpen Festival is coming up. His Majesty is going to

413
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,160
gather all the princes and concubines

414
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,640
to the Hall of Immortal Dew to discuss the Yulanpen Festival's activities.

415
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,800
Important ministers such as Zhangsun Wuji will also be there.

416
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,960
The crown prince said that this is a good time to expose Prince of Cao's plot in front of everyone.

417
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,550
Now matter how His Majesty favors him, he can't overlook this in public.

418
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:41,640
When does the crown prince plan to greet the emperor?

419
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,610
His Majesty has a habit to take a short nap after lunchtime.

420
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,130
He will probably summon people at 3:00 p.m.

421
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,870
This batch of paper with the hidden armor

422
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,420
will arrive at Simen College at 11:00 a.m.

423
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,740
It will be 4 hours before the crown prince greets His Majesty.

424
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,170
It will be just in time.

425
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,750
The crown prince asked me to tell Young Master Pei, within these two hours,

426
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,200
there must not be any mishap with the armor that is shipped to Simen College's storage room.

427
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,550
The crown prince will expose, in front of everyone, Prince of Cao's secret transportation of the armor.

428
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:11,160
At that time, if the armor is searched and found in Simen College's storage room,

429
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,720
the crown prince can take a further step

430
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,540
to ask His Majesty to dispatch people to search Prince of Cao's Manor.

431
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,990
Once it's substantiated that the Prince of Cao has been secretly hoarding armor,

432
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:22,240
then the high crime of treason will be confirmed.

433
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,370
I shall not disappoint Crown Prince's mission as commanded.

434
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,720
The crown prince originally wanted to assign more people to you,

435
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,980
but he considered that there shouldn't be too many people involved in this matter.

436
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,250
It will arouse suspicion. Therefore,

437
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:37,360
he is letting me stay here to abide by your orders.

438
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,370
Thank you.

439
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,400
Is everything going smoothly?

440
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
This is?

441
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,760
I am Hua Tian, the crown prince's personal guard. Greetings, Adjutant Mo.

442
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,660
Greetings.

443
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,130
They are indeed swapping out the paper with armor while at camp.

444
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:47,590
Right now, they are going to Simen College to make the delivery.

445
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,670
Are you sure?

446
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,060
I've already checked early this morning before we left. It's confirmed.

447
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,700
Excellent.

448
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,880
Immediately go to Simen College and monitor the storage room

449
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,500
to make sure that batch of armor stays inside the storage room.

450
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,110
Hurry, keep up!

451
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,550
Hurry up! Hurry up!

452
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,010
Hurry, keep up.

453
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:21,820
Hurry up!
[Supply Storage]

454
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,690
Gently.

455
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,190
Hurry and move it inside.

456
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:41,550
Hurry up. Hurry up.

457
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:54,350
The two Adjutants.

458
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,060
Both of you have worked hard, Adjutants.

459
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,290
I have been ordered to accept the delivery.

460
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:00,390
Thank you, Assistant Professor Xue.

461
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,020
There are still three more carriages of goods to unload.

462
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,740
You've worked hard.

463
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,460
We've done everything we should so far.

464
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,690
We only need to wait for the crown prince to rush here

465
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:27,230
and find the evidence to prove Prince of Cao's guilt. Then it is mission accomplished.

466
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,540
Put that inside.

467
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,540
Go.

468
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,700
Have you prepared the stuff?

469
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,750
I made the preparation last night. It's all here.

470
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,330
This... May I ask impudently.

471
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:53,560
How did Prince of Cao find out that Mo Kun is the crown prince's man?

472
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,010
Except for the crown prince, who would dare bother with what Prince of Cao does?

473
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:01,620
Since the crown prince knows about the armor, he will definitely act against Prince of Cao in good time

474
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,960
and obtain witnesses and the contraband at the same time.

475
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,550
Prince of Cao won't let this opportunity go. Let's go ahead

476
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,440
and play a scheme to let the crown prince

477
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,090
get caught in his own trap.

478
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:15,100
Crown Prince is the heir.

479
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,380
How certain is Prince of Cao about this?

480
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,330
Xue, you are not thinking of changing sides to go with the wind, are you?

481
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,630
No, no, no. I don't dare serve two masters.

482
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,400
I am just thinking for Prince of Cao's sake.

483
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,130
This is an important matter. We must not make any mistakes.

484
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,660
You are right.

485
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,530
Mo Kun seems to have detected about the armor for some time. Therefore,

486
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:39,060
he has planned this very thoroughly.

487
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,820
I wonder if he has any inside help

488
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,560
in Chang'an City?

489
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,240
Inside help?

490
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,920
Pei Xingjian!

491
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,730
That's right. It has to be Pei Xingjian.

492
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,880
Pei Xingjian is the inside man for the crown prince and Mo Kun.

493
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,940
It's 3:00 p.m. No more time.

494
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,450
I'll take care of the armor. You take care of the people outside.

495
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:12,130
If you fail,

496
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,680
you and I will both lose our lives.

497
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,200
His Majesty arrives!

498
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:05,870
Accuse Prince of Cao for treason? This is a huge matter.

499
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:08,790
A thorough plan must be prepared.

500
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:11,420
Isn't the crown prince somewhat reckless by taking this action?

501
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,180
I was reminding the crown prince, too.

502
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,260
But the crown prince said Prince of Cao's blade is already upon his neck.

503
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,620
He cannot retreat anymore. If he retreats further,

504
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:23,730
he may as well give up the heir's seat.

505
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,290
Take me to see the crown prince.

506
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:28,460
Talented Lady Wu.

507
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:30,770
Don't go.

508
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,530
His Highness has made up his mind.

509
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:35,920
In another two hours, he will enter the Hall of Immortal Dew to greet His Majesty.

510
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,060
If he meets Talented Lady Wu now,

511
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,890
it may cause unnecessary trouble for you.

512
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:44,400
That's why he sent me over to notify you.

♫  Fate has its uncertainties  ♫

518
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:42,560
♫  I've spent this life with brush and ink in hand  ♫

519
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:48,260
♫  Writing about what love is  ♫

520
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:53,460
♫  Borrow from the relentless of the night  ♫

521
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:59,520
♫  To exchange for the certainty of a promise  ♫

522
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,230
♫  There are too many bumpy roads along the way  ♫

523
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:10,320
♫  The more twists, the deeper it is  ♫

524
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,990
♫  Breaking up and making up is like an illusion  ♫

525
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:20,990
♫  Resembles a traveler traveling through this life  ♫

526
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:26,760
♫  Time ignores everything including obsession  ♫

527
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:31,770
♫  With the candlelight flickering indefinitely  ♫

528
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,540
♫  After the fire, there was only one thing left  ♫

529
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:44,320
♫  A bright moon that makes one's heart tingle  ♫

530
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,120
♫  After the fire, there was only one thing left  ♫

531
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:59,050
♫  A bright moon that makes one's heart tingle  ♫
