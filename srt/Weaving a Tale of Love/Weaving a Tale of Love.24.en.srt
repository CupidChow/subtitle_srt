[Weaving a Tale of Love]

3
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,010
[Episode 24]

4
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,600
Replying to Your Majesty, Talented Lady Wu is being humble.

5
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,020
The weaving process of silk fabrics is very complicated.

6
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,730
All the ladies are naturally intelligent and deligent.

7
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,780
That's why they were able to learn in such a short time. This is already not easy.

8
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,820
A'Quan.

9
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

10
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,070
Reward him.

11
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,560
Reward!

12
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,880
Thank you Your Majesty for the reward.

13
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,760
This grape is big and sweet.

14
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,650
My two loved consorts, you should also have a taste.

15
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,420
Thank you, Your Majesty.

16
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,630
Meiniang, what's up with you?

17
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,040
Reply to Your Majesty.

18
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,230
After I went into this chamber,

19
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,380
I immediately felt overwhelmed by an unusual fragrance.

20
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,470
When you smell this incense, it will cause your body to be sore

21
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,620
and your heart to beat inconsistently.

22
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,110
Hurry up and have a seat.

23
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,380
Zhi'er, what incense is it in your chamber?

24
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,870
Why do I also feel uneasy?

25
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,920
Yuan Lang, what is the incense that you lit?

26
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,280
Reply to Your Highness. I didn't light up any incense today.

27
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,220
A mouth full of lies. Today is your shift. If it is not you, then who is it?

28
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,240
I will go check immediately.

29
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,160
Wait.

30
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,890
Reply to Your Majesty and Crown Prince!

31
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,970
inside this incense burner, the incense is an enchanting fragrance.

32
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,740
It's a kind of aphrodisiac. Whoever lilt the incense has ill intentions.

33
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,150
Please investigate, Your Majesty.

34
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,340
I don't know anything of enchanting fragrance. I am also not the one who lit this incense.

35
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,870
Please spare my life. Please investigate, Crown Prince.

36
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,730
Pei Xingjian, don't lie here.

37
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,030
The crown prince is someone honorable.

38
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,930
He won't use this type of thing.

39
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,220
Pei Xingjian, the palace has been filled with rumors and lies.

40
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,530
They say that the crown prince is into males.

41
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,850
Yet now you say the crown prince secretly used an enchanting fragrance.

42
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,600
If you say this outside,

43
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,520
then where will the crown prince stand?

44
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,680
Where would His Majesty stand? Where would the country stand?

45
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,260
Pei Xingjian, how do you know this is

46
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,800
an enchanting fragrance?

47
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,680
Reply to Your Majesty. This enchanting fragrance

48
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,840
used to be popular in the pleasure-seeking places in Chang'an.

49
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,130
There were even wealthy playboys who took it to school.

50
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,640
I have collected this type of incense before at the school, so I know.

51
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,330
Crown Prince, what is the meaning behind this?

52
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,480
Your Majesty, this is the first time I've heard of an enchanting fragrance.

53
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,580
I am really confused. I was in the courtyard this whole morning.

54
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,120
I haven't stepped foot in my chamber nor have I asked people to light up incense.

55
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,510
Usually, in my chamber, the only incenses used are ones to help relieve the mind.

56
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,860
Not only will I never light this type of thing in my chamber,

57
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,480
I can also promise I have never used this in the whole East Palace.

58
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,830
Your Majesty, this misunderstanding item was placed in the chamber.

59
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,850
The evidence is here. Crown Prince keeps denying that he does not know.

60
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,260
How will this allow people to be happy?

61
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,850
- The rumors outside perhaps will get worse.
- Older Sister.

62
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,900
This perhaps has another side.

63
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,760
If this enchanting fragrance is the crown prince's,

64
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,750
then he would be afraid of people knowing. Then why would he use it here,

65
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,870
and ask His Majesty and us to come?

66
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,520
This isn't logical.

67
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,960
Your Majesty, I don't dare to promise anything else,

68
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,650
but the crown prince asking to see Xiao Douzi in the East Palace,

69
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,650
to teach silk weaving, it's something I know about.

70
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,490
The crown prince is filial. Xiao Douzi is hardworking.

71
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,020
I can't believe the rumors outside.

72
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,530
I suggested to Crown Prince to avoid suspicions, but he is full of righteousness

73
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,990
and said that, "An upstanding person isn't afraid of a slanted shadow."

74
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,330
As the crown prince, if he gets hurt because of a few rumors,

75
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,290
then how would he do big things in the future?

76
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,880
Yet one matter has settled and another has risen.

77
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,510
Today, in the chamber, an enchanting fragrance was used.

78
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,580
Your Majesty, I think

79
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,750
this keeps on occurring.

80
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,170
It must be set up on purpose by someone,

81
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,340
to make the crown prince's reputation bad, breaking the peace in the country.

82
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,880
Your Majesty, Talented Lady Wu is right.

83
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,200
Please investigate thoroughly, Your Majesty.

84
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,790
Please help me.

85
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,870
Say, why harm the crown prince?

86
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,220
Say, who are you taking orders for?

87
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,280
I... I...

88
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,810
I really didn't do it.

89
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:30,030
Your Majesty, Deputy Imperial Guard Leader Mo Kun seeks an audience.

90
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,150
Bring him!

91
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,260
Deputy Imperial Guard Leader Mo Kun greets Your Majesty.

92
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,550
What is the matter?

93
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,760
While searching in Yuan Lang's room today,

94
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,390
I found a bag that has an enchanting fragrance. Please have a look, Your Majesty.

95
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,760
Your Majesty, I previously noticed Yuan Lang acting strangely.

96
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,220
So I asked people to check his room earlier.

97
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,020
Your Majesty,

98
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,200
it is the incense that was used.

99
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,850
Please spare my life, Your Majesty and Crown Prince.

100
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,300
How did you do this?

101
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,870
You are framing the crown prince and you still want to live?

102
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,440
It won't ease my anger even if I kill you ten times!

103
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,080
Say! Who are you taking orders for?!

104
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,690
If you say it, I will only kill you; or else,

105
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,160
I will kill your whole family!

106
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,300
Your Majesty has already said if you tell who the person behind it is,

107
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,450
then he will spare your family.

108
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,250
What are you hesitating for?

109
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,460
It has come to this, unless the person

110
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,350
still has a way to save you?

111
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,460
Reply to Your Majesty. The person that wants to harm the crown prince...

112
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,990
is no one.

113
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,520
Everything was done by me.

114
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,130
You are only a servant.

115
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,000
If no one ordered you, then why would you plan to harm me?

116
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,620
You still won't say it?!

117
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,690
I believed those rumors and thought the crown prince was into males.

118
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:32,490
So I was possessed and wanted to use the enchanting fragrance to confuse the crown prince.

119
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,740
This has nothing to do with my family, please spare them, Your Majesty and Crown Prince!

120
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,090
Pei Xingjian...

121
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,160
Get this bastard out of here.

122
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,350
Death by rod.

123
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,060
Yes.

124
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,960
Crown Prince is kind and selfless.

125
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,470
Yet there are people who think the crown prince is weak and is trying to hurt him.

126
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,890
If someone continues to spread rumors of the crown prince,

127
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,740
I will not let them go easily.

128
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,360
Thank you for rectifying my name and for clearing me of suspicion.

129
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,870
Your Majesty is wise.

130
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,700
Your Majesty, don't be angry anymore.

131
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,400
Be careful of hurting your health from anger.

132
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,010
Kneel.

133
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,280
Do you not hear me?!

134
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,980
Kneel!

135
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,400
What have I done to cause Your Majesty to be angry?

136
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,160
Using the excuse of viewing lotus flowers and picking lotus seeds today,

137
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,940
you led me to the East Palace. Do you dare to say it wasn't because of the enchanting fragrance rumor?

138
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,200
You wanted me to go to East Palace to see it for myself!

139
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,360
You guys probably have placed spies in East Palace already!

140
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,500
You may even have lit the fire and fanned the flame.
(Started and spread the rumors)

141
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,530
I am wronged. Ming'er has been wronged, too.

142
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,300
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

143
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,290
I didn't punish you guys in the East Palace.

144
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,770
It was to save your face, so it wouldn't become big!

145
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,430
A smart person should know when to stop.

146
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,790
Even if you didn't order that servant,

147
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,610
you were involved in the rumors!

148
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,230
I punish you to lose your monthly salary for half a year, and to self-reflect your wrongdoings.

149
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,360
His Majesty is passing through!

150
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,990
Has His Majesty changed his mind?

151
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,510
Reply to Consort Yang and Prince of Cao,

152
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,600
His Majesty asked you to continue to kneel at the Hall of Brilliant Joy.

153
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,150
It will be humiliating if done outside.

154
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,050
His Majesty also said, with Prince of Cao's abilities,

155
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,870
he is someone who will have to help the crown prince to rule the country.

156
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,690
Don't have thoughts of ill intentions.

157
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,340
Harming others, in the end, will harm yourself.

158
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,670
Mother,

159
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,340
I don't want you to sacrifice yourself

160
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,480
to save me.

161
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,430
It looks like today's matter,

162
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,850
His Majesty doesn't believe you were not involved.

163
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,510
His Majesty is punishing us as a warning to the two of us,

164
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,330
but he didn't further investigate you.

165
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,850
He will still consider your father-son relationship.

166
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,560
Ming'er, in the future, when you do things,

167
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,960
you have to be more careful.

168
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,160
Mother, you have analyzed it well.

169
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,060
When I do things in the future, I will be more careful.

170
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,970
Consort Yang.

171
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,340
In my opinion, that Xiao Douzi is a disaster.

172
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,160
Anything that he is involved in, nothing is successful.

173
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,450
Xiao Douzi.

174
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,770
I cannot do anything to Crown Prince and Talented Lady Wu.

175
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,700
Can't I do anything to a little Xiao Douzi?

176
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,140
Mother, I want to kill the rooster to warn the monkey.
(Punish one person as an example to warn all the others)

177
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,750
Let's see who will dare to do things for the crown prince and Talented Lady Wu in the future.

178
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,440
Ming'er, what else do you want to do?

179
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,000
I want him to die.

180
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,620
Mother.

181
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,960
Mother.

182
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,570
Thank you for coming on time to help, Talented Lady Wu.

183
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,010
Today, it was all thanks to Pei Xingjian for having careful thoughts.

184
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:50,660
He quickly found out; or else, what could have happened would have been unimaginable.

185
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,080
Please listen to warnings in the future and don't be careless.

186
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,970
Don't let the Prince of Cao and his mother have another chance;

187
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,190
or else, when the mistake is caused,

188
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,360
it will be too late to regret it.

189
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,930
This time, it was my carelessness.

190
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,030
I will remember Talented Lady Wu's warning.

191
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,650
You have suffered today. Please rest early.

192
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,350
I will take my leave.

193
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,920
- A'Sheng, please see to Talented Lady Wu for me.
- Yes.

194
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,050
Please, Talented Lady Wu.

195
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,450
♫ As long as I close my eyes ♫

196
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,080
♫ I can catch a glimpse of you ♫

197
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,540
You're crying? Were you scared back there?

198
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,530
No. The wind got in my eye.

199
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,970
♫  I think it's all my fault  ♫

200
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,570
♫  I won't be able to see you  ♫

201
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,920
After this, the crown prince will be more careful.

202
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,820
In the future, I will be more careful in protecting you.

203
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,450
Pei Xingjian, thank you.

204
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,030
♫  After all we've been through  ♫

205
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:40,840
♫  I love you more than anything  ♫

206
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:47,850
♫  Even if I'm not in your future  ♫

207
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,460
♫  I only want to protect you now  ♫

208
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,310
♫  May the shadow of my past self  ♫

209
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,170
♫  Be the flower in your hair  ♫

210
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:05,580
♫  A flower that will never wither or blow away  ♫

211
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,870
Today really was a scare.

212
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,510
Even when I think of it now, I am extremely afraid.

213
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,640
If it weren't for Talented Lady Wu and Imperial Guard Leader,

214
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,590
then His Highness would have fallen into a trap.

215
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,030
I can't believe that servant has been in East Palace for many years and

216
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,190
he is... Prince of Cao's man.

217
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,650
Then, how did you know

218
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,890
that servant was one of Prince of Cao's men?

219
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,970
Before, I didn't know the rumors outside of Crown Prince.

220
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,330
I knew something was not right, yet I didn't have a way to stop the crown prince.

221
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,020
I needed to have a plan to help him.

222
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,380
So then, I discussed it with Talented Lady Wu secretly,

223
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,900
to not let you and the crown prince meet up alone.

224
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,610
If it really cannot be avoided, then invite Talented Lady Wu to be present.

225
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,770
This way the crown prince won't be able to reject.

226
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,480
The people outside will also not be able to say any rumors.

227
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,850
Today, I looked for Talented Lady Wu to help, but she coincidentally wasn't there.

228
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,660
So I went to the study room to see the crown prince.

229
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,210
But that Yuan Lang kept stopping me from going inside.

230
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,200
Then I got suspicious of him.

231
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,830
I thought there may be something wrong, so I went on top of the roof.

232
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,020
Exactly as I predicted, I saw you guys...

233
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,950
Therefore, Imperial Guard Leader risked being punished by His Majesty.

234
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,770
He barged in through the window and pressed on His Highness's acupuncture point.

235
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,600
Then nothing big happened.

236
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,610
Imperial Guard Leader discovered that the incense burner was handled improperly.

237
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,660
So he sneaked out of the back window and found me.

238
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,960
He asked me to get ice from the ice room

239
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,950
for His Highness and Xiao Douzi to wake up.

240
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,960
Eunuch Wang.

241
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,280
- Are His Highness and Xiao Douzo still inside?
- Yes.

242
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,990
Okay.

243
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,630
Crown Prince doesn't allow anyone to interrupt. Please put the things here.

244
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,530
I'll bring it in later.

245
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,690
Move aside.

246
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,960
Yes.

247
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,370
No discipline.

248
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,270
[Reserved Peace and Calm]

249
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,630
Eunuch Wang.

250
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,130
Your Highness!

251
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,070
- What is wrong with His Highness?
- He is fine.

252
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,770
With ice, he can awaken.

253
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,080
I have brought the ice.

254
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,650
Go outside and lead him somewhere else.

255
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,470
I will think of a way to get His Highness and Xiao Douzi out of here.

256
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,730
If I didn't guess wrongly, Prince of Cao will come to the East Palace later.

257
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,790
He might even ask His Majesty to come.

258
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,080
Let's plan according to that.

259
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,650
- Okay, I'll listen to you.
- Hurry up and go.

260
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,310
Imperial Guard Leader turned out to be right.

261
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,760
Yuan Lang really is someone Prince of Cao put in the East Palace.

262
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,040
Prince of Cao must have gotten his news

263
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,210
so he asked Consort Yang to bring His Majesty here to the East Palace to see the crown prince,

264
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,740
to prove the crown prince's rumor.

265
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,070
I have something I'd like to ask you.

266
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,400
Although it is not right, in consideration of the crown prince's future safety,

267
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,010
please tell me.

268
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,290
Please say, Talented Lady Wu.

269
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,350
I don't know about the rumors of the crown prince,

270
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,920
if there is something behind it?

271
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,060
It really is a rumor.

272
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,050
I have been with His Highness for many years. I dare to use my brain to promise

273
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,160
His Highness has no feelings for Xiao Douzi.

274
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,620
His Highness has said he looks after Xiao Douzi so much

275
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,660
because he is talented and cares about friendship.

276
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,190
He even saved Crown Prince twice.

277
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,240
Today's matter is because of the enchanting fragrance,

278
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,850
it was not Crown Prince's idea.

279
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,870
Your Highness.

280
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,450
Shouyue, why are you here?

281
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,160
Xiao Douzi, what happened to you?

282
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,330
Your Highness was intoxicated by enchanting fragrance and almost lost your sense of judgment.

283
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,180
Good thing I came on time.

284
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,190
Your Highness, don't be angry anymore.

285
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,260
Today you have gotten fortune out of misfortune.

286
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,770
Not only have you cleared the rumor of you outside,

287
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,160
you have also let His Majesty know of your filialness.

288
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,200
This is a good thing.

289
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,610
Here, drink this medicine to relieve the poison.

290
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:23,490
Clearing your mind is the right medicine.

291
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,150
Pei Xingjian has already warned me.

292
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,270
The more I look after Xiao Douzi, the more danger he is in.

293
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,810
Now it looks like it really is so.

294
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,870
Imperial Guard Leader.

295
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,700
Yuhai.

296
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,610
Are you here to look for Xiao Douzi? He has just gone out.

297
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,970
I came to give medicine to him.

298
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,340
Then please give it to him for me.

299
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,670
Eunuch Sun, why are you here?

300
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:07,020
I came to give sweet-scented osmanthus cake to Xiao Douzi.

301
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,750
Where's Xiao Douzi?

302
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,860
Eunuch Sun, didn't Xiao Douzi go and see you?

303
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,550
- See me?
- Yes.

304
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,840
Who said so?

305
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,940
Once Xiao Douzi came back, he saw the note you left for him.

306
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,650
It said there was an urgent matter and you asked him to go to the Courtyard of Misfortune.

307
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,470
Xiao Douzi didn't even eat. He went immediately.

308
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,920
Oh, no!

309
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,690
Xiao Douzi. Xiao Douzi.

310
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,660
Wake up, Xiao Douzi.

311
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,670
Xiao Douzi.

312
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,900
Xiao Douzi. Xiao Douzi.

313
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,250
Xiao Douzi.

314
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,530
Xiao Douzi, wake up.

315
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,450
Xiao Douzi.

316
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:37,730
Xiao Douzi. Xiao Douzi.

317
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,060
Wake up, Xiao Douzi.

318
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,340
Xiao Douzi!

319
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,470
You scared me!

320
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,210
Why have you cried?

321
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,370
With you to protect me, how would I die?

322
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,640
I won't die easily.

323
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,200
Does it hurt?

324
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,950
Yes.

325
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,770
Where's the assassin?

326
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,750
[Prince of Cao Manor]

327
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,020
Prince of Cao's manor?

328
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,200
Prince of Cao wants to kill you. He will not let you go easily.

329
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,850
If he can kill you once, he can kill you twice.

330
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,210
We must follow their roots up

331
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,170
to cut them off.

332
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,900
Guards! There is an assassin!

333
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,650
Imperial Guard Leader, where is the assassin?

334
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,210
He is nearby. Look over there.

335
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,400
Yes. Let's go.

336
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,760
Hurry up and come!

337
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,330
The assassin is here!

338
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,210
- Eunuch Sun.
- Why did you stop me?

339
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,000
Are you with him?

340
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,330
Xiao Douzi is at the Courtyard of Misfortune. Go take care of him first.

341
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,230
Let me take care of it from here.

342
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,250
- Imperial Guard Leader.
- Where is he?

343
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,130
Reporting to Imperial Guard Leader. The Hall of Brilliant Joy is ahead.

344
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,250
We don't dare to go in.

345
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,650
Is it possible the assassin hid in the Hall of Brilliant Joy?

346
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,200
Imperial Guard Leader must be joking. No matter how bold the assassin is,

347
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,530
we don't dare to barge in the Hall of Brilliant Joy.

348
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,430
This is the badge the assassin left behind.

349
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,290
The assassin has Prince of Cao's badge.

350
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,040
He disappeared near the Hall of Brilliant Joy.

351
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,450
Is it really such a coincidence?

352
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,240
This...

353
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,590
My work is at the East Palace.

354
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,250
The other places, I am not in charge of.

355
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,740
We will separately do our jobs.

356
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,970
But... I am reminding you out of kindness.

357
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,540
The person that got hurt today, Xiao Douzi,

358
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,200
is a well-respected person of Crown Prince and Talented Lady Wu.

359
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,370
I saw myself, in front of everyone, His Majesty

360
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,350
in the East Palace rewarded him greatly.

361
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:01,050
The movement is so great tonight.

362
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,780
If you don't have a result,

363
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,590
then it won't be good to report.

364
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,590
[Prince of Cao Manor]

365
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,310
Lighter.

366
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,480
It hurts.

367
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:33,370
Not right, this doesn't seem to be so simple.

368
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,970
I could've caught them earlier,

369
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,280
yet Pei Xingjian let him go on purpose.

370
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,820
Maybe Pei Xingjian is also a Prince of Cao's man.

371
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,080
Wait.

372
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,760
I can promise with my life Pei Xingjian is a good person.

373
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,850
Even if he let the assassin go on purpose,

374
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:53,470
there must be a reason. Anyhow, he wouldn't hurt anybody.

375
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,280
Xiao Douzi, Xiao Douzi.

376
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,390
Have you let Pei Xingjian feed you some enchantment soup?

377
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,890
Maybe you will get sold by him

378
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,250
and you are helping him to count money?

379
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,600
Foster Father!

380
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,780
Look, look!  Why are you so careless?

381
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,110
In the future, when you are alone, you have to be careful.

382
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,780
Especially at night.

383
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,210
I am afraid someone will harm you again.

384
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,770
[Prince of Cao Manor]

385
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,060
This is indeed a badge from Prince of Cao's manor. But from the guards to the cooks,

386
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,360
anyone who comes in and out of Cao Manor has the badge.

387
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,770
Then if someone wants to frame me, they can steal one.

388
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,240
How hard is that?

389
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,170
Of course, I know this is not affiliated with Your Highness and Consort Yang.

390
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,560
But outside, the rumors are strong.

391
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,060
They say Xiao Douzi has helped the previous Empress and Talented Lady Wu to make clothes.

392
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,720
He has offended Consort Yang and Your Highness.

393
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,930
Nonsense!

394
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,200
Of course, I know this is a rumor.

395
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,840
But last night, many saw

396
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,270
the assassin disappear in front of the Hall of Brilliant Joy.

397
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:13,200
Everyone says so, so I had to...

398
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,130
do my duty.

399
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:18,300
Please understand my difficulty, Consort Yang and Your Highness,

400
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,710
so I can report.

401
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:26,930
How about this? I will investigate everyone in the manor.

402
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:30,390
If I find someone who lost their badge, I will allow you to deal with them.

403
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,580
Is that all right?

404
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:37,550
Thank you, Your Highness. I will take my leave.

405
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,300
Ming'er, you are doing things too impulsively.

406
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,860
How will this be good by leaving behind this type of habit?

407
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,800
It looks like you cannot touch Xiao Douzi anymore.

408
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,810
If he encounters anything again, the first person he'll be suspicious about will be us.

409
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,430
Enough.

410
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:14,080
Xiao Douzi is a small person in the end.

411
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,830
Even if he knows some sewing skills, he cannot become someone big.

412
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,670
We will spare his low life for now.

413
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,760
[Bureau of Imperial Attire]

414
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:24,090
Your Highness, Imperial Guard Leader said that Xiao Douzi wasn't hurt too much.

415
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:29,780
After this, Prince of Cao probably won't cause harm to him easily.

416
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,750
You don't need to be worried because of this, Your Highness.

417
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,280
It is my fault in the end.

418
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,910
Xiao Douzi almost lost his life because of this.

419
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,920
Pei Xingjian is right.

420
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,780
In the future,

421
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:54,720
I must be cautious with what I say and do, and not let anyone catch a weakness,

422
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,040
causing harm to others.

423
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,120
It is really a rare sight to see.

424
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,540
This Xiao Douzi's skills

425
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,170
are truly extraordinary.

426
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:54,120
Double-sided?

427
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,420
Thi-This is double-sided?

428
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,790
How is this possible?

429
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:04,650
This skill has already been lost with my master, Attire Expert An.

430
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,820
Even I don't know how.

431
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,510
How can Xiao Douzi know this?

432
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:13,460
This is my first time seeing this type of skill.

433
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,950
It really is eye-opening.

434
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,660
I have already said this skill

435
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,210
has already been gone with my master.

436
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,570
How would you know?

437
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,650
Not right.

438
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,450
My master would rather die, then

439
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,400
teach me.

440
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,100
Unless...

441
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,590
Unless this Xiao Douzi

442
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,770
really is related to my master?

443
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,890
If it is like so,

444
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,760
then this Xiao Douzi

445
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:55,610
we cannot keep.

446
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:02,420
Master! Master, why would Xiao Douzi know this skill?

447
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,740
If you ask him then you would know.

448
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,730
Xiao Douzi is really hardworking sewing clothes.

449
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:14,630
We also don't know how he learned these skills.

450
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:17,260
Master, when you were healing from your injury,

451
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,320
Xiao Douzi never dared to slack off.

452
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,420
He is as hardworking to sew as you.

453
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,490
In my opinion, he doesn't seem to be someone who schemes.

454
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,980
Shut up.

455
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,720
What do you understand?

456
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,030
I don't want to listen to your nonsense.

457
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,810
Xiao Douzi, what are you sewing?

458
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,700
Qiniang, you have come on time.

459
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,920
These days that Attire Expert Zhuo is resting. Everyone is lazy.

460
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,110
I saw that Sister was having a hard time with Lady Wei's shoulder wrap.

461
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:58,300
So I thought to help out in my free time.

462
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:03,360
I wonder about this butterfly's embroidery technique... Is it double-sided embroidery?

463
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,860
That's right. I saw that Sister selected the light and translucent organza fabric.

464
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,660
I thought over and over. In the end, I thought to use double-sided

465
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,710
to sew the butterfly, as the best.

466
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:17,420
This double-sided is the sewing world's unique skill.

467
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,190
You are showing it to me without any hiding.

468
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,990
Are you not afraid of me to steal your ways?

469
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:26,930
Why would you steal? If you like, I can teach you.

470
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:30,230
When you know, you can teach everyone else in the bureau.

471
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,320
Let's see if they dare to look down on you in the future.

472
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,600
Sister, come here.

473
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:46,960
Have a seat. For a double-side, if you find the pattern, it is not hard.

474
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,200
I'll teach you the way; you will know once you try.

475
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:55,280
This double-sided technique, to sew in and out is really particular.

476
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,180
I followed Master for five years already. She kept saying

477
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,510
the basic skill is the most important.

478
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:30,730
She never teaches us the real stuff.

479
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,830
But you and I have only known each other for a few months,

480
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:37,890
and you are willing to teach me this unique skill.

481
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:42,860
Are you not afraid of me doing bad to you?

482
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,300
You are a good person, Qiniang.

483
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:51,220
You have saved me. You are someone special in my life. Why would you do bad to me?

484
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:55,150
If you are happy, I am also happy.

485
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,090
- Xiao Douzi.
- Yes?

486
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,820
Attire Expert Zhuo asked you to come. She said there is something she wants to ask you.

487
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,090
Something to ask me?

488
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,020
Go over first. Xiao Douzi will be there in a minute.

489
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:23,650
Xiao Douzi, Master asked you to go there most likely to ask about the double-sided technique.

490
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:27,520
She saw the double-sided embroidery on the gown you made for Empress Zhangsun.

491
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,590
She said that it is her Master Attire Expert An's unique skill.

492
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:35,450
Oh no, double-sided is mother's unique skill.

493
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:39,780
She didn't share it with anyone else. I was careless.

494
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:45,360
Xiao Douzi, unless you and Attire Expert An

495
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,800
really have some relation.

496
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:52,560
You must be kidding! Attire Expert An is famous.

497
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,850
I'm just a little physician from the Courtyard of Misfortune and have never seen the world.

498
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:59,210
How would I get skills from her?

499
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:02,840
Then I will have a look.

500
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,970
Xiao Douzi.

501
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,750
Before, you said your sewing skills

502
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:21,200
came from a book among a concubine's funerary objects.

503
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,030
Then, you drew your designs for me.

504
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:28,830
It is all designs from clothes.

505
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:31,690
I haven't really looked into it.

506
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:35,400
But now, say

507
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,280
about the double-sided embroidery on Late Empress Zhangsun's gown.

508
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,980
Where did you learn it from?
