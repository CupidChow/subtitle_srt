00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,740
[Episode 6]

4
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,270
Liuli, you can live here at ease.

5
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,750
If you're missing anything, just tell me and I'll get it for you.

6
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,600
A'Ni, can you lend me some money?

7
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,610
I am penniless now and it's inconvenient to go out.

8
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,800
I'm empty-headed.

9
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,570
I should have thought of this.

10
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,810
Liuli, take this money and use it.

11
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,210
I can't use that much.

12
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,590
This money isn't that much value.

13
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,230
I'm afraid it's not enough for you for a few days.

14
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:12,240
I have money. I can pay it back tomorrow.

15
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,900
If you have money, then where is it?

16
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,550
I'm not lying. I do have money and a fair amount.

17
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,690
It's just... it was picked up by a Simen student.  I'll go get it back.

18
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,710
[Simen College]

19
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,000
[Simen College]

20
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,030
This man knows that Duke of Hedong's Heir Apparent.

21
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,220
I offended the heir that day.

22
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,720
If his friend recognizes me and deliberately makes it difficult for me

23
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,880
and doesn't give me the money back, what will I do?

24
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,240
Uncle Zhang, where is she?

25
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,030
The young lady was just here.

26
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,830
Why has she disappeared in an instant?

27
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,970
Forget it. You can go back.

28
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,420
Yes.

29
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,010
Wait!

30
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,220
This bag belongs to me.

31
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,020
How will you prove that this bag is yours?

32
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,860
Sir, you don't know this, but

33
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,120
my cousin works in the palace

34
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,740
and has unfortunately died of illness.

35
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,270
The family asked someone to transport my cousin's corpse out of the palace.

36
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,990
Unexpectedly, the horse cart carrying the coffin

37
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,890
got turned over in the market

38
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,290
when the horse got scared. Everything was in chaos.

39
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,310
After that, a kindhearted person

40
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,160
brought back my cousin's corpse,

41
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,890
but his belongings were lost.

42
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,850
I went to search for them in the market,

43
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,200
and that's how I discovered your message.

44
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,490
I should have come sooner to retrieve my cousin's belongings,

45
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,520
but it so happened that Simen College was closed for the internal exam.

46
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,370
That's why I've delayed until today.

47
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,590
So that person was your cousin?

48
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,640
This bag is his belonging?

49
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,550
Yes, yes, yes!

50
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,350
This is the one.

51
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,250
But you've never seen this bag.

52
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,830
How do you know it is the one I'm holding?

53
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,670
There are three small bags inside the big bag.

54
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,440
The colors of the three small bags

55
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,100
are separately green, red, and blue.

56
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,040
If you don't believe me, Sir, just check it.

57
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,330
That's right, this bag is yours.

58
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,610
The jade is returned in one piece to Zhao.
(T/N: The property is returned intact to the owner.)

59
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,590
Thank you. You do not keep a lost time and have a noble character, Sir.

60
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,810
You are indeed an exemplary scholar. I have nothing to repay you with,

61
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,410
so I can only wish you good health and fortune,

62
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,570
continued success in your career and many students.

63
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,470
Take care!

64
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,060
- Good! Good!
- Good!

65
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,840
- Awesome!
- Once more!

66
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,240
Good!

67
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,760
Come catch me!

68
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,270
Don't run! Give me back my candied haw!

69
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,640
Awesome!

70
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,400
You really are... you are indeed in the same ilk as that Duke of Hedong's heir.

71
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,610
- Stop, Miss, you can't go inside!
- Pei Xingjian!

72
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,770
- Miss, you can't go inside!
- Pei Xingjian!

73
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,260
- Miss!
- Pei Xingjian!

74
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,570
Impudent!

75
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,660
This is Simen College, not the market. Who is barging in?

76
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,680
I'm looking for Pei Xingjian. Tell him to come out.

77
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,780
I told you that I already asked someone to find him.

78
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,890
Why are you so impatient, Miss?

79
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,410
He cheated me of my money. Why would he dare to come out to see me?

80
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,070
He must be hiding.

81
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,090
What?

82
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,550
You said Pei Xingjian cheated you out of your money?

83
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,270
That's right!

84
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,840
Pei Xingjian, I've caught you today.

85
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,890
It's like this, I am Pei Xingjian's superior.

86
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,470
My name is Xue Xu. I'll take you to find him

87
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,950
and uphold justice for you.

88
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,100
Thank you, Sir Xue.

89
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,280
Young Master Pei is coming.

90
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,440
Why are you here again?

91
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,650
Where is my cousin's money? Give it back to me!

92
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,160
Money? DIdn't I already give it to you?

93
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,120
Are you telling me that these are my cousin's belongs?

94
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,640
- The bag contained these things?
- That's right.

95
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,490
The bag only had rocks and tree branches.

96
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,040
No, no, no. I almost got sidetracked by you.

97
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,720
The bag originally had money, but you exchanged the content

98
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,110
and put these things in.

99
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,070
Pei Xingjian, stop! What is that attitude of yours?

100
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,790
You would believe such a crude scam?

101
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,040
This woman is clearly a cheat.

102
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,010
Or she took what was inside the bag and is still not content.

103
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,320
Now she wants to bite me back. (T/N: falsely accuse)

104
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,390
Anyway, I've already returned the bag's content to you.

105
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:13,270
If you continue to bother me, I'll report to the authorities.

106
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,510
I've never seen such a despicable person as you.

107
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,570
Pei Xingjian, stop!

108
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,360
Give me my things back.

109
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,590
Simen College's Pei Xingjian has taken a civilian woman's money by force.

110
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,390
You have shamed the Imperial Academy.

111
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,160
I am weak and alone,

112
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,280
orphaned without support. I ask everyone here

113
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,790
to carry out justice for me.

114
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,080
Who is this?

115
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,620
How could this happen?

116
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,310
What's the situation?

117
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,160
Young Miss, don't be anxious.

118
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,300
Regarding such a shameful action,

119
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,000
Simen College will definitely not condone it.

120
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,190
I'll take you to find the Director of Studies now to get justice for you.

121
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,500
Thank you, Sir Xue, for upholding justice.

122
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,470
Pei Xingjian, what are you doing?

123
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,420
If you are not guilty, why won't you let the victim talk?

124
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,440
I am the victim.

125
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,100
I did something good, and still got falsely accused.

126
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,810
This woman is talking nonsense and switching lies and truth. It's no use to talk more.

127
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,530
The easiest to do is to throw her out.

128
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,910
So heavy.

129
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,460
You still want to hit me?

130
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,640
After all, you are a woman.

131
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,630
If I abandon you here and you run into a lecherous person,

132
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,650
you'll probably be taken advantage of.

133
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,680
Forget it. Consider it as teaching you a lesson today.

134
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,850
Let me tell you! A gentleman likes money but will only obtain it through righteous ways. Understand?

135
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,790
Say it!  Where is your home?

136
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,300
You are a bad person. I'll cut you into pieces!

137
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,920
It's so difficiult to be a good person.

138
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,350
I was going to just let you go,

139
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,430
but I didn't know you would refuse to cooperate.

140
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,720
This evil person. He's stolen my money

141
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,640
and he would even play me.

142
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,590
In front of everyone,

143
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,490
will this evil person take advantage of a woman?

144
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,860
Help!

145
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,080
This woman looks familiar.

146
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,370
Why are you closing your eyes?

147
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,820
Your eyes can talk,

148
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,270
then use your eyes to show me the way then.

149
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,160
Either you use your ways to show me and

150
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,870
tell me where your home is or I'll leave you here.

151
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,000
You decide.

152
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,200
Let's go.

153
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,470
[An Residence]

154
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,080
If you dare to come make a ruckus at Simen College again,

155
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,370
- whenever I see you, I'll throw you out.
- Release me right now!

156
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,800
In another six hours, the acupoint will be released by itself.

157
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,640
You can stay here and reflect on your wrongdoing.

158
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,080
You big bad man, cheater... indeed, birds of a feather stick together.

159
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,370
You can't be anyone good if you follow behind that Duke of Hedong's heir.

160
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,850
I swear, however you took in those things today,

161
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,290
I will make you give them back in the future!

162
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,670
Why did I tell the truth as soon as I got anxious?

163
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,900
I'm doomed. It will be even more difficult

164
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,320
to get what Mother left me.

165
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,010
What do you want?

166
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,690
It's you.

167
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,830
You are that Hu woman that was copying the wall portrait in Da Ci'en Temple.

168
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,560
That's right, it was me. What do you plan to do with me?

169
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,150
I can't do anything to you, but the Duke of Hedong's heir can.

170
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,240
Are you threatening me?

171
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,340
Duke of Hedong's heir isn't as tolerant as I am.

172
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,440
He has already ordered people to inquire about your background.

173
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,530
I'm afraid he will soon come over to get you into trouble.

174
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,410
I can only help you this far. Best of luck.

175
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,680
You want to scare me by using the Duke of Hedong's heir? You are underestimating me.

176
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,980
Don't go!  Release my hand first!

177
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,080
Big bad man! Don't go!

178
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,670
My hand is sore.

179
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,060
Bad man!

180
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,140
Xiao Guizi, what are you looking for?

181
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,580
I'm looking for Xiao Shunzi's stuff.

182
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,000
What did Xiao Shunzi hide?

183
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,720
Xiao Shunzi was locked up for so long, Eunuch Sun ran around for so long that his legs became skinny.

184
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,930
But not only did he not save him,

185
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,070
he couldn't even see him.

186
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,080
But it's all right. Xiao Shunzi was selling fragrance sachets

187
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,710
and earned some money, but

188
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,590
who would know where this money is hidden?

189
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,420
Let me help you!

190
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,920
Hey, what are you doing?

191
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,720
Xiao Guizi! Xiao Guizi!

192
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:36,100
I finally found out! Xiao Guizi, come here.

193
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,750
Slow down, slow down.

194
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,110
I finally found out.

195
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,540
It turns out someone

196
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,630
quietly went to Deputy Director Pan to tattletale.

197
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,650
They said Xiao Shunzi illegally sold outside items in the palace and stole money.

198
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,530
Eunuch Pan is famous for his greed.

199
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,040
Once he heard this, of course he was curious.

200
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,380
If he doesn't get something good from Xiao Shunzi,

201
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,360
he definitely won't let him go easily.

202
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,040
Who would be so evil? If I find out, I'll fight him until he can't stand!

203
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,790
What use is talking about this?

204
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,320
Let's collect some money to save Xiao Shunzi.

205
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,700
Did you find Xiao Shunzi's money?

206
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,240
Oh, right!

207
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,200
I was looking everywhere.

208
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,400
But I couldn't find it at all. How about let's look for Eunuch Sun?

209
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,000
Maybe he has ideas?

210
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,500
Eunuch Sun also has his hands full right now.

211
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,820
People from the Bureau of Imperial Attire are looking for Physician Dou from him.

212
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,850
Eunuch Sun doesn't have the person, so they're fighting right now.

213
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,300
Really?

214
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,960
I haven't seen Physician Dou in many days. He didn't go to the Bureau of Imperial Attire?

215
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,400
That's right. Eunuch Sun said this, too, but

216
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,730
the Bureau of Imperial Attire doesn't believe him.

217
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,990
What a mess. Let's go take a look.

218
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,240
Your Highness, do you really intend to stay in the side hall for the long term?

219
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,280
The East Palace is too far, and His Majesty's health isn't stable.

220
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,800
Living here allows me to take care of His Majesty and puts me at ease.

221
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,970
[Imperial Examination]

222
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,840
Your Highness, you really intend to deliver Pei Xingjian's

223
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,180
Imperial Examination idea to His Majesty?

224
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,700
Of course.

225
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:56,630
Your Highness, His Majesty's health is not great.

226
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,490
He might be in a bad mood.

227
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,290
If you hand him this...

228
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,500
this "Determining government position through imperial examination" scroll,

229
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,500
it will be hard to guess how His Majesty will take it.

230
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,830
Please reconsider, Your Highness.

231
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,910
Pei Xingjian is just a scholar.

232
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,920
Yet he could see so far and think so brilliantly.

233
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,630
As Crown Prince, I have the idea to make the Tang Empire better.

234
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,690
How could I pretend to be mute and deaf for my own benefit?

235
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,310
Of course, I should deliver this to His Majesty at the earliest possible time.

236
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,470
Yes, but...

237
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,830
Are you worried about what Prince Cao said?

238
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,160
Yes.

239
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,010
The more he wants to stop this, the more I need to hurry.

240
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,160
Otherwise, the worries will pile up.

241
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,700
Liuli, you are so pretty.

242
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,030
It's because of your skillful hands. Growing up,

243
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:35,460
this is the first time someone did makeup and hair like this for me.

244
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,660
What are you laughing at?

245
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,820
I was thinking that liar from Simen College

246
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,860
probably has a head made from wood glue.

247
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,230
You are so beautiful, yet he treated you so poorly yesterday.

248
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,610
I get mad every time you mention that Pei Xingjian!

249
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,670
He really is a greedy bastard who swapped out contents, but he won't admit it!

250
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:03,470
Most despicable was how he turned it around and said I bit the hand that fed me!

251
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,230
That he helped me get the bag and then tried to accuse him of stealing.

252
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,120
How could he think of such an unthinkable tactic!

253
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,820
He's an evil liar!

254
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,670
Where are you going?

255
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,020
That was all the money I had.

256
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,770
It's stuff my grandpa and Xiao Shunzi toiled hard to collect for me.

257
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,000
I can't let some evil person take it!

258
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,210
Most importantly, my mom's stuff was in there, too.

259
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,940
I already lost mom's golden needle. I can't lose this, too!

260
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,210
I must get it back no matter what!

261
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,070
You are a citizen, he is an official. You have no power.

262
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,180
He has a sharp tongue and can fight well.

263
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,870
What can you do with him?

264
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,350
Besides, if he really wanted to return it to you,

265
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,840
would he swap it out from under you?

266
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,540
Then am I going to let this go?

267
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,580
To get justice, you must find a way that guarantees it.

268
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,060
Don't be in a hurry.

269
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:57,470
Your uncle said you can stay at Ruyi Resist Dye Shop as an artist.

270
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,050
Your pay and bonus will not be missed.

271
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,550
So you don't have to worry about money for now.

272
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,790
Once we find out a good plan,

273
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,590
we can find him and get your mother's stuff back.

274
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,340
How about it?

275
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:36,250
This is a pretty flower dress. Did you make it?

276
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:40,290
Liuli, your uncle's family are all nice.

277
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,950
They treat me as one of their own.

278
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,170
Not only did they let me stay in their ancestral home,

279
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,300
but also let me become the clerk of Ruyi Resist Dye Shop.

280
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,830
I have no way to repay them, but I want to use this flower dress

281
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,930
to get first place at this year's Hu Merchant Conference to help us gain recognition.

282
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,310
What is this Hu Merchant Conference?

283
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,100
The Hu Merchants hold a conference in Western Market every year.

284
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,400
A lot of people will come for it.

285
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,950
The one who wins will get the next year's orders from the Hu merchants.

286
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,760
They will also be known as the head of the field.

287
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,900
Why is their conference to determine bids hailed as the way to help Ruyi Resist Dye Shop gain recognition?

288
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,780
That is a long story.

289
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,560
Later when you meet your auntie,

290
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,950
you have to talk and act elegantly.

291
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,490
You need to find ways to make your auntie like you.

292
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,320
Understand?

293
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,240
Mother, as great as Auntie's family might be, it's only a concubine's position.

294
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,560
That Pei Yan was born from the first wife, so he is the eldest son.

295
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:56,120
Regarding him getting a concubine, can Auntie make the calls?

296
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,370
Have you guys looked too high on Auntie?

297
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,640
Pei Yan's biological mother is already dead.

298
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,310
Even though your auntie is his stepmother, she is still an elder to him.

299
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,870
Now that he is getting a concubine,

300
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,880
the elders recommend their own families' daughters.

301
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,260
He should at least pay a little respect, right?

302
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,930
They can't reject at once.

303
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,680
Once you enter the Commandant Manor and meet Pei Yan,

304
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,640
what happens next will depend on yourself. Understand?

305
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,940
Madam Cao, Fifth Madam Kudi is here. Master has asked you to hurry up.

306
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,570
Hurry up. Stop looking. Let's go.

307
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,030
Younger Sister, please have a seat.

308
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,200
You have called me to quickly come today.

309
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,700
What pressing matter is there?

310
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,360
- Hurry.
- Ever since you have married well, you have not come here in a long time.

311
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,750
I've missed you so much.

312
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,040
Fifth Madam is here!

313
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,190
Greetings, Auntie.

314
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,900
Shanhu is already so big.

315
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,290
This... You probably have a family-in-law, right?

316
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,830
Auntie is teasing me.

317
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,790
We asked you to come today to discuss Shanhu's marriage.

318
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,370
To tell you the truth,

319
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,030
getting a concubine isn't Pei Yan's idea.

320
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,680
But a suggestion from his first-wife, Cui Shi.

321
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,310
Cui Shi, after marrying into the Pei family for three years, has still never borne a child.

322
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:32,070
Though Pei Yan didn't utter even half a word of complaint,

323
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,970
but Cui Shi has a hard time confronting the rest of the Pei family.

324
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,420
So, she took the initiative in suggesting

325
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,670
to find a concubine for her husband.

326
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,670
This way, the Pei family's bloodline will go on.

327
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,750
I hear this Pei Yan was formidable at a young age,

328
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,340
and his appearance is first-tier as well.

329
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,730
He is already a First-Ranked Scholar in the Classics,

330
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,510
and he will soon climb up high.

331
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,220
Of course.

332
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,330
If she becomes the concubine and marries over,

333
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:01,780
she can go with him to his job. Then it's not too different from the official wife.

334
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,680
If her fate is good and she gives birth to a son,

335
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,890
then that would be the Pei family's first great-grandchild.

336
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,140
We cannot give up this type of good thing to others.

337
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,420
Fifth Madam, please help.

338
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,380
Have Shanhu marry into that family.

339
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,830
Not long after your mother was harmed,

340
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,890
Madam Cao's older brother opened next to Ruyi Resist Dye Shop

341
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,560
the Caoji Resist Dye Shop,

342
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,800
and brazenly used the name of "Number One Needle in the World" Attire Expert An to do business.

343
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,830
Madam Cao has been helping her older brother at Caoji.

344
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:43,000
She even publicly stated that your mother had completely passed on her dressmaking skills to her.

345
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,090
How can those customers who came because of the fame tell the difference?

346
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:50,200
Even many of Ruyi Resist Dye Shop's loyal customers have been scammed away.

347
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,600
Your uncle has often gotten so angry over this matter that he gets pain in his chest.

348
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,660
He says Cao Shi betrayed Madam An back in the day.

349
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,150
Yet now she has the nerve to pretend to be Madam An's successor and to use her name to make money?

350
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,970
So I swore to myself,

351
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,050
we must defeat Caoji at the Hu Merchants' Conference,

352
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:09,240
to vent for Attire Expert An and Ruyi Resist Dye Shop.

353
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:18,510
A'Ni, I take the place of my mother and thank your kind intentions.

354
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,360
Right, what about this?

355
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,530
You're the proper successor of Attire Expert An.

356
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:29,120
Then, as for this dress, help me finish it together. Okay?

357
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,920
If Shanhu can marry into Younger Sister's manor,

358
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,730
then it's good to have family on top of family relations.

359
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,770
My daughter understands to be grateful.

360
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:49,510
If this succeeds, she will definitely become Younger Sister's helping hand.

361
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,390
All right.

362
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,340
Since Shanhu is my own niece...

363
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,530
Thank you, Auntie.

00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,100

365

Here, here!  Please.

366
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,360
Pei Yan is going to invite some talented scholars to his manor to

367
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,070
drink wine and write poetry.

368
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,250
I discussed this with Cui Shi.

369
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,120
We'll invite some well-suited daughters from good families to the manor in a Flower Pageant.

370
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,210
Under the excuse of the Flower Pageant,

371
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:24,100
let Pei Yan take a look and see. It's good if he likes you and selects you.

372
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,620
If it doesn't work out, nothing will be wrong.

373
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,570
Tomorrow? The timing is so tight.

374
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,160
Is there time to prepare?

375
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,160
How about this?

376
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,870
Tomorrow, I'll help Shanhu prepare a carriage.

377
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,390
Also, a high-quality peony flower for the Flower Pageant.

378
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,000
The only thing is...

379
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,660
Shanhu, your outfit and makeup needs

380
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,810
to take some effort.

381
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,960
Since she is my own niece,

382
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,790
she must not get looked down on by people.

383
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:57,630
Besides, Shanhu's uncle has shops upon shops selling shoes.

384
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:02,060
He wouldn't let Shanhu's dress lose, would he?

385
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,410
Mother.

386
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,440
Of course. Fifth Madam can rest assured.

387
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,340
Shanhu's dress will definitely be good tomorrow.

388
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,600
It definitely won't embarrass you.

389
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,340
Have you heard? A Talented Lady of the late emperor got a serious illness.

390
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,960
Abscesses grew on her body. She got stinky but no one took care of her.

391
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,160
She can only lie there and wait for death. It's so pitiable.

392
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,920
That's right. Not to mention it's the late emperor's Talented Lady,

393
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,650
Now that His Majesty is ill, even those ladies without children

394
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,710
are all feeling endangered.

395
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:56,510
I heard the Lady of Bright Deportment who Xiaolian serves has already lost sleep for three nights.

396
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,120
When her bedding was being sorted out in the morning, it was discovered that

397
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,730
even her pillowcase was wet.

398
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,540

Once a baby bird is tainted with the human odor,

408
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,260
it will be abandoned by its parents.

409
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,280
Even if you put it back into the nest, it still won't work.

410
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,340
The love between parents and children exists among all living beings.

411
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,300
It's the same with flowers, birds, fish, and insects.

Miss Yu and I have asked Sister-in-Law to dress up, but she just doesn't want to.

485

She says something like "she doesn’t want to snatch away the light from others."

486
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,590
If she dressed too beautifully, then she is afraid that she will be laughed at by other people.

Is it possible for you two to explain a bit more in detail about the measurements of the madam?

499

Her height is similar to mine. Approximately, this tall.

500
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,740
She likes wearing blue and pink.

I'll help you. It's quite heavy.

00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:28,020
I think that if Cousin doesn't like any of these clothes,

521
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,060
why don't we choose the fabric and make another one?

522
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,850
These clothes are for ordinary families.

523
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:36,650
How can they match up to the elegance at the Commandant Manor?

524

530
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:06,700

What is your affair?

Aunt, you can't only think of Cousin's marital prospect

536

and forget about me.

The new artist at Ruyi Resist Dye Shop is really good.

The dress she designed is rich but not trendy, elegant, and poised.

It'll be perfect for the Flower Pageant.

It's because this dress has a simple and clean style

561
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,810
that I can be sure of completing it today.

562
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,820
When the style is simple, then it needs to compete on colors and fabric texture.

563
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,450
I think this fabric will be perfect.

564
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:50,890
This silk fabric is good, but it's widely seen. Could it be too ordinary?

565
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:54,010
Of course, using one layer is ordinary.

566
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:57,670
But if you try three layers, or even five, it won't be so ordinary anymore.

Your Majesty, this son, and subordinate have an urgent matter to report.

599
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:21,930
Your Majesty, this son and subordinate recommend reforming Great Tang's imperial exam system.

600
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:24,160
Great Tang's imperial exam system inherited that of the previous dynasty.

601
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,560
It has groomed a batch of scholars who memorized old books and have no creativity. They cannot be entrusted with major responsibilities.

The Imperial Academy and Chongwen Hall, as the nation's institutions to develop pillars of the nation,

603
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,700
have mostly accepted students from aristocratic and noble families.

604
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,880
After a long time, they unavoidably form private cliques and factions for personal gains, resulting in corruption.

605
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,280
Your Highness the Crown Prince, excuse me for this old minister for speaking straightforward.

606
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,510
The imperial exam system is the foundation of the nation, providing an important method to select talents for the nation.

Furthermore, His Majesty is not feeling well now,
