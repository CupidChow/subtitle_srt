[Episode 40 - Final Episode]

4
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,780
A'Cheng just sent this over.

5
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,100
A'Cheng said that Lord Pei personally made this gold-foiled figure for Miss Kudi.

6
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,600
Please accept it, Miss Kudi.

7
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,700
Your wedding will take place in just a few days. You will be staying with each other day and night.

8
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,600
But you two had better not be like the Weaver Girl and the Cowherd,

9
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,500
while I become the Celestial Empress who separated the couple.

10
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,600
Haven't you seen enough of the bustle? Hurry up and take the item to him,

11
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,200
so that Lord Pei isn't exhausting his gaze

12
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,800
and also complaining about me as a mean foster mother.

13
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,700
Foster Mother...

14
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,900
Foster Father.

15
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,200
The Lantern Festival is happening now.

16
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,800
Shouyue and I made a bet.

17
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,100
If he wins, I'll let him take you to see the lanterns.

18
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,400
What is the bet?

19
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,200
Liuli, in half-an-incense's time, wear the golden hairpin for the festival.

20
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,600
You will find out what the bet between me and Shouyue is.

21
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,700
Foster Father. Foster Mother. They are...

22
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,400
It's good. You can't see through it.

23
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,500
Foster Mother, why are you dressing me up like this?

24
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,910
Shouyue and I made a bet just now.

25
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,600
We bet whether he can take you away

26
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,700
from the Lantern Festivities.

27
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,600
Foster Mother.

28
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,000
Liuli, you just suffer for a little while then.

29
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,500
Let's go.

30
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,400
General Su is a child at heart.

31
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,800
He actually took this effort to make it hard for Shouyue.

32
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,200
Even if there were a mirror in front of me now,

33
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,300
I wouldn't even be able to see instantly which one is myself.

34
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,200
No matter how smart Shouyue is, how will he recognize me?

35
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,600
Not to mention that he needs to break through layers of guards to take me away.

36
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,600
Look.

37
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,600
Good.

38
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,000
That rascal!

39
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,800
Forgive me, General.

40
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,200
It's you?

41
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,900
I, A'Cheng, didn't mean to offend.

42
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,000
It's just that my master ordered me, so I couldn't help but obey.

43
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,600
What?

44
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,400
Oh no! I've been fooled by that rascal Shouyue.

45
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,100
Shouyue.

46
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Why is there one missing?

47
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,700
Is Liuli still here?

48
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,940
Why stand dazed? Take off the masks.

49
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,200
How did you recognize me just now?

50
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Why didn't you take away the girl wearing the hairpin with the gold-foiled figure?

51
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,300
How can one figure fool me?

52
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,200
No matter what you are wearing, however many people are surrounding you,

53
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,200
I can instantly see you.

54
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,800
Liuli,

55
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,000
do you know how hard it's been to persist?

56
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's been hard to bear not being able to see you.

57
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,700
But when I do see you, it's even harder to bear it.

58
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,800
Why are they making it so hard for you to bear?

59
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,200
If it's hard, why are you bearing it?

60
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,000
You've lost weight recently.

61
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,500
Are you working too hard learning how to do bookkeeping with Madam?

62
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,200
Liuli,

63
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,400
I don't want you to work so hard.

64
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,700
Once you marry me, we'll hire more servants

65
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,800
to help with things.

66
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,070
Most important is that

67
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,800
you must carefully choose your personal maids.

68
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,000
You must not be careless.

69
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,000
I haven't had the chance to tell you.

70
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,810
Grand Princess Linhai had Heir Apparent's wife

71
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,600
give me a house along with the deed.

72
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I couldn't reject so I temporarily accepted it.

73
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,800
I was about to ask you how to deal with it.

74
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,400
I already found out about this matter.

75
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,600
Grand Princess especially sent someone to tell me.

76
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,100
Liuli,

77
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,200
no matter where we live, there are always

78
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,800
some things that are unavoidable.

79
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,900
To let us live in that house,

80
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,280
it's simply Grand Princess wanting to show

81
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,800
you how Duke of Hendong's household has been good to me.

82
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,400
If we buy another house, it would make us look ungrateful.

83
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,500
Besides, His Majesty wants to promote me to the Ministry of Personnel.

84
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,800
At that time, there will be an entourage of officials and assistants that follow me.

85
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,600
Their lodging will have to be arranged, too.

86
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,000
My current house will certainly not be enough.

87
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,600
I was thinking of buying another house. Now I can save the effort.

88
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,600
Don't worry about this matter then.

89
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,400
Once I get the key, I will organize our wedding room well.

90
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,400
You only need to enter the house in the palanquin carried by eight people.

91
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,500

See who is here?

106
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,430
- Liuli is here.
- Uncle.

107
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,010
I was just talking with A'Ni that your wedding is the day after next.

108
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,680
I came here today, first of all, to invite Uncle, Auntie,

109
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,270
Older Cousin and his wife to attend my wedding.

110
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,210
- There are two other matters that I would like Uncle to help with.
- Whatever it is, let's talk inside.

111
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,880
- All right.
- Let's go.

112
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,950
The wedding room and the dowry have been prepared.

113
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,680
What I still need are two personal maids for the main room.

114
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,830
Foster Father has also looked for me but hasn't found any suitable ones in such a short time.

115
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,660
I was thinking that Uncle has been doing business for many years in Xizhou and Chang'an.

116
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,800
You know many people and you can judge a person's character accurately.

117
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,140
So I would like Uncle to help me find two maids.

118
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,460
The price is negotiable. What's important is their personal character.

119
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,850
Shouyue is the heir to the Zhongjuan Pei branch of the Pei clan.

120
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,660
Once you are married to him, there will be plenty of occasions

121
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,550
to deal with the Duke of Hedong's household and other clan members of Zhongjuan Pei.

122
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,250
You really do need two suitable maids for yourself

123
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,260
so that they can help you when things happen.

124
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,090
The personal maids must have good character.

125
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:00,310
If you fall into schemes plotted by people with ill intentions, that will be terrible.

126
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,990
What is the second matter?

127
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,930
Uncle,

128
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,330
these manors are Shouyue's properties in Luoyang.

129
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,000
They have been managed by Grand Princess Linhai.

130
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,970
I would like Uncle to help me quietly check them out.

131
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,160
How big are these manors?

132
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,360
What condition are they in?

133
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,140
So many manors?

134
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,060
It so happens that your eldest uncle has a spice shop

135
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,230
in Luoyang that has been in business for over ten years. He knows more people than I do.

136
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,790
I will immediately write a letter to him

137
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,510
asking him to take people to personally make a round and find out clearly.

138
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,700
I thank both uncles.

139
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,880
Why are you so formal? We are in the same family.

140
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,510
Oh yes!  Even though you've acknowledged Madam Yu as your foster mother,

141
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,070
but you are after all still the Kudi family's daughter.

142
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,260
On your wedding day, where will you leave from?

143
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,290
After all, I'm the Kudi family's daughter.

144
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,360
I have already prepared. I will go back to the Kudi residence tomorrow.

145
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,960
On the day after tomorrow, I will leave the Kudi residence to get married.

146
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,770
You are so young but have thought of everything.

147
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,890
By sentiment or reason, this is as it should be.

Shanhu. Shanhu.

151
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,730
Don't sleep anymore. Liuli is already at the front door.

152
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,430
You'd better get up to welcome her.

153
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,340
Beware that your father will scold you.

154
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,460
Why should I welcome her? Is it so mighty that she is marrying the Magistrate of Chang'an?

155
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,900
In a few days, I will marry the Heir Apparent to Duke of Hedong.

156
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,860
Even though I'll be a concubine, but I will be a ranked noble lady.

157
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,150
Compared to the wife of a fifth-ranked official, I'm not lacking much.

158
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,630
You are such a child.

159
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,540
Are you forgetting what Grand Princess told you to do?

160
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,670
Thank you, Mother, for reminding me. I almost missed doing an important matter.

161
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,210
- Slowly.
- Let go then.

162

Daughter, it's like this.

170

A few days ago, the wife of the Heir Apparent to Duke of Hedong

171
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,470
personally came here to propose marriage.

172
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,000

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,370
so they will be family on top of family with our Kudi family.

175
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:24,880
I thought that it's not convenient to bother you since you are always busy.

176
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,480
So I didn't tell you.

177
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,770
- Don't—
- Husband is the master of this house.

178
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,350
You are the one who decides on Shanhu's marriage, anyway.

179
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,320
Is it necessary to tell Liuli?

180
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,020
You actually know that I'm the master of the house?

181
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,750
You keep interrupting when I talk.

182
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,950
Daughter, look at how noble the Duke of Hedong's household is.

183
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,440
Grand Princess Linhai is also the one in charge.

184
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,390
I'm worried that

185
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,590
if we keep rejecting their marriage offers,

186
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,330
the Duke of Hedong's household will probably be angry out of embarrassment.

187
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,890
We are just a small and lowly household.

188
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,720
What if we get into trouble with them?

189
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,420
It probably will be bad for you, too.

190
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,430
Besides, thanks for your blessing.

191
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,430
I just got a job in the Ministry of War.

192
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:17,090
I want to continue to do better and bring honor and fame to the ancestors.

193
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,270
At this time, if we offend the Duke of Hedong Manor,

194
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,800
I'm afraid that your father's career

195
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,200
will be worrisome. What do you think, Daughter?

196
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,280
Shanhu's marriage should be decided by Father.

197
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,780
Since Father has already made the decision,

198
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,740
I can only congratulate Younger Sister then.

199
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,000
Yes, yes, yes.

200
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,370
However, I still want to remind Younger Sister of something.

201
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:59,720
What these noble people are thinking and considering, it's not what we can understand.

202
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,430
It's fine that you don't understand.

203
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,990
As long as you behave and not hurt yourself and others,

204
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,280
peace will be maintained.

205
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,870
Shanhu, can you remember to heart what your sister said?

206
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,630
Yes, I will.

207
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,310
I almost forgot something important.

208
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,370
A'Ye! A'Ye!

209
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,310
Go bring A'Chun and A'Tao to see Eldest Young Lady.

210
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,780
Yes.

211
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:40,370
Father, who are A'Chun and A'Tao?

212
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,290
Your stepmother said that

213
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,170
she is sorry for what she did to you those years ago.

214
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,990
Now that you are getting married,

215
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,180
she is giving you a big gift so that she will rest assured.

216
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:59,010
If I'm the one who said it, you definitely won't believe it.

217
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,220
But your father has seen it.

218
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,960
I was thinking that Lord Magistrate Pei must have a big house and many things to do.

219
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,670
Once you marry over there, you will be a ranked lady.

220
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:11,210
It won't do if you don't have two close personal maids.

221
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,160
Greetings Eldest Lady.

222
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,310
These two maids are thoroughly vetted.

223
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,570
They are honest and obedient, so they can be placed in the main bedroom as your personal maids.

224
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,020
This is most suitable.

225
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,300
These two maids are of high quality.

226
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,280
They don't look like ones hired from the market.

227
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,100
I wonder where you found them.

228
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,720
How do you know if they are well-behaved?

229
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,810
Older Sister, you didn't know this.

230
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,240
These two maids are personally trained by my maternal uncle.

231
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,670
Naturally, I know about their character really well.

232
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,760
How can Madam Cao's brother have trained these kinds of maids?

233
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,180
Now I understand why the Duke of Hedong's household wants to take Shanhu as concubine.

234
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,040
It's actually to make her do these things.

235
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:39,020
Since these two maids are kind gestures from Shanhu's maternal uncle,

236
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,470
how can I take advantage? Naturally, they should accompany Shanhu

237
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,080
when she marries into the Duke of Hedong Manor.

238
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,180
Master. Madam. People from the An family are here.

239
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,860
Liuli.

240
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,980
Greetings, Uncle.

241
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,260
Silang is here.

242
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,960
A rare guest. Come, sit down and have some tea.

243
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,130
No need for tea.

244
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,060
Years ago, if it weren't because you were a coward and feared for your life,

245
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,120
you wrote the divorce letter to extricate the relationship from my younger sister,

246
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,640
and even indulged your concubine to go to the Wu Manor to help arrest your own daughter.

247
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,060
My sister and Liuli shouldn't have been tormented by false charges

248
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,370
and then abandoned by their own family members.

249
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,170
This is all in the past now.

250
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:30,000
Silang, why do you keep picking on my mistakes and not let go?

251
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,010
Liuli is getting married tomorrow. As her uncle,

252
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,970
I don't have much to give her.

253
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,140
So I am bringing two maids to give her.

254
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,490
How can you?

255
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,640
What do you mean?

256
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,160
Silang, you didn't know.

257
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,560
Liuli already has two good maids.

258
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,370
They are sufficient to take care of her.

259
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:55,800
The Kudi family marries our own daughter. How can we let an outsider shoulder the cost?

260
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,150
We accept your thoughtfulness by heart.

261
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,400
Liuli is successful now, so you keep saying Kudi family's daughter.

262
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,410
Aren't you embarrassed to be so boastful?

263
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,730
Tomorrow is Liuli's wedding day.

264
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,380
I'm not going to argue with you now.

265
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,960
A'Ni. Xiao Tan. Hurry and greet your new master.

266
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,170
We servants A'Ni and Xiao Tan, greet Eldest Young Lady.

267
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,360
Shopkeeper A'Ni will be your maid?

268
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,460
Thank you, Uncle, for your kind gesture.

269
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,430
But it's fine to take Xiao Tan,

270
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:49,430
but A'Ni is already the shopkeeper at Ruyi Resist Dye Shop.

271
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:52,330
How can I make her suffer to be my maid?

272
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,180
A'Ni volunteered to come with Xiao Tan to take care of you.

273
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,180
You don't need to refuse.

274
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,690
I, A'Ni, have been a servant for the An family.

275
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,260
I really respect Eldest Young Lady as a person.

276
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,600
It's my blessing to stay by Eldest Young Lady's side

277
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,410
in this life. How can you say it's suffering?

278
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:13,150
If Eldest Young Lady refuses, then you're looking down at me.

279
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,150
Maids for the main room do the serving work.

280
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:29,260
A'Ni is used to being a shopkeeper, how is she used to doing this kind of work?

281
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,760
You only know that I was bought by the An family.

282
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,900
But you didn't know that I was a personal maid to Princess Gaoyang when I was young.

283
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,240
I even helped Princess Gaoyang to be in charge of the Princess's manor.

284
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,040
It was only when she wanted me to serve her Prince Consort and I refused,

285
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,530
so she put me for sale at the West Market.

286
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,780
I was luckily purchased by the An family.

287
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,700
If you don't think I'm capable of serving Eldest Young Lady,

288
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,900
then who is eligible?

289
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,400
Useless! Everyone is useless!

290
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,240
Didn't you say that Liuli had a timid temperament,

291
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,680
and that she is just a Hu woman who gets scared easily?

292
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,230
What? She got opinionated today?

293
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:19,090
She would even reject two good maids that were given free to her.

294
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,610
She is clearly guarding against us.

295
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,530
You actually said she was incapable.

296
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:30,280
I think she is smarter than you by over 100 times.

297
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,060
Madam, please don't be upset. As I see it,

298
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:39,210
Kudi Liuli probably isn't that thoughtful to connect the two maids and the Duke of Hedong's household.

299
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,770
Perhaps... Perhaps it's because she is in conflict with Shanhu,

300
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,680
so she is on guard.

301
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:50,160
Madam, Shanhu can't even do such a trivial matter.

302
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,190
Does Ruzhuo still need to take her as a concubine?

303
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,220
She hasn't even entered the manor yet,

304
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,920
- and you are already getting jealous?
- I don't dare.

305
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,640
Shanhu and Liuli don't get along.

306
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,610
She will be totally willing to be used by us.

307
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:16,630
If Liuli doesn't know what's good for her and dares to oppose me,

308
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:21,360
then we should hold some more chess pieces in our hands.

309
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,670
Besides, in this world, the sharpest, fiercest, and most vicious

310
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,970
blade is "family."

311
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,720
Do you still not understand this principle?

312
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,580
Yes, this daughter-in-law will immediately go to prepare the betrothal gifts.

313
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,830
Once Shouyue and Liuli get married,

314
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:41,010
we'll let Ruzhuo bring in Shanhu.

315
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,270
This Kudi Liuli

316
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:51,120
doesn't know what's good for her.

317
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,250
Congratulations! Congratulations!

Mother, today is your daughter's wedding day.

320
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:50,960
I should be happy, but without my mother next to me,

321
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,430
my heart misses a piece and feels an unspeakable pain.

322
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,470
I'll let your earrings accompany me then.

323
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:04,210
I'm sure you can see me from Heaven.

324
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:08,660
I am very fortunate to meet a good husband.

325
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,220
I will always be happy.
