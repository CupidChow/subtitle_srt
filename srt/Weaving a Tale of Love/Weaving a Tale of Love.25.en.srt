[Weaving a Tale of Love]

3
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,830
[Episode 25]

4
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,050
Xiao Douzi, before you said your sewing skills

5
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:44,590
were learned from a concubine's funerary items.

6
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,250
Then, you drew your designs for me.

7
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,130
It is all designs from clothes.

8
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,010
I haven't really looked into it.

9
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,820
But now, say,

10
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,530
about the double-sided embroidery on Late Empress Zhangsun's gown,

11
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,970
where did you learn it from?

12
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,660
Replying to Attire Expert Zhuo. When I designed the gown for Late Empress,

13
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,310
I thought over and over without inspiration.

14
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,860
One day when I fell asleep,

15
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,210
in my dream, I had a fairy help me.

16
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,380
Nonsense!

17
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,110
Stop trying to lie to me.

18
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,070
I never believe any god or fairy sayings.

19
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,270
Don't think that with Crown Prince and Talented Lady Wu

20
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,410
to help you, I can't do anything to you.

21
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,550
Now, it is late and there is no one.

22
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,030
This is the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

23
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,780
With the doors closed, I can make decisions.

24
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,410
Today, you have to tell the truth.

25
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,580
Or else... don't you dare leave.

26
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,510
I don't dare to lie to you.

27
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,830
The fairy said she was a harem official in the palace who died unjustly.

28
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,240
She had become a fairy, and her wish had not been fulfilled.

29
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,180
So, she had been staying at the Hall of Thinking Heart.

30
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,440
That fairy said she knows how to sew.

31
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,020
When she was alive, she never taught it to her descendants.

32
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,250
She was really unwilling to go like this.

33
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,530
She saw I had sewing talent and wanted to accept me as an apprentice.

34
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,580
She even taught me double-sided sewing.

35
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,420
Hall of Thinking Heart?

36
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,280
It's the Hall of Thinking Heart that has been haunted?

37
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,760
What happened after?

38
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,360
After, I got happy and woke up.

39
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,300
When I woke up, I realized it was a dream and was really disappointed.

40
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,600
But then I thought of the details in the dream again.

41
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,350
It really showed the skills of double-sided sewing.

42
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,940
Mouth full of lies!

43
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,550
How would there be this type of thing in the world?

44
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,660
If you dare to speak nonsense again, I will ask people to snatch your tongue.

45
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,250
Let's see if you still dare to speak nonsense.

46
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,060
Attire Expert Zhuo, everything I said is the truth.

47
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,960
The fairy has made a promise to me.

48
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,020
She would come to my dream sometimes to teach me sewing skills.

49
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,410
Attire Expert Zhuo, if you don't believe me, if the fairy comes again,

50
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,370
I am willing to tell you everything in the dream.

51
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,520
Whether or not what I am saying is real,

52
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,380
Attire Expert Zhuo you will know after a few days.

53
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,440
If I cannot say the new sewing skill of the fairy,

54
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,740
then you can punish me then.

55
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,470
If I can learn the unique sewing skill,

56
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,020
I won't lose anything if I wait a few days.

57
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,210
Okay.

58
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,520
Then I will wait a few more days. If you dare to trick me,

59
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,370
then I will let you see my skills. Let you know

60
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,180
in this palace, I have lived for 20 years.

61
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,560
I wasn't a vegetarian to finally get to be the attire expert.
(T/N: I didn't get there by being nice)

62
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,460
Mother, you have to forgive me.

63
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,070
I don't wish to give your skills to the enemy, Attire Expert Zhuo.

64
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,660
But this is the best way to save my life. I am not afraid of dying,

65
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,700
but I am afraid I cannot help you reverse your case and take revenge.

66
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,860
Xiao Douzi must have listened to my warning,

67
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,450
so he thought to say this.

68
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,250
Master thinks too much and is too suspicious.

69
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,400
Whether or not Xiao Douzi is related to Attire Expert An,

70
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,190
I'm afraid it'll be hard to pass Master's stage.

71
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,610
I have asked Xiao Fuzi and Xiao Guizi to pay attention to Xiao Douzi.

72
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,070
I am afraid she alone has some type of danger at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

73
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:02,950
Just now, Xiao Fuzi reported that Pei Xingjian has gone to find Xiao Douzi.

74
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,940
Bring this Longan Red Dates Soup to Xiao Douzi.

75
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,530
Also, let Pei Xingjian drink a bowl. Remember.

76
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,810
You have to use this bowl with a green lining;

77
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,570
don't make a mistake.

78
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:33,340
Master, do you really have to cause harm to Pei Xingjian?

79
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:40,390
Then, Pei Xingjian asked people to investigate Attire Expert An.

80
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,560
I feel this person has evil intentions towards Xiao Douzi.

81
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,620
That day someone wanted to harm Xiao Douzi. Pei Xingjian pretended to rescue her.

82
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,850
But he secretly let go of the person who committed the crime.

83
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,920
I saw it carefully, there won't be a mistake.

84
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Master.

85
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:06,410
Liuli is naive. He saved her.

86
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,480
She will be harmed by him one day.

87
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,870
If you hesitate again, you will harm Liuli.

88
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:18,470
But... Master, Crown Prince looks highly on Pei Xingjian.

89
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,000
If something happens to him,

90
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,510
Crown Prince will not let it go easily.

91
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:27,540
What if... he investigates us?

92
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,300
I have already asked.

93
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,770
Pei Xingjian's shift is during the day today.

94
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,530
After two hours, he will leave the palace.

95
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,570
I have also calculated this soup's portion.

96
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,510
The soup will take effect after he leaves the palace.

97
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,460
Something happening to him after leaving the palace,

98
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,460
it won't get to us.

99
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,690
Even if it does,

100
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,940
don't worry,

101
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,930
I will take all the blame.

102
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,220
I won't cause trouble for you.

103
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,080
Master.

104
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,240
I have lived half my life at the Courtyard of Misfortune.

105
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,130
My only hope...

106
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,080
is to help my benefactor protect her daughter.

107
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:16,900
As long as Liuli is safe, I am not afraid to take the blame.

108
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,220
Master, that is not what I meant.

109
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,860
For Xiao Douzi, I'm not afraid of death.

110
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,920
Remember, don't make a mistake with the bowl.

111
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,580
I will protect Xiao Douzi.

112
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,140
I will also not let you be in danger.

113
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,110
Go.

Today, East Palace has your favorite desert.

116
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,200
Crown Prince asked me especially to bring it here.

117
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,090
Crown Prince thinks of you so well, I am a bit jealous.

118
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:09,210
Young Master Pei, you are outstanding in both literature and martial arts, so you are the crown prince's right-hand man.

119

I am just a little physician.

120

Other than making clothes and telling jokes, I have no other talent.

121
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,270
How am I worth even 10,000th of your importance to the crown prince?

122
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,840
Did you think I am jealous because of this?

You can't even cover your mouth when eating desserts.

Stop making fun of me, you are the one with one less brain cell.

126
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,850
The dessert you fed really is sweeter.

You also have a taste.

128
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,240
You said men and women should stay apart. So if I bite you, it's an appropriate defense. Right?

129
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,820
You are making me angry on purpose, huh?

130
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,870
I will say it again.

131
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,890
Men and women should stay apart, except for you and me.

132
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,420

- You have come!

Yes, yes, yes!  You also have a taste.

The soup my master makes is brilliant!

The sweet soup made by my master is the best. Longan increases the energy flow and red dates nurture the blood flow.

Have you lived too long?

153
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,860
Please investigate, Your Highness. I really didn't betray Consort Yang.

154
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,830
It is that Talented Lady Wu is too smart.

155
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,420
She saw through how I sent messages to Consort Yang.

Before Talented Lady Wu entered the palace, she already knew Pei Xingjian.

174
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,610
Now, they are also helping the crown prince together.

175
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,470
Talented Lady Wu and Pei Xingjian already knew one another?

176
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,700
Then they must have personal affairs.

177
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:57,760
No wonder they help and protect the crown prince.

178
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,370
Li Zhi is not a tiger yet.

179
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,890
At most, he is a cat.

180
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,320
Talented Lady Wu does not have any personal affairs with Pei Xingjian.

181
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,560
I only said they knew one another already before.

182
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,200
Something like personal affairs,

183
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,340
we cannot say.

184
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,060
Whether or not they have it, if we plan accordingly,

185
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,070
then we can make His Majesty believe it.

186
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,450
Also, there is you as a great pawn.

187
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,300
Then, with you to be a witness,

188
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,770
then it will be inarguable proof.

189
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,630
Me to be a witness?

190
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,750
If you want to live, then do as I say.

191
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,150
It really is a great pawn.

192
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,990
Being able to get rid of both Pei Xingjian and Talented Lady Wu.

193
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,480
It's the same as chopping off the crown prince's wings.

194
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:07,030
[Eternal Peace Gate]

195
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,720
- Boss, I want some tea.
- Sure.

196
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,080
This time...

197
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,010
Okay, I'll have two.

198
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,610
Let's rest.

199
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,260
Would you like to have a look at this?

200
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:56,290
Master, is it that the medicine we have put is in effect?

201
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,270
Let's go.

202
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,840
Why am I so dizzy all of a sudden?

203
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,150
It feels just like when I was poisoned by Pu Banu's drug. It feels very similar.

204
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,360
Wait first. Let him fall from the horse first,

205
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,260
then we will take action.

206
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,740
I have gotten into the enemy's trap through poison.

207
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,950
Who is the mastermind?

208
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,130
Master, why do they have to catch Pei Xingjian?

209
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,310
Then what should we do?

210
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,340
I also don't know these men in black's background.

211
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,380
But there is one thing I can am sure of,

212
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,800
our medicine has caused great trouble for him.

213
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,190
Anyways, their doing saves a lot of trouble for us.

214
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,430
Even god is helping us, this is too good!

215
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,890
We don't need to take action ourselves.

216
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,740
I was really nervous earlier.

217
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,280
I heard this Pei Xingjian is someone spectacular.

218
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,450
Boss has hired ten of us.

219
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,850
We should be able to capture him with our plan.

220
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,180
Why would it be so easy for us to succeed?

221
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,220
This really is too easy.

222
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,400
Remember that after we finish the boss's orders, to quickly report back.

223
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,540
Delay may bring trouble.

224
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,460
Master.

225
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,090
Let's go.

226
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,710
Let's have a look closer.

227
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,890
What are you doing?

228
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,930
Hurry, hurry!

229
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,180
What urgent matter to have called me here so early?

230
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,850
Master came to tell you that he has already helped you deal with Pei Xingjian.

231
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,350
In the future, there won't be anyone to find trouble with you anymore.

232
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:04,090
You have to remember to not expose your identity in the future.

233
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,030
Don't let people be suspicious of your identity.

234
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,510
What do you mean by Pei Xingjian won't cause trouble for me in the future?

235
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,380
What has Adoptive Father done? Say it clearly.

236
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,440
It is a long story. Anyways you are a blessed person.

237
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,130
Also, even God is helping you.

238
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,460
I don't know who this Pei Xingjian offended.

239
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,790
We haven't even done anything and someone helped finish him off.

240
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:28,480
What exactly happened? Stop talking in circles!

241
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,640
To make it simple, Pei Xingjian has encountered trouble.

242
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,020
He cannot investigate you anymore.

243
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,040
[Hall of Sunset Pool]

244
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,600
Talented Lady...

245
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,910
Don't be afraid!  Don't let others know!

246
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,500
You have to be careful of me! I didn't mean to.

247
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,360
Yesterday, someone drugged me, I could not resist.

248
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,260
I passed out when a group of men dressed in black arrived.

249
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,550
Afterward,

250
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,730
I don't remember.

251
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,740
Then it looks like my maids have also been drugged.

252
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,790
Or else my chamber would be very protected, how could you come in easily?

253
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,400
Everyone doesn't know.

254
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,650
It appears that someone thinks we are obstacles,

255
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,430
And wants to kill two birds with one stone. They want me dead.

256
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,040
It is urgent. I must leave and not cause you any harm.

257
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,060
You cannot leave. This person probably has already laid a trap.

258
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,750
They are just waiting for us to fall in.

259
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,400
It is already dawn. It won't be easy for you to leave the Hall of Sunset Pool.

260
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:47,310
It is about time. If we go now, we can catch them perfectly.

261
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,270
Ming'er, are you 100% sure this time?

262
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:53,950
Don't worry Mother. This time there for sure won't be any mistake.

263
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,620
We have brought so many people. With so many people watching,

264
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,910
even if Talented Lady Wu can talk, Pei Xingjian is full of crimes, she won't be able to get out of it.

265
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:05,920
Then, with the personal maid that once served Talented Lady Wu as a witness,

266
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,420
having personal affairs, it will for sure be complete.

267
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:30,610
I heard His Majesty has asked Consort Yang to reflect at Hall of Brilliant Joy.

268
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,610
Consort Yang and Fourteenth Brother in a rush, where are you guys headed?

269
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,840
My cat is missing.

270
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,690
If it were to find a cat, I wouldn't need to have so many people,

271
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,620
but this cat is loved by His Majesty.

272
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,140
So I myself am looking for it.

273
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,370
Ming'er went to the Hall of Brilliant Joy to greet me and wanted to go with me.

274
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,860
He said this is also being filial to His Majesty.

275
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,460
I heard the palace said that the cat has gone to Talented Lady Wu's hall.

276
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,840
If you also want to be filial to His Majesty,

277
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,630
why don't you go with me to find it?

278
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,210
They are making it such a big thing to go to Talented Lady Wu's hall.

279
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,640
I don't think it is only to find a cat.

280
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,700
There must be something behind this.

281
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,980
Talented Lady Wu, please don't fall into the trap.

282
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,980
If Crown Prince goes as well, he can be a witness as well.

283
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,350
Seeing this type of disgraceful thing,

284
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,350
even if Crown PRince wants to play favors, it won't be possible.

285
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,000
He will have to be impartial.

286
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,350
Since Fourteenth Brother has invited me, then I will go as well.

287
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,360
What?!

288
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,560
You guys drugged Pei XIngjian so he couldn't move

289
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,840
then you watched him be taken by men in black,

290
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,090
then taken to Talented Lady Wu's chamber?!

291
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,290
Master said in consideration of your safety,

292
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,470
we cannot consider too much.

293
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,290
Pei Xingjian is my savior!

294
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,960
How can Adoptive Father have the idea to kill him?

295
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,580
Even if we don't do anything, someone will still want to kill Pei Xingjian.

296
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,740
We can avoid the first day, but we can't avoid the fifteenth!

297
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,590
What do you understand?

298
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,840
Why am I sleeping here?

299
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,980

Someone saw that it came into Hall of Sunset Pool.

I brought them to find the cat.

311
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:04,110
Go in to look for the cat. I, Prince of Cao, and Crown Prince will wait inside

They want to harm us. There is no hiding.

If I want to go out, it'll be even harder.

With all my martial arts, I never would have thought

324

I would be so hopelessly pushed down by villains.

- Why are you still standing? Hurry up and go.
- Yes.

344
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,430
Wait.

345
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,960
That is His Majesty's favorite cat. If something happens to it,

346
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,320
can a little Talented Lady like you take the blame?

347
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,290
I have to go inside myself to have a look.

348
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,530
I haven't cleaned up my hall.

349
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,980
I am unwell today, I woke up late.

350
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,560
Now the hall is not ready for others to go inside.

351
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,980
Since Talented Lady Wu thinks it is not well,

352
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,170
Consort Yang and Fourteenth Brother, wait with me outside.

353
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:28,240
I believe that Talented Lady Wu will try her best to find the cat for you.

354
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,120
Talented Lady Wu is the owner of Hall of Sunset Pool. She knows the place better.

355
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,810
Finding the cat is also better and convenient.

356
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:40,660
You said you wanted to be filial to His Majesty by helping him to find a cat,

357
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,830
now why are you stopping us?

358
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:48,470
If the cat really cannot be found and His Majesty blames us,

359
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,310
will Crown Prince take responsibility?

360
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,360
Greetings, Two Highnesses and Consort Yang.

361
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,080
Greetings, Talented Lady Wu.

362
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,050
I came to pick up your clothes to fix at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

363
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,790
Xiao Douzi has come on time.

364
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,530
Why are you everywhere?

365
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,790
Today, this Hall of Sunset Pool really is lively.

366
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:21,740
I really have the luck to come when Your Highnesses and Consort Yang are here.

367
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,550
I have the luck to greet everyone.

368
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,690
There is still a lot of work to be done at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

369
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,930
Let me take the clothes and leave first.

370
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,720
Talented Lady Wu, I know your wants.

371
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,940
I will think of what you are thinking and fix the design.

372
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,560
I don't have clothes for Xiao Douzi to fix, nor have I asked him to come.

373
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,900
He said he knows what I want and will serve me.

374
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,880
Is he here to help?

375
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,270
But how did he know that I had difficulties? Should I trust him?

376
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:56,560
I have prepared the clothes. They are inside. Go and get them from inside.

377
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,030
Yes.

378
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,930
It is me. Don't misunderstand and don't scream.

379
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,630
It is not what you think. Talented Lady Wu and I were framed.

380
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,940
I know. You don't need to explain.

381
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,720
I must explain. You have to believe me.

382
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,560
I believe you.

383
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,150
There is no time to explain. I trust you and you have to trust me.

384
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,810
From this point on, you have to listen to me.

385
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,290
Now, the urgent matter is to rescue you out of here.

386
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,330
Hurry up and leave here, it is extremely dangerous here.

387
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,760
Prince of Cao and his mother are prepared to come in here.

388
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,100
No. I have to save you!

389
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,220
I can't let you take the risk.

390
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,660
No, I have to save you.

391
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,820
It is time to use my female identity.

392
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,430
Do you want me to prove I am a female?

393
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,330
I only want to go inside to look for a cat.

394
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,920
Talented Lady Wu, you keep hindering me,

395
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,230
unless inside your chamber there is something I cannot see?

396
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,090
You are afraid of me and Their Highnesses to see.

397
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,390
The more you are like this, the more I want to go inside to see.

398
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:24,110
Inside this hall, what dirty thing is there?

399
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:27,610
What do you mean by this, do you want to frame me to death?

400
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:30,240
You have brought Your Highnesses here this early,

401
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,090
to come to my Hall of Sunset Pool and keep forcing me. Are you here to look for the cat or for trouble?

402
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:38,000
Today, if I let you use the excuse of finding a cat to search my hall,

403
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,530
this embarrassment, how will you let me survive in this palace?

404
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:48,210
Don't misunderstand, Talented Lady Wu. It really is that this cat is loved by His Majesty.

405
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:52,860
My mother is also worried, and a servant saw a cat come into your hall.

406
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,020
Talented Lady Wu is generous. Just let my mother go in and look for it.

407
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,990
If she can't find it,

408
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,990
then I will apologize to you with my mother.

409
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:05,510
In my opinion, your feeling for finding a cat for His Majesty

410
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,310
is the same as Consort Yang.

411
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,400
But if outsiders search inside this Hall of Sunset Pool,

412
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,360
then it'll be another meaning.

413
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,800
It will not be respectful to Talented Lady Wu, if this is spread out.

414
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,040
People who don't know might think Consort Yang is embarrassing Talented Lady Wu on purpose.

415
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,890
It might hurt Consort Yang's reputation.

416
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,010
I'll guarantee for Talented Lady Wu that she will definitely look for the cat with full attention.

417
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,340
Let's let Talented Lady Wu execute this.

418
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,940
It'll be fine if we wait here.

419
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,450
Crown Prince keeps helping Talented Lady Wu!

420
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,450
You two sing together and keep dragging this out.

421
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:37,310
Preventing me to find the cat for His Majesty, what is the meaning?

422
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:42,680
Unless on Crown Prince's side, there is also something?

423
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,590
Wait!

424
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,580
Pei Xingjian, I thought you had some skills.

425
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,310
I have forced you out like this already.

426
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:16,050
The good show is finally coming. Let's see how you will wrap it.

427
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,940
Greetings, Prince of Cao.

428
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,890
Why are you blocking for? Leave.

429
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,360
After Your Highness has looked at the clothes, it seems I have missed one.

430
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,490
I will go back to get it.

431
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,330
I don't have time to be wasted by you.

432
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,460
- Someone come! Go in with me!
- Wait!

433
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,410
Please move out of the way, Talented Lady Wu!

434
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,230
Impudence!

435
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:51,780
How dare you offend Talented Lady Wu in her palace? Are you being insubordinate?

436
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,460
I asked them to! If something happens, I will take the blame!

437
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,410
I advise Crown Prince to not butt in.

438
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:02,300
I am here. No one is allowed to be reckless in Talented Lady Wu's palace.

439
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,830
Royal Brother, Talented Lady Wu is our stepmother.

440
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:09,240
I advise you to move out of the way.

441
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,900
You protecting Talented Lady Wu is not right.

442
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,980
Are you not afraid of people talking behind your back?

443
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:20,580
Really? I remember His Majesty asked Consort Yang to reflect at Hall of Brilliant Joy.

444
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,540
Instead of reflecting at the Hall of Brilliant Joy, Consort Yang has come to Talented Lady Wu's hall to make a scene.

445
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,710
I really can't stand it and have to speak up for justice.

446
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:47,490
Crown Prince, today I have to go inside Talented Lady Wu's hall.

447
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:51,790
I advise you, Crown Prince, that it's not too late to extricate yourself from this.

448
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,310
If you really want to get involved in this mess,

449
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:57,450
you probably won't be able to bear the consequences.

450
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:02,690
Royal Brother, Talented Lady Wu's hall, it is not convenient for us to go in.

451
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,850
I will be with you here.

452
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,780
Just let my mother go inside to look for it. If she cannot find it,

453
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,640
I will apologize to Talented Lady Wu.

454
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,160
Then we will search elsewhere.

455
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,740
Danqing!

456
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,190
Sister, why is it so loud outside?

457
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,450
It has ruined my sweet dream.

458
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,400
Sister, who is this?

459
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,380
Consort Yang, I apologize.

460
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,410
This is my sister from my hometown.

461
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:27,640
She came two days ago to the palace to accompany me.

462
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,790
Last night, we talked for a long time, causing me to wake up late.

463
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:38,250
Yu Liu, hurry up and look for Consort Yang's cat.

464
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,770
Yes.

465
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:43,200
Come with me as well, two consorts.

466
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,520
What is with this?

467
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,660
Unless Talented Lady has already seen past what we set up,

468
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,610
she did this to make fun of me.

469
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,650
Why would it be like this?

470
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,680
Reply to Talented Lady. There is no cat in the house.

471
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,830
Since there isn't,

472
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,750
then I'm sorry to disturb you.

473
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,180
I will bring the servants to go elsewhere to find it.

474
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,760
Would you like to have a cup of tea—

475
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,320
Please, Sister.

476
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,300
Ming'er, let's look elsewhere.

477
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,680
Please tell Talented Lady Wu that I will also be leaving.

478
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,780
Also, tell her to be more careful in everything.

479
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,510
Yes. Please, Crown Prince.

480
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,120
Is Pei Xingjian not in Talented Lady Wu's chamber?

481
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,790
There is no Pei Xingjian in the chamber.

482
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:25,240
Talented Lady Wu is also really generous to let her servants

483
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,240
bring our people to search the whole chamber.

484
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,690
Her chamber is just that big. There is no way there is somewhere to escape.

485
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,590
Unless... Pei Xingjian had already escaped.

486
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:45,190
I cannot figure it out. We have already set up everything.

487
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:48,140
You can say we had set up an escape-free net.

488
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,530
How can he escape?

489
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,210
Does he know to make underground tunnels?

490
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,900
This is also where I cannot figure it out.

491
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,240
There were so many people watching a small Hall of Sunset Pool.

492
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,940
Yet we still let him escape.

493
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,780
Xiao Douzi, come down and answer me.

494
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,040
Greetings, Talented Lady Wu.

495
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,920
Rise.

496
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,970
Do you have anything to say about today's matter?

497
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:35,700
How did you know me and Pei Xingjian had difficulties?

498
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,520
Why did you come to help?

499
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,690
If today's matter was found out, then we would die.

500
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:44,110
Why did you have to get involved?

501
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,740
How would I know that you and Pei Xingjian had difficulties?

502
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,840
It was only a coincidence.

503
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,440
Talented Lady Wu, you have helped me.

504
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,850
Young Master Pei has saved my life. When you are framed by evil people,

505
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:59,600
I am a person who returns favors. I should help out.

506
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,830
You came coincidentally?

507
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,960
But I remember that I didn't ask you to retrieve any clothes.

508
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,970
I also don't have clothes needed to be repaired.

509
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,960
Xiao Douzi, you have saved me today.

510
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,710
I really want to talk to you in peace.

511
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:19,290
A few months ago, at the Bureau of Imperial Attire, the matter of Attire Expert Zhuo checking your pouch,

512
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,310
then I had already known that

513
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:24,060
you must have had a lot of secrets.

514
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,850
I helped you then because I believed

515
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,530
you were someone without bad intentions.

516
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,460
Also, in this palace, who doesn't have some difficulties?

517
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,390
I don't care what secrets you have, it doesn't involve me then.

518
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,740
I can pretend I know nothing.

519
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,730
But since you already knew of Pei Xingjian at Hall of Sunset Pool,

520
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:53,850
although I am clean with Pei Xingjian and was only schemed last night,

521
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:57,280
but in this palace, people are hard to predict.

522
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,460
Since you already knew, I have to make it clear.

523
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,110
Are you a friend or an enemy?

524
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:12,590
I can't even distinguish if you are a man or woman.

525
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:17,080
But to make sure of this, it is not hard.

526
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:27,280
Sister Wu, I do have a lot of secrets.

527
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,330
So I don't blame you for being suspicious.

528
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:33,460
I have kept everything from you so you wouldn't be harmed.

529
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,650
Now, you asked me if I am a friend or an enemy; the palace is full of schemes.

530
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:40,080
For you to be at ease,

531
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:44,250
I am willing to tell you my secrets and background.

532
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,180
You and I, we are actually old acquaintances.

533
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,130
Eleven years ago, you saved me twice.

534
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,880
I wanted to thank you a long time ago.

535
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,550
Sister Wu...

536
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:10,720
Many years ago, there seemed to have been a person to also call me this.

537
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,460
Sister Wu, do you still remember eleven years ago,

538
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:20,560
a girl called Liuli once lived in your home,

539
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,930
she helped you sew your wedding gown.

540
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,030
Then the guards wanted to capture that girl,

541
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:41,670
you asked a young man to take her away.

542
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,940
That girl was still captured and put into a palace jail.

543
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,250
Then, Eunuch Sun in Courtyard of Misfortune

544
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,080
used a fake death to save us.

545
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,030
Attire Chief Lin and Attire Expert Zhuo rushed to the Courtyard of Misfortune.

546
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,890
They wanted to burn this girl and her mother's corpse.

547
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:08,020
That day, it was the lucky day you entered the palace.

548
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,660
The palace had forbidden any bad luck.

549
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,960
So, you saved that girl again.

550
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,140
So you are the girl that escaped then?

551
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:29,160
You are Liuli? Your mother is Attire Expert An?

552
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:35,070
You are still alive. This is great!

553
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,730
Sister Wu, it is me. I am Liuli.

554
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:45,270
I finally have a chance to thank you, my life saver,  face to face.

555
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,320
When I met you in the palace,

556
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,660
I felt you were close.

557
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,540
So you are the little girl then.

558
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,550
But today, how did you know me and Pei Xingjian had difficulties?

559
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:01,210
Also, how could you come on time to help?

560
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:04,090
This involves Adoptive Father and Xiao Shunzi.

561
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:07,020
I cannot tell Sister Wu the truth.

562
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,170
Last night, I coincidentally met some men in black.

563
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:14,640
They brought a man to your Hall of Sunset Pool.

564
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,870
I felt it was not right, I didn't dare to tell others,

565
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,150
I was worried a whole night, early in the morning,

566
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:24,570
I found an excuse to retrieve clothes to have a look.

567
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,080
Thank you.

568
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:31,370
You have saved me and Pei Xingjian.

569
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:33,130
I thank you.

570
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:37,540
I can't believe there is this fate

571
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,190
that can make us meet again in the palace.

572
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,500
Sister Wu, to be able to meet you again,

573
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,900
to see you again, it is too great!

574
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,790
I still have one thing I wanted to ask you.

575
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:54,250
Then, the person who saved me in your manor—

576
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,740
Talented Lady Wu, the guards have come.

577
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,630
His Majesty has asked you to go to the Hall of Immortal Nectar.

578
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:04,470
His Majesty has asked for you, I will take my leave first.

579
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,340
I will greet you another day.

580
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:11,070
To be able to meet you today is unexpected and a surprise.

581
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:13,840
I will find you another day to talk.
