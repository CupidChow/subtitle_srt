00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,040
[Episode 20]

4
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,410
Crown Prince, you have great aspirations, and you are also at a vibrant, prime age.

5
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:46,100
Every time I see Your Highness, I am reminded of myself when I first entered the palace.

6
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,120
It is such a shame that the time I can be in the palace is not long.

7
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,210
I can't avoid eventually going to the Ganye Temple

8
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,330
to accompany Buddha for the rest of my lonely life.

9
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,380
I only wish that Your Highness will not waste your youthful life.

10
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,490
Grab ahold of the chance and rise up.

11
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,510
I understand your situation.

12
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,810
If there is a day I can help you change your situation,

13
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,250
I will, for sure, help out to repay you.

14
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,030
For Your Highness to have this thought,

15
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,240
I greatly appreciate it.

16
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,720
Talented Lady Wu, you are too formal to say this.

17
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,490
Every time I encountered danger, I was able to get through it thanks to Talented Lady's righteous help.

18
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,570
Talented Lady Wu, you are just like an older sister to me.

19
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,040
No, I'm too brusque.

20
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,760
Talented Lady Wu is young, but you are my elder.

21
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,910
Other than His Majesty, you are the only one who cares about my safety in this palace.

22
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,150
From now on, if anything happens to Talented Lady Wu,

23
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,810
I will definitely not stand aside and do nothing.

24
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,760
I will keep it to heart about Your Highness's caring sentiments.

25
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,770
It's meal time. Let us all go to eat.

26
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,710
- All right.
- All right, let's go.

27
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,290
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

28
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,580
Let's go see how he is doing.

29
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,500
Let's go see.

30
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,110
Let's go.

31
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,210

You got hurt, but I can't do anything.

80
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,920
You can come see me, can't you?

81
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,330
That's right. Pei Xingjian is already in the palace,

82
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,050
and he is the crown prince's personal guard.

83
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,860
If I want to see him, then I should be able to.

84
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,030
Xiao Douzi,

85
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,810
I heard from the young eunuch that you came before sunrise and wanted to see me.

86
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,090
What's wrong?

87
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,770
Yesterday, I saw Pei Xingjian get hurt, so I'm really worried.

88
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,390
So I want to beg Eunuch Wang to let me see him.

89
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,470
You are Young Master Pei's friend.

90
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,850
It's understandable that you want to visit him.

91
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,950
Once East Palace opens, just ask someone to notify your visit.

92
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,520
You don't have to wait here before sunrise.

93
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,090
Thank you, Eunuch Wang.

94
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,580
Oh, yes!  You are Young Master Pei's friend.

95
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,440
You already knew him outside the palace.

96
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,000
Do you know a girl named Yu'er?

97
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,830
Yu'er?

98
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,500
Do you know her?

99
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,200
Is she Young Master Pei's sweetheart?

100
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,190
Young Master Pei's sweetheart?

101
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,590
I-I... don't know.

102
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,230
Last night, Young Master Pei was half unconscious

103
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,300
and kept calling,

104
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,500
"Yu'er, I'm coming to save you. Yu'er."

105
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,720
It seemed that he was very worried.

106
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,870
My guess is that this young lady named Yu'er

107
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,810
must be Young Master Pei's sweetheart.

108
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,120
Young Master Pei has a sweetheart. Why are you looking so silly?

109
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,290
He's been unconscious for a whole day. Why isn't he awake yet?

110
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,920
He's lost too much blood and was also poisoned.

111
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,940
I still have things to do and need to leave first. You can stay here and keep an eye on him.

112
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,660
Eunuch Wang, it's time to change medicine for Young Master Pei.

113
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,060
I still need to take care of some matters out front.

114
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,980
Shu Lan, you change the medicine for Young Master Pei.

115
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,050
I'm a girl. This is not appropriate, is it?

116
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,670
Xiao Douzi, it's perfect that you're here.

117
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,360
You change the medicine for Young Master Pei.

118
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,750
Me?

119
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,370
Do a good job.

120
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,520
Xiao Douzi, please help then.

121
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,110
This...

122
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,790
It's better that I don't do it.

Are you awake?

126
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,150
You are really awake.

127
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,230
How are you? Do you feel bad?

128
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,010
Why are you here?

129
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,620
I'm fine. Don't feel sad.

130
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,140
Shouyue, you are finally awake.

131
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,060
- No need to rise.
- Xiao Douzi greets Your Highness the Crown Prince.

132
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,280
Xiao Douzi, you are really a lucky star.

133
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,190
You came and Shouyue woke up.

134
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,560
Shouyue, don't get up. Just rest.

135
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,710
Be careful.

136
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:50,050
I'm fine. I've let Crown Prince worry.

137
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,900
Xiao Douzi, you should go back now.

138
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,690
Otherwise, you'll get scolded.

139
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,230
I sneaked out.

140
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,080
I'll get scolded anyway when I go back.

141
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,750
I may as well stay longer, so I won't lose.

142
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,810
How are you? Does your hand hurt?

143
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,990
Did I make a mistake when I put medicine on just now?

144
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,150
It's a small wound. Nothing big.

145
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,990
Xiao Douzi, go back now.

146
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,390
Xiao Douzi, I've already kept Physician Lu in the East Palace.

147
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,090
He can treat Shouyue as needed anytime.

148
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,940
Don't worry. Just go back then.

149
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,620
How about this? I'll give you a special permission

150
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,170
to come to the East Palace anytime to visit Shouyue.

151
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,090
Really?

152
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,780
Xiao Douzi, you shouldn't come and see me anymore.

153
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,260
Also, don't come to the East Palace any time.

154
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,340
There are too many people watching in the inner palace. If Xiao Douzi comes to the East Palace often,

155
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,220
other people will think that he has the crown prince to support him.

156
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,410
They will be jealous of him, and he will be resented.

157
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,910
That's right. Xiao Douzi,

158
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,070
I'll find some reason to summon you in the future.

159
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,820
Other people won't pay attention then.

160
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,320
Good, this is good.

163
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,490
- Xiao Douzi.
- Foster Father, why are you here?

164
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,020
I was just thinking about finding an opportunity

165
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,570
to visit you and Xiao Shunzi at the Courtyard of Misfortune soon.

166
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,670
I knew you were busy at the Bureau of Imperial Attire

167
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,390
and probably couldn't find the time to come out,

168
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,970
so I had to find an opportunity to come and see you.

I know Foster Father pampers me the most. I also miss Foster Father.

171
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,140
Xiao Douzi, in the past few days,

172
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,800
have you been visiting the East Palace frequently?

173
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,800
I know that you are grateful for Crown Prince

174
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,810
saving you from the palace jail.

175
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,690
So you want to repay his kindness.

176
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,980
However, do you understand the situation in the palace?

177
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,790
Prince of Cao is coveting the crown prince's seat.

178
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,300
Crown Prince isn't stable in his standing.

179
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,340
He might not be able to ascend to the throne.

180
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,610
If you are too close to the crown prince,

181
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,740
that makes you an enemy of Prince of Cao.

182
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,470
I understand everything that Foster Father says.

183
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,040
Since you understand it,

184
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,230
then you shouldn't let me worry anymore.

185
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,010
The most important rule to survive the inner palace

186
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,180
is to avoid trouble.

187
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,940
Foster Father, it's precisely because of that,

188
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,100
I have to help the crown prince to avoid Prince of Cao's scheming plots.

189
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,180
Crown Prince is gentle and kind, and he will definitely be a good emperor in the future.

190
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,660
With him as emperor,

191
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,500
perhaps we'll be able to investigate the truth

192
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,740
and exonerate my mother in the future.

193
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,820
What if the crown prince can't help you?

194
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,540
I will still do my best to help him and Pei Xingjian.

195
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,280
I've thought it over many times.

196
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,120
If there were fewer people who shied away from trouble during Mother's case,

197
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,130
and more upstanding virtuous people,

198
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,290
perhaps the result would have been different.

199
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,690
Therefore, I don't want to be a cowardly turtle that doesn't stick its neck out.

200
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,410
Whoever is right, that's who I will help.

201
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,220
Child, each person only has one life.

202
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,430
Many things in the world are fated.

203
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,280
Even aristocrats and nobles are like this.

204
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,040
What can a little physician, who even has to hide gender and identity, do?

205
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,920
Whatever I can do, I'll do it.

206
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,380
Even if I fail, I won't regret it.

207
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,910
You–

208
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,510
You... are too stubborn.

209
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,670
Thank you for the osmanthus cakes, Foster Father. Don't worry, I understand.

210
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,050
Master asked me to ask Talented Lady Wu.

211
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,460
About the gown for the Feast for all Souls Festival this year, do you have any special requests?

212
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,720
Then Master can make special arrangements.

213
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,500
Attire Expert Zhuo is thoughtful.

214
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,290
I have a low status. Just let the concubines whose statuses are higher have their gowns made first.

215
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,150
I'm not in a hurry.

216
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:14,690
Talented Lady Wu, His Majesty is paying this year's Feast for All Souls Festival with particular high regard.

217
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,850
So all the consorts and concubines have been especially attentive about their clothes and makeup.

218
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,630
The Bureau of Imperial Attire is limited in staff.

219
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,010
All the harem is clamoring to go to the Bureau of Imperial Attire to select patterns and staff.

220
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,980
You are the only exception, being polite and humble.

221
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,110
I really admire you but I'm also concerned about neglecting you.

222
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:33,040
I'm sure everyone has selected the experienced embroidery ladies.

223
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,540
Then I will select Xiao Douzi, who just entered the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

224
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,780
As for the design and style,

225
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,590
whenever he is free after finishing work, he can come to see me and discuss it.

226
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,720
Yes, I will take my leave.

227
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,370
Walk her out for me.

228
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,090
Yes.

229
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,620
Talented Lady Wu, the Bureau of Imperial Attire has rushed you twice now.

230
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,820
Why aren't you in a hurry to have a new gown made?

231
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,280
Ever since Pei Xingjian and Pu Banu competed in their duel, I've been feeling that

232
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,500
Consort Yang won't be as reticent as before.

233
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,550
She will do everything to help Prince of Cao to target the crown prince.

234
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,250
In recent days,

235
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,180
when I went to serve His Majesty's illness, I saw Consort Yang was also there.

236
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,810
She even tried to keep me away from getting close to His Majesty.

237
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:29,170
I think, for the Bureau of Imperial Attire to be so rushed lately,

238
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,610
it's very likely because Consort Yang wants to know

239
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,120
what I will be wearing at the Feast for All Souls Festival.

240
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,050
The sooner we prepare,

241
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,490
the more time they'll have to scheme.

242
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,320
One should not harm another person,

243
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,460
but one must be on guard against others. Fortunately, Xiao Douzi is quite skilled.

244
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,680
We still have time even if the dress is made a few days later.

245
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,030
I understand now.

246
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,290
- Jia Yue.
- Yes.

247
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,870
You will make Lady Gao's gown this year.

248
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,050
Yes.

249
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,990
- Xi'er.
- Yes.

250
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,820
You will make Consort Liu's gown.

251
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,430
Yes.

252
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,040
- Shuang'er.
- Attire Expert Zhuo.

253
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,400
I also made Consort Wei's gown for last year's Feast for All Souls Festival.

254
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,830
Please assign it to me for this year then.

255
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,760
I made Consort Wei's gown for the Feast for All Souls Festival the year before last year.

256
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,100
If you use this logic, then I should be assigned to make Consort Wei's gown.

257
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,590
All of you, shut up!

258
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:32,140
Every one of you is fighting to make the gown for a high-status consort.

259
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,200
But which one of you can tell

260
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,220
which cloud has rain?

261
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,510
For instance, Talented Lady Wu.

262
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,010
Even though her status isn't high,

263
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,640
but in the palace now,

264
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,120
she is very respected!

265
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,660
Attire Expert Zhuo, I have already prepared a design for Talented Lady Wu.

266
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,430
Please take a look.

267
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,040
You don't need to worry about Talented Lady Wu's gown.

268
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,140
This year,

269
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,480
you can prepare a gown for Lady Ing.

270
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,880
Attire Expert Zhuo, I made the gown for Talented Lady Wu in all the years in the past.

271
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,250
Why is it now that Talented Lady Wu is rising,

272
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,420
I don't get to make her gown?

273
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,930
You should ask yourself about this.

274
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,170
I... Have I made a mistake?

275
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,760
You've been making clothes for Talent Lady Wu for many years,

276
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,730
but she has specifically asked for Xiao Douzi to make her gown for the Feast for All Souls festival.

277
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,370
Who can you blame?

278
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,630
If you blame anyone,

279
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,170
you can only blame yourselves for not being skilled

280
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:32,800
and letting a newcomer win over you by comparison.

281
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,300
Where is Xiao Douzi?

282
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,940
Where is Xiao Douzi? Why isn't he here yet?

283
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,140
Replying to Master. Shu Lan from East Palace just called away Xiao Douzi.

284
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,420
She said that the crown prince wants to ask him about something.

285
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,930
I don't think Xiao Douzi is more skilled than we are.

286
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,950
I think he is better at appeasing the higher-ups than we are.

287
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,990
Today, it's Crown Prince; tomorrow, it's Talented Lady Wu.

288
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,330
If this continues,

289
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,510
it's not just that our reputation is covered up by him,

290
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,670
even the entire Bureau of Imperial Attire and Master's reputation will be covered up.

291
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,910
You shut up!

292
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,420
What have I been teaching you every day?

293
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,740
You must be careful in your words and behavior. Beware that trouble comes from your mouths.

294
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,800
Go back to work!

295
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:17,330
Xiao Douzi is protected by the crown prince. You don't have that protection.

296
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,610
Didn't I remind you?

297
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,760
Don't come to the East Palace so often.

298
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,200
This is your first day on duty at the East Palace.

299
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,040
I came over to see if you are fully recovered.

300
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,620
So it's because you worry about me

301
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,840
that you came over to the East Palace?

302
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,930
Forget it if you don't appreciate it.

303
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,720
I appreciate it.

304
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,030
Don't worry. My body has a good foundation.

305
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,980
This small wound is nothing.

306
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,960
Then I congratulate your full recovery, and I also congratulate you on becoming the Imperial Guard Leader.

307
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,360
You can now fulfill your wish to work for the nation and for the people.

308
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,090
Such congratulatory words

309
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,670
are too simple.

310
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,430
Am I supposed to give you gifts?

311
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,700
Tell me then, what do you want?

312
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,980
However, don't be a lion opening a big mouth. I'm quite poor. (asking for an expensive present)

313
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,560
I will have to grab this opportunity and think it over.

314
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,700
Previously, I heard Eunuch say that Crown Prince

315
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,420
really likes the sleepwear that you made for him.

316
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,090
He said that the garments you made were comfortable and fitting.

317
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,090
Even if they were getting old, he still asked Shu Lan to wash them and keep them.

318
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,900
So you want me to make clothes for you. Why beat around so many bushes?

319
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,400
That's easy. Making clothes is my specialty.

320
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,530
I promise then.

321
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,000
What are you doing?

322
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,770
Of course, it's to measure your waist. What else would I be doing?

323
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:02,670
When you made clothes for the crown prince, did you measure him this way, too?

324
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,920
Of course not.

325
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,210
The Bureau of Imperial Attire has very detailed measurements of the crown prince.

326
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,350
Open up.

327
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,570
I was measuring the waist just now, now I'm measuring the chest.

328
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,040
Open wide.

329
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,180
It's fine that you measure me this way.

330
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,000
But you can't do so for other people.

331
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,690
This is a special case because I didn't bring the ruler.

332
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,780
Don't underestimate my clothes-making skills.

333
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,170
I am very accurate with my hand estimates.

334
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,310
I really don't know how I can start teaching you.

335
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:47,080
Anyway, you must seriously remember what I told you.

336
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,900
Come then.

337
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,900
I've finished measuring.

338
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,650
These are all old and stale designs, no fresh ideas at all.

339
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,020
You are just being perfunctory by using these things.

340
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,030
Replying to Consort Yang.

341
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,430
I have already tried my best

342
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,820
and drew all the deisgns that I could think of.

343
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,160
I have no intention of being perfunctory.

344
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,750
If you are not being perfunctory,

345
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,330
then it means you are incapable and can't be entrusted with a big job.

346
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,190
If so, you may as well retire early

347
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,470
and vacate the position of Attire Expert at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

348
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,130
Consort Yang, please allay your anger.

349
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,720
I will go back and redesign immediately.

350
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,960
I will definitely design a gown that Consort Yang will be satisfied with.

351
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,420
Wait.

352
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,180
Let me ask you. How is Talented Lady Wu's gown coming along?

353
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,270
Replying to Consort Yang.

354
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,250
Talented Lady Wu hasn't started the preparation yet.

355
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:11,050
She has only asked Xiao Douzi to make the gown for her.

356
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,920
Who is Xiao Douzi?

357
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,700
Xiao Douzi has just been transferred temporarily

358
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,010
from the Courtyard of Misfortune to the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

359
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:21,150
He has never made any clothes for the consorts and concubines before.

360
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,860
Understood.

361
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:28,240
Pay attention to what Talented Lady Wu's gown is.

362
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,740
Yes.

363
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,400
Next time, if you still can't present any acceptable design,

364
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,270
I won't be having such a good temper again.

[Embroidery Splendor Blooming Flowers]

366
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,910
Usually you all clamor to make clothes for Consort Yang

367
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,330
so that you can get more benefits.

368
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:58,700
Now that I'm giving you a chance, why is everyone becoming mute?

369
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,400
Talk!

370
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,990
Qiniang!

371
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,110
You talk.

372
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:11,620
Every design that Master has drawn is beautiful,

373
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,570
but Consort Yang is still not satisfied. This disciple's skill is crude.

374
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,280
How could I dare to show off in front of Master?

375
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:38,080
You speak. What ideas do you have?

376
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,720
I'm thinking that Attire Expert Zhuo's dressmaking skill is outstanding,

377
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,910
and no one in the Bureau of Imperial Attire can compare,

378
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,150
but Consort Yang is still unsatisfied.

379
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,360
Perhaps these designs don't get what Consort Yang is thinking.

380
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,400
Keep talking.

381
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,780
What is Consort Yang thinking?

382
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,350
This... I haven't thought of it yet.

383
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,700
All of you, keep thinking!

384
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,510
- Yes.
- Yes.

385
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,260
Imperial Guard Lang?

386
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:57,800
Don't be like this. We haven't seen each other for a long time. Let's talk.

387
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,470
I've been missing you so much. How can I stand letting my hands go?

388
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,590
It's not good that we are pushing and shoving. Someone may see us.

389
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,100
It's broad daylight. Which maidservant are you from?

390
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,730
You dare have an affair with a guard.

391
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,730
I wonder who it is.

392
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,640
So, it's Song Tao from Talented Lady Wu.

393
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:23,210
I was momentarily muddled. Female Officer Dan Qing, please spare me.

394
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,520
Hurry, ask Female Officer to let go of us.

395
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,150
Female Officer, please be generous.

396
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,840
If I were the only one that saw it,

397
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,620
I would have shut one eye and let you off.

398
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,030
But now many people saw your filthy affair.

399
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,800
I'm afraid that Consort Yang has to be the one

400
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,130
to shut them up.

401
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:47,530
Have mercy, Consort Yang. Have mercy, Female Officer.

402
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,900
If you can spare me this time, I would be willing to work  like a horse or cow

403
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,410
to repay Consort Yang.

404
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,020
You don't need to work like a horse of cow.

405
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,480
You only need to agree to do one thing for Consort Yang.

406
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,570
Then no one will find out about your affair with Guard Lang.

407
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,630
How do you recognize Guard Lang?

408
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,020
My heart was wasted on you.

409
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,790
You actually colluded with an outsider to frame me.

410
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,150
Our Consort Yang used to not care about these things.

411
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,840
That's why she didn't say anything about your Hall of Sunset Pool.

412
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,220
Now that Consort Yang wants to discipline Hall of Sunset Pool,

413
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,180
your scandal naturally cannot escape Consort Yang's sharp eyesight.

414
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,390
However, Guard Yang is smarter than you are.

415
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,500
He understands the principle of a good bird choosing a better tree for a perch.

416
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,340
Song Tao, don't blame me.

417
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,590
What I am doing is for our future's sake.

418
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,980
As long as you work for Consort Yang, Consort Yang will be good to us.

419
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,400
Curses!

420
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,430
I, Song Tao, am blind.

421
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,260
I will not entangle with you anymore in this life.

422
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,060
Song Tao!

423
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,020
I got caught by Female Officer today.

424
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,370
Whatever you need,

425
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,250
just ask.

426
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:25,130
I know that Song Tao is a person who recognizes realities.

[Hall of Sunset Pool]

428
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:48,970
Talented Lady Wu, why do you feel so at ease as to read?

429
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,690
What is it?

430
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,920
The Feast for All Souls Festival is coming up. All the consorts and concubines have been working hard

431
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,830
and want to stand out with their gowns.

432
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,690
I heard that the Bureau of Imperial Attire has been busy with visitors.

433
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,680
You've followed me so many years,

434
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,610
why have you become so impatient?

435
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:14,000
Could it be that Talented Lady already has a good idea?

436
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,330
Of cousre, Talented Lady has a good idea.

437
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,330
Why are you so impatient?

438
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,270
I was just thinking for Talented Lady's sake.

439
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,370
That's true.

440
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,440
Dan Qing, is there news from Song Tao?

441
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,400
Not yet.

442
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:48,040
Consort Yang, if you want to know what Talented Lady Wu is preparing to wear,

443
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,270
just ask Attire Expert Zhuo then.

444
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,840
Why do you want me to pressure Song Tao as inside help?

445
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,030
Previously, I always tolerated and stayed humble.

446
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:01,630
It led to palace servants thinking that I'm easy.

447
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,730
I want to use this Feasts for All Souls Festival as an opportunity to show my strength,

448
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:09,730
to let everyone know the stature that I hold in the harem.

449
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:13,330
Doing this is also for Ming'er.

450
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:19,170
Wu Meiniang is smart. I should at least take care of ourselves

451
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,590
in order to live safely.

452
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,310
His Majesty the Crown Prince wants to invite me and Xiao Douzi to drink.

453
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:42,220
There is a difference between our statuses. I can't bear it.

454
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,970
His Highness the Crown Prince said it's thanks to Talented Lady Wu,

455
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,250
with Young Master Pei and Xiao Douzi for helping him.

456
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,370
That's how he has successively evaded the ambush from Prince of Cao and Consort Yang.

457
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,470
Now that His Highness has fully recovered from his injuries,

458
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:56,080
he has also obtained a helpful guard in Young Master Pei.

459
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,720
He is very happy.

460
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,120
That's why he wants to invite you to the East Palace for a small party.

461
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:07,030
It's too bad that Talented Lady Wu is His Majesty's concubine, so it's not proper.

462
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,100
That's why he only invited you and Xiao Douzi.

463
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,870
Young Master Pei, I have a question, but I don't know whether I can ask.

464
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,760
Eunuch Wang, please speak.

465
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,120
When you were unconscious, I served by your side.

466
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,480
In your unconscious state, you kept calling

467
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,600
"Yu'er, Yu'er."

468
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,030
Is this young lady Yu'er,

469
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,770
your sweetheart?

I–

472
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,160
When I was unconscious, I'm grateful for your help.

473
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,550
Thank you, Eunuch Wang.

474
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,510
You must be amused at the nonsense talk that I spoke during my unconscious state.

475
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,160
Young Master Pei, you've misunderstood.

476
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,250
It's proper that a man and woman marry upon the right age.

477
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,420
How can I laugh at Young Master Pei?

478
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,910
I was just thinking of reminding you.

479
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,430
If there really is a lady who is in love with you,

480
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,390
find a good opportunity

481
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:17,220
and let His Highness decide on the match for you.

482
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,090
This would be a tremendous grace.

483
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:24,030
At that time, no matter which family Yu'er is from,

484
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,130
it's guaranteed.

485
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,350
Thank you, Eunuch Wang.

486
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,290
But...

487
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:38,280
Young Master Pei, is there an unspeakable difficulty?

488
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,660
You are handsome, dashing, strong in both literature and martial arts.

489
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,730
You were also promoted to be Crown Prince's Imperial Guard Leader.

490
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,350
Such a glorious honor!

491
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:57,570
Which family's daughter can make it so difficult for you, Young Master Pei?

492
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,080
Which family is it?

493
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,320
It's a long story.

494
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,080
It's better not to talk about it.

495
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,630
Look at me...

496
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,120
Your Highness the Crown Prince, Xiao Douzi is here.

497
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,730
Xiao Douzi greets Your Highness the Crown Prince.

498
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:25,560
Xiao Douzi, you and Shouyue are my guests today.

499
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,870
No need to feel restrained and no need to be formal.

500
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,650
Thank you, Your Highness, for your kindness.

501
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:34,140
This could hurt your dignity if it's spread outside.

502
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,490
Shu Lan and A'Sheng are my trusted attendants.

503
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:40,070
Today's event won't be spread outside.

504
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,840
Thank you, Your Highness, for bestowing me a seat.

505
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,960
When I encountered dangers this time, it was thanks to you and Shouyue that I evaded peril.

506
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,790
I got a high-quality wine offered by Bahana kingdom, (Today's Ferghana)

507
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,790
so I wanted to share it with you so that I won't waste this fine wine.

508
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:04,700
When I was young, my mother obtained a bottle of wine from somewhere.

509
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,950
That was the first time I saw wine and really wanted to try it.

510
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,690
But my mother said that children weren't allowed to drink.

511
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,950
So I stared at that glass bottle every day.

512
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,060
The more I looked, I thought the color was really beautiful.

513
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,670
One day, I finally couldn't stand it anymore and secretly opened it to drink.

514
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,360
That taste was indeed sweet and fragrant.

515
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,140
What happened afterward? Did your mother discover you?

516
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,430
I got greedy and drank too much,

517
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,530
and actually held the glass bottle and fell asleep.

518
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,660
My mother caught me and I got spanked.

519
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,360
You get to drink as much wine as you wish in the East Palace today. How about that?

520
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,850
Great!

521
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:47,740
Your Highness, Young Master Pei is here.

522
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,500
This subordinate greets Your Highness the Crown Prince.

523
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,600
Shouyue, you are here just at the right time. I was just telling Xiao Douzi,

524
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,670
you are both my guests today, so there is no need to observe formalities.

525
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,990
You can enjoy drinking this great wine with me.

526
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,140
Come, sit down quickly.

527
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,640
Yes.

528
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,320
A'Sheng, serve.

529
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,770
Yes.

530
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,340
Pour wine.

531
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,150
I successively encountered dangers this time.

532
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,300
Luckily both of you risked your lives to save me, so I was able to evade peril.

533
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,830
I have remembered to heart about your affection toward me.

534
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,270
Come, let me toast a cup to you two.

535
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,990
This wine is from the western region.

536
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:58,160
The wine offered by Bahana Kingdom is especially sweet and fragrant.

537
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,280
Xiao Douzi, compared to the wine that you stole when you were young,

538
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,050
how does this wine taste?

539
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:15,630
Xiao Douzi, wine may taste sweet when you drink, but it has a strong effect afterward.

540
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,190
You must not drink too much.

541
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,730
Later, you still have to work at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

542
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,350
Shouyue, don't be a party pooper.

543
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:27,360
I am here. Don't be afraid. Drink!

544
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,730
How does it taste?

545
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,720
This tribute wine is indeed sweet and fragrant.

546
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,700
But if I really had to compare, wine

547
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,210
tastes best when it's stolen.

548
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,790
Come, pour more for him.

549
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:56,250
Shouyue, why aren't you drinking?

550
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,900
Hurry and drink up.

551
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,790
Thank you, Your Highness.

552
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:09,660
Xiao Douzi, you said my tribute wine doesn't taste as good as the wine you stole to drink.

553
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,300
I have to punish you with three cups then.

554
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,040
Your Highness the Crown Prince already said, there is no need for formalities and restraints today.

555
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,740
But now you overwhelm me with your stature as Crown Prince. Don't you think you should be punished with three cups, too?

556
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:25,190
Xiao Douzi, we are servants.

557
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,600
It's a great honor for His Highess to bestow you drinks.

558
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,600
How dare you punish His Highness to drink?

559
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,690
Xiao Douzi is correct.

560
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,260
I accept the punishment. We will each drink three cups for punishment.

561
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,730
Come.

562
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,870
Come.

563
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,480
Your Highness, Xiao Douzi can't hold alcohol.

564
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,190
If he drinks too much, I'm afraid that he will offend Your Highness.

565
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:50,790
Why don't I drink these three cups as punishment for his sake?

566
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:58,140
Shouyou, you seem to favor Xiao Douzi.

567
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:03,040
I don't know why Your Highness says this.

568
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,530
They are both punishment drinks. You drink for Xiao Douzi.

569
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,830
Why don't you drink for me, too?

570
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,140
That's right. His Highness is right.

571
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,000
Young Master Pei should be punished with three cups of wine, too.

572
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,910
Well said. The three of us all should drink three cups for punishments. We're all even.

573
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:20,450
That's right, Pei Xingjian should be punished, too. Let's drink together.

574
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,840
Come.

575
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,990
Bottoms up!

576
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,090
Xiao Douzi toasts to Your Highness the Crown Prince.

577
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,030
A'Sheng.

578
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:42,070
Your Highness, you have drunk a little too much today.

579
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,840
Yes.

580
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,930
Your Highness, why don't we stop drinking now.

581
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:54,950
You just recovered from injuries. If you drink more, it may harm your body.

582
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,690
Shouyue, why are you such a party pooper today?

583
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:04,450
So nagging and nagging, you are about to be like A'Sheng.

584
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:12,060
Your Highness, this subordinate is worried about your body,

585
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,280
and also worried about Xiao Douzi.

586
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,920
After all, he is on duty.

587
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,740
If he leaves the Bureau of Imperial Attire too long, he may be punished.

588
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,580
Xiao Douzi, you can't drink anymore.

589
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,150
Beware that you are female.

590
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:37,490
Your Highness, Xiao Douzi really can't keep drinking anymore.

591
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:41,460
If the Bureau of Imperial Attire's chief finds out that he is drunk,

592
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,800
he will definitely get punished. At that time,

593
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,080
he will disappoint Your Highness's goodwill in inviting him to drink.

594
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,090
Your concerns makes sense.

595
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:55,200
But I am particularly happy when I can drink with the two of you.

596
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,800
Too bad that time is short.

597
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,960
I really should take my leave.

598
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,890
There is still a lot of work waiting for me at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

599
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:06,500
Thank you for your hospitality, Your Highness.

600
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,490
Your Highness, I will take my leave, too.
