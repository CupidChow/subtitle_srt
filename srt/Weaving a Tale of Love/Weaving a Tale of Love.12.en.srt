[Weaving a Tale of Love]

3
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,130
[Episode 12]

4
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,410
I have made up my mind.

5
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,630
Whether you withdraw your complaints to Simen College is up to you. I don't care anymore.

6
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,300
But you have to take care of a matter on my behalf, to you make up for the false accusation you filed against me.

7
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,240
As someone who has fled the palace secretly, what could I eventually do on your behalf?

8
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,190
Let me use your waist badge.

9
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,880
Waist badge? Are you talking about the waist badge to leave the palace?

10
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,480
Exactly!

11
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,630
You can't be thinking about using my waist badge to sneak into the palace!

12
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,940
That's not something you should be concerned about. There won't be any gain for you if you know way too much.

13
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,120
You only have to lend me the waist badge. This way we will clear up things. What about it?

14
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,770
What place do you think the palace is?

15
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,290
A place where you can sneak in as you please? How many lives do you think you have?

16
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,250
Whether I die or not, that's not something you should be concerned about! It has nothing to do with you.

17
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,340
You only have to lend the waist badge to me and we are good.

18
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,350
No way! This is something I can't help you with.

19
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,850
Whether you can help me or not, it is not up to you.

20
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,120
You first take a look at this. What is it?

21
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,030
[Arrest Bulletin: Courtyard of Misfortune staff member secretly ran away from the palace. Reward available to informants... signed Court of Jucidianl Review]

22
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,660
Make way! Step aside!

23
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,660
Get out of the way!

24
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,840
Step aside! Step aside!

25
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,520
Damn it! Damn it!

26
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,320
- What should I do?
-  Let's go!

27
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,460
- Let go of me!
- Let's go!

28
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,090
Come here!

29
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,660
Search the place!

30
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,160
- Have you seen this person?
- No.

31
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,590
Are you the one that asked your attendant to contact the authorities?

32
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,900
- Where is he?
- Still upstairs.

33
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,030
- Hurry and lead the way.
- Yes.

34
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,370
Quickly, don’t let them run!

35
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,020
This way.

36
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,650
Thank you, Young Master, for helping me despite our previous conflict.

37
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,720
No need for thanks. Just give me the waist badge now,

38
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,920
and I'll help you leave here safely. How about it?

39
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,760
This is a good deal, right?

40
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,960
It is a good deal, but I left the palace by lying inside a coffin.

41
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,890
I didn't have my waist badge with me.

42
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,060
This way! This way!

43
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,700
You won't loan it to me? Then don't blame me.

44
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,620
What are you doing?

45
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,710
What else can I do? I'll take you to the authorities.

46
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,430
Yes, yes, yes! I'll loan it, all right?

47
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,840
Just like the saying: "You don't cry until you see the coffin."
(T/N: not give in until all options are exhausted)

48
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,320
Give it.

49
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,050
My cousin is keeping the waist badge for me.

50
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,420
Help me get out of here, and I'll take you there to get it.

51
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,690
Search separately. Thoroughly check every room!

52
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,280
Yes!

53
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,380
Good, I'll trust you once.

54
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,880
What are you doing?

55
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,090
What did you think? Hurry up and remove your clothes.

56
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,530
You want to remove my clothes?

57
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,210
We are both men. It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

58
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,030
You can't take off your clothes.

59
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,440
Let's switch clothes.

60
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,030
I'll wear yours to divert the soldiers.

61
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,760
You wear mine to masquerade as me to leave.

62
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,200
I don’t want to! You get out! I don’t want to change clothes with you

63
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,450
There was no one. This way has a room.

64
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,060
Search!

65
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,860
Hurry and take off your clothes!

66
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,410
No, don't come close!

67
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,480
You go away, go away. I won’t remove my clothes, I won’t remove my clothes.

68
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,050
Just let them capture me then!

69
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,290
Open the door! Open the door!

70
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,270
Open the door! Hurry!

71
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,880
You are so troublesome.

72
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,990
After them!

73
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,270
Stop!

74
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Chase them!

75
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,500
Chase them!

76
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,250
Make way!

77
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,490
Chase them!

78
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,920
Chase them!

79
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,670
Thank you, Young Master Pei, for helping me

80
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,990
despite previous conflicts.

81
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,100
You are Yu'er!

82
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,160
Who are you? Are you a girl or boy?

83
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,570
I can save you, and I can also capture you to take to the authorities.

84
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,890
Let's go to the magistrate's office and clear this up.

85
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,460
I am not a bad person.

86
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,030
This is a long story. Can we go somewhere else

87
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,520
and I'll slowly explain it to you?

88
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,990
[An Family Residence]

89
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,770
Yu'er didn't deliberately cheat Young Master Pei. I concealed my identity

90
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,110
because of a helpless difficulty. Please understand, Young Master Pei.

91
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,520
Is it really you that is on that arrest order?

92
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,840
It is me. I am the physician Xiao Douzi on that arrest order.

93
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,990
I am also the civilian woman, Yu'er, that Young Master Pei knows.

94
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,460
Which one is the real you?

95
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,190
Because of an unexplainable reason,

96
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:27,390
I masqueraded as a male and grew up in the palace to work as a physician.

97
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,560
I wished to escape from the palace someday

98
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,400
so that I wouldn't have to pretend to be a man and could wear a dress,

99
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,660
wear jewelry, and makeup,

100
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,040
just like all the girls to live the life of a regular person.

101
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,500
That's why I pretended to be a corpse that day

102
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,660
to escape from the palace in a coffin.

103
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,270
Young Master Pei knows about all that happened afterward.

104
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,050
I originally thought I could be carefree after escaping from the palace.

105
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,160
I didn't expect that the Directorate of Eunuchs would find out about my escape so quickly.

106
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,070
They even raised an uproar to post a bulletin to arrest me.

107
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,190
Why did your mother and father

108
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,960
let you pretend to be a male at such a young age

109
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,560
and grow up in the palace? Isn't this very dangerous?

110
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,640
My mother is this world's best mother.

111
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,990
If Mom were still alive.

112
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,690
I would have become the most carefree

113
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,500
and happiest girl in the whole world.

114
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,940
As for my father, he is coldhearted

115
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,250
and treated me as excess baggage.

116
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,890
To let Father not worry by not seeing me, it's what I can do for filial piety then.

117
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,420
But why didn't your mother

118
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,240
entrust you to a close friend or relative?

119
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,220
My mother had a rare treasure that an evil person wanted.

120
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,260
That person wanted to murder Mother and me in order to obtain that treasure.

121
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,920
Mother was murdered, and I was saved by a kind-hearted person.

122
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,070
I survived after almost dying and hid in the Courtyard of Misfortune.

123
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,690
Young Master Pei, this must sound unbelievable to you.

124
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,940
But the Courtyard of Misfortune was really the best shelter for me.

125
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,160
It let me live in safety for many years.

126
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,110
My guess is that your enemy must be very powerful.

127
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,990
That's why you'd rather risk hiding in a place like the Courtyard of Misfortune.

128
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,460
Since the older cousin is a fake,

129
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,550
then what you said about having a sweetheart

130
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,060
is also a lie?

131
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,630
I only wanted to hide my identity and live a peaceful life.

132
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,000
I have no interest marrying into a noble family.

133
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,410
But if this word is said no one would believe it.

134
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,260
That's why I made a random lie to Young Master Pei.

135
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,830
Since you have escaped from the palace, why did you dress as a physician again just now

136
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,850
and showed yourself everywhere?

137
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,400
I couldn't help but dress as a physician again today.

138
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,990
It was to hide my identity in order to avoid an old acquaintance.

139
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,360
This is all that I can tell right now.

140
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,320
If my identity is exposed someday,

141
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,560
anyone who knows the truth will be dragged down by me.

142
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,870
Same with you.

143
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,150
The more you know, the more dangerous it is.

144
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,670
To help me escape from the palace,

145
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,940
my best friend, Xiao Shunzi, has been jailed.

146
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,780
I still don't know if Foster Father has rescued him.

147
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,020
Now that I am publicly wanted for arrest,

148
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,860
Foster Father has probably been dragged in already.

149
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,920
Young Master Pei, you have extended a helping hand several times.

150
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,970
I greatly appreciate it but have no way to thank you.

151
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,150
But please rest assured, Young Master Pei, I will hurry to Simen College and withdraw the lawsuit.

152
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,590
You must not do that.

153
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,660
Why not?

154
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,760
Right now, Chang'an is full of bulletin notices to arrest you.

155
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,920
Even though you are dressed as a woman now,

156
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,850
but you still resemble that portrait somewhat.

157
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,500
You must be extra careful and not go to Simen College to show yourself.

158
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,590
It's because I don't know when I may be arrested,

159
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,320
that's why I should withdraw that lawsuit for you soon.

160
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,160
Otherwise, if I suddenly disappear one day,

161
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,930
Young Master Pei will really become

162
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,730
someone who has no place to plea for exoneration?

163
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,830
I don't want to be an evil person who wrongs good people.

164
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,600
A'Ni!

165
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,720
You came back, that’s good! I was worried!

166
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,680
There is big trouble!

167
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,380
Young Master Pei.

168
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,620
Shopkeeper A'Ni, don't panic.

169
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,730
I already know that Miss Yu'er

170
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,030
is the Xiao Douzi on that arrest order.

171
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:45,810
I already heard the whole story just now.

172
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,520
It's not easy to survive. Everyone has his own difficulties.

173
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,130
I will definitely guard Miss Yu'er's secret.

174
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,720
I still have something to ask Yu'er.

175
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,830
Please excuse me, Young Master Pei.

176
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,230
Let's go.

177
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,160
[Auspicious and Delicate Breeze]

178
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,830
What did you tell him? You didn't say who your mother was, did you?

179
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,460
Foster Father had told me not to ever tell anyone about that.

180
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,030
Anyone who knows the truth will be dragged down by me.

181
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,180
You must not reveal your true identity.

182
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,500
The less people know, the safer it is.

183
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,440
But how did he find out that you were Physician Dou?

184
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,510
He came here, probably wanting to talk about withdrawing the lawsuit.

185
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,110
But he happened to see me dressed as a physician.

186
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,210
That's how I was exposed.

187
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,000
It looks that we must be extra cautious in the future.

188
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,860
You almost got seen by your aunt just now.

189
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,910
In a quick turn, Young Master Pei also saw through your real identity.

190
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,560
Your arrest orders are posted on all the streets outside.

191
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,130
I am really worried.

192
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,290
A'Ni, don't be too worried.

193
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,230
I will be more careful in the future.

194
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,770
Young Master Pei, please sit while I brew some tea.

195
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:20,330
Speaking of which, I haven't thanked Young Master Pei yet.

196
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,060
Thank you for saving me.

197
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,690
If I have the chance in the future, I will risk my life

198
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,860
to repay you.

199
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,900
Repay me in the future?

200
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,240
What about the waist badge?

201
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,570
Are you going back on the promise?

202
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,230
I'm not going back on my word.

203
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,760
It's just that I was in a hurry to escape from danger

204
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,620
that I lied to you.

205
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,200
I escaped from the palace without intending to go back.

206
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,530
That's why I didn't even bring my waist badge out.

207
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,600
May I ask Young Master Pei, why do you want to take the risk to enter the palace?

208
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,990
I want to see someone.

209
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,990
I know quite a few people in the palace.

210
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,590
Tell me who you want to see, maybe I can help you.

211
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,590
Since you've already escaped from the palace, obviously you can't go back.

212
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,240
It's useless to tell you.

213
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,780
No, I'm planning to go back to the palace.

214
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,910
You want to go back to the palace?

215
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,000
When palace servants feel depressed,

216
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,480
it's a frequent occurrence that someone commits suicide.

217
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,650
This is a great taboo in the palace.

218
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,470
That's why whenever someone disappears,

219
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,910
the Directorate of Eunuchs will dispatch people to search quietly.

220
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,370
They would never raise such a public ruckus.

221
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,660
Now that I've only disappeared for four or five days,

222
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,710
there is already an arrest order from the palace.

223
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,230
It is definitely not a simple matter.

224
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,060
I am not afraid of anything else,

225
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,530
but I fear that Foster Father and Xiao Shunzi have been dragged in by me.

226
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:53,930
So I've thought it through. I can't let them suffer for me, so I'll return to the palace.

227
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,240
No!  Definitely no!

228
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,670
A'Ni is right.

229
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,690
There is an arrest order for you now in the palace.

230
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,820
If you go back, it's like sending yourself to death. Not only that, you can't save the others.

231
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,390
You will lose your life for nothing, too.

232
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,220
I said going back to the palace, I don't mean right now.

233
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,750
I will make a plan and not rush into it.

234
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,500
Young Master Pei, you still haven't told me who you want to see in the palace.

235
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,890
Forget it.

236
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,530
If I told you, you wouldn't be able to help anyway.

237
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,350
Don't underestimate me.

238
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,600
Just tell me, maybe I can come up with an idea.

239
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,250
Young Master Pei, you can go ahead and tell us.

240
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,560
Yu'er and I are women, but we also understand the principle of knowing gratitude is a debt to repay.

241
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,760
There must be something big if you want to risk your life to go into the palace.

242
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,130
Even though we can't help, but we will definitely guard your secret.

243
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,210
If you don't tell us, even if I want to help you,

244
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,460
there's no way for me to help.

245
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,800
The person I want to see...

246
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,080
is the crown prince.

247
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,070
Crown Prince?

248
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,190
This is a serious matter. Excuse me for not telling you the details.

249
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,120
But I swear, the proof is substantial.

250
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,090
The crown prince is in trouble. I'm telling the truth.

251
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,240
Fatty, I need to go to the restroom.

252
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,970
Hurry up!

253
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,890
Why have you come again?

254
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,560
I say, Eunuch Sun,

255
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,200
consider this a help to you.

256
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,540
The higher-ups have already issued their orders.

257
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,490
Even if you stand here until nighttime,

258
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,140
you still won't be able to see Xiao Shunzi.

259
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:06,340
Then, please take this food

260
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,160
to him, all right? Thank you.

261
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,380
Sure, sure!  Just go back then.

262
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,810
Time to eat.

263
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,960
What are you looking at?

264
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,790
Let me tell you!  Nobody has come to see you.

265
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,540
Master, bad news!

266
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,420
There is talk everywhere in the palace, saying that Xiao Douzi has escaped from the palace.

267
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,710
Nonsense!

268
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,790
It's true. Attire Expert Zhuo reported it to the Directorate of Eunuchs.

269
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,530
Now there are posted bulletins everywhere in Chang'an to arrest him.

270
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,870
Master! Master! Big trouble!

271
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,900
I heard from the eunuchs who had gone outside the palace for errands

272
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,530
that there are arrest orders posted everywhere outside the palace to arrest Xiao Douzi.

273
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,870
What?

274
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,970
Xiao Fuzi, is it true that Xiao Douze escaped from the palace?

275
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,510
There's no such thing. Don't talk nonsense.

276
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,930
Xiao Douzi and Xiao Shunzi are such good friends.

277
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,620
Xiao Douzi is missing now.

278
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,010
Xiao Shunzi is arrested and they won't let him out.

279
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,960
The news about Xiao Douzi's escape,

280
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,090
could it have come from Xiao Shunzi?

281
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,180
Xiao Douzi didn't escape from the palace.

282
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,790
Xiao Shunzi is not that kind of person either.

283
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,200
[Courtyard of Misfortune]

284
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,450
If you can safely leave the city, just leave a mark

285
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,980
for me outside the city gate, so that I won't worry.

286
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,510
I'll remember it.

287
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,430
Xiao Douzi, it's been many days.

288
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,720
You should have left the city, right?

289
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,030
Attire Expert Zhuo is too vicious. I really fear for you.

290
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,570
Tomorrow is the day when I can leave the palace to make purchases.

291
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:25,340
I should confirm it, or I just can't quit worrying.

292
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,760
Liuli, what's wrong?

293
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,590
I had a nightmare.

294
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,900
A'Ni, do you know which day of the month it is tomorrow?

295
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,340
The fifth day.

296
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,040
Nothing.

297
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,690
You should stay home these days and not go anywhere else.

298
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,600
You heard me?

299
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,750
I've been keeping watch on Liuli today and can't go anywhere.

300
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,140
I have to find a chance to tell the shop owner about what happened today,

301
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,970
and ask him come up with a solution.

302
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,550
I hope there won't be trouble.

303
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,390
Master, Wei Lin asks to see you.

304
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,060
So early?

305
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,880
Let him in.

306
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,480
Yes.

307
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,390
I, servant Wei Lin, greet Attire Expert Zhuo.

308
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,570
What has Sun Decheng

309
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,630
been doing these days?

310
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,650
Replying to Attire Expert Zhuo.

311
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:23,990
Sun Decheng has been busy lately bribing the lateral courts.

312
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,500
But he couldn't even see Xiao Shunzi.

313
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,980
He's almost ill from anger.

314
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,650
The matter of issuing Xiao Douzi as wanted,

315
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,930
I guess...

316
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,380
he has already heard, right?

317
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,740
He knows. I'm here because of it.

318
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,050
According to usual practice, today should be the day the Courtyard of Misfortune goes out of the palace to make purchases.

319
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,710
I'm guessing that if Xiao Douzi really escaped outside the palace,

320
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,870
then Sun Decheng

321
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:57,760
will find an opportunity to see him this time.

322
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,540
Wei Lin.

323
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,230
I just like that smart mind of yours!

324
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,730
Thank you, Attire Expert Zhuo, for your praise.

325
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,610
However,

326
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:14,140
lately Sun Decheng seems to have found out

327
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,690
that I'm following him.

328
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,950
And without his permission,

329
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,460
I can't go outside the palace. I have no way of watching him.

330
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,610
So I came to ask Attire Expert Zhuo.

331
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,670
What should I do?

332
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:38,780
- Qiniang, then you go watch Sun Decheng.
- Yes.

333
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,520
Keep your eyes open.

334
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,190
Don't ruin this for me.

335
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,310
I shall take my leave.

336
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,650
There's a mouse! There's a mouse!

337
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,530
There's a mouse! There's a mouse!

338
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,910
- There's a mouse!
- Where?
- Inside the room!

339
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,170
You— Why don't you look for it?

340
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,550
Look carefully. Do you see it?

341
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,970
Look carefully. It's right under the bed.

342
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,430
Come out. It's not here.

343
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,090
Liuli.

344
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,920
Liuli!

345
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,940
Toys! Have a look!

346
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,310
A'Ni, is Yu'er here?

347
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,940
I'm here to investigate some palace things.

348
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,120
I don't know where she went. I'm looking for her right now.

349
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:58,120
Everywhere is plastered with her order for arrest. Why did she come out?

350
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,400
A'Ni, do you know what date will be tomorrow?

351
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,690
The fifth. What is it?

352
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,660
Nothing.

353
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,280
It's bad! She must have gone to see Eunuch Sun!

354
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,990
Yu'er's foster father?

355
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,790
Yu'er said that every fifth of the month is the day the Courtyard of Misfortune goes shopping.

356
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,000
She's worried that Eunuch Sun will be involved in her troubles. She must have gone to see him!

357
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,190
Where will they meet?

358
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:26,390
The city's gate. Yu'er said that Eunuch Sun ordered her

359
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:30,570
that if she could leave safely Chang'An, to leave a message for him there.

360
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,740
Okay, I'll go look for her.

361
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,600
I'll go, too.

362
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:59,260
Fresh cabbage!

363
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,900
Geat wine! Homemade great wine!

364
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,760
Have a look! Have a look!

365
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,600
Why's it him again?

366
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,070
He's with A'Ni every day.

367
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,060
No, I need to check it out.

368
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,720
Next.

369
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,600
Still looking for this person.

370
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,230
There are so many people here. How do we find her?

371
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,670
Come with me. Let's go over there.

372
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,930
This...

373
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:19,840
Shaobing! Fresh out the oven!
[T/N: a kind of flat bread]

374
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,690
- This one is so pretty!
- You want this one?
- Yes.

375
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:05,500
I just remembered! When Yu'er left, she brought a veil.

376
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,840
We should look for a person wearing a veil!

377
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,390
- Yu'er!
- Yu'er!

378
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,410
Mother, look forward!

379
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,110
Oh no!

380
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,790
Eldest Sister Qiniang!

381
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:26,600
It's me. Me.

382
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,830
- You are... Cao Wu?
- Right.

383
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,010
Sister Qiniang, it's really you!

384
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,440
It's been so many years since I last saw you. Now you're this tall already?

385
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,960
Yeah, it's been so long since we last met.

386
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,720
Do you still remember? We used to be so close. You often came to my house to play.

387
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,970
Of course, I remember.

388
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,170
Eldest Sister, it's so rare for you to come out of the palace.

389
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:50,000
Come to my house for a while.

390
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,550
Eldest Sister!

391
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,210
Guard, I saw Physician Dou!

392
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,090
What Physician Dou?

393
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,730
Him! Physician Dou from the Courtyard of Misfortune!

394
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,330
Did you see clearly?

395
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:19,070
I'm absolutely sure!

396
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,340
I'm a servant at Imperial Attire Bureau! I know him!

397
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,890
Let's go.

398
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,790
Yu'er don't be afraid. It's me.

399
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:47,020
The one wearing the plaited bamboo hat. It's him. They are together. Get him!

400
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,720
- What are you doing? Let me go. I'm from the Courtyard of Misfortune!
- Behave!

401
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,900
Eunuch Sun, where is Physician Dou?

402
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:03,920
How would I know where he is? If you're asking me, then who would I ask?

403
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,540
Eunuch Sun, if you don't tell us where Physician Dou is, then I'm sorry.

404
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,910
I can only take you back to the palace. You explain it to Deputy Director Pan.

405
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,880
I...

406
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,020
Let me go. Let me go.

407
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,280
I'm sorry, Yu'er.

[Auspicious and Delicate Breeze]

409
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,590
A'Ni.

410
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,300
She's pretty upset.

411
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,660
Let her calm down by herself.

412
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,850
Earlier, thanks to Young Master Pei's help,

413
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,660
that's why Yu'er could escape the danger.

414
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,310
A'Ni thanks Young Master Pei in Yu'er's stead.

415
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,120
You are exaggerating Shopkeeper A'Ni.

416
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,040
Yu'er!

417
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,950
What are you planning to do?

418
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,600
- I'm going back to the palace to surrender.
- Nonsense!

419
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,880
You can't go! You stay here and behave well.

420
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,850
Once the situation isn't as bad in a few days, the shopowner will think of a way to take you out of Chang'An.

421
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,740
No. I must go back.

422
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,280
Because of me, Xiao Shunzi got caught. Now, Foster Father got caught.

423
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,020
How can I stay here?

424
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:18,630
I can't let them suffer because of me. I must return to the palace to save them!

425
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,940
The situation has gotten so bad, it's useless to go back.

426
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,450
You can't save them. You will also be caught in an impasse.

427
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,970
Then I still must go back.

428
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:29,900
They are my most treasured people. I can't sit back and do nothing.

429
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,460
Yu'er!

430
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,360
She...

431
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,350
I hit her acupoints. She'll wake up in a few hours.

432
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:42,260
Take good care of her. Don't let her run around.

433
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,900
Quickly take it off!

434
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,780
Don't come near! Don't come near!

435
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,700
Go away! Go away!

436
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,500
What is wrong with me?

437
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,940
Why do I worry so much about that

clever yet mysterious girl?

[An Residence]

440
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,510
A'Ni, I know you're worried I will be in danger going back to the palace.

441
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:01,620
I must disappoint you.

442

Liuli!

443

Liuli!

444
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:46,620
A'Ni, Father is in danger because of me.

445
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,990
Thinking thoroughly about it, I must go back to the palace.

446
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,150
To bear what I must bear.

447
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,650
To face what I must face.

448
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,990
If I let Father suffer in my stead,

449
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,590
no matter outside the palace or anywhere in all the world,

450
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:03,800
I won't be able to feel free and peaceful.

451
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,450
Uncle cares a lot about Liuli.

452
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,630
It gave me the feeling of a family after I left the palace.

453
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,390
I can't bear to bid my farewells to my uncle in person.

454
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:16,660
I can only kowtow from far away with my full filial heart.

455
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,000
Please forgive me for not saying goodbye.

456
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,060
Also, don't fear and worry about me.

Finally, please help me tell Pei Xingjian

458
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:32,070
I know very well that his plan is very capital.

459
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,000
It will be hard to survive going back to the palace this time.

460
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,110
But as long as there's a fine possibility,

461
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,300
I will definitely let the crown prince know.

462
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,540
Please take good care of yourself! Liuli

00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,360
Is it that something happened to Yu'er?

465
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,950
She still can't be at ease about her father. She went back to the palace.

466
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:11,570
She left a letter and asked me to tell you, that if there's the least chance,

467
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,440
she will help you to send a message to the crown prince!

468
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,250
It's still early. Maybe Yu'er still hasn't entered the palace!

469
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,290

I'm a physician from the Courtyard of Misfortune! I came out of the palace for business and lost my waist plate.

472
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,960
I'm in a hurry to go back to the palace and carry on with my orders, could you make an exception?

473
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,450
Without a waist plate, no one can enter.

474
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,380

00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,710
I want to see Deputy Director Eunuch Pan Qinhai?

I have something important to clarify about Eunuch Sun from the Courtyard of Misfortune.

477

Do you think you can see Deputy Director Pan as you wish?

00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,800
Didn't he just talk about Sun Decheng from the Courtyard of Misfortune?

481
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,850
I also seem to have heard that something happened to Sun Decheng.

[Arrest Bulletin]

It's him!

486
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,120
Eunuch Sun, you have been staying in the lateral court one night.

487
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,770
Have you thought about the whereabouts of Xiao Douzi?

488
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:09,390
Eunuch Pan, even if you ask again,

489
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:11,580
I will still say the same.

490
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,790
Nobody from the Courtyard of Misfortune has seen Physician Dou in the past few days.

491
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:19,510
I also personally led people to search thoroughly the Courtyard of Misfortune.

492
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:23,010
I've looked in every possible place of the palace many times.

493
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,250
But we haven't found any trace of Physician Dou.

00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:19,410
♫  The more twists, the deeper it is  ♫

514
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,710
♫  Breaking up and making up is like an illusion  ♫

515
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:30,100
♫  Resembles a traveler traveling through this life  ♫

516
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:35,750
♫  Time ignores everything including obsession  ♫

517
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:40,780
♫  With the candlelight flickering indefinitely  ♫

518
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:44,520
♫  After the fire, there was only one thing left  ♫

519
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:52,870
♫  A bright moon that makes one's heart tingle  ♫

520
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,130
♫  After the fire, there was only one thing left  ♫

521
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:08,680
♫  A bright moon that makes one's heart tingle  ♫
