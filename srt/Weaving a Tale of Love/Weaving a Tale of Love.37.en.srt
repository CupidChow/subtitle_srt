[Weaving a Tale of Love]

00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,100
[Episode 37]

4
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,890
Go ahead and take His Majesty's pulse.

5
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,530
Yes.

6
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,130
Why is His Majesty's hand this cold?

7
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,090
His Majesty has already passed away.

00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,980
[Hall of Immortal Nectar]

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,040
[Hall of Sunset Pool]

10
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,970
Yu Liu,

11
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:08,090
pack things. We're going to Ganye Temple.

12
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,000
[A month later]

13
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,780
Liuli!

14
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,770
Liuli?

15
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,030
Eunuch Wang.

16
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,300
Eunuch Wang.

17
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,850
You are finally back!

18
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,600
Where is Liuli? Is she still well?

19
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,730
Don't be anxious. Liuli is fine for now.

20
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,200
Did you harvest the medicine?

21
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,940
- Here it is.
- Hurry and give it to the pharmacy.

22
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,720
- You must not delay even for an instant.
- Yes.

23
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,100
- Where is Liuli? Take me to see her now!
- Don't be impatient.

24
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,190
How much did you suffer?

25
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,070
You are wounded all over.

26
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,280
When I went to get the Thunder God Precipice, I, unfortunately, fell off the cliff.

27
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,060
Luckily, I grabbed onto a vine and hung on to it

28
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,730
so I didn't die. After I was unconscious for two days,

29
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,720
I was saved by a monk who was searching for medicine in the mountains.

30
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,240
Let's not talk about that now. Where is Liuli?

31
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,130
Hurry and take me to see her.

32
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,400
Listen to me first, listen to me.

33
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,950
After you left, the late emperor passed away, and the crown prince ascended to the throne.

34
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,620
His Majesty has transferred Liuli to the sleeping quarters in the inner palace

35
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,760
so that it's more convenient to take care of her. This...

36
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,030
You know about the rule in the inner palace.

37
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,120
It probably won't be easy for you to visit anymore.

38
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,380
His Majesty placed Liuli in the inner palace?

39
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,850
How is this adhering to rules?

40
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,170
You should know.  When His Majesty was still the crown prince,

41
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,070
he already adored Xiao Douzi very much.

42
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,040
Then after finding out that she was a female,

43
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,920
he was so happy.

44
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,350
If it wasn't for the fact that Liuli is sick now,

45
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,060
His Majesty probably would have already issued a decree.

46
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,630
Liuli's status at this time would be...

47
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,170
would be imperial now.

48
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,330
I want to see His Majesty.

49
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,940
You risked your life to find the medicine and achieved a new merit.

50
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,500
Of course, His Majesty will reward you handsomely.

51
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,080
Go home and rest first. When His Majesty is finished with the court,

52
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,620
he should summon you.

53
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,620
Has Old Medicine Master said how certain he is about this medicine?

54
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,070
Pei Xingjian especially reminded me that Old Medicine Master said that the medicine is being slowly adapted.

55
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,410
It cannot be taken all at once. Liuli is still weak.

56
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,170
She almost–

57
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,680
almost–

58
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,830
This medicine...

59
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,240
was sent over by Shouyue?

60
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,520
Yes. Your Majesty cares about Pei Xingjian and hasn't summoned him the last few days.

61
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,630
But he couldn't sit still, so he went to Old Medicine Master to help make the medicine.

62
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,950
Pei Xingjian knows that Your Majesty is anxious

63
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,700
for Liuli to wake up soon. Once the antidote is concocted,

64
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,170
he delivered it himself.

65
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,770
Greetings, Your Majesty.

66
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,570
Greetings, Your Majesty.

67
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,190
- How is it?
- Replying to Your Majesty.

68
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,700
Liuli is appearing to be calm after ingesting the medicine.

69
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,880
Her breathing is much smoother, too.

70
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,850
Old Medicine Master is indeed a medicine master as he was named in the past.

71
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,660
As I see it, given some more time, she can completely recover.

72
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,220
Good. Good.

73
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,730
Liuli, did you hear?

74
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,440
You will recover soon.

75
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,200
Once you recover, I will uncover your mother's case.

76
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,440
And also give you a big reward.

77
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,570
Young Master Pei is waiting outside to see His Majesty.

78
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,150
A'Sheng, what is it?

79
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,050
Your Majesty,

80
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,040
Sir Pei is waiting outside to see Your Majesty.

81
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,440
It's deep into the night and I am tired.

82
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,720
Tell Shouyue to go back first.

83
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,320
When I'm not busy, I will naturally summon him.

84
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,080
Yes.

85
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,430
[Taiji Gate]

86
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,920
- Imperial Guard Leader.
- Eunuch Wang.

87
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,230
Has Liuli taken the medicine? What is the effect? Is she awake yet?

88
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,810
Don't worry, don't worry.

89
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,550
Old Medicine Master's antidote is indeed miraculous.

90
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,700
Liuli's pulse is stable now, and her breathing is stronger.

91
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,220
The imperial physician said, given enough time to nurture,

92
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,370
she can completely recover.

93
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,460
That's good then.

94
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,730
What about His Majesty?

95
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,690
Will His Majesty see me?

96
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,890
His Majesty said you should go home to rest.

97
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:30,240
Once he gets through the busy work in the next few days, he will summon you.

98
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,340
I accept His Majesty's edict.

Yes, they said that she is finally awake.

119
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,860
Your Majesty, slow down.

120
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,690
Liuli just woke up. Instead of serving her with care,

121
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,040
why are you all outside?

122
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,000
Replying to Your Majesty, someone is visiting her.

123
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,410
Liuli ordered us to wait outside.

124
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,450
Sun Decheng of the Courtyard of Misfortune respectfully kneels to greet Your Majesty.

125
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,470
Why are you here?

126
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,640
- Liuli greets Your Majesty.
- Liuli.

127
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,090
You just recovered from a severe illness, no need to be formal.

128
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,630
You can all leave.

129
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,090
- Yes.
- Yes.

130
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,160
How are you feeling?

131
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,190
I was unconscious and in a deep sleep for several months.

132
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,650
When I woke up, I felt like I was in another world.

133
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:59,890
I missed Foster Father and Xiao Shunzi, so I asked them to come and visit.

134
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,270
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

135
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,910
I also want to congratulate Your Majesty's ascension to the throne.

136
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,610
Liuli.

137
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,170
If you didn't risk your life to save me, I couldn't have easily ascended to the throne.

138
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,420
Liuli, you are my lucky star.

139
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,730
I will treat you very well and not let you suffer ever again.

140
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,970
Your Majesty is magnanimous. I don't dare to overstep my station.

141
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,320
When I tried to send out the message at that time,

142
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,840
I used a hidden chess move. If it weren't for Pei Xingjian to

143
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,280
see through the code that I left in the dragon robe and the message,

144
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,360
and persuade Pu Bano to look for Medicine Master in the dungeon,

145
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,250
not only couldn't I have achieved merit, I might have misguided Your Majesty

146
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,570
to be trapped by Prince of Cao. I could have become a sinner in Great Tang.

147
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:14,330
Your Majesty, if you want to assess contributions and give rewards, Pei Xingjian should get the top reward.

148
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,480
Both you and Shouyue are meritorious. I will give rewards appropriately based on the merits.

149
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:24,120
I have ordered the Court of Judicial Review to re-examine your mother's case.

150
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,570
Once you completely recover, you can personally interrogate Zhuo Jinniang,

151
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,310
vindicate your mother, and restore her reputation.

152
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,770
To be able to vindicate my mother's grievance and revenge for her,

153
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,120
this is Your Majesty's blessing. I, Liuli, kneel to thank Your Majesty's grace.

154
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,390
I wish Your Majesty to live ten thousand years and many more.

155
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,340
Liuli, you did so much for me.

156
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,900
It's really not much I can do for you.

157
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,890
Once you've recovered, I'm ready to confer you—

158
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,090
I plead with Your Majesty,

159
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,990
once I have achieved my revenge,

160
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,470
permit me to become a female monk at Ganye Temp and stay by Talented Lady Wu's side.

161
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,390
What are you saying?

162
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,720
You want to enter religious life?

163
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,090
Why?

164
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,440
Replying to Your Majesty. Sister Wu saved my life,

165
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,010
so she is like a sister to me. When Sister Wu shaved off her hair,

166
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,480
I already wanted to stay by her side at that time.

167
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,450
Because I hadn't avenged Mother's grievance yet,

168
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,710
so I had to stay here.

169
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,910
Now that my wish is fulfilled, I have no more earthly wishes.

170
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,810
I don't want any rewards.

171
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,890
I only wish that Your Majesty will permit me to go to Ganye Temple

172
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,530
and accompany Sister Wu.

173
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:09,800
Liuli, I promised Talented Lady Wu before

174
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,340
that once I become emperor, I would find a way to bring her back to the palace.

175
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,300
Even though it's difficult to do, but I shall not go back on my promise.

176
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,620
Talented Lady Wu will return to the palace sooner or later.

177
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:33,380
If you really want to stay by her side, just wait patiently for her to return then.

178
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,490
I want to beg for another reward, Your Majesty.

179
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,070
What do you want me to reward you?

180
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,510
Please allow me to go back to the Bureau of Imperial Attire to work, Your Majesty.

181
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,660
After this severe illness, I am alive after death.

182
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,130
It makes me really reminiscent of times from the past.

183
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,140
Mother's grievance has been avenged.

184
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,080
From now on, I have no other entanglements.

185
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,210
I only wish to return to the Bureau of Imperial Attire to continue to make clothes for Your Majesty.

186
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,330
Liuli, you need to think it through.

187
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,460
I want to give you an even bigger honor and bestowment,

188
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,830
- and my one—
- I am a person of little luck.

189
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,410
When I was a child, I dragged my mother into harm.

190
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,520
Later, I almost harmed Foster Father and Xiao Shunzi.

191
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,890
I have no other wish,

192
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,410
except to never drag other people into harm again.

193
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,960
I will be content.

194
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,710
Your Majesty, if you can allow me to return to the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

195
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,760
I will behave

196
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,500
and concentrate on my duty without any other thoughts.

197
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,230
I understand. The "other people" that you don't want to drag into harm

198
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,960
is Pei Xingjian.

199
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,730
Liuli, do you know that I want to give you

200
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,370
isn't just glory and riches, but my one true heart?

201
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:12,790
But your heart has been given to Pei Xingjian.

202
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,940
Fine.

203
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,220
I'll allow you to return to the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

204
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,140
You will stay there obediently

205
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,210
and concentrate on dressmaking.

206
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,420
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your grace.

207
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,200
His Majesty has given your father a position as an official.

208
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,180
It's very clear that he wants to marry you into the inner palace.

209
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,500
Everyone knows it in the inner palace.

210
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,360
What about Pei Xingjian? Is he all right?

211
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,100
Why won't the palace maids let me see him?

212
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,590
Pei Xingjian returned from finding the medicine.

213
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,490
His Majesty avoided seeing him, saying he should rest

214
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,650
because of his injury.

215
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:07,200
Pei Xingjian was anxious and came to see me at the Courtyard of Misfortune.

216
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,600
We guess that His Majesty must be aware of your feelings for each other.

217
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,590
That's why His Majesty is afraid of him.

218
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,760
My jade pendant?

219
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,690
This is probably the best ending

220
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,350
for everyone's sake.

221
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,990
Your Majesty, don't keep drinking anymore.

222
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:22,610
Even though this wine is fragrant, you'll get drunk if you drink too much.

223
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:27,380
Wine is the best when it's aged.

224
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,170
People are the best when they are the old ones.

225
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,370
Your Majesty, isn't that Bao'er?

226
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,330
Your Majesty.

227
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,240
Bao'er.

228
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,870
Isn't it staying with Talented Lady Wu?

229
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,790
Why is it here?

230
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,640
Your Majesty, I am kneeling in Ganye Temple

231
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,710
to congratulate you from afar for your ascension to the throne,

232
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,770
to finally achieve your ambition and implement your grand plans.

233
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:41,500
Other than feeling joyous for Your Majesty, I am also worried for Your Majesty.

234
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,350
I know very well that a monarch sits alone in the hall of supreme power,

235
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:50,050
but has to endure unimaginable loneliness and solitude that ordinary people cannot withstand.

236
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:55,300
I am away from the palace and cannot do anything for Your Majesty.

237
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,640
When Your Majesty is happy, have you also forgotten me?

238
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,720
If Your Majesty is distressed with worries,

239
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,470
you can let Bao'er pass a message.

240
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,990
I would be pleased to be Your Majesty's confidante

241
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,610
and listen to Your Majesty's thoughts.

242
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,210
In this world,

243
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,560
Meiniang has treated me the best.

244
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,250
But in my heart,

245
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,660
it's all filled with Liuli.

246
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
Meiniang,

247
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,830
teach me.

248
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,900
How should I treat Shouyue and Liuli?

249
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,920
Buy me one, too.

250
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,320
You haven't done anything good. Why should I buy it for you?

251
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,360
"The case of Former Attire Expert An at the Bureau of Imperial Attire

252
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,570
overstepping boundaries to make the pheasant robe for the empress,

253
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,170
after the Court of Judicial Review's investigation and new trial,

254
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,400
both material and people evidence are confirmed,

255
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,840
it's truly Zhuo Jinniang and Attire Chief Lin

256
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,580
who framed an innocent person.

257
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,980
To extricate her connection, Consort Yang

258
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,030
did not confirm facts, believed in biased statements,

259
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,570
and was also responsible for a lack of investigation.

260
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:33,530
Zhuo Jinniang and Attire Chief Lin overstepped boundaries and made the pheasant robe for the empress,

261
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:37,880
lied to the emperor, even framed innocents, and destroyed the corpse to hide evidence.

262
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,850
Their extreme evil cannot be forgiven by heavenly law.

263
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,550
His Majesty has ordered the Court of Judicial Review

264
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:45,130
to announce your crimes to the world

265
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,780
and publicize to the people

266
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,700
to console Attire Expert An's spirit in Heaven.

267
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,210
Attire Chief Lin and Zhuo Jinniang cannot be forgiven for their high crimes.

268
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,590
The punishment is decapitation."

269
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,590
Liuli,

270
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,020
I don't want to die.

271
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,200
Spare me.

272
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,300
Liuli, I... I don't want to die!

273
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,610
I haven't fulfilled my dream in dressmaking.

274
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,080
You don't know that, do you?

275
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,960
I always wished to become Number One Needle in the World.

276
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,950
My wish is not fulfilled, so I really can't die.

277
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:13,020
Liuli, I beg you.

278
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,660
I'm wrong.

279
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,560
I'm wrong!

280
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,690
I'm really wrong!

281
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:29,160
Liuli, it's all my fault.

282
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,620
Liuli,

283
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,950
I am guilty toward Teacher.

284
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:42,380
I harmed her. I know I did wrong.

285
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:47,500
Please be merciful. Just let me go and forgive me.

286
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,390
As long as you say a word for me to His Majesty,

287
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:55,050
His Majesty will definitely spare my life.

288
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:58,210
Only you can save me, Liuli.

289
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,420
I will work as a horse or ox and serve as a servant

290
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,660
all my life to repay you.

291
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:08,740
Liuli, spare me.

292
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,610
You committed unforgivable sins.

293
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:16,060
Zhuo Jinniang, you are getting what you deserve.

294
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,030
Think back carefully

295
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,710
all the terrible things you did to my mother.

296
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,430
No... No...

297
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,930
I...

298
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,280
I...

299
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,040
Qiniang.

300
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,270
Qiniang.

301
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:40,270
Qiniang! Qiniang!

302
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,300
I am your master!

303
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,660
How can you be so heartless to your master?

304
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:51,390
How can you bear to see me die like this?

305
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,970
Qiniang, beg Liuli.

306
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:58,440
She will listen to you. You are the only one who can save Master now.

307
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,810
My dream in dressmaking

308
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:07,690
is not finished yet. I cannot die!

309
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:13,380
Master, if you had known about now, would you have done what you did?

310
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,880
You've committed so many sinful things, how can I help you?

311
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,460
I'm sorry that I cannot do anything.

312
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,270
You... are heartless!

313
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,350
Give me another chance, will you?

314
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,860
I beg you, Liuli.

315
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,870
Attire Chief Kudi, it's time for the execution.

316
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,860
Liuli, save me!

317
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,410
Liuli!

318
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:57,500
Liuli, save me!

319
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,100
Liuli, save me!

320
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,020
Liuli!

321
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,410
♫  The constant regret in spring is everlasting  ♫

322
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:11,380
♫  The constant regret in spring is everlasting  ♫

323
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:15,170
♫  Don't know how it has turn this way  ♫

324
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:19,920
Mother, it was right here that year,

325
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,370
you left with your grievance

326
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:26,040
but exchanged for a chance to let me live.

327
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,860
I hid my name and identity to survive for more than ten years.

328
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,920
I have finally avenged for your grievance

329
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,350
and vindicated you.

330
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,480
Mother, you've always wished for my safety, comfort,

331
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,760
and happiness.

332
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,830
I promise you

333
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,330
that I will cherish these days and times that I have obtained with much difficulty.

334
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,870
I will definitely stay safe

335
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,300
and happy.

336
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,320
May your spirit in Heaven

337
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,370
rest in peace.

338
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,860
His Majesty summons Imperial Guard Chief Adjutant Cao and

339
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,820
Imperial Guard Leader Pei Xingjian

340
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,270
to enter the court.

341
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,380
Your Majesty, Imperial Guard Leader is here.

342
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,040
Greetings, Your Majesty.

343
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,510
May Your Majesty live ten thousand years and many more.

344
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:30,850
Imperial Guard Leader, no need for formality. You may rise.

345
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,530
Thank you, Your Majesty.

346
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,180
I will soon ascend to the throne. Lately, I have been busy handling state affairs.

347
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,410
I also wanted to let you recuperate from the injury.

348
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:47,130
That's why I could only call you before me today.

349
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:51,550
My injury is not serious. I am grateful because you show solicitude for me, Your Majesty.

350
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,010
Shouyue, you are my most trusted official.

351
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,640
Not only have you prevented Prince of Cao's conspiracy,

352
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,280
but you have also found the herb which saved Liuli's life.

353
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,370
I want to reward you and Liuli according to your contributions.

354
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,490
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your grace.

355
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,520
Shouyue, seeing how impatient you are,

356
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,410
you must already have thought about what reward you want.

357
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,950
As long as you don't ask me to arrange you a marriage,

358
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,970
I can promise you anything.

359
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,510
Shouyue...

360
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,350
You are the heir to the Zhongjuan Pei branch of the Pei clan.

361
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,360
About the conflicts between you and my aunt, Grand Princess Linhai,

362
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,610
I am aware of some of it.

363
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:59,430
They say you jinxed your father, mother, wife, and child.

364
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,690
You are a fated disaster.

365
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,170
I know that...

366
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:10,190
behind this gossip, there was probably some help given by Grand Princess.

367
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:13,500
Your wife died many years ago, and you have not re-married.

368
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,770
It's probably somewhat related to my auntie who speaks with arrogance.

369
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,800
Originally, I wanted to find you

370
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,280
a high official's daughter and bestow marriage

371
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,030
so that my aunt could be restrained.

372
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,260
But the late emperor passed away not too long ago.

373
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,850
It's really not convenient during national mourning.

374
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,820
I understand.

375
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,010
Thank you, Your Majesty.

376
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,780
Stand up!

377
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,480
Liuli has already told me what reward she wants.

378
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,430
She said she has no other wish

379
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,670
than being able to stay in the palace,

380
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,210
return to the Bureau of Imperial Attire so she could craft clothes for me.

381
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,770
Shouyue,

382
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,640
what reward do you want?

383
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,580
I don't wish for any rewards.

384
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,620
I only wish to do my best for Great Tang and Your Majesty

385
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,460
so that I don't disappoint my master's tutelage

386
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,190
and don't disappoint Your Majesty's acknowledgment of my abilities.

387
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:46,940
I have just ascended the throne and my foundation isn't solidified.

388
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,840
I am thinking about transferring you to the Ministry of Personnel

389
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,380
to recruit talents for me,

390
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,190
select the best to be officials to be set up in court.

391
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:59,950
It's too bad that your resume is still too thin, so you are not quite ready for the Ministry of Personnel.

392
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,680
But if I keep you in the palace,

393
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,130
you will be under-utilized for your talents and abilities.

394
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:10,030
After thinking it over, I want you to work for several years as Magistrate of Chang'an City.

395
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,480
Once you have acquired enough experience,

396
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,920
I will transfer you to the Ministry of Personnel.

397
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,810
Shouyue,

398
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,590
what do you think?

399
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:30,000
I accept the decree.

400
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,060
Thank you, Your Majesty.

401
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,170
Congratulations, Lord Pei.

402
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:43,660
Lord Pei, according to palace rules, when you leave the palace for a new position,

403
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,880
the waist badge that allows entry to and exit from the palace

404
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,930
must be returned to the Directorate of Eunuchs.

405
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,550
Lord Pei, His Majesty has to go to court every day now.

406
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:09,680
If you need to report to His Majesty, you can see him at court.

407
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,240
You won't need to endure the hassle of coming to the inner palace.

408
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,520
I'm tired.

409
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:40,730
A'Sheng, please walk Shouyue out for me.

410
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,660
Yes.

411
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,920
This subordinate bids farewell.

412
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:26,270
[Taiji Hall]

413
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,110
Your Majesty, there is a Buddhist saying.

414
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:54,120
The heart doesn't move, and the person doesn't randomly move.

415
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,110
When one doesn't move, then there is no harm.

416
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:00,160
If the heart moves, then the person randomly moves.

417
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,230
It will hurt the body and bring pain to the bones.

418
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,580
I know that Your Majesty feels much unwillingness.

419
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,660
And you also feel uncertainty and criticize yourself.

420
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,150
But this is not Your Majesty's mistake.

421
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:16,530
It's also not Shouyue and Liuli's mistake.

422
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,910
Why not let it go for now,

423
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,820
and wait for time to solve it.

424
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:25,560
Just like how my feelings are toward Your Majesty all these years,

425
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,870
even though they are not known to Your Majesty, nor acceptable to the people,

426
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:32,010
even though they make my heart ache,

427
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:36,410
but I am glad to have them.

428
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,780
Your thoughtfulness toward me,

429
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:42,380
how do I not know?

430
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,150
You are the only one who really understands me.

431
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,760
Don't worry.

432
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:56,320
I will not go back on my promise.

433
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:24,020
[Taiji Gate]

434
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:37,370
Lord Pei, I'll stop here then.

435
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:41,840
Lord Pei, please be safe.

436
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,980
I have a message.

437
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,480
Please pass it to Liuli, Eunuch Wang.

438
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,150
Lord Pei, please don't make it difficult for me.

439
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:04,030
Liuli, I know that

440
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:07,990
you asked His Majesty to let you return to the Bureau of Imperial Attire to protect yourself,

441
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:11,000
but moreover, it's to protect me in front of His Majesty.

442
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:15,390
Liuli, when we part now,

443
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:18,480
I wonder when we will meet again.

444
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,730
[Taiji Gate]

445
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,050
In the second year of Yonghui era, Li Zhi completed his period of mourning, brought Wu Meiniang back to the palace, and conferred her as Lady of Bright Deportment.
