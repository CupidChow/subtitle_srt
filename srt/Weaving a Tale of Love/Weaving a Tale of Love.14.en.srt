[Aspects representing 38 kinds of good causes and results]

6
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,880
Talented Lady, you have been transcribing classics for two hours already!

7
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,510
Have a cup of tea and take a rest!

8
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,120
I was unaware I had been transcribing for such a long time.

9
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,070
Today his Majesty's condition has shown some improvements.

10
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,090
All of the imperial concubines

11
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,710
have been eagerly attentive and busy looking after his Majesty.

12
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,720
How come Talented Lady Wu is not going to see His Majesty?

13
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,840
Since all of the imperial concubines are nursing him,

14
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,800
I will not add trouble to it.

15
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,610
I can finally enjoy some free time by myself, transcribing classics.

16
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,150
On one hand, I can pray for good fortune for His Majesty.

17
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,890
On the second hand, Crown Prince is busy with the reform regarding the imperial examination.

18
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,960
He probably doesn't have much time so he will transcribe classics for His Majesty.

19
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,360
I will share this responsibility with him.

20
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,490
Crown Prince is indeed honest and kind-hearted. Therefore, we all understand why you would help him.

21
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,320
But you also must look after your own health!

22
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,240
You have been sitting down for such a long time. You will again have a backache!

23
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,080
If you didn't say so, I wouldn't have thought about it.

24
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,410
Your reminder is

25
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,580
about how sitting down for two hours would lead to backaches?

26
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,940
I have been sitting down transcribing only for two hours, yet my waist has been aching all over.

27
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,190
Crown Prince has to handle the public affairs during the day,

28
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,380
and at night, he also has to transcribe classics for His Majesty. Probably...

29
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,650
he also overworks himself.

30
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,670
Talented Lady just started to rest a bit.

31
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,820
But why did you stand up, exercise a little, and then again sit down?

32
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,020
Song Tao, please send this pattern to the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

33
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,390
Tell them to embroider a cushion resembling this one.

34
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,830
Ah, right! I really like the embroidery work of Xiao Douzi!

35
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,390
Please take a walk around the Courtyard of Misfortune and ask him to embroider a cover for me.

36
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,170
I heard that Physician Dou got transferred  to the Bureau of Imperial Attire

37
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,490
by Attire Expert Zhuo.

38
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,630
Such a thing happened!

39
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,880
The dove you painted seems to be alive.

40
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,080
It is... why is it so familiar?

41
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,630
Is it the bird that you and Crown Prince saved?

Palace Officer Song Tao!

45
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,010
Palace Officer Song Tao, are you going to the Bureau of Imperial Attire?

46
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,630
Yes, Talented Lady Wu wants a cushion for her waist. She also painted the design by herself.

47
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,180
Such a coincidence to bump into you! There's no need to go in anymore.

48
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,570
I will just give the design to you.

49
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,590
Sister, please let them know.

50
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,420
All right. Is there any specific request Talented Lady Wu has regarding this cushion?

51
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,920
You just have to follow the shape and the design depicted in the painting.

52
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,240
And about the size... make it a little bit bigger so it will be unisex.

53
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,420
Ah, right! I have just heard that Physician Dou has just been transferred from the Courtyard of Misfortune

54
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,390
to the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

55
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,890
Talented Lady Wu really likes Physician Dou's embroidery work, so she wants him to make the cushion.

56
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,190
Physician Dou made a mistake and is currently being punished in confinement.

57
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,750
Is Talented Lady Wu insisting that Physician Dou do the work?

58
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,850
My Lady generally does not want to cause trouble.

59
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,940
If this is the situation then please assign someone to do the work.

60
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,120
Understood, I will let my master know.

[Brightly Lit Gate]

62
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,990
Master, Talented Lady Wu sent word that she would like to have a cushion made.

63
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,960
Talented Lady Wu likes Xiao Douzi's embroidery work

64
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,150
and was hoping that he could do the work.

65
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:01,010
This is the design that Talented Lady Wu drafted herself.

66
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,770
Talented Lady Wu...

67
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,060
personally painted this design?

68
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,140
This signifies the importance of this cushion,

69
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,310
also by specifically asking for Xiao Douzi's to do this work.

70
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,550
We can see how much she admires Xiao Douzi.

71
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,360
The entire Bureau of Imperial Attire cannot match Xiao Douzi.

72
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,880
The Bureau of Imperial Attire is losing all our reputation.

73
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,950
Master, since Talented Lady Wu likes Xiao Douzi's handiwork.

74
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,010
Why don't we rescue Xiao Dou from confinement?

75
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,760
Xiao Douzi will be grateful to you and Talented Lady Wu will be happy.

76
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,140
Whether Xiao Douzi can leave confinement,

77
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,420
that will depend on himself

78
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,630
and if he is willing to serve me.

79
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,530
All right.

80
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,480
I will go there myself

81
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,240
and see for myself if Xiao Douzi should die

82
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,630
or live.

83
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,950
Physician Dou,

84
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,050
how's the drawing doing? Let me see.

85
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,820
Attire Expert Zhuo, you are too hasty.

86
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,580
This drawing  is very very detailed,

87
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,770
complex in intricacies and precision.

88
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,440
Also, I'm drawing this from memory,

89
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,230
so to complete this book it will take 10 days to half a month's time.

90
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,190
I don't have time to wait 10 days to half a month.

91
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,320
You don't have to completely fill the book.

92
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,250
Just give me whatever you have drawn so far.

93
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,060
I want to see if your life is

94
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,530
worth waiting an extra 10 days.

95
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,660
Take this new book and continue drawing.

96
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,910
Every day I will come to collect your completed drawings.

97
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,680
Don't be lazy or try any tricks.

98
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,470
I'm hoping that you will rescue me.

99
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,940
I wouldn't dare be lazy or try any tricks.

100
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,440
Bright and beautiful,

101
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,640
unique and intricate patterns,

102
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,000
this must be the real deal.

103
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,490
Wait a minute!

104
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,850
I let the little bastard pull one over on me!

105
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,360
These colors and patterns

106
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,480
are used for Palace death garments.

107
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,220
All my handwork is not used to kiss up to dead people. What good are these to me?

108
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,490
This Xiao Douzi...

109
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,890
What a trickster and scam artist.

110
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,260
I pointed out a survival path, but she's being uncooperative.

111
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,310
What should I do with her...

112
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,400
What are you two doing?

113
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,530
This-This flower is so beautiful!

114
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,610
You can barely see such beautiful flowers around the courtyard. Who allowed you to pluck it out?

115
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,100
Replying to Attire Expert Zhuo. It was Eunuch Pan's order.

116
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,580
During early winter, Eunuch Pan ordered the gardeners

117
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,420
to find the most beautiful peony flowers within the palace

118
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,540
and plant them in the sleeping quarters of the imperial consort.

119
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,830
After a few months, the peonies bloomed.

120
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,420
They are beautiful indeed, as expected of the queen of flowers.

121
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,270
However, after a while, there's a new plant growing here.

122
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,280
Compared to Consort Yang's peony, this one is

123
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,870
even more beautiful.

124
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,940
Eunuch Pan used to tell Consort Yang that

125
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,200
the peony at Jingle Palace is the queen of flowers.

126
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,190
Eunuch Pan doesn't want to be found lying,

127
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,900
so asked the gardener to move this peony to Jingle Palace also.

128
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,550
However, the gardener said that this is not the season to move them.

129
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,220
Even if it's moved, it might not survive.

130
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,330
Therefore, Eunuch Pan had an idea.

131
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,050
He asked us to remove this peony.

132
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,570
He said, as long as we remove this peony,

133
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,610
then the peony in Consort Yang's quarters would still be the queen of flowers.

134
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,550
In the future, Eunuch Pan would not be worried that Consort Yang would scold him.

135
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,000
Eunuch Pan's idea

136
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,520
is truly great.

137
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,450
If Xiao Douzi doesn't want to tell me her secret technique,

138
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,370
then I will kill her,

139
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,470
and then I can still be the most admired Attire Expert Zhuo.

140
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,020
I will be the most skilled seamstress within the palace.

141
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,610
Physician Dou.

142
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,490
Physician Dou, come here.

143
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,980
What are you doing here?

144
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,510
Did your master tell you to come?

145
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,130
I came pretending to be here on behalf of my master, but she doesn't know I'm here.

146
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,370
So I can't stay here for long.

147
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,040
Physician Dou, come here, I have something to say.

148
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,730
I have a distant cousin named Cao Wu.

149
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,890
Cao Wu's friends A'Ni and Pei Xingjian

150
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,580
asked me to see how you were.

151
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,960
They asked me to tell you

152
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,980
that they are currently trying to think of ideas to save you.

153
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,860
Thank you for coming here to tell me.

154
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,520
Please tell them

155
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,320
that I am very thankful for their efforts in trying to save me.

156
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,140
However, the palace is no ordinary place.

157
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,700
It is not easy to save me.

158
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,930
Tell them to take care and not do any dangerous things on my behalf.

159
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,420
Right, I have something to ask you.

160
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,540
Can you transfer a message to the crown prince for me?

161
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,510
Just say that I have something important to report.

162
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,210
Tell him that he must meet me.

163
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,200
Are you crazy?

164
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,150
The crown prince is the Heir Apparent of Tang.

165
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,990
His position is above all except one.

166
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,770
He's not someone a mere physician like you can see just because you want to,

167
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,670
and not someone that a mere maid like me can deliver a message to.

168
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,080
I am not crazy. It really is important!

169
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,630
Please, can you think of anything?

170
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,580
I suggest you not even think about it anymore.

171
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,790
I definitely cannot do it.

172
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,000
There is something I remembered though.

173
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,360
Are you acquainted with Talented Lady Wu?

174
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,120
Why do you ask?

175
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,310
Yesterday Talented Lady Wu drew a design herself

176
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,630
to be delivered by a close maidservant.

177
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,690
She specifically asked you to make the cushion according to it.

178
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,950
It's said that when Talented Lady Di died, you made her funeral clothes.

179
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,920
When Talented Lady Wu heard of this, she believed in your embroidery skills and talent.

180
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,550
So, I am guessing you might be acquainted with her.

181
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,290
I could try to let Talented Lady Wu know of your current situation.

182
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,950
Maybe she has an idea of how to save you.

183
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,990
Talented Lady Wu is kind and helped me before.

184
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,290
She also knows of my embroidery skills.

185
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,460
However, I am just a small physician from the Courtyard of Misfortune. Talented Lady is beyond my reach

186
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,300
so we are not that well-acquainted.

187
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,810
It's better to not bother Talented Lady Wu with my issues.

188
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,770
Even if I owe Talented Lady Wu a favor,

189
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,030
I might never get to return in my life.

190
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,200
So, I hope to embroider this cushion myself.

191
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,980
I hope you will allow me.

192
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,170
All right. Talented Lady Wu wanted you to embroider it anyway.

193
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,850
I will try to claim the cushion embroidery task.

194
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,100
And then I will try to get the materials to you.

195
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,150
Thank you...

196
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,210
Sister Qiniang.

197
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,230
Helping you

198
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,260
at least satisfies Cao Wu's favor. If my cousin asks,

199
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,680
I can have a good reply.

200

[Bureau of Imperial Attire]

201
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,990
Master, it's getting late.

202
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,030
You're still not going to rest?

203
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,260
It's just a cushion.

204
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,400
Master, you needn't do this.

205
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,100
How about letting me embroider?

206
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,060
What do you know?

207
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,330
The cushion is small

208
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,040
but Talented Lady is currently favored.

209
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,080
In the past, no one has heard of Talented Lady Wu.

210
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,530
Nowadays, His Majesty is sick.

211
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,920
Other than Consort Yang,

212
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,060
Talented Lady Wu is the only other one to be by the emperor's side.

213
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,480
I understand.

214
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,190
Master, how about giving this task to me.

215
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,460
I will embroider it carefully.

216
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,890
When we give this to Talented Lady Wu,

217
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,650
I will definitely say that

218
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,400
Master, despite being busy, did not care about exhaustion

219
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,140
and completed this in the middle of the night.

220
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,600
You finally got it.

221
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,390
Qiniang, you should understand

222
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,120
that in the palace, as long as I am well,

223
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,990
then all of the Bureau of Imperial Attire is well.

224
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,740
Only then you seamstresses and servants in the Bureau of Imperial Attire

225
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,550
might also be well.

226
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:23,090
Master is right.

227
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,660
Enough.

228
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,800
I will go rest.

229
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,050
I'm getting old.

230
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,150
My eyes and my back are both lacking.

231
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,930
Take care, Master.

[A desperate dove finds a perch. Peace reigns over the land.]

233
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,430
I will retrieve this before dawn.

234
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,130
I wrote down the instructions on the paper.

235
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,460
Thank you, Sister Qiniang.

236
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,540
This dove...

237
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,390
I have seen it before.

238
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,570
This robe isn't Mother's work.

239
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,880
How do you know?

240
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,970
Mother's embroidered birds are alive and can fly.

241
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,860
Not like these.

242
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,210
They have no life.

243
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,080
That's right.

244
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,260
It's the same person's embroidery.

245
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,000
This is my master's work.

246
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,220
I worked very hard to get this off her hands half-done.

247
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,940
Zhuo Jinniang! It's Zhuo Jinniang.

248
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,740
Then the maidservant who asked Mother to help change the formal clothing was Zhuo Jinniang.

249
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,470
After that,

250
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,770
Mother was taken.

251
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,560
That's right.

253
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,170
Greetings, Talented Lady Wu.

254
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,470
The cushion cover you ordered is completed.

255
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,760
This cushion cover is embroidered on both sides.

256
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,040
On the outside, the colors are bright, for women.

257
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,880
It can be flipped.

258
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,630
The back side has subdued colors,

259
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,700
perfect for men.

260

The Bureau of Imperial Attire has worked hard.

263
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,480
I wanted Xiao Douzi to embroider this,

264
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,320
but I heard he might have done something wrong and was imprisoned at the imperial prison.

265
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,120
Who's work is this cushion cover then?

266
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,950
Talented Lady Wu, even though Physician Dou is in the imperial prison,

267
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,250
she remembers the favor she owes you.

268
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,690
She asked me to deliver all the materials for the cushion cover.

269
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,930
The person behind the poetry is Physician Dou.

270
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,320
The embroidery is also done personally by him.

271
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,710
Crown Prince

272
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,150
has trouble.

273
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,690
Su Tao. Ye Liu. Come with me to the imperial prison.

274
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,770
Physician Dou, I can only help you to this point.

275
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,510
I hope Talented Lady Wu can save you.

276
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,090
Talented Lady Wu, you're here. You must have seen

277
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,980
the message I delivered via the cushion?

278
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,870
Physician Dou, what is the meaning of the message you sent.

279
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,720
This is an important matter. You must speak clearly.

280
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,270
You must not lie.

281
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,840
Talented Lady Wu, this is a long story.

282
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,490
I must keep it short.

283
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,930
A few days ago, I left the palace

284
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,850
and met Simen College's Pei Xingjian by chance.

285
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,530
He found proof that the crown prince is in danger.

286
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,250
But his rank is too low,

287
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,960
and cannot pass the message to the crown prince.

288
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,070
When he found that I am a physician in the palace,

289
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,780
he took a risk

290
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,420
and asked me to deliver the news to the crown prince.

291
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,300
But as soon as I came back, I became imprisoned in here.

292
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,390
Even though I know it's important, there wasn't anything I could do.

293
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:49,540
You are saying that the person asking you to pass a message is Pei Xingjian?

294
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,550
Yes. Does Talented Lady Wu also know him?

295
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:58,570
It cannot be delayed. I will look for the crown prince immediately.

296
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,930
The cause and effect is this.

297
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,240
It's a little unbelievable,

298
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,370
but I believe in Pei Xingjian's character and actions.

299
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,100
The message is important and may affect your well-being.

300
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,200
I couldn't accept.

301
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,100
I hope you will also take it seriously.

302
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,300
Talented Lady Wu also knows Pei Xingjian.

303
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,800
The Pei family has been acquainted with the Wu family for generations.

304
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,880
I've known Pei Xingjian since my youth.

305
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,710
Based on my understanding of him,

306
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,300
he is mature and good in both literature and martial arts.

307
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,100
If he took such a risk to pass a message,

308
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,980
then I believe it's not immaterial or a joke.

309
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,590
Talented Lady Wu and I thought the same thing.

310
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,440
If the message came from someone else,

311
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,130
I might not have believed it. However, Pei Xingjian

312
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,770
I do believe.

313
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,820
Attire Expert Zhuo,

314
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,180
what are you asking me to help you with now?

315
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,170
I want to ask you

316
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:13,050
to give Physician Dou a death sentence, effective immediately.

317
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,950
Physician Dou leaving the palace on his own is wrong,

318
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,860
but he came back and turned himself in. The crime does not warrant a death sentence.

319
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,980
Is the money not enough?

320
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,410
As long as you give me a number, I will give it to you.

321
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,920
They all know I am greedy, but I have a bottom line.

322
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,500
I am only greedy but will not hurt someone's life.

323
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,030
What grudge you have with Physician Dou is

324
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,650
all between you two and does not concern me.

325
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:49,250
If you want to kill him,

326
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,000
I can only pretend to not see.

327
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,860
However, I have some advice

328
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,140
I must tell you.

329
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,170
You must do things cleanly.

330
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,900
You cannot cause me any trouble.

331
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,650
I understand.

332
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,210
Thank you, Eunuch Pan.

333
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,070
This money is a gift.

334
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:17,490
When it's done, I will have more.

335
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,670
I am Wei Lin. Greetings to Attire Expert Zhuo.

336
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,590
What did you call me here for?

337
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,170
Come!  Sit here and we'll talk.

338
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,530
Taste the tea I bought.

339
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:56,660
Qiniang, stand guard outside.

340
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,800
Wei Lin and I will have a chat.

341
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,320
Don't let anyone disturb us.

342
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,040
Yes.

343
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,020
Sit.

344
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,160
What are you afraid of?

345
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,580
Sit.

346
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,950
Recently I have been thinking

347
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,810
at the Bureau of Imperial Attire

348
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,610
what post to give you.

349
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,960
It will allow you to use

350
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,380
your intelligence and wits

351
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,320
but also be great for your career.

352
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,820
Attire Expert Zhuo is too generous.

353
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,230
I will do my best and give it my all.

354
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,840
Giving your all.

355
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,350
You're not just saying it, right?

356
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:15,540
I am not fooled that easily.

357
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,850
If you are loyal, I will help you.

358
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,710
If you are just sucking up...

359
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,280
I have been bullied much in the palace.

360
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,840
Only Attire Expert Zhuo does not care that my birth is lowly.

361
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,070
You not only put me in important posts but also are generous.

362
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,650
I really don't want to be bullied anymore.

363
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,610
If my heart and words are not in sync,

364
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,170
then I am worse than a dog or pig!

365
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,940
Wei Lin,

366
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,480
if you are truly loyal,

367
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,370
I will give you something important to do.

368
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,890
I don't even trust Qiniang for this,

369
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,510
but I think you are trustworthy.

370
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,570
Would you like to help me?

371
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,050
What matter do you need help with?

372
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:09,190
If you don't want to do it, then don't ask.

373
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,140
If I say it,

374
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,380
even if you don't want to do it, you still must.

375
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,930
I...

376
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,090
I am willing to put my all for Attire Expert Zhuo!

377
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,540
Great.

378
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,410
I didn't set my eyes on the wrong person.

379
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,620
You do this well,

380
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,150
I will transfer you to the Bureau of Imperial Attire and put you in a high post.

381
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:47,090
Afterward, no one will be able to look down on you.

382
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,020
Hey, Xiao Guizi.

383
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,340
Look.

384
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,050
I've been new here and might have been rude.

385
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,570
So, I want to prepare some wine and food

386
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,980
to apologize to everyone.

387
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,200
But I don't know what everyone's tastes are.

388
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,880
So...

389
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,400
Eunuch Sun likes to eat spiced beef

390
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,680
and drink old wine from Wacang.

391
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,350
Xiao Shunzi likes to eat shrimp.

392
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:59,660
Xiao Fuzi and I like roasted chicken.

393
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,810
Then, what about Physician Dou?

394
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:04,310
Physician Dou likes osmanthus cake.

395
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:13,420
What are you asking about Physician Dou for? He's now at the Imperial Prison, so he can't eat it anyway.

396
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,000
I was confused, just confused.

397
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:04,280
[Power]

398
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,640
What are you doing?

399
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:46,770
Young Master Pei, my young master has something important and asked me to find you.

400
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,780
He will be here shortly. Please wait.

401
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,930
I am not emotionally up for guests today.

402
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,590
Please ask your young master to come another day.

403
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,110
I will drink and talk then.

404
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,530
Who is your young master?

405
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,500
Please forgive me, Young Master Pei.

406
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,480
I cannot reveal my young master's identity.

407
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:21,430
Pei Xingjian, please don't kill him.

408
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,350
Ninth Young Master, long time no see.

409
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:40,510
You came with a lot of people to visit me today.

410
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,280
You asked someone to deliver a message

411
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,300
that there's something extremely important to talk about.

412
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,550
Now you are asking me?

413
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,480
You haven't drunk wine yet today,

414
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,410
so why are you drunk?

415
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:57,860
How dare you! You are just a student at Simen College.

416
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,560
How fortunate you are to even see His Highness the Crown Prince.

417
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,840
Pay your respects.

418
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,080
Crown Prince!

419
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,750
Pei Xingjian greets the crown prince!

420
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,800
I was rude earlier. Please punish me.

421
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,380
You did not know. Don't you have something to report?

422
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,340
This is very confidential. Please

423
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,240
come into my home first.

424
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,660
Yu'er!

425
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,600
Yu'er!

426
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,650
Yu'er!

427
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,500
Yu'er!

428
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,070
Pei Xingjian? What are you doing here?

429
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,430
Crown Prince received the message you delivered from the imperial prison.

430
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,030
So I could come to the palace and see you.

431
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,520
That's great! I was able to accomplish what you asked.

432
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,380
In the future, you shouldn't call me an idiot anymore.

433
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,640
Yu'er is amazingly smart.

434
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,250
You are the brightest person I know.

435
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,900
I finished what you asked...

436
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,950
Why are you so worried still, Young Master Pei?

437
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,930
The guards say...

438
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,600
today at noon

439
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,640
your time is up.

440
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,360
Today?

441
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,760
You used everything to help me,

442
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,830
but I can only look on as you meet death.

443
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,830
I returned to the palace this time

444
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:12,790
to save not only Foster Father but also Xiao Shunzi,

445
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:18,030
and also helped you pass on the message to the crown prince.

446
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,780
I have completed my mission.

447
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,800
Even if I die, I have no regrets.

448
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,810
Liuli?

449
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,110
Who are you? Yu'er?

450
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,010
Physician Dou? Liuli?

451
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,770
Why do you have so many secrets?

452
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,430
You want to die with so many secrets?

453
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,610
How can you die with no regrets?

454
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,400
How can you die with no regrets!

455
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,840
Who are you? Who exactly are you?

456
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:12,160
That's right, with so many secrets,

457
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,260
how could I die with no regrets?

458
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,980
I haven't avenged Mother.

459
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,980
I haven't cleared Mother's name.

460
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:40,420
One day, I will tell everyone

461
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,160
that I am Kudi Liuli.

462
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,400
That I am the successor to "Number one needle in the world" Madam An.

463
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,890
Your Highness, Prince Cao privately moved army equipment.

464
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,690
This is clearly a sign of rebellion.

465
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:12,530
Touzhou had more shipments to Chang'an.

466
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,560
Touzhou Ministry's Captain Mo Kun

467
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,160
is one of the army officials making the delivery.

468
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,960
He will find an opportunity

469
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,770
to investigate the whereabouts and schedule of Prince Cao's army equipment.

470
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:25,470
He will message me to discuss a counteraction plan.

471
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:29,080
Good work. I did not misplace my trust.

472
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,610
[Power]

473
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,070
Power?

474
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:42,230
Yes, Your Highness, it is the character for "Power."

475
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:46,680
"Power" could mean weight.

476
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,750
but also could mean power or authority.

477
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,310
I believe in my abilities.

478
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:56,270
I cannot stand people who seek power through underhanded means.

479
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:59,160
Meeting this issue which concerns the wellbeing of the nation,

480
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,410
as a court official, I should try to resolve it and help the emperor.

481
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:06,350
However, my status is low and I couldn't meet Your Highness.

482
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,740
Even though I am worried, there was nothing I could do.

483
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:14,220
I could only wash away my worries with wine and hope for the best.

484
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,290
My understanding of this word was too narrow before.

485
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,670
Power is an excellent sword.

486
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,820
If it's in the hands of a just and selfless gentleman,

487
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,170
then it can slay demons and extinguish devils and spread equity.

488
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,790
On the other hand, if someone evil and selfish were to hold it,

489
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:36,210
then it will bring about the downfall of a nation, and life will wither.

490
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:40,530
The small wise hide in the forest. The true wise hide in the city.

491
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,080
Those who do not seek or give to society

492
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,020
even though they are clean,

493
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,100
but their effect is only on their hill.

494
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,240
Only those who are not afraid of responsibility

495
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,500
are the true wise men.

496
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,590
Your Highness's wise words,

497
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,840
I will remember carefully.

498
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,580
Your merits deserve a great reward.

499
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,630
Thank you, Your Highness.

500
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,220
Looks like you already know what you want.

501
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,280
I beg Your Highness

502
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,070
to rescue Courtyard of Misfortune's Physician Xiao Douzi from the imperial prison.

503
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,990
Xiao Douzi?

504
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,150
The one who asked Talented Lady Wu to deliver the message to me?

505
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,170
Talented Lady Wu?

506
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:42,410
That physician told Talented Lady Wu your name.

507
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,950
Talented Lady Wu said she and you are childhood acquaintances.

508
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,210
That's why she believed him.

509
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,460
Xiao Douzi got help from Talented Lady Wu.

510
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,400
Your Highness, the one who has done the most this time

511
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,310
is not me, but Physician Douzi.

512
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,340
In order to pass the message, Xiao Douzi

513
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,740
was unafraid of the capture order for him within the palace

514
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,800
and turned himself in knowing that death waited for him.

515
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,500
Now, I'm unsure whether Xiao Douzi is alive or dead.

516
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,120
Even though he is a lowly physician,

517
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,130
but in order to do what's right, he's willing to put his life on the line.

518
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,780
This strength and tenacity are shocking and respectable.

519
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,960
I cannot take credit for today's matters.

520
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,940
Please save Xiao Douzi's life.

521
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,120
I see. To think that a lowly physician

522
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,480
has such courage.

523
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,690
What did he do? Why did he escape from the palace?

524
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:43,670
Xiao Douzi has a personality of steel.

525
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:47,320
He is careful and his fingers are nimble. He has great embroidery skills.

526
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,760
In the palace, many are jealous.

527
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,040
So, he wanted to escape the palace.

528
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,810
However, he ran into me

529
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,630
and learned that Your Highness was in danger.

530
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,530
He knew that he might die and turned himself in.

531
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:04,080
I thought that he might not even survive,

532
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,440
so passing the message to Your Highness must be harder than climbing the sky.

533
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,880
However, he actually did it.

534
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,410
Okay. I will save this Physician Dou.

535
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:18,600
Pei Xingjian, I will also remember your merits today.

536
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,930
Saving a life is important.

537
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,780
Let's return to the palace immediately.

538
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,060
Take care, Your Highness.
