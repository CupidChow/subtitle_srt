[Prince of Cao's Manor]

5
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,190
Your Highness, Pei Xingjian has arrived.

6
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,600
Greetings, Prince of Cao.

7
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,200
Ask Liuli to come here.

8
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,900
Yes.

9
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,000
Pei Xingjian, later when you two meet,

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,120
I hope you don't mind me here.

11
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,800
Frankly,

12
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,700
whether to you,

13
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,400
or to her, I am not at ease.

14
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,500
So, later, it is better to watch.

15
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,190
Please, Your Highness.

16
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,580
Consort Yang, Pei Xingjian has arrived.

17
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,000
His Highness has asked me to bring Liuli there.

18
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,000
- Go ahead.
- Yes.

19
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,210
Wait.

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,600
Where's the note you just wrote?

21
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,800
Bring it here and let me have a look again.

22
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,700
[Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m., Prince of Cao will raise troops at Black Tortoise Gate]

23
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,100
Remember.

24
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,000
This note, you have to find a chance to secretly give to Pei Xingjian.

25
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,400
The more you give it carefully,

26
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,200
the more he will believe it as the truth.

27
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,340
Liuli!

28
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,240
Liuli.

29
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,480
Your Highness has asked for me. I am not sure what you have asked me for?

30
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Pei Xingjian is afraid for your safety and doesn't believe that you have followed me.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,540
So... I arranged especially for you two to meet.

32
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,200
To help Imperial Guard Leader's lovesickness.

33
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,400
Also, for him to give up and follow me.

34
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,820
So in the future, you two will be enemies, harming your relationship.

35
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,400
Your Highness, you have spoken wrong. Imperial Guard Leader and I have no love.

36
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,700
He is he, I am me.

37
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,500
I am just a pitiful person who cannot save herself.

38
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,600
How would I have the strength to make Imperial Guard Leader switch?

39
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,000
If he follows Prince of Cao, it is not thanks to me.

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,300
If he continues to go on the dark path,

41
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,600
please don't involve me.

42
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,200
Liuli, I know you are still upset.

43
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
I also don't wish for your forgiveness.

44
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,600
You can resent me or get mad at me.

45
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,900
I have nothing to say. I really didn't think it would come to this.

46
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,030
I didn't think the medicine Physician Heng prescribed

47
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,400
was a poison that could take your life.

48
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,600
I never thought from the start,

49
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,400
the more I wanted to protect you, the more I could harm you.

50
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,500
You didn't think. Such simple 3 words.

51
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,200
You have done so many things in secret.

52
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Eleven years ago, you changed my fortune.

53
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Eleven years later, you gave my mother's golden needle to Zhuo Jinniang.

54
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,600
As Zhuo Jinniang wished, she got my mother's title, "Number One Needle in the World."

55
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,400
After, you still thought I wasn't pitiful enough,

56
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,000
yet you made the poison become a medical pill for Xiao Shunzi to make me eat!

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Now, I am not human nor a ghost. Living is like hell.

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,200
I cannot face Mother after I die. This is all thanks to you!

59
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,300
In the end, who thought all you could say would be "I didn't think"!

60
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Then, you so simply have moved on from it?

61
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,000
Liuli,

62
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,800
I know you feel wronged.

63
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,500
It is my fault.

64
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,700
Don't worry, no matter what,

65
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,800
even if it takes my life, I will cure you.

66
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,100
Pei Xingjian, you still don't understand!

67
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,200
I am not afraid of death, I am afraid that till death,

68
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,600
Mother's wronged case cannot be overturned.

69
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,800
Mother's title of Number One Needle in the World has been snatched by her murderer.

70
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,720
I hate so much...

71
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:42,830
hate that I was careless, and could not see clearly...

72
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,200
to see your true self.

73
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,800

74
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,700
Pei Xingjian,

75
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,800
remember what I just said.

76
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,300
Although you have saved me multiple times,

77
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,000
but you have also harmed me several times.

78
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,200
Now I don't owe you anything.

79
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,800
You and I are no longer associated.

A man's future is more important.

84
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,800
You saw Liuli, and I've also promised a great career for you.

85
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,700
When do you plan to give me an answer?

86
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,600
Future? Prosperity?

87
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,500
I don't need either.

88
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,800
I only want Liuli. Please tell me

89
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,600
if Liuli's poison can be cured.

90
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,400
Since I have the poison, I also have the cure.

91
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,440
As long as you follow me,

92
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,800
I will surely give the cure to Liuli.

93
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,400
Since you have the cure, why don't you cure Pu Banu?

94
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,000
I always reward based on their accomplishement.

95
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,000
If Pu Banu wants to get the cure,

96
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,600
then he has to let me see his value.

97
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,000
You and Liuli also.

98

I don't raise useless people and I don't do sales where I lose money.

99

As long as you have the cure,

100
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,000
then I will not disappoint you.

101
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,600
Okay.

Also, one more thing.

Liuli's real identity...

104
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,600
Her pretending to be a male cannot be revealed.

105
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,800
No matter what reason.

106
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,230
If Liuli dies,

107
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,200
I am a useless pawn.

108

[Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m., Prince Cao will raise troops at Black Tortoise Gate]

114
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,000
It is such a shame you did not see yourself, Mother.

115
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,400
If it weren't that I already knew,

116
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,100
I might have been scared by her fierceness.

117
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,400
Pei Xingjian really loves you.

118
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,900
Devoted.

119
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,600
It makes me touched, too.

120
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,000
Pei Xingjian and Li Zhi really trust her.

121
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,800
He will surely believe the note's message.

122
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Tomorrow, as long as the East Palace shifts its army to surround Black Tortoise Gate,

123
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,800
we will be totally justified to accuse the crown prince of revolt.

124
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,000
Then, search the East Palace

125
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,400
and find the dragon robe that Liuli custom-made for the crown prince.

126
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,000
Then Crown Prince's evidence of overthrowing will be the truth.

128
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,830
This note was given by Xiao Douzi secretly when the Prince of Cao wasn't looking.

129
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,530
It is Xiao Douzi's handwriting.

130

His Majesty has been unconscious for many days.

If we make a choice after he wakes up, then it'll be too late.

135

It is urgent. Please take lead, Your Highness.

136

- Consort Yang. Your Highness.
- It's late.

141
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,270
You better hurry and embroider the nine-dragon robe for the crown prince.

142
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,290
Consort Yang, even if I don't sleep and hurry to sew,

143
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,260
I still won't be able to finish the nine-dragon dragon robe in one night.

144
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,090
What do you mean by this?

145
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,070
Unless you want to find an excuse to not do it?

146
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,700
It's not that I won't do it.

147
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,870
It is that I have a better plan.

148
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,550
Say it.

149
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,730
The crown prince likes me.

150
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,090
Usually, I make all his clothing.

151
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,000
A few days ago, I made a new serpent robe for the crown prince. (A serpent robe is less in rank than the dragon robe)

152
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,820
I haven't had time to send it.

153
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,390
Now I only need to get that clothing,

154
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,410
and change the four-toed claw on the robe to a five-toed claw.

155
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,510
Then the serpent will become a dragon, and the serpent robe will become a dragon robe.

156
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,390
It can also show Crown Prince trying to overthrow the emperor.

157
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,250
There is another advantage to changing a serpent robe to a dragon robe.

158
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,270
Compared to the usual serpent robe that Crown Prince usually wears,

159
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,610
the dragon robe only has one more.

160
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,970
Ordinary people won't be able to detect.

161
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,190
If the crown prince wears this

162
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,940
in front of people, then it'll be hard evidence.

163
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,960

164
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,070

Either the candlelight is too dim, then the candlelight is too bright,

177
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,910
then there are too many bugs, and then you wanted to use the toilet. What do you want now?

178
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,800
Thirsty. Bring me tea.

179
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,160
Haven't you already finished embroidering? Can't you get it yourself?

180
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,890
The imperial robe is finished, but I have not finished my tasks.

181
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,080
Delaying progress, can you be responsible?

182
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,130
- What are you doing?
- Don't you see me sewing a secret message for Crown Prince?

183
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,760
You want to send a message to the crown prince?

184
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,530
Rather than suspecting I am secretly sending messages to Crown Prince,

185
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,390
then go tell Consort Yang.

186
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,430
Don't make a big ruckus and disturb me.

187
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,350
I have asked you to pour me water. Did you not hear?

188
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,790
Sign? What sign?

189
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,650
It is a Douzi, of Xiao Douzi.

190
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:05,150
It is the same color thread as the imperial robe. If you don't look carefully, you can't see it.

191
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,100
She said last time that Prince of Cao in front of Crown Prince

192
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,110
put poison on Crown Prince's clothes, so he keeps it in mind.

193
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,250
After, he only wears clothes sewn by her.

194
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,450
This clothing is with Douzi as a sign.

195
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,750
When she sewed the words, did she purposely avoid you?

196
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,360
No, she even told me to report to you.

197
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,150
Since she didn't take precautions with you, there won't be anything.

198
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,220
Consort Yang, then are you really going to let her send the imperial robe to the East Palace alone?

199
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,100
What if she has suspicions?

200
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,450
Won't she ruin your and His Highness's big matter?

201
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,960
We naturally cannot let her go alone.

202
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,030
Find a maid from the manor.

203
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,380
Make her seem like an embroidery maid from the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

204
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,410
Let her go with Liuli to the East Palace to send the dragon robe.

205
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,890
Remember, you have to find a smart one.

206
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,200
So that she watches carefully and won't leave her side for even a second.

207
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,990
There cannot be any carelessness at all.

208
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,180
Rest assured, Consort Yang.

209
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,700
- Eunuch Wang, how are you lately?
- Good, good, good.

210
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,060
I haven't seen you in many days.

211
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,030
I've heard a lot.

212
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,540
I heard you committed a big crime and suffered a lot.

213
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,150
How is your injury?

214
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,100
Thank you for worrying, Eunuch Wang.

215
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,030
My wound is already well.

216
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,070
These days, I have been recovering at the Courtyard of Misfortune.

217
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,740
The task to sew clothes for the crown prince has also been delayed.

218
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,180
I am really not at ease.

219
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,240
This is the serpent robe that I especially made for His Highness the Crown Prince.

220
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,670
I hope that he likes it.

221
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,030
Here.

222
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,880
I heard Pei Xingjian say you were captured by the Prince of Cao's men.

223
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,950
Are you fine now?

224
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,350
I am a low official. I am grateful for the crown prince's care,

225
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,190
but I have also been harmed because of this.

226
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,160
Now I am a drug addict. I am useless.

227
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,180
Not only can I not help the crown prince,

228
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,970
I might even be the crown prince's burden.

229
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:32,030
I feel really guilty and have nobody to thank.

230
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,340
I can only use threads to show my intentions.

231
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,120
I probably cannot live long.

232
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,990
I don't know in the future

233
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,360
whether or not I will be able to sew clothing for the crown prince.

234
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,130
It looks like the crown prince should almost be awake. How about you wait a bit?

235
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,270
If His Highness can you see, he would be happy.

236
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,020
Where's Xiao Douzi?

237
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,300
Your Highness, Xiao Douzi put the serpent robe down and left immediately.

238
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,700
He said he has no face to see you.

239
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,730
What does that mean? Xiao Douzi was harmed because of others causing him to be a drug addict.

240
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,170
It's because I'm respected that I'm hated.

241
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,760
This is obviously implicated by me.

242
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,850
Wasn't Xiao Douzi captured by the Prince of Cao?

243
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,130
How could she come here to deliver the serpent robe?

244
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,530
Did Xiao Douzi come alone?

245
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,680
There is a maid that came with Xiao Douzi.

246
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,750
She said she is from the Bureau of Imperial Attire, but I've never seen her before.

247
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,650
I boldly think

248
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,610
that maid may have been sent by the Prince of Cao.

249
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,990
If that is the case, for Xiao Douzi to deliver the serpent robe,

250
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,640
it must have been on the Prince of Cao's orders.

251
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,600
Last time, didn't the Prince of Cao do something to your clothing?

252
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:03,610
Unless they want to use my trust in Xiao Douzi to harm me?

253
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,240
A'Sheng, did Xiao Douzi leave any other signs?

254
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,990
Your Highness, I have looked carefully at this clothing, it is the same as before.

255
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,670
Xiao Douzi embroidered the word "Douzi" inside the clothing.

256
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:21,140
But this "Douzi" word this time looks messy.

257
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,900
It looks like 3 dots.

258
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,220
Let me see.

259
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,570
Xiao Douzi has just gotten well after being really sick. He just became addicted to drugs.

260
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,660
His hands were not as active as before.

261
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,350
It can be understood.

262
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,360
If it was forced by the Prince of Cao,

263
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,600
Xiao Douzi wouldn't leave a sign.

264
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,610
You're right.

265
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,420
This Douzi is your and Xiao Douzi's secret message.

266
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,240
It means for you to wear it without any worrying.

267
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,800
If Xiao Douzi was forced by someone,

268
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,080
he wouldn't sew this Douzi.

269
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,050
I haven't worn clothing sewn by Xiao Douzi in a long time.

270
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,910
Hurry up and let me try it on.

271
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,190
[Hall of Immortal Nectar]

272
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,100
Your Majesty, don't blame me for being ruthless.

273
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,270
Maybe it is that I have never thought to fight for power.

274
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,590
I only hoped you would treat me well.

275
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,950
I could ask for nothing for my whole life,

276
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,170
but what about our Ming'er?

277
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,180
Crown Prince and Ming'er are like fire and water now.

278
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,900
If it isn't you who dies, it is I who dies.

279
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,520
My lung disease cannot be cured.

280
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,850
Even if you wake up, you probably don't have many days.

281
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,320
In the future, if the crown prince reigns,

282
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,010
without you and I to protect Ming'er,

283
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,510
Ming'er will surely die.

284
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,990
I have no other choice.

285
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,650
Even if I die, I need to fight for my son once.

286
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,750
Consort Yang, His Majesty woke up a while last night.

287
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,520
He was more conscious than before.

288
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,480
Eunuch Pan, I have something I want to talk to you about.

289
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,180
[The Prince of Cao Li Ming is virtuous and brave. I now proclaim Li Ming as Crown Prince to succeed the throne.]

290
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,000
[Li Zhi is demoted from the crown prince's seat.]

291
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,820
Consort Yang,

292
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,050
making up this order will have nine generations killed.

293
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,570
His Majesty's death is today.

294
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:42,290
If you want to live, then listen and do what you should.

295
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,430
What do you want to do?

296
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,630
Today, there will be two big things happening.

297
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,800
The first is the crown prince surrounding the Black Tortoise Gate.

298
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,280
The Prince of Cao will catch him red-handed.

299
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,250
The second thing is His Majesty dying.

300
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:04,890
Director Pan Qinghai reading the verdict of His Majesty's will.

301
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,110
Reporting to disown Crown Prince, Li Zhi,

302
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:11,190
making Prince of Cao, Li Ming as emperor.

303
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,860
Consort Yang, this probably isn't that easy.

304
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,950
A few days ago, His Majesty just appointed the two ministers as regents.

305
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,980
He has already given protection to the crown prince.

306
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,420
If you say the crown prince is using his army to overthrow,

307
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:29,380
not only will the people not believe,

308
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:33,670
even the officials will be suspicious.

309
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,570
They will naturally be suspicious.

310
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,220
Then I will need you to prove it

311
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,520
so they believe it.

312
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,250
Me? What can I do?

313
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,100
Then, you have to speak with me,

314
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,870
be firm that your previous superior, Gao Quan,

315
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:01,690
was a spy placed by His Majesty's side.

316
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:05,580
Since the start, he has done something to his nourishment soup.

317
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,840
This is what caused His Majesty to be deeply ill, unable to be treated.

318
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:16,460
His Majesty knows Gao Quan poisoned him, so he asked for him to be killed.

319
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,460
To find out the mastermind,

320
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,410
His Majesty purposely didn't make it big,

321
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,060
telling the public Gao Quan accidentally died.

322
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,380
Just last night,

323
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,890
His Majesty had found out that Gao Quan is Li Zhi's man.

324
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:34,560
So he wants to disown Li Zhi and look highly at the Prince of Cao.

325
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Gao Quan has been helping Crown Prince. This, everyone knows.

326
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:46,010
This way, isn't my plan flawless?

327
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,920
You are very daring! You two dare to block me?

328
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,960
Consort Yang has ordered that no one can leave or enter the Hall of Immortal Nectar.

329
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:23,320
[Hall of Immortal Nectar]

330
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,440
What do you two want?

331
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,010
Your manor has bought vegetables and asked for us to send it.

332
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,710
Are you the substitutes for Old Wang?

333
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,730
Yes, yes!  He asked us to come.

334
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,600
Who are you? You dare to pretend to be the vegetable person to enter the manor?!

335
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,720
Please spare us!  We are here to find someone.

336
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:00,070
Where is this?! Let us go!

337
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,690
Aren't you here to find him?

338
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,710
His Highness said to admit you guys.

339
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,170
Child, child!  Are you well?

340
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,810
Xiao Douzi, what happened to you?

341
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,990
Where are you unwell?

342
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,680
Foster father. Xiao Shunzi. Why are you guys here?

343
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,890
I heard Pei Xingjian say you were captured by the Prince of Cao.

344
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:26,080
We couldn't sleep the whole night. We thought to pretend to be vegetable people to save you.

345
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,510
But who thought once we entered, we were caught.

346
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,820
Child.

347
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,150
It is all my fault.

348
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:37,080
Now I am already someone useless.

349
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,950
Why did you two use your lives to save me?

350
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,470
Child, are you all right?

351
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,170
Is your drug addiction relapsing?

352
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:47,440
It is all my fault! I fed you. It is all my fault.

353
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,410
His Highness has ordered.

354
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,450
If your drug addiction relapses, then to give you one pill.

355
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,990
Child.

356
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:18,600
No. No.

357
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:25,270
- Child.
- What I need to do has already been finished.

358
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:28,140
In the future, I would rather die

359
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,360
than touch this drug again.

360
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,020
Child, hurry up and tell me

361
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,640
why Prince of Cao wants to capture you and poison you.

362
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,060
Because he wants to harm the crown prince.

363
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,810
No,

364
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,520
they have already harmed him.

365
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,480
Already harmed him?

366
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,720
Yes.

367
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:27,150
Consort Yang, right now the crown prince is wearing the serpent robe that Liuli embroidered.

368
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:32,240
Great! Liuli knows her stuff.

369
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:44,030
Your Highness, Prince of Cao can only move his own army.

370
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,800
They are just wearing the armor that was secretly shipped into Chang'an.

371
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,980
They intend to control the critical station at the Black Tortoise Gate.

372
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,370
Your Highness, rest assured, our East Palace's troops are sufficient to defend against them.

373
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,500
I have already prepared.

374
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:01,080
Please relay the order to go to the Black Tortoise Gate to catch the Prince of Cao.

375
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:09,210
Not only do we have to go to the Black Tortoise Gate,

376
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,990
we also have to meet the Prince of Cao

377
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:17,060
to not disappoint Xiao Douzi's hardship.

378
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,370
I will immediately mobilize the East Palace troops

379
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:22,880
to go with Crown Prince to the Black Tortoise Gate.

380
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,890
[Reform from the Source]

381
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,870
I understand then.

382
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,900
When you passed the message,

383
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,500
you hid a secret code.

384
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,680
But I don't know if the secret code

385
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,520
will be noticed by Crown Prince and Pei Xingjian.

386
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,250
Be good and stay there. When it gets dark,

387
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,410
you'll be taken to the Prince of Cao's Manor to see Pei Xingjian.

388
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,170
The extra dot that I sewed on the "Douzi" word is a dragon claw.

389
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,350
The embroidery method is different from the other two dots.

390
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,490
I wanted to remind the crown prince that there is an extra toe on the claw for the serpent robe,

391
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,200
so the serpent robe has become a dragon robe.

392
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,850
Even though your idea is ingenius,

393
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,090
but would it be too risky?

394
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:03,270
You are the person that Crown Prince and Pei Xingjian trust the most.

395
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,460
Foster Father, the Prince of Cao has repeatedly harmed the crown prince.

396
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,460
His scheming never stops. If I don't pretend to obey them,

397
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,370
they will definitely think of other schemes to harm the crown prince.

398
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:16,560
It will come again and again.

399
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,120
All the gods and immortals, please protect Crown Prince and Pei Xingjian

400
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,060
to be lucky and see through the Prince of Cao's insidious plot.

401
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:31,890
If Attire Expert An's spirit is listening in Heaven, please protect us to safely get through this danger.

[Prince of Cao Manor]

403
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:50,130
Your Highness, the soldiers have been trained for many days and are ready for their mission.

404
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,290
We're only waiting for Your Highness to issue the command.

405

Everything is ready. We're just waiting for the east wind.

406
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:59,770
All officers and soldiers, please wait patiently.

407
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,910
What time is it now?

408
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,320
Replying to Your Highness, it is 11:00 a.m.

409
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,130
Reporting!

410
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,320
Your Highness, the troops are moving from the East Palace.

411
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,360
Crown Prince and Pei Xingjian are personally leading them.

412
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,150
Your Highness, shall we start?

413
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,110
Wait a little longer.

414
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,880
There must not be any mistake in today's battle.

415
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,040

416
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,890
Reporting!

417
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,030
Your Highness, Crown Prince and Pei Xingjian are leading the troops toward the Black Tortoise Gate.

418
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,700
Are Crown Prince's troops really going to the Black Tortoise Gate?

419
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,680
Crown Prince's troops went around Taiji Palace and kept going north to the Jian Fu Gate,

420
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,290
they then went westward, and the Black Tortoise Gate won't be far.

421
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:24,640
Your Highness, if we don't start now, it may be too late.

422
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,950
Crown Prince Li Zhi is planning to revolt.

423
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:37,410
He is raising troops at the Black Tortoise Gate. All officers and soldiers, listen to my order.

424
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,490
- Yes!
- Yes!

425
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:42,760
Follow me to rush to the Black Tortoise Gate to capture the rebels.

426
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,770
Once the mission succeeds, all the officers and soldiers

427
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,430
will be meritorious contributors to Great Tang. I will

428
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,710
definitely reward based on merits!

429
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,720
- Capture the rebels!
- Capture the rebels!

430
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,520
- Support Prince of Cao!
- Support Prince of Cao!

435
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,220
- Here, top it off.
- Come, drink.

Guards.

437
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,420
Guard Pu, why are you delivering the food today?

438
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,700
Where is Xiao Cui?

439
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,580
His Highness has something big to do today and took away most of the manor's troops.

440
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,560
He especially dispatched me to deliver food

441
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,440
and to also inspect the jail cells,

442
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,570
to prevent

443
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:16,490
any bandits taking advantage of the empty manor.

444
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,550
Guard Pu, you've worked hard.

445
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,600
It's a trivial matter. The two of you,

446
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,070
I'll deliver the food inside and also check around.

447
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:28,480
You can rest assured and enjoy the warm food.

448
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,380
- Yes.
- Yes.

449
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,010
What do you want?

450
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,550
I only see the three of you in this entire jail.

451
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:18,660
But there is food for a fourth person in this container.

452
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,890
I only want to know where this fourth person is jailed.

453
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,100
You are the Prince of Cao's dog.

454
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,550
You've helped him to commit many sinful wrongdoings.

455
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:31,830
You should know very well all of those unspeakable crimes.

456
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,820
Why did you come here to ask us?

457
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,260
We don't have to argue or discuss old accounts.

458
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,510
I came to find this person because Pei Xingjian asked me.

459
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,120
I came to help you.

460
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,710
It's also to help myself.

461
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,360
Liuli has already been harmed by you all like this.

462
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,700
Do you think we will still believe you?

463
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,850
Just save your strength. Don't try to lie to us with pretty words.

464
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:00,560
I am not lying to you. I don't need to either.

465
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,960
You can see.

466
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,510
Liuli is tormented by the poison. So am I.

467
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:12,190
Prince of Cao has been controlling me with this poison. My addiction

468
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:15,470
has pierced into the bone marrow.

469
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,950
Forget it, if you don't believe me.

470
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,290
I'll make the story short.

471
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,610
Pei Xingjing is suspecting that there is a poison master behind the Prince of Cao.

472
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:27,220
Usually whoever makes the poison can also detoxify it.

473
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:31,950
I've looked everywhere in the manor except this dungeon.

474
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:36,090
Pei Xingjian is speculating that if there really is such a poison master behind the Prince of Cao,

475
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:39,870
it's very likely that he is hidden somewhere in this dungeon.

476
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:44,230
You just said, there are only three of us jailed here,

477
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,560
but there is food for four people?

478
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,440
That's why he must be

479
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,690
hidden in a secret place.

480
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:56,380
These days, during the middle of the night,

481
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,390
I occasionally heard a knocking sound from the underground.

482
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,110
Really?

483

[Peace within the Four Seas]

484
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:55,090
Crown Prince Li Zhi intends to poison and kill His Majesty,

485
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:59,680
raise troops at the Black Tortoise Gate and rebel. The evidence is confirmed.

486
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,860
I will eliminate the wrongdoers and return things to normal

487
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:08,220
and arrest Li Zhi, the traitor who would commit regicide and patricide.

488
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,230
Li Zhi!

489
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:13,060

491
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,220
Why are Zhangsun Wuji and Zhu Suiliang here?

492
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,430
I wonder why the two of you are here?

493
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:39,260
Last night, this old minister and Minister Chu received a secret report,

494
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,910
which claimed that the Prince of Cao was secretly exercising troops and horses as well as hoarding armor

495
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,130
with the intent to rebel

496
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,810
and will raise troops at the Black Tortoise Gate today at 11:00 a.m.

497
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:54,550
What I see now concurs with the secret report

498
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,970
without a single difference.

499
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,850
Crown Prince is the one rebelling!

500
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:05,100
Are the two of you helping the crown prince to rebel?

501
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,580
The one raising troops at the Black Tortoise Gate to rebel

502
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,220
is actually you, Prince of Cao!

503
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:15,760
We were entrusted by the crown prince to lead troops to guard the Black Tortoise Gate.

You are Crown Prince's Ministers-Regent.

506
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,120
Of course, you will speak for the crown prince.

507
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,830
Tell Crown Prince to come out!

508
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:29,520
I want to question him in person!

509

Your Highness, it's men from the East Palace.

510
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,880
Shouldn't the East Palace's troops be inside the Black Tortoise Gate now?

511
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,030
