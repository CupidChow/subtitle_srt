[Weaving a Tale of Love]

3
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,100
[Episode 31]

4
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,400
A'Bi's is smarter than Qiniang.

5
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,000
She is diligent in studying, and she is also reliable.

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So, I want to accept A'Bi as a disciple.

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let A'Bi take over Qiniang's tasks.

8
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,200
Qiniang, after I deal with Xiao Douzi, I will deal with you.

9
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,900
Let you know the consequence of betraying me.

10
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,480
A'Bi, start.

11
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,100
Yes.

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,100
After Madam An, the golden needle has been lost for many years.

13
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,600
Now that it has reappeared, it is a wish from the ancestors.

14
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,700
Attire Expert Zhuo is following the wish of the ancestor founders.

15
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,200
She will succeed the title,  "Number One Needle in the World."

16
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,500
She deserves it rightfully, now in the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

17
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,400
Please welcome the ancestor

18
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,600
to attend the Golden Needle ceremony.

19
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,800
Everyone listen.

20
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,050
Kneel and praise.

21
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,220
Kneel.

22
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,820
Kneel down!

23
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,120
Xiao Douzi. Xiao Douzi, kneel.

24
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,800
Someone come! Make him kneel!

25
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,000
Xiao Douzi, stop fussing! Hurry up and kneel.

26
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,000
Zhuo Jinniang, even if you make me kneel, lay down,

27
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,200
I won't accept your fake title, "Number One Needle in the World"!

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,200
I wanted to wait until after the Golden Needle ceremony

29
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,400
to deal with you.

30
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,240
It looks like you cannot wait.

31
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,000
Guards! Bring him down!

32
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,800
Hit him 20 times!

33
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,100
No! 30!

34
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,700
Hit hard! Hit with all your might!

35
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't hit anymore!

36
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,300
Xiao Douzi, as long as you beg and give in,

37
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,500
Teacher is wise and will forgive you!

38
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,040
Xiao Douzi, do you give in?

39
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,200
I don't give in.

40
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,800
You are really incorrigible.

41
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,700
Since you are not afraid of death, then I will fulfill your wish.

42
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,000
Hit! Continue to spank!

43
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,800
Wait!

44
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,680
Teacher, today is the lucky day you are having the Golden Needle ceremony.

45
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,600
If you continue to spank, then someone will die!

46
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,000
Although Xiao Douzi deserves to die, I am afraid it will ruin your happy matter.

47
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,680
[Hall of Immortal Nectar]

48
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,400
Your Highness, Imperial Guard Leader has returned to the palace.

49
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,000
He says there is something urgent he wants to ask you about.

50
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,800
Crown Prince has something important. He cannot leave the chamber,

51
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,200
or else it will ruin His Majesty's peace.

52
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,800
What is there that is more important than His Majesty's well-being?

53
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Let him wait outside the chamber.

54
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,500
Yes.

55
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,300
Eunuch Wang, where's Crown Prince?

56
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,700
His Highness really cannot step aside. He asks for you to wait here.

57
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,000
Thank you, Eunuch Wang.

58
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,800
Imperial Guard Leader?

59
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,100
Only by killing him will I be happier.

60
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,800
He caused this himself today.

61
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,900
He looks for death. You cannot blame me!

62
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,200
How many more beatings are there?

63
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,600
- There are still 2 more.
- Nonsense!

64
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,500
I am counting, there are still 10!

65
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,800
How would there still be 10?

66
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,600
Master! Master, I have been counting!  It is already the 28th!

67
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,000
Shut up!

68
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,400
Continue to spank. Beat hard!

69
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,600
Whoever else dares to speak more today,

70
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,400
Xiao Douzi is the result!

71
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,600
I am Pei Xingjian, Imperial Guard Leader of East Palace, here on the crown prince's order.

72
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,800
I am bringing Bureau of Imperial Attire Xiao Douzi to question!

73
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,200
Wait!

74
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,000
You are saying the crown prince wants to see Xiao Douzi?

75
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Exactly.

76
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,600
Nonsense!

77
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,000
I have been to the Hall of Brilliant Joy not too long ago.

78
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,400
I wanted to ask Consort Yang to watch,

79
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,000
but Consort Yang said from today on,

80
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,200
all consorts and princes

81
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,400
have to go to Hall of Immortal Nectar to serve. There is no exception!

82
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,800
Now, the crown prince is busy at the Hall of Immortal Nectar.

83
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,700
How would he have time to ask Xiao Douzi to go to East Palace?

84
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,640
Xiao Douzi, I have come too late.

85
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,260
What do you want to say? I'm listening.

86
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,900
Leave.

87
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,100
I don't want to see you.

88
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,200
From now on, whether I die or live,

89
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,800
it is none of your business.

90
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,430
Imperial Guard Leader, what is Xiao Douzi saying?

91
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,700
Xiao Douzi said if he dies today,

92
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,800
then he won't be able to complete Crown Prince's

93
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,500
mink overcoat lined with silk embroidery with a golden dragon that is specially prepared for His Majesty.

94
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,500
Attire Chief Lin, we each have our own masters.

95
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,600
You also have your hardships.

96
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
We shouldn't make it hard for one another.

97
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,000
Why for this small matter

98
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,100
ruin your future?

99
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,800
Crown Prince has ordered, the Bureau of Imperial Attire will naturally abide.

100
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,400
Xiao Douzi has offended his superior, making Attire Expert Zhuo mad,

101
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,000
so he has suffered Attire Expert Zhuo's punishment.

102
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,600
Now, he has already received his punishment.

103
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Imperial Guard Leader, you can take Xiao Douzi away to see the crown prince then.

104
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Thank you, Attire Chief Lin.

105
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,500
Attire Chief Lin, you– Aren't you muddled-headed?

106
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,600
Xiao Douzi still hasn't apologized to me. How can you let him go?!

107
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,400
Attire Expert Zhuo, remember!

108
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,300
In the future if someone in the Bureau of Imperial Attire dares

109
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,600
to offend their superior,

110
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,800
Xiao Douzi is an example.

111
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,200
[Courtyard of Misfortune]

112
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,950
Mother, I am wrong.

113
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,220
I am useless.

114
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,590
It is my uselessness, Mother,

115
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,060
I am useless.

116
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,660
I am useless, Mother.

117
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,450
Cold.

118
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,970
Useless.

119
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,270
Liuli, your mother's spirit

120
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,240
won't be mad at you.

121
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,400
If she wants to be mad, she'll be mad at me.

122
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,080
It is me who caused you to lose your Mother's golden needle

123
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,390
and the spot, "Number One Needle in the World."

124
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,320
You have to recover.

125
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,590
Whether or not you get mad at me,

126
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,910
get angry at me, hit me.

127
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,390
You can do anything you'd like.

- Qiniang.
- Eunuch Sun.

129
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,220
This is Physician Dou's change of clothing.

130
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,430
Also, this. Its the wooden box I found under her bed. Keep it well.

131
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,130
Okay. Thank you, Qiniang.

132
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,660
Master, I have brought the medicine.

133
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,450
Let me.

134
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,060
Liuli, you have awoken.

135
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,200
Xiao Douzi, you have awoken.

136
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,660
Hurry! Hurry up and drink this medicine.

137
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,880
This medicine is really good!

138
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,890
Imperial Guard Leader especially got this prescription and ingredients for the medicine from the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

139
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,260
Leave. I don't want to see you.

140
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:46,000
Xiao Douzi, Imperial Guard Leader took the risk to save you.

141
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,670
You– How can you–

142
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,490
Crown Prince wanted you to rest at East Palace,

143
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:02,280
but he is afraid of Consort Yang and Prince of Cao.

144
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,700
So he has placed you at the Courtyard of Misfortune.

145
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,550
Stay here and recover. The Bureau of Imperial Attire,

146
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,890
Crown Prince will deal with it.

147
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,800
[Eternal Peace Room]

148
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,900
Greetings, Your Majesty.

149
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,820
Greetings, Crown Prince.

150
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,360
Is His Majesty having his medicine?

151
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,460
His Majesty's medicine hasn't finished cooking.

152
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,620
He is taking the Immortal Nectar Soup now.

153
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,930
Director Pan, His Majesty's medicine is finshed.

154
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,400
Let me, Brother.

155
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,930
Director Pan.

156
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,190
Where's His Majesty's medicine? Why are you not bringing it?

157
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:01,240
Your Majesty, then rest well.

158
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,530
Leave first. Let His Majesty have a good rest.

159
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,060
Okay.

160
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:55,950
I am tired. You can all leave.

161
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,880
Rest well, Father.

162
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,230
I will leave first.

163
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,690
Pan Qinghai,

164
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,160
I think you have lived too long!

165
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,360
Do you want to die with Gao Quan?!

166
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,430
Spare me, Your Highness!

167
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,500
I didn't mean to back out,

168
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,540
but... I really cannot take action today, Your Highness!

169
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:48,980
When I got the medicine earlier, I remembered Consort Yang's entrust.

170
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,040
Consort Yang said that once this medicine has been ground,

171
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,950
he-he must eat it fast; or else, it'll disturb the medicine's effectiveness.

172
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,600
This medicine has been by my side for many days.

173
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,900
I am afraid the medicine's effectiveness is not enough.

174
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,050
If His Majesty eats this medicine and does not die immediately,

175
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,730
then-then won't it be able for Crown Prince

176
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,000
to prepare for the succession?

177
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,850
For your future,

178
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:18,130
Your Highness, I cannot think more!

179
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,600
Since it is like so, why didn't you say so earlier?

180
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,160
From tomorrow on,

181
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,510
I will ask Pu Banu to give you new medicine every other day.

182
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,550
If you still delay,

183
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:39,620
I won't let you go easily.

184
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,650
Your Highness, don't worry. I will try my best

185
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,220
to serve Your Highness.

186
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,790
Sister Qiniang, the medicine has arrived.

187
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:16,970
This– There is a difference between men and women. It is better if you do it, Xiao Shunzi.

188
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,800
I can do dead people,

189
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,000
this– It's better for you, Sister Qiniang.

190
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,600
Xiao Shunzi...

191
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,400
Please tell Qiniang the doctor has said many times,

192
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,000
the medicine placed yesterday, you have to clean it well before you place the new one.

193
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You have already told me.

194
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,500
What if Qiniang forgets?

195
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,100
Why are you looking at me? Hurry up and say!

196
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,200
Qiniang, the doctor said before you change the medicine from the day before,

197
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,100
you have to clean the area well before you apply the new medicine!

198
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
I know!

199
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,800
Continue!

200
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,800
The doctor also said the water to wash the wound cannot be too cold or too hot!

201
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:42,100
It has to be the same temperature as the body to discard the pain.

202
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,300
Okay!

203
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,500
No!

204
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,600
Kill me!

205
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,900
Kill me and I still won't admit defeat!

206
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,400
"Number One Needle in the World." "Number One Needle in the World."

207
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,300
It cannot be given to Zhuo Jinniang!

208
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,400
No!

209
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,000
I don't ever want to see you again!

210
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Leave!

211
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,800
No.

212
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,800
I cannot!

213
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,200
How is Xiao Douzi?

214
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
Is his wound better?

215
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,200
Physician Dou isn't just suffering from external injuries now.

216
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,900
What is more affected is his heart.

217
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,000
He has been talking in his dreams all this time.

218
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,800
He is still disturbed about the "Golden Needle" matter!

219
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,100
He said...

220
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,300
He said that he never wants to see you again!

221
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,170
Physician Dou is stubborn. Once he has decided on something,

222
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,800
even nine oxen cannot pull him back.

223
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:35,020
I am afraid in the future if he will resent you.

224
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,400
No wonder he would hate and resent me.

225
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,600
Now even I myself don't know

226
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,800
whether or not what I did is right.

227
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,400
Xiao Douzi is not someone who will hold a grudge.

228
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,800
Whoever treats him well, he knows.

229
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,500
One day, he will realize.

230
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,800
Go in first you two.

231
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,730
Remember, don't let His Majesty have medicine first.

232
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,000
Wait until I go there.

233
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,800
Yes.

234
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,820
How can you wait for me here so openly?

235
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,000
Remember to find a place with no people next time.

236
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,310
Come with me.

237
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,200
The sooner you finish Prince of Cao's task,

238
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
the sooner you will be able to break free.

239
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,400
You don't need to live in fear.

240
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,000
Wait. Director Pan,

241
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,100
I also have something Prince of Cao ordered

242
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,600
for me to give you as a reward.

243
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,800
To serve Prince of Cao, it is my duty.

244
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,500
How would I dare to ask for a reward?

245
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,100
Why don't you have a look?

246
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,800
See whether or not you like this reward.

247
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
What is this?!

248
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,600
I heard Director Pan is a well-known filial son.

249
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,800
What? Even your own grandpa's finger

250
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,100
you cannot recognize?

251
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,600
Grandpa!

252
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,000
I have caused trouble for you.

253
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,200
Sorry, Grandpa.

254
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
Grandpa!

255
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,800
Director Pan, if you still delay,

256
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,800
what will be inside the box won't be a finger.

257
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,800
I'm afraid it'll be someone's head.

258
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,000
Tell Prince of Cao

259
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,200
I will do as he says, for sure.

260
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,400
Please ask Prince of Cao to be kind,

261
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,000
to spare my family.

262
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,200
Have you ever thought

263
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,600
after Prince of Cao succeeds the throne, he will kill everyone,

264
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,400
to prevent trouble.

265
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,200
Being a eunuch,

266
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,400
I deserve to die.

267
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,300
But what about you?

268
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,800
You also won't have a good ending.

269
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,800
You and I are the same.

270
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,200
We are just Prince of Cao's pawns.

271
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,900
Dying later is better than dying now.

272
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,900
One person dying is better than the whole family dying.

273
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,500
Grandpa!

274
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,400
Is Xiao Douzi better?

275
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,600
I will visit him then greet His Majesty at the Hall of Immortal Nectar.

276
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,400
You cannot, Your Highness.

277
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,600
Xiao Douzi has to recover at the Courtyard of Misfortune.

278
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,400
Your health is important. You cannot go there.

279
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,200
Xiao Douzi is probably plagued by his unhappiness that he hasn't recovered sooner.

280
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,400
I heard outside the palace there is a doctor.

281
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,300
He is good at treating external wounds and also depression,

282
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,400
congested air flow and blood flow. I would like to take a leave from Your Highness.

283
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,300
I want to go outside the palace to visit this well-known doctor.

284
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,000
Go ahead. If you need anything, tell me.

285
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,200
Yes.

286
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,600
Shouyue, there is another matter.

287
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,200
The number of times Prince of Cao has gone to the Hall of Immortal Nectar is a lot more.

288
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,000
His movements are suspicious. His Majesty gets weaker each day.

289
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,100
I'm worried that Prince of Cao will risk it all and strike.

290
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,990
Although I don't know where they will take action,

291
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,200
but I have to take precautions.

292
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,000
From what I see,

293
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,800
unless the power shifts, Prince of Cao will cause harm to His Majesty.

294
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,700
In this critical moment, the person who wants His Majesty to not be well

295
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,200
would probably be Prince of Cao.

296
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,400
But there is one thing you have to take precaution of.

297
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
What?

298
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,800
Everyone says that Director Gao accidentally fell to his death.

299
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,000
But after investigating,

300
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
when Director Gao fell to his death, no one saw.

301
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,300
After Director Gao, Consort Yang immediately helped Pan Qinghai

302
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,200
to become Director of the Directorate of Eunuchs. In this, there must be something wrong.

303
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,300
What you are saying is,

304
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,800
Pan Qinghai is someone Prince of Cao and his mother placed?

305
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,200
Your Highness, Director Pan's men have brought a message.

306
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,800
He said that His Majesty has awoken and they came to inform you.

307
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,700
He especially asked for Your Highness to give your greetings at the Hall of Immortal Nectar.

308
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Your Highness, what does this Pan Qinghai intend to do?

309
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,200
He is fawning for nothing?

310
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,000
Your Highness, you cannot be careless when taking precautions.

311
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,800
You have to be careful, you cannot let your guard down.

312
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,600
Greetings, Crown Prince.

313
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,000
His Majesty has awoken so early. Is it that he has not slept well last night?

314
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,800
I asked you to come

315
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,000
to take advantage, the Hall of Immortal Nectar is quiet,

316
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,600
to say something to the crown prince.

317
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
It's an eventful time right now.

318
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,500
If there is anything, you cannot overlook it.

319
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Brother Pei, go along without any trouble.

320
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,800
Pu Banu?

321
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,000
How dare he gallop on a horse inside the palace?

322
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,400
Show your badge.

323
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,200
My badge has gone missing, I will show you next time.

324
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,100
You know the palace's rules. Don't make it hard for us.

325
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,690
Without your badge, you cannot leave the palace.

326
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,400
Guard Pu, what's wrong?

327
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,400
Leave!

328
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,400
Stop him!

329
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,170
Thank you for your help Imperial Guard Leader.

330
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,640
Come! Help me catch Pu Banu!

331
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,080
Wait.

332
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,220
I want to bring him back.

333
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,450
This...

334
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,150
Crown Prince has orders

335
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:15,680
during His Majesty's unwell period. Anyone who breaks the palace rules,

336
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,640
must be punished without mercy.

337
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,950
Pu Banu committed a wrong. I must take him back to report to the crown prince.

338
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,740
Since it is like so, I will hand him over to you.

339
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,440
Bring the medicinal soup.

340
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,030
I can rest early and you guys can go back to being busy with your affairs.

341
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:57,240
Eunuch Pan, bring the medicine.

342
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,580
Zhi'er, if there is anything you don't understand in the imperial affairs,

343
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,000
you can get advice from Zhangsun Wuji.

344
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,160
He is a loyal person in the imperial court.

345
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:11,380
Don't worry, Your Majesty, I will remember.

346
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,700
Are you busy, Crown Prince?

347
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,330
Yet you have time to come to the Hall of Immortal Nectar to serve His Majesty.

348
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:37,510
You even feed medicine to His Majesty yourself.

349
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:41,340
I am aware and have taken it to heart.

350
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,800
His Majesty never likes taking medicine but hasn't missed any lately.

351
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:49,810
He can drink it every day on time. This is thanks to you.

352
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,620
With Prince of Cao's orders,

353
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,450
putting poison in His Majesty's medicine,

354
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:47,470
using the crown prince to send the poison

355
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:50,180
to feed it to His Majesty.

356
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,910
Your Highness, what I have just said is the truth.

357
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:06,400
This is no lie.

358
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,820
Since you have already turned to Prince of Cao and his mother,

359
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,970
why do you have to tell me this great secret?

360
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,960
How can I trust you?

361
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:20,110
Your Highness, I didn't turn to Prince of Cao and his mother willingly,

362
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,460
I was forced.

363
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,100
I am not asking for accomplishments, but forgiveness.

364
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,770
I only want to save my family,

365
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:30,030
old, young and my own life.

366
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:38,340
Among all the princes, His Majesty loves 14th Brother the most.

367
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,120
Even if 14th Brother wants to steal my Crown Prince title,

368
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,370
he wouldn't be so wicked.

369
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:47,040
He dares to poison His Majesty.

370
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,350
Also, after Talented Lady Wu has repented,

371
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:54,540
it is I who has served His Majesty in feeding him medicine.

372
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,820
Now, you ask me to not care about His Majesty and not ask about the medicine,

373
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,020
to discard my duty as a son and as a subject.

374
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:04,200
Then won't it be Prince of Cao's thoughts, so in front of His Majesty,

375
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,010
to say I am not filial?

376
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,000
Your Highness!

377
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:33,030
I wish you to be well soon.

378
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,390
I have been looking at affairs day and night lately.

379
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,330
I can't believe my hand numbing illness is happening again.

380
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:42,770
Last time because my hands were not well, I spilled your medicine.

381
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,610
It looks like, serving His Majesty,

382
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:00,080
will have to be passed on to 14th Brother.

383
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,270
Your Highness.

384
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,940
- Pu Banu has gotten into trouble.
- What happened?

385
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,400
The medicine has taken effect. He tried to leave the palace and was caught.

386
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,410
He is now locked up in the imperial guard leader's manor.

387
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:50,100
Useless fellow.

388
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,810
How is it?

389
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:26,100
Imperial Guard Leader.

390
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,620
His pulse is inexplicable.

391
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,400
It shows that his heart is weak and about to die.

392
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,870
It also shows that he has great strength, unlike normal people.

393
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:38,410
I really don't know about this pulse. Forgive me.

394
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:41,430
I don't dare to make a decision lightly.

395
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,220
Leave.

396
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,980
Hurry up and give me medicine.

397
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,620
Pu Banu is known to be the best warrior in the land.

398
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:59,110
He is a great martial arts person. Why is he like this?

399
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,290
Pu Banu wants to leave the palace.

400
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:04,030
He must have something important.

401
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:06,700
Unless it is related to Prince of Cao?

402
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:12,480
Before Prince of Cao comes, we have to pry open his mouth.

403
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:34,830
What is this place? Let me out.

404
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:37,530
Let me out!

405
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:39,840
- I want to go out! I want to go out!
- Tell me!

406
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,030
Why did you barge out of the palace gates?

407
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:46,260
I-I....  My gout illness has relapsed.

408
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:51,170
I have to go out to see the doctor, but my badge has gone missing.

409
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,010
So I barged.

410
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:57,120
You are young, and also someone who knows martial arts.

411
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,110
How would you have gout? Hurry up and speak up!
