[Episode 17]

4
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,650
The emperor has arrived!

5
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,320
Hail to the emperor!

6
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,670
Long live! Long live to the emperor!

[Supply Storage]

9
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,920
General Mo!

10
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,350
You should have a meal and a drink together with us!

11
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,850
What about returning together to Puzhou tomorrow?

12
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,190
My stomach just got better. I am not going to eat anymore.

13
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,710
I don't want to let down General Chen and the rest.

14
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,150
My people are also about to come. I will wait for them here.

15
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,740
All right. I won't insist anymore then.

16
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,500
General Chen. General Mo.

17
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,270
I am not sure where the people in charge went.

18
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,180
They also have not given the warehouse key to someone.

19
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,590
General Mo, if you don't leave, can you help keep it?

20
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,410
When the people in charge come, just return it to them.

21
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,550
Sure. Of course.

22
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,310
Then, thank you.

23
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,330
General Mo, then my men and I will take leave first.

24
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,670
Please.

25
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,610
General Mo.

26
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,470
General Mo, I have come late.

27
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,400
Are we going back to Puzhou now?

28
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,980
No rush. We will wait until 3:00 p.m.

29
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,470
Give them my order.

30
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,080
Watch the supply storage closely.

31
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,450
- No one can enter and go as they please!
- Yes.

32
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,880
Troop Lie!

33
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,480
- Guard closely.
- Yes!

34
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,470
Why has he come?

35
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,310
Who?

36
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,100
Official Registrar Zhang from the Imperial Academy.

37
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,760
He is famous for being facetious when doing things.

38
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,340
No, I have to take a look.

39
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,950
I'm the Chief Administrator at the Imperial Academy.

40
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,030
I am the scholar that is here to get the book of Guo Zijian's.

41
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,390
How does that relate to you? Why don't you let me in?

42
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,290
What is the meaning of this?

43
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,340
- Outrageous.
- Chief Administrator Zhang.

44
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,350
- Long time no see.
- You have come right on time, Young Master Pei.

45
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,750
This boor seems not to get my words.

46
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,140
Our Guo Zijian has stored a book inside the warehouse.

47
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,730
Teaching Assistant Xue has just passed down his words to me, saying

48
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,430
the storage room at Simen College is out of space.

49
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,950
They asked me to quickly get it before dark.

50
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,330
I came in a rush for it, but this person won't let me get it.

51
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,400
What is the meaning of this, you say?

52
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,560
Chief Administrator Zhang, it isn't convenient to use the storage room today.

53
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,640
Please come after dark or a little later.

54
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,150
I will bring people to send it to you. What do you think?

55
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,120
Is Simen College fooling with me?

56
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,850
One tells me to come at 3:00 p.m.

57
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,070
Another one tells me to come after 3:00 p.m.

58
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,700
Fine. Fine.

59
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,130
I am determined to go in today. What can you do about me?

60
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,840
How dare you!

61
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,450
Fine.

62
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,910
In that case, you need to write a letter of confirmation for me.

63
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,190
Write on it that you are in charge of the storage room today.

64
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,810
Later, I won't be blamed for being late.

65
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,640
All right, I'll write it.

66
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,680
Brother Pei, what was the problem?

67
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,070
If there is really armor in here,

68
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,110
why would Xue Xu dare ask someone to come and pick things up?

69
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,510
He even specified 3:00 p.m. to pick up.

70
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,500
It is fishy.

71
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,650
Just open it and see.

72
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,520
For him to dare do this, there are two possible reasons.

73
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,110
Either there is no armor at all...

74
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,880
I found it!

75
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,280
Then there is only one possible reason left.

76
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,510
Xue Xu guessed correctly that we wouldn't allow Chief Administrator Zhang to come inside.

77
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,130
Don't you understand it yet?

78
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,420
All these things have happened too smoothly.

79
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,520
The armor is here, but there is no one from Prince of Cao.

80
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,530
The person in charge is also gone.

81
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,360
Even the storage room's key is in our hands.

82
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,630
Xue Xu even specially asked Chief Administrator Zhang;

83
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,180
thereby, proving that we are the ones guarding the storage room

84
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,570
and not allowing anyone to enter.

85
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,080
Prince of Cao must know that the secret storage of armor has been revealed,

86
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,310
so he wants to remove his connection from it.

87
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,880
I'm afraid it isn't so simple.

88
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,310
What is the meaning of this?

89
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,970
East Palace. (Traditionally the crown prince's palace)

90
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,240
Oh no, Prince of Cao is framing the crown prince!

91
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,930
Why are you still dazed? Hurry to the palace to stop the crown prince!

92
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,230
How about we move these things out of Simen College?

93
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,760
It's too late already.

94
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,760
I'm to be blamed for being impatient

95
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,790
and hurting the crown prince.

96
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,310
In that case, I will entrust the Yulanpen Festival
(a Buddhist festival)

97
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,920
to beloved consort to organize.

98
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,380
Talented Lady Wu will assist.

99
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,210
All the beloved concubines and royal princes should suggest ideas.

100
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,760
At that time, the entire nation will celebrate

101
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,700
and happily enjoy the Yulanpen Festival.

102
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,950
Your decree is obeyed.

103
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,590
Crown Prince.

104
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,290
Present.

105
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,500
Frame the one hundred pages of scriptures that you copied,

106
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,800
and make an offering at the Yulanpen Festival,

107
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,040
to pay respect to our ancestors and your mother.

108
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,490
This son and subordinate obey your decree.

109
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,820
Your Majesty, I have another matter to report.

110
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,740
Move aside! Everyone move aside!

111
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,660
Recently, I've been busy with reforming the imperial examination system.

112
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,700
It involves revising the system, changing test subjects,

113
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,300
and also conveying the questions. With many assorted matters,

114
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,950
there are quite a few areas of careless omissions.

115
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,050
A few days ago, I accidentally discovered something.

116
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,060
After thinking it over, I really think that I need to report it to Your Majesty.

117
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,830
What does Crown Prince want to report?

118
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,810
Your Highness the Crown Prince,

119
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,810
His Majesty has been busy with many affairs and isn't feeling well yet.

120
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,330
Let's not make a big fuss over minor matters, all right?

121
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,470
Meiniang, why are you stopping the crown prince?

122
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,010
Crown Prince, speak.

123
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,770
- This—
- Crown Prince, I think

124
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,880
it's better that I personally report to His Majesty on some matters.

125
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,600
Your Majesty, this concubine is presumptuous.

126
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Lately, I have seen Crown Prince so busy with reforming the imperial examination system that he was lax in copying the scriptures.

127
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,670
I wanted to remind him but didn't have the heart to rush him.

128
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,550
But I also wanted to see the hundred pages of scriptures to be completedly copied soon.

129
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,150
Therefore, I secretly copied some pages for the crown prince.

130
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,430
Perhaps it's because my calligraphy writing is too crude,

131
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,200
Crown Prince discovered it, but he is so kind that,

132
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,250
instead of scolding me,

133
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,120
he actually wants to report about my intention to Your Majesty.

134
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,210
This concubine is distressed, that's why I repeatedly declined.

135
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,890
But I didn't know that Crown Prince would still insist on talking about it.

136
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:26,290
Meiniang has a noble character and doesn't wish her kind action to be publicly known.

137
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,670
Crown Prince is honest and straightforward,

138
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,630
not wishing to take credit for someone else's work.

139
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,600
I am very gratified.

140
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,850
Without any virtue and accomplishment, this concubine is lucky to receive praise from Your Majesty.

141
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,640
His Highness the Crown Prince, is actually the impressive one

142
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,660
for being humble and polite.

143
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,990
Crown Prince, you did great.

144
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,900
You continue to have the demeanor of the heir.

145
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,370
Your Highness!

146
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,190
I have come way too late. You shall punish me severely.

147
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,800
What has actually happened?

148
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,840
Prince of Cao had found out about our intentions.

149
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,180
Therefore he kept his composure and secretly set off.

150
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,670
He also sealed the insignias of the East Palace on his armors.

151
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,370
He wants to shift the blame on Crown Prince. Pei Xingjian found out there was an imposter among them.

152
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,440
Therefore, I was sent to report this immediately, but I came way too late.

153
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,030
It is thanks to Talented Lady Wu who strived to stop me just now.

154
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,950
That's how I was able to stop by the abyss and turned danger into fortune.

155
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,610
I don't know how to thank you. Please accept my bow.

156
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,420
Crown Prince, from now on you shall not be so impetuous.

157
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,600
Prince of Cao is very scheming. If you don't have full certainty,

158
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,330
you must not be rash to avoid alerting the snake in the grass.

159
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,340
I will keep that in mind, Talented Lady Wu's intentions are pure.

160
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,250
Ming'er, there is something you are hiding from me.

161
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,070
What just happened in the hall?

162
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,230
Just now,

163
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,230
the crown prince was going to report to His Majesty that I secretly hoard military armor.

164
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,120
What? Crown Prince knows about it?

165
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,170
Even if he knows about it, I still have a response for him!

166
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,940
If he had spoken about it to His Majesty just now,

167
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,300
I was fully prepared to knock him over so that he would never rise again.

168
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,920
Who could have imagined that he was just about to speak,

169
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,950
it was pushed back by that Talented Lady Wu.

170
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,230
It looks like the Talented Lady Wu is determined to help the crown prince.

171
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,170
Ming'er, you really don't listen to me.

172
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,760
Mother, don't worry.

173
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:11,070
Even if he knows, he still can't do anything about me.

174
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,590
You don't listen to my advice

175
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,460
and make such dangerous moves. How can I not worry?

176
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,170
Mother, don't worry. I'm prepared.

177
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,330
Retreat 10,000 steps. If something is exposed in the future,

178
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,680
I will take on the responsibility for everything in front of His Majesty.

179
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,590
You will not be dragged in, Mother.

180
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,950
Mother, you just deny knowing anything about my plots,

181
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,120
and just continue to be His Majesty's favored consort.

182
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,170
Do you think I worry about my own safety and life,

183
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,860
worry about whether I will be dragged in?

184
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,070
All these years, I've been so cautious in the palace as if I was walking on thin ice.

185
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,850
You are the one I worry about!

186
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55,180
My only hope in this life is your safety.

187
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,220
If something happens to you,

188
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,280
it would be meaningless for me to stay alive.

189
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:15,670
[Hall of Immortal Dew]

190
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,620
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

191
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,520
Fourteenth Younger Brother.

192
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,740
Gao Quan greets Your Highness the Crown Prince and Prince of Cao.

193
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,350
It's such a coincidence today.

194
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,420
Three princes have come successively to greet His Majesty for his health.

195
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,080
Prince Fu is inside right now, speaking with His Majesty.

196
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,930
This Deer Hunting Scene is offered by Vice Minister Yan Liben.

197
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,630
I remember when I was young, you used to take us brothers to hunt.

198
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,910
You also shot down a buck.

199
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,710
The way it happened is just like in this painting.

200
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,680
I feel a sense of affection.

201
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,340
So I begged for this painting to bring it to the place to show you.

202
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,960
This Deer Hunting Scene

203
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,670
is drawn with lively brush strokes, and it looks so alive.

204
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,910
This Yan Liben is quite

205
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,280
a fantastic painter.

206
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,860
Your Majesty.

207
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,310
- Greetings, Imperial Father.
- Greetings, Imperial Father.

208
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,660
This younger brother greets Crown Prince.

209
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,550
Thirteenth Young Brother, no need to be formal.

210
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,900
Zhi'er and Ming'er, you both came at the right time.

211
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,880
Look at this painting brought over by Fu'er.

212
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,510
Doesn't it look like when I took you hunting years ago?

213
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,510
Your Majesty, I frequently dream of hunting deer

214
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,630
alongside you when I was young.

215
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,650
I really miss it. I also remember

216
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,420
that day. Crown Prince was feeling weak,

217
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,540
so he not only couldn't shoot down any prey, but also got struck with a cold.

218
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,670
He had to recuperate for a long time.

219
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,670
Zhi'er is good at everything,

220
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,600
except your body is too weak.

221
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,340
Your Majesty doesn't need to worry too much.

222
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,520
Even though Crown Prince was born a little too weak,

223
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,910
he just needs to exercise and strengthen his body.

224
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,280
Your Highness the Crown Prince, this younger brother is going hunting for the Imperial Hunting Garden.

225
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,870
Hunting can not only strengthen the body, but it can also help improve archery skills.

226
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,520
I wonder if I could invite Crown Prince to come along.

227
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,180
Thank you, Fourteenth Younger Brother, for your thoughtfulness, but the Yulanpen Festival is coming up.

228
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,590
I haven't finished copying the 100 pages of scriptures that I promised.

229
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,820
- So—
- Zhi'er,

230
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,220
our Great Tang founded the dynasty from atop horseback.

231
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,010
Emperor Gaozu also required all the descendants to be adept in both literature and martial arts.

232
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,470
You are the heir apparent to Great Tang and must have a strong body.

233
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,990
You must not emphasize literature above martial arts.

234
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,250
Ming'er and Fu'er, both of you brothers should watch each other.

235
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,310
Do not always stay inside to read and write, and neglect your martial skills.

236
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,050
Your Majesty is right.

237
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,500
Tomorrow, I will go with Fourteenth Young Brother to hunt

238
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,980
and try to hunt a wild deer to present to Your Majesty.

239
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,740
Good, I'll wait for that.

240
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,280
Thirteenth Young Brother, why don't you come along tomorrow?

241
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,970
We brothers can improve our martial arts and our brotherly bond.

242
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,070
This younger brother will obey your order.

243
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,500
This is how it should be.

244
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,100
Good brother, I'm at fault for oversight yesterday

245
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,460
and almost fell into Prince of Cao's trap.

246
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,110
Even though it didn't result in a drastic mistake, but your identity has been exposed.

247
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,980
During this journey to Puzhou, you may encounter danger at every step.

248
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,210
Why do you say so, Brother Pei. It was clearly because  the cunning Cao gang

249
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,450
saw through our scheme and affected the crown prince.

250
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,630
Now that we have seen through the rebels' intentions,

251
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,120
they should be the ones who are in fear.

252
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,100
Good brother, take care.

253
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,150
Adjutant Mo, stop!

254
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,140
Adjutant Mo.

255
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,820
Crown Prince ordered me to bid Adjutant Mo farewell.

256
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,930
He said that he hopes Adjutant Mo will take care along the journey.

257
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,650
Be careful and stay safe. Eliminating the treacherous will take time and can't be rushed.

258
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,460
Once everything is ready, he will rely on your help again

259
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,210
to eliminate the treacherous together and maintain safety for the nation.

260
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,630
This subordinate is incapable and almost sent the crown prince into danger.

261
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,220
Crown Prince not only doesn't blame me but continues to be caring.

262
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,580
I, Mo Kun, feel further ashamed.

263
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,420
Please tell His Highness the Crown Prince

264
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,480
that I will enthusiastically serve him.

265
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,810
Adjutant Mo, we shall meet again.

266
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,630
Good brother,

267
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,900
take good care on your journey.

268
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,400
Young Master Pei, there is another matter.

269
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,710
Prince of Cao has arranged for the crown prince to go hunting tomorrow.

270
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,460
Hunting? The crown prince agreed?

271
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,180
In front of His Majesty, the crown prince couldn't help but agree.

272
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,870
Prince of Cao's secret shipment of armor has been discovered by the crown prince.

273
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,820
Since he couldn't harm the crown prince,

274
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,080
Prince of Cao is probably planning to kill the crown prince.

275
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,680
The hunting ground is full of dense trees and blades have no eyes.

276
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,080
If Prince of Cao wants to inflict harm upon the crown prince, it's going to be difficult to defend.

277
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,460
Of course, the crown prince knows, and he has already invited Prince Fu to go with them.

278
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,480
Prince Fu is a person of virtuous character, so Prince of Cao should be more fearful.

279
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,940
But, just in case, the crown prince wants to invite you to go with him.

280
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,790
If Crown Prince trusts me, of course, I will be there.

281
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,840
Thank you, Sir Pei.

282
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,260
Don't be worried, Crown Prince. We have to take all precautions.

283
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,350
Ask people to close the gates in the East.

284
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,220
There is only a limited area where hunting animals can hide.

285
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,550
You will for sure do well

286
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,780
and make great progress.

287
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,190
Pu Banu.

288
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,180
Yes.

289
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,190
Bring people to protect the Crown Prince.

290
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,870
If anything happens, bring your head to me.

291
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,560
Yes.

292
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,190
Strange! Why are Prince of Cao's men following me?

293
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,950
If someone asks when the East was closed,

294
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,990
you know how to respond?

295
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,590
This place has been closed since the morning.

296
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,920
Crown Prince wanted to hunt and trespassed.

297
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,190
The Imperial Hunting Garden is dense with trees. I couldn't see through.

298
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,730
- Give the signal.
- Yes.

299
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,010
Let it go!

300
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,010
Reporting to Prince of Cao, there are tracks of wild hogs to the west.

301
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,670
Thirteenth Brother, Crown Prince went east.

302
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,840
We shouldn't disrupt his joy.

303
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,250
We also should not steal his glory.

304
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,350
Why don't you go to the West Gate to hunt?

305
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,840
You will for sure have a great accomplishment.

306
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,350
You have thought thoroughly, Fourteenth Brother.

307
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,110
You are too welcome. This time's hunting is my initiative.

308
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:47,370
Of course, I have to let both of my brothers have fun.

309
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,590
Thank you, Fourteenth Brother.

310
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,950
Please wait, Crown Prince.

311
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:10,010
Crown Prince, Prince Cao says the East is already closed.

312
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,520
But we have been going East for so long, why hasn't anyone stopped us?

313
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,810
Unless there is a trap?

314
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,810
- Is there anything unusual?
- Not only has the East been closed,

315
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,960
there are startled birds flying in the sky.

316
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,850
There probably is a trap.

317
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,480
- Protect the Crown Prince!
- Yes!

318
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,070
Hua Tian, you protect the crown prince and go south. I will cover the back.

319
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,620
Okay.

320
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:28,610
Oh no! They are using whistling arrows to signal the crown prince's location.

321
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,230
Quick! Chase the arrow shooter!

322
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,970
- Yes!
- Yes!

323
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,170
Hurry!

324
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,740
It's red.

325
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,340
They are making the move where the crown prince is. Let's go toward the whistling arrow's direction

326
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,400
and finish up the crown prince.

327
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:34,120
Immediately send a signal to Prince of Cao and tell him that the crown prince has gone to the northern side.

328
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,120
All the whistling arrows are ruined. It's useless even if you kill me.

329
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,170
Crown Prince!

330
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,470
Are you all right?

331
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,390
Hurry and go.

332
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,240
Where is the person?

333
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,710
Where is the person?

334
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:57,020
Reporting to Your Highness. The crown prince is over there!

335
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,010
Chase!

336
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,890
Sit tight.

337
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,530
Reporting to Prince of Cao. I saw it myself that the crown prince and the horse fell down the cliff together.

338
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:43,710
This is a deep chasm. The crown prince must be dead.

339
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:11,040
Congratulations, Your Highness the Prince of Cao!

340
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,060
Pu Banu.

341
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,650
Present.

342
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,550
Shoot an arrow into me.

343
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,510
Yes.

344
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,490
Crown Prince really wanted to catch prey during hunting

345
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,920
to please Your Majesty.

346
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,000
To help Crown Prince fulfill his wish, I ordered people

347
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,580
to seal the woods to the east of the hunting garden early in the morning.

348
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,810
to decrease the hunting area, and also added more people to protect the crown prince.

349
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:48,680
I didn't expect that Crown Prince would take off his serpent robe because he couldn't stand the heat,

350
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,280
and he later mistakenly entered the forbidden area.

351
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,710
The soldiers couldn't find Crown Prince's tracks and were all panicking.

352
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,650
At that time,

353
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,930
the imperial guards at the eastern side of the hunting field

354
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,730
discovered some armed soldiers.

355
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:08,770
Those imperial guards didn't see the crown prince's serpent robe and didn't recognize the crown prince.

356
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:13,320
So they had mistaken Crown Prince's group as bandits that had barged in.

357
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,540
Therefore, they got into a conflict and almost hurt Crown Prince.

358
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,310
When I got the news and hurried over,

359
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,700
I found the serpent robe discarded by Crown Prince along the route.

360
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,690
That's how I figured out how it happened and immediately stopped the imperial guards.

361
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:32,130
But Crown Prince's steed was startled and ran toward the cliff.

362
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:37,370
I was helpless as I watched Crown Prince fall into the deep chasm.

363
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,420
This son and subordinate was incapable of protecting the crown prince.

364
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,340
I should be punished by 10,000 deaths.

365
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,250
Please declare my guilt, Your Majesty,

366
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,910
with a harsh punishment.

367
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:10,560
I told you all to take good care of him.

368
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,700
All of you!

369
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,280
Zhi'er... Zhi'er.

370
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,300
Your Majesty is wise. Fourteenth Brother was really thoughtful about Crown Prince's hunting.

371
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,730
He took care of all the details thoroughly.

372
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,250
It's just that Crown Prince was always diligent in reading,

373
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,110
but he lacks experience with the hunting field and entered the forbidden area by mistake

374
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,340
and caused the imperial guards' misunderstanding. To save Crown Prince, Fourteen Brother disregarded his own safety

375
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,520
and barged into the forbidden area

376
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,980
and was shot by a random arrow, and his blood flowed without stopping.

377
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,950
This son and subordinate pleads that Your Majesty consider Fourteenth Younger Brother's sincerity

378
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,640
and allow him to atone for his guilt with merits.

379
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,310
You are talking about these things...

380
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,020
Zhi'er?

381
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,070
Zhi'er.

382
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:24,820
- This son and subordinate greets Your Majesty.
- Hurry and rise.

383
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,060
Let me see. How is your injury?

384
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,370
- Are you severely injured? Summon the imperial physician now!
- Yes.

385
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,430
Your Majesty need not worry.

386
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,050
I'm only injured externally, so it's nothing severe.

387
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:41,010
It's good that you're back. Hurry and help Crown Prince get into his seat.

388
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,290
Slowly. This is Heaven blessing our Great Tang.

389
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,620
Heaving gives blessing to my Zhi'er.

390
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,770
Crown Prince is lucky, truly a blessing from Heaven

391
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,170
and blessing from our ancestors.

392
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,780
Here.

393
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,450
Zhi'er,

394
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,210
hurry and tell me

395
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,960
what exactly happened.

396
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:16,900
This is right. I witnessed Crown Prince falling into the chasm with my own eyes.

397
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,900
I don't know what happened after that.

398
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,410
Now that Crown Prince can return safely,

399
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,180
it is truly joyful and celebratory.

400
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,500
Otherwise, I should be punished by 10,000 deaths,

401
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,830
and my guilt can never be pardoned.

402
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:39,480
My life was hanging by the thread at that time.

403
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,920
I thought I would have died for sure.

404
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,850
I didn't even know that 14th Younger Brother's men were behind me.

405
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,110
Crown Prince!

406
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,840
I fell into the chasm and thought I would surely die.

407
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,520
Everything looked dizzy in front of me, and it seemed Imperial Father appeared.

408
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,530
Me...?

409
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,320
It looked like,

410
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,510
but also not like.

411
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,540
That person had a youthful-looking face and white hair.

412
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:28,000
The face seemed real but also imagined, but his demeanor really resembled Your Majesty.

413
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,750
I felt a sudden warmth in my heart

414
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:33,290
and actually forgot fear and shouted, "Save me, Your Majesty."

415
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,210
Your Majesty smiled gently and said,

416
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,140
"You are Great Tang's heir,

417
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,410
bearing a heavy burden.

418
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,280
Your life cannot end here."

419
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:53,290
After he finished talking, he gently blew a fairy breath upon me,

420
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,000
then a big wind started blowing

421
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,750
and actually lifted me to a giant rock on the side of the cliff.

422
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,520
That's how I fortunately survived.

423
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:16,540
Zhi'er, I really was right about you.

424
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:20,420
My son was indeed chosen by Heaven.

425
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,170
Crown Prince has turned adversity into fortune. It must be because Your Majesty has focused on the cultivation of Dao.

426
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,530
Crown Prince sincerely copied the scriptures, and thereby accumulated meritorious blessings.

427
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:33,340
Fourteenth Younger Brother, don't you agree?

428
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:39,330
Crown Prince's blessing is as high as the sky, and it's truly our Great Tang's blessing.

429
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,290
Crown Prince's mishap is all my fault.

430
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:45,930
Crown Prince is kind not to blame me.

431
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,160
But I really cannot feel at ease.

432
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,620
I heard that Hua Tian, who is Crown Prince's personal guard,

433
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,860
has died in this mishap and unfortunately died from protecting the crown prince.

434
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,200
I would like to give Pu Banu, the warrior bestowed to me by Your Majesty

435
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,700
to the crown prince

436
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,730
as his personal guard

437
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:06,040
to protect the crown prince's safety.

438
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:11,810
It would be a slight amend to atone for my deeply-felt guilt.

439
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:23,670
I am grateful for 14th Younger Brother's kind thoughts.

440
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,100
Imperial Father, this son and subordinate

441
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,630
has already found a personal guard who is strong in both literature and martial arts.

442
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,750
His name is Pei Xingjian.

443
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,610
I was originally going to transfer him to East Palace.

444
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:41,420
I don't really want to

445
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,260
take away 14th Younger Brother's

446
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,380
favorite warrior.

447
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:51,190
I've seen Pu Banu's bravery.

448
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,020
I was going to keep him by my side

449
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,540
but couldn't overcome Ming'er's repeated pleas,

450
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:58,050
so I bestowed him to Ming'er.

451
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,360
Now that Zhi'er ran into the mishap today,

452
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,130
not only are your imperial young brothers worried,

453
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:06,210
I am very concerned, too.

454
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:11,260
Since Ming'er is willing to part with his favorite,

455
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:16,060
just let Pu Banu become your personal guard to protect you then.

456
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,020
As to the person that you selected,

457
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,220
also transfer him to East Palace, too, right?

458
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:27,670
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your kindness, but I think

459
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,940
quality is more important than quantity regarding personal guards.

460
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,320
How about this?

461
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,880
I want Pei Xingjian and Pu Banu

462
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,770
to have a duel. The winner

463
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:41,870
will return to East Palace with me.

464
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:47,980
This is a good way. Then, let's hold a duel after 10 days.

465
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:51,270
The winner will stay by Crown Prince's side

466
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:54,540
as his personal guard. This is also an opportunity

467
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:58,000
to boost the morale among the imperial guards.

468
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,130
It's decided then.

469
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,960
Let me see...

470
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,740
Talented Lady, something really bad has happened.

471
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,680
What is it? You're in such a panic.

472
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,710
I just heard that Crown Prince went hunting with Prince of Cao and Prince Fu.

473
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:33,190
No one knows how, but Crown Prince got injured and even fell off a cliff.

474
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,620
What?

475
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,950
Prince of Cao cried all the way back and asked His Majesty to punish him.

476
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,630
Unexpectedly, Crown Prince came back alive.

477
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:42,010
I heard that Crown Prince was covered in blood.

478
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,240
It's really scary.
