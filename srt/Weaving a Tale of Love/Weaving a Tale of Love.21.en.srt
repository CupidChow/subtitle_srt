[Weaving a Tale of Love]

3
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,140
[Episode 21]

4
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,400
Take it easy.

5
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,070
Why did we walk all the way here?

6
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,440
I'm trying to sober you up. Just in case you give away your identity

7
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,570
and cause trouble.

8
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,590
Here.

9
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,830
Yue'er, don't say I am nagging.

10
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,350
In the future, you cannot be so carefree.

11
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,990
Don't forget you are a woman.

12
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,500
I just drank grape wine

13
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,620
and remembered my childhood.

14
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,380
It felt nice and I drank a few more cups.

15
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,120
Thank you for your reminder, Young Master Pei.

16
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,460
It was my oversight that could've disrupted the matter.

17
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,110
Also, one more thing.

18
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,300
You have to remember every minute,

19
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,440
don't get too close with Crown Prince.

20
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,890
Also don't be like today, drinking so much wine with Crown Prince.

21
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,770
I understand not getting drunk,

22
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,880
but why can't I be close with Crown Prince?

23
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,200
Crown Prince is kind. You also want to serve him.

24
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,630
Unless... you are the same as Adoptive Father.

25
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,290
You don't want me to get afflicted with Crown Prince and Prince Cao's fight.

26
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,230
Afraid I will face danger?

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,820
Whoever is right, I'll help them. I am not afraid.

28
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,660
You are right.

29
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,290
And also not right.

30
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,920
I am not only afraid you will get involved in the palace fight,

31
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,490
also...

32
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,150
also...

33
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,790
Also, what? Just say it.

34
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,180
Usually, you are straight with your words when arguing with me.

35
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,970
Today, why are you like this?

36
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,790
Crown Prince's impression of you is good.

37
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,480
He has been thinking that you are a male all along.

38
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,130
He also wishes to transfer you to the East Palace to serve.

39
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,420
Then, there'll be a lot of changes.

40
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,270
Before, didn't I help you change medicine?

41
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,190
What can there be?

42
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,880
If you really become someone by Crown Prince's side,

43
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,730
what if you have to serve him when taking a bath,

44
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,850
sleep with him, then what will you do?

45
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,720
I-I-I didn't think of this.

46
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,150
I never thought of going to the East Palace.

47
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,720
I have to stay at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

48
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,980
It is really hard to know what you are thinking.

49
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,210
Maybe you pretended to be a physician when you were little and grew up at the Courtyard of Misfortune.

50
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,390
Therefore, you are less worried than common girls.

51
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,410
Yu'er, you must always remember this.

52
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,210
There is a difference between men and women.

53
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,330
Your biggest danger is your female identity.

54
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,920
Other than Mother and Adoptive Father,

55
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,470
there has never has been someone to treat me so well,

56
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,130
thinking everything so thoroughly for me.

57
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,150
Can you tell me...

58
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,000
what wrong your mother faced?

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,990
Who exactly is this enemy?

60
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,910
I can help you, I really can.

61
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,580
Sorry, I cannot say.

62
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,020
I don't want to involve more people.

63
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,480
Even if you don't tell me,

64
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,300
I can think of a way to find out who your enemy is.

65
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,420
Only this way... can I protect you.

66
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,300
It is time to eat! Everyone go eat.

67
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,190
I haven't finished.

68
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,690
I know.

69
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,280
Wait for me. Let me clean up.

70
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,000
Hurry up you two. Today is the first day of the month. They have more dishes. If you go late, you won't be able to eat it.

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,610
Okay.

72
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,730
Let's go.

73
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,770
Yan Ran, let's go.

74
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,940
Yan Ran,

75
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,580
why do you care about him?

76
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,510
Attire Expert Zhuo is drawing designs in the room.

77
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,670
He won't miss any chance to make Attire Expert Zhuo happy.

78
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,170
He wishes us all to leave.

79
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,730
- Let's go.
- Hurry.

80
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,810
More dishes today, sounds so good.

81
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,600
Master, it's time to eat.

82
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,720
Everyone has left?

83
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes, except for Xiao Douzi.

84
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,170
Everyone else has left.

85
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,200
- Xiao Douzi?
- Yes.

86
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:05,250
This means that Xiao Douzi has already started sewing clothes for Talented Lady Wu?

87
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,500
He is thinking of new designs, but I was in a rush to come,

88
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,930
so I didn't look at it much.

89
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,990
Stop picking it up. Stop it.

90
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,220
Hurry up and have a look.

91
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,160
Look at what Xiao Douzi is drawing and for whom.

92
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,950
Geez, hurry.

93
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,500
Ask for more details.

94
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,880
Go.

95
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,010
This...

96
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,450
Qiniang, help me have a look.

97
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,160
Is this design drawn well?

98
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,680
What you drew is a "One Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix"?

99
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,420
Exactly.

100
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,430
This is the most gorgeous and exquisite "One Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" picture I've seen.

101
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,120
No wonder Master looks at you differently.

102
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,450
Your thoughts and skills are really greater and on a different level

103
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,830
than the sisters here

104
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,370
Thank you for your praises, Qiniang.

105
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,880
Today, Attire Expert Zhuo asked us to think further.

106
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,250
I thought of what Consort Yang's thoughts would be.

107
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,900
Then I thought of this "One Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix."

108
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,240
I don't understand.

109
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,200
Why do a "One Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" fulfill Consort Yang's thoughts?

110
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,410
After the previous king was deceased, the queen's seat has been empty since.

111
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,300
Consort Yang is most liked,

112
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,310
and is also the only one His Majesty favors

113
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,880
and almost became Queen.

114
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,280
Consort Yang is respected, so she obviously wants her clothes

115
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,450
to show her outstanding and high status.

116
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,030
What you are saying makes some sense.

117
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,210
But... if Consort Yang has this thought,

118
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,730
then why doesn't she directly show it.

119
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,740
Why does she have to make everyone guess?

120
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,100
You don't know this.

121
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,600
In the palace, there are some things that can only be put in meaning but not expressed.

122
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,120
Consort Yang naturally can't say it herself.

123
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,580
But we as servants, we have to help send our host's message,

124
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,520
to try our best to make it aware.

125
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,310
As long as Consort Yang likes it,

126
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,670
achievement can be expected soon.

127
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,710
Xiao Douzi!

128
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,330
How dare you?!

129
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,480
How many days has it been that you have come here?

130
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,360
I've been taking good care of you, but you are so proud of yourself.

131
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,380
You dare to step on me and climb up?

132
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,860
Let me tell you unless I die, or else you will never!

133
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,600
Attire Expert Zhuo, you misunderstood.

134
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,150
How can I dare to step on you?

135
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,740
I planned to give this design to you first.

136
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,130
I understand

137
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,180
that everyone in the Bureau of Imperial Attire's thoughts are your thoughts.

138
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,970
All of our achievements are yours.

139
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,670
I just wanted to help you.

140
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,690
Such a sweet talker!

141
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,690
It's great you understand in your heart.

142
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,820
[Bureau of Imperial Attire]

143
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,830
Is this a design of a "One Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix"?

144
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:39,030
Replying to Consort Yang, it is.

145
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,380
In His Majesty's eyes, you have been respected and obedient.

146
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,870
He has requested you to manage the royal harem all these years.

147
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,780
This time, you are in charge of the Feast for All Souls Festival. The "One Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix"

148
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,980
is the most suitable for you to show your royal harem

149
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,940
one and only status.

150
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,010
Attire Expert Zhuo, you really do have insight.

151
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,850
Then, when my Consort Yang was the younger generation,

152
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,010
she was the queen in His Majesty's heart.

153
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,360
Dan Qing, don't speak too much.

154
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,190
Attire Expert Zhuo, you really have put effort into it this time.

155
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,390
I am really satisfied.

156
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,940
But you still have to make more effort when embroidering.

157
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,640
Only in this way, you won't disappoint this design.

158
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:30,260
Replying to Consort Yang. I have not slept at all last night.

159
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,850
I have thought of an idea.

160
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,140
Say it.

161
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,730
If we can select feathers from birds and peacock as decorations,

162
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,120
then we can show a "One Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix,"

163
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,670
and we can also show your

164
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,810
respected status in His Majesty's heart.

165
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,690
Attire Expert Zhuo,

166
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,260
this is a great idea.

167
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,960
We will do as you have said.

168
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,030
You have to put in your efforts.

169
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,910
Thank you for your trust. I will for sure try my best.

170
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,540
Talented Lady Wu, Xiao Douzi has come.

171
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,510
Greetings, Talented Lady Wu.

172
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,310
These few days, I have designed a few designs with much thought.

173
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,690
- I came specifically for you to see.
- Thank you.

174
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,730
Let me have a look.

175
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,950
There is nothing for you now, please leave.

176
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,340
Yes.

177
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,960
Talented Lady Wu, your ginseng soup is ready.

178
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,780
Put it there.

179
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,030
Where's Yu Liu? Where is she being lazy now?

180
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,590
There is something for Yu Liu to do. I had time

181
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,990
so I sent it for you.

182
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,200
I think this peony design is the best.

183
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,450
Peony is the king of flowers.

184
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,670
Flowers in full bloom mean wealth. The meaning is good as well.

185
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,470
If you choose this one,

186
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,590
I think that we can use the most precious gold silk embroidery for the petals.

187
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,610
By using Tian Mountain's jade as an inlay for the leaves,

188
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,010
we can show its richness.

189
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,360
This is great. We'll do as you say.

190
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,700
Right. You have to remember to do it low profile, don't make it obvious to others.

191
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,650
Don't let people take the idea.

192
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,480
It will not go well if it is a coincidence with other concubines.

193
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,760
Yes. I understand.

194
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,680
- Consort Yang, Song Tao has sent news.
- Quickly say it.

195
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,430
Xiao Douzi has drawn many designs for Talented Lady Wu to choose from.

196
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,770
Talented Lady Wu chose a peony design,

197
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,560
and even said to use the most precious gold silk embroidery for the petals

198
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,640
and Tian Mountain's jade as an inlay for the leaves,

199
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,420
and must make it rich in beauty.

200
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,410
Peony?

201
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,600
Talented Lady Wu's ambition really is not small.

202
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,910
Good thing I thought to have a spy.

203
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:15,010
Attire Expert Zhuo probably is still in the dark right now.

204
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:19,700
She really thinks that Talented Lady Wu doesn't wish to show off in public.

205
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,270
Consort Yang, in my opinion,

206
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,170
just order Attire Expert Zhuo to hide the supplies of gold silk thread and Tian Mountain jade,

207
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,790
and ask Xiao Douzi to catch shrimp.

208
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,400
No need.

209
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,210
It's better to let Xiao Douzi make the clothing.

210
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,540
I don't understand, Consort Yang.

211
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,780
Although Talented Lady Wu is smart,

212
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,360
but she is still young and doesn't know complexity.

213
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,600
She dares to use peony.

214
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,360
That is Empress Zhangsun's favorite design.

215
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,330
She is just a small Talented Lady Wu.

216
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,030
His Majesty has just given some respect,

217
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,350
and she has already become highly conceited.

218
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,580
She dares to use the peony.

219
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,980

Here.

227
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,120
You have traveled long.

228
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,660
Today, I am busy;

229
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,910
otherwise, I would have greeted you myself at the city gate.

230
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,370
Your transfer was given by Crown Prince himself.

231
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,060
He kept asking when you would come to Chang'an.

232
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,370
I am really grateful for His Highness the Crown Prince's recognition and remembering.

233
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,180
Hurry and sit then.

234
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,870
I heard that you defeated Pu Banu in front of His Majesty and won the position of Imperial Guard Leader.

235
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,770
I am so happy.

236
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,690
Too bad I didn't witness that exciting competition.

237
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,830
Good brother, you overpraise me.

238
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,330
We must serve the crown prince well,

239
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,680
so that we do not disappoint the crown prince's grace.

240
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,980
I, Mo Kun, will definitely not disappoint His Highness.

241
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,900
Furthermore, I won't disappoint the goal that I set when I was young.

242
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,670
Even though the transfer order has been issued, but the procedure isn't completed yet.

243

Good brother, you can rest for a couple of days.

00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,780
I really can't be idle.

245
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,370
Why don't you give me something to do first, Brother Pei?

246
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,130
I do have something.

247
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,780
If you are willing, then please investigate it for me.

248
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,660
However, you must investigate it secretly

249
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,820
and you must not make it public.

250
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,210
Brother Pei, just give me the order. I shall not disappoint you.

What exactly is his connection with the palace?

253
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,360
There may be some clues in the archives in the palace.

254
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,280
But I'm not sure.

255
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,070

256
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,410
Why does Brother Pei want to investigate him?

257
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,790
I have a friend who has encountered trouble,

258
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,580
but she won't tell me about it.

259
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,430
I can only try to help her secretly

260
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,990
in the hope that she can be extricated from dire straits.

261
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,410
If Brother Pei can't easily talk about it, I won't ask further then.

262
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,770
I'll just get the job done.

00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,340
isn't it an old case from 11 years ago?

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,620
Why have you brought out this old file?

287
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,430
The Imperial Guard Leader's manor, for an unkown reason, suddenly wants to check the old file.

288
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,450
First, they went to the Court of Judicial Review.

289
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,030
They also came to the palace jail to find the files.

290
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,990
It took me a lot of effort to find it.

291
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,200
I can fulfill my duty in a while then.

292
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,130
Why does the Imperial Guard Leader want to investigate this An case?

293
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,970
How could I ask the question about that?

294
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,400
They told me to find the file, so I found the file.

It's probably trouble when it comes to this case.

00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,800
It's the one Xiao Douzi met when she left the palace,

It's natural that he will be ostracized by other people.

Pei Xingjian is suddenly investigating this old case.

315

More than likely, he wants to find out about Xiao Douzi's background.

You are right.

00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,000
Once Pei Xingjian finds out that Xiao Douzi is Liuli,

318
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,200
regardless of it being personal or official business, it'll probably endanger Xiao Douzi.

324
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Pei Xingjian shouldn't repay kindness with a grievance, should he?

325
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,800
People's hearts are full of vicious schemes. We must guard ourselves.

If this case is traced down further,

336
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,100
it won't be good for Xiao Douzi.

Xiao Shunzi,

348
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,200
you must pay more attention to what happens at Consort Yang's.

00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,100
We need to pay better attention for Xiao Douzi's sake.

352
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,900
Understood.

353
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,900
Brother Pei.

354
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,000
You can leave.

355
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

356
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,800
I was originally feeling strange about this. Brother Pei just started in a new position.

357
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,500
Why were you in a hurry to investigate a commoner family outside the palace?

358
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,400
Once I looked, that's when I realized the connection.

359
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,700
This case actually involves Prince of Cao's mother, Consort Yang.

360
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,800
Brother Pei, you are indeed awesome.

361
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,400
This involves Consort Yang?

362
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,200
Eleven years ago, His Majesty intended to confer Consort Yang as empress.

363
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,600
But all the court ministers fiercely disagreed.

364
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,000
Ultimately His Majesty didn't do it, but this incident caused an uproar those years ago.

365
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,800
Brother Pei, do you remember it?

366
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
This incident happened around the time when I came to Chang'an to participate in the imperial exams.

367
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So I have a little impression of it.

368
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,200
The Kudi Yanzhong that Brother Pei wants to investigate

369
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,400
is only an ordinary commoner.

370
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
However, his wife wasn't ordinary.

371
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,800
She was the famous Number One Needle in the World, Madam An.

372
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,200
According to the file at the Court of Judicial Review,

373
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,400
Madam An made a pheasant robe for Consort Yang to wear at the ceremony to confer the empress title.

374
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,600
But later, Consort Yang wasn't conferred as empress.

375
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,000
Madam An was convicted for overstepping propriety

376
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,800
and committed suicide in jail.

377
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,500
Isn't Kudi Yanzhong's wife

378
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,100
Madam Cao?

379
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,000
This Madam Cao that you mention is Kudi Yanzhong's concubine.

380
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,900
Before Madam was arrested, Kudi Yanzhong already wrote a divorce letter

381
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,400
and terminated all connections with Madam An.

382
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,800
From then on, Kudi Yanzhong only had one concubine

383
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,600
and no official wife.

384
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,000
Madam Cao came from a brothel originally.

385
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,100
How can she compare to Madam An?

386
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,800
Madam An was bestowed Number One Needle in the World by His Majesty himself.

387
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,540
She used to be in charge of the Bureau of Imperial Attire

388
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,400
and was favored by the late empress.

389
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,300
Because she was tired of living inside the palace,

390
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,400
she pleaded with the late empress to resign and left the palace.

391
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,770
Soon after that, Empress Zhangsun passed away and

392
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,800
Madam An had also disappeared.

393
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,400
No one would have expected that she married a most ordinary Kudi Yanzhong.

394
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,600
It was only until the Court of Judicial Review arrested her

395
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,200
that she was connected with the palace again.

396
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,600
This Madam An, did she have children?

397
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Madam An had a daughter named Liuli.

398
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,000
She was only seven that year and was arrested and put in the palace jail along with her mother.

399
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,600
I also went to the palace jail to look at the old file. According to the file,

400
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,900
Madam An strangled her daughter in the jail cell and then hanged herself.

401
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,600
What a pitiful child.

402
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,600
She died so tragically inside the palace at such a young age.

403
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Yu'er grew up in the palace since her childhood.

404
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,800
She hid her identity by posing as a physician because she was a guilty person.

405
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,600
She survived death row in the palace jail.

406
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,200
Precisely, this is how it happened.

407
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,610
Brother Pei?

408
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,400
I was thinking,

409
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,000
the pheasant robe for conferring an empress should have been made by the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

410
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,800
Why did Madam An make it and gift it to Consort Yang?

411
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
This doesn't sound logical.

412
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,200
Did you look into this?

413
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,400
What Brother Pei said I also feel suspicious about.

414
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,400
As recorded by the file in the Court of Judicial Review,

415
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,200
in order to appease Consort Yang, Madam Yang

416
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,300
secretly made the pheasant dress without Consort Yang's knowledge.

417
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,950
This isn't right.

418
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,000
Madam An was determined to leave the palace back then.

419
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,900
She was willing to leave Empress Zhangsun who favored her.

420
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,600
Why would she change her mind several years later

421
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,300
to make the pheasant gown for Consort Yang at the risk of overstepping propriety?

422
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,000
The sequence doesn't sound logical.

423
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,400
There was talk that Madam An realized how hard life was after she left the palace.

424
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,200
So she wanted to return to her job in the palace.

425
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Madam An was bestowed Number One Needle in the Palace by His Majesty.

426
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,000
If she had wanted to return to the palace, the Bureau of Imperial Attire would have been pleased to have her.

427
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,200
Why would she come up with this bad idea?

428
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Or perhaps it was Consort Yang

429
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,800
hearing that His Majesty wanted to confer her as empress,

430
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,400
so she ordered someone to overstep propriety to make the pheasant robe.

431
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Unexpectedly, she wasn't conferred as empress.

432
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,400
The pheasant robe was discovered, so Madam An was the scapegoat.

433
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,500
Brother An's speculation

434
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,600
seems much more logical than the theory of Madam An's conspiracy charge.

435
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,000
Or perhaps, it was other people who wanted to climb up in their career

436
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,800
so they decided to appease Consort Yang by privately forcing Madam An.

437
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,400
That's also possible. It's just that the incident happened so long ago,

438
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,370
and Madam An also committed suicide in jail.

439
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,500
There is no more proof.

440
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,000
Other than the daughter, did Madam An have other relatives?

441
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,800
Madam is a daughter of a Hu family. She had two older brothers in her family.

442
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,880
One of them is named An Silang,

443
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,400
who has a resist dye shop in the West Market.

444
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,400
- Is it Ruyi Resist Dye Shop?
- That's right.

445
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,500
After Madam An and her daughter died, what happened to the corpses?

446
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,200
Is there a file in the jail's archive?

447
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,400
Madam An and her daughter died in jail...

448
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,000
the corpses were collected and buried by the Courtyard of Misfortune.

449
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,800
Courtyard of Misfortune...

450
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,090
There's no mistake now.

451
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,400
Yu'er is Madam An's daughter.

452
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,000
She was that child entrusted by Talented Lady Wu

453
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,800
taken to serve the Wu Manor but later arrested by the Court of Judicial Review.

454
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,400
Yu'er was saved by Sun Decheng from jail.

455
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,800
From then on, she treated Sun Decheng as her foster father and grew up in the Courtyard of Misfortune.

456
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,300
Yu'er, no, Liuli.

457
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,200
Liuli escaped from the palace but insisted on returning to the palace and entered the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

458
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,300
It must be because she has found clues to her enemy and wants to avenge her mother.

459
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,400
I finally know who she is.

460
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,800
Xiao Douzi.

461
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,600
Shouldn't you be working at the East Palace at this time?

462
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,000
Why are you here?

463
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,200
I just went to the Bureau of Imperial Attire to find you. They said you were working at the Hall of Sunset Pool.

464
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,400
So I delieberately waited here for you.

465
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,000
You are in such a hurry to find me. Is there anything urgent?

466
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,400
You don't need to worry.

467
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,200
I came so that I can tell you in person,

468
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,800
I'm really happy to see you again.

469
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,800
Didn't we just see each other when Crown Prince invited us to drink two days ago?

470
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,800
You came especially, just to say this?

471
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,800
I confirmed some things.

472
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,200
My mood has become really good. It's just that this is talk without proof,

473
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,800
and this is not a place to talk for a long time.

474
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Tomorrow evening, I will bring some things to visit you at the Courtyard of Misfortune.

475
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,000
I guarantee that you'll be pleased when you see it.

476
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,600
What is it?

477
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,600
You'll find out tomorrow.

478
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,800
Anyway, I'm really happy

479
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,600
to see you again.

480
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,030
Also,

481
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,990
we are really fated.

482
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,300
Catch them!

483
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,220
Liuli, I've looked for you for 11 years.

484
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,470
I never thought that you already were by my side.

485
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,750
I can finally return this to its rightful owner.

486
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:08,610
You will definitely be happy, really happy.

487
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:12,960
[Madam An's embroidery]

488
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:40,950
Master, if you want to know what the ceremonial dress Xiao Douzi made for Talented Lady Wu looks like

489
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,660
just ask him directly.

490
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,510
You're the Bureau of Imperial Attire's Attire Expert.

491
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,410
Looking through his dwelling like this,

492
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,760
if he catches us, it'll get bad.

493
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,680
If I could directly ask him, would I come here secretly?

494
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,290
You don't need to be worried.

495
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,190
I ordered Xiao Douzi on a commission.

496
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,090
I'm afraid that being discovered by him, it would hurt your reputation.

497
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,750
Talented Lady Wu personally asked for Xiao Douzi to make her clothes.

498
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,350
Both covering up each other.

499
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,120
They're clearly fomenting some scheme

500
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,650
to let Talented Lady Wu surpass everyone at the Feast of All Souls.

501
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,650
Consort Fei doesn't know why yet she's furious. She also wants to be the queen of beauties.

502
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:29,070
If we don't ascertain in advance Talented Lady Wu's exact details,

503
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:33,100
if we fail, even Consort Yang's ceremonial dress will lose to Talented Lady Wu.

504
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,800
Then what prestige do I still hold?

505
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,610
What are you waiting for? Quickly help me find it!

506
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,280
- Carefully search.
- Yes.

507
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,060
I found it!

508
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,140
I'm always afraid of a mistake.

509
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,960
This time everything's all right.

510
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,960
Master, what is right?

511
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,960
You don't need to know.

512
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,740
Talented Lady Wu and Xiao Douzi think they are smart.

513
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:02,580
I never thought that they were too smart for their own good.

514
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,430
Consort Yang rarely meddles. Once she does,

515
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:11,170
she very accurate. What a clever move.

516
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,450
My mother had a rare treasure that caught evil people's eyes.

517
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:21,590
They wanted it, so that's why they wanted to hurt my mother and me.

518
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:25,320
Someone killed my mother. I have been saved by trusted people.

519
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,540
Surviving after many hazards, I hid in the Courtyard of Misfortune.

520
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,680
About dressing up as a man and being a physician in the palace,

521
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,930
it was to survive.

522
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,540
It makes sense. Everything makes sense now.

523
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,130
Back then, Zhuo Jinniang attacked Attire Expert An.

524
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,020
She chased down Liuli.

525
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:48,100
It must have been because of Attire Expert An's Golden Needle and valuable book.

526
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,330
I almost hurt Liuli.

527
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:54,330
If I give her the Golden Needle now, she will face danger.

528
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:58,790
Then, not only won't she be able to protect the Golden Needle and valuable book left by her mother,

529
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:01,350
but even preserving her life would be hard.

530
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,720
Where are you going, so absent-minded?

531
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,730
That's to say, Zhuo Jinniang is going crazy.

532
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:41,370
She ordered me to do so much but she only gave me 6 hours to finish.

533
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:45,410
This morning I left in a hurry and forgot to bring an important tool in my room, I need to go back to get it.

534
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,130
I don't have time to talk to you.

535
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,650
You can't go.

536
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,450
Why?

537
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,180
She gave you your orders so you would leave your room.

538
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,790
If you go back and bump into her, it'll get bad.

539
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,330
No wonder...

540
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,630
Giving me so much work was because of that!

541
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,880
Let her search if she wants to! I'm not afraid!

542
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,850
It's not convenient to talk here.

543
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:13,500
Tonight at 7:00 p.m., I'll wait for you by Changchun Lake.

544
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,640
Changchun Lake?

545
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:21,270
Okay. At Changchun Lake.

546
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,740
Master, this time Consort Yang's temper changed so much,

547
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,490
she acted in a high style and is not shying from anything.

548
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,180
I even heard that all the court ministers, in order to appease Prince of Cao,

549
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,220
are collecting bird feathers regardless of high cost.

550
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,720
The cost of birds is soaring in Chang'an City now.

551
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,530
If it's a precious breed, it's difficult to even find one feather.

552
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:54,710
Consort Yang's position in the heart of His Majesty is still high.

553
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:57,560
Yet she's still not the empress.

554
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,760
I always think,

555
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,400
does this have something to do with Xiao Douzi?

556
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:12,720
My right eyelid has been jumping lately.

557
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,920
I hope there's no bad luck coming for Xiao Douzi.

558
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,980
When you were talking, it was jumping worse.

559
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,800
Xiao Douzi acts brashly.

560
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,700
Master, shouldn't we go persuade her?

561
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,710
If this really does have something to do with Xiao Douzi,

562
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,970
then the arrow is already ready to shoot.

563
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:43,080
Even if Xiao Douzi wants to hold back,

564
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,720
it's unlikely.

565
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,910
Brother Pei!

566
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:17,240
- Good brother.
- Didn't you say you wanted to give some things to a friend?

567
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,190
Why are you here?

568
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:24,250
I thought about it. I should hold onto this thing.

569
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,020
For her, for the thing, it's safer.

570
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,730
By the way, why you are training here?

571
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,570
The guard on duty tonight is taking a leave tonight.

572
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,430
So I volunteered to substitute for him.

573
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,460
I don't have my official duty yet anyway,

574
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,840
so it's good to get familiar with the palace by walking around.

575
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:50,150
Good. Then you quickly go training.
