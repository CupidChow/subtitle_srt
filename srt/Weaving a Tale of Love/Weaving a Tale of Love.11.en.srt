[Weaving A Tale Of Love]

3
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,020
[Episode 11]

4
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,130
Do you really want to withdraw from the fair?

5
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,590
Yes. We don't have any samples of clothes now.

6
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,310
The sample dress of Ruyi Resist Dye Shop is here!

7
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,590
A'Ni!

8
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,320
- It's so great!
- We finally found the sample.

9
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,190
I thank Young Master Pei in the name of Ruyi Resist Dye Shop.

10
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,860
Shopkeeper A'Ni, quickly get ready!

11
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,600
All right!

12
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,670
That's really great!

13
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,930
The dress designed by Caoji Resist Dye Shop is gorgeous.

14
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,580
It has Great Tang's palace style.

15
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,600
It inspires people to widen their horizons.

16
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,980
However, it's still too early to declare victory.

17
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,840
Because the next contestant is

18
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,900
the famous Ruyi Resist Dye Shop!

19
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,480
Let's invite the shopkeeper of Ruyi Resist Dye Shop

20
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,080
to come up and present their work!

21
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,450
- Great!
- Great!

22
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,990
About that...

23
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,750
How did you know that person was a liar?

24
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,890
Earlier with all the clothing shops,

25
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,750
that person single-mindedly only came to your stand.

26
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,060
It's proving that you are not that smart

27
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,370
and wanted to steal the clothes from you.

28
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,800
Thank you.

29
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,080
Don't admire me too much.

30
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,570
Don't forget! We are now...

31
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,710
still enemies.

32
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:22,210
Don't worry. It's you that owes me and I won't forget.

33
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,960
Let's say that what happened today repays a little bit of interest.

34
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,520
Dear colleagues. Dear customers of Ruyi Resist Dye Shop. Good morning, everyone!

35
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,280
Great!

36
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,510
This is the clothing designed by our Ruyi Resist Dye Shop.

37
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,890
This dress's design is based on the shape of a peony.

38
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,690
We used a gradual dying technique.

39
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,880
Its design is unique and original. The confection is complicated and meticulous.

40
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,220
It can set off the ethnic girl's

41
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,980
lively and cheerful nature of their foreign beauty.

42
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,410
Good!

43
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,790
Although the thought behind this dress is clever, it doesn't surpass our Caoji Resist Dye Shop's magnificence.

44
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,580
It probably can't appeal to refined taste.

45
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,230
It makes sense what she says. Right.

46
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,560
That's right.

47
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,080
Take a look.

48
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,980
Look! That piece looks better!

49
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,230
The color is really beautiful!

50
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,510
That's right.

51
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,380
Ruyi Resist Dye Shop cut the dress's skirt into a flower shape.

52
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,020
This shows great creativity!

53
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,680
But...

54
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,520
Wait a second!

55
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,360
The dresses and garments of Caoji are indeed magnificent.

56
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,000
But they are more suitable for the sweet-tempered and refined women of the Tang Dynasty.

57
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,410
Hu women are more lively and restless, and love dancing and singing.

58
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,500
Ruyi Resist Dye Shop's dresses

59
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,870
were designed for Hu women!

60
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,160
Clever talk in an ingratiating manner!

61
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,690
If we want to know whether the dress is beautiful or not,

62
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,840
we shall hear the verdict of the masses!

63
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,480
Shopkeeper Cao is right! In fact, I want to

64
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,370
make a deal with you!

65
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,910
Since these dresses and garments were designed for Hu women,

66
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,290
so, of course, they should be tried on by a Hu woman to judge whether they are ugly or beautiful.

67
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,970
I was born in Tang and I grew up in Tang.

68
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,650
However, there's Hu people blood flowing through my veins.

69
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,480
Today, I will offer my service, just like Mao Sui,

70
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,040
on behalf of the women in the western region that want to buy Great Tang's clothing,

71
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,690
I will try on this piece of fabric!

72
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,140
Good!

73
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,960
- Congratulations! Congratulations!
- Thank you!

74
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,570
- Congratulations! Congratulations!
- Thank you, everyone.

75
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,980
Congratulations, Shopkeeper A'Ni for winning the contest!

76
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,590
- Thank you! Thank you!
- Shopkeeper A'Ni,

77
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,770
you are getting so many Hu merchants' contracts, I think you may get too busy.

78
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,730
- Please share some work with us.
- Thank you.

79
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:15,240
We all do business in the West Market, and we are neighbors.

80
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,870
[Ruyi]

81
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
[An Residence]

82
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,880
A'Ni, you haven't fallen asleep, too. Right?

83
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,800
Whenever I think of the Hu Merchants Fair,

84
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,930
the angry look of Madam Cao and Shanhu,

85
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,290
I can't resist laughing.

86
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,790
The more I think about it, the better I feel. Let's see in the future whether they have the face to

87
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,320
keep cheating by using Attire Expert An's name.

88
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,800
Exactly.

89
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,680
Liuli, the dress you made shined so brilliantly today,

90
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,620
and our Ruyi Resist Dye Shop won. Why do you look so worried?

91
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,420
I am only thinking, did I mistake Pei Xingjian today?

92
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,750
I also think he doesn't seem like a bad person.

93
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,920
If he really is a good person,

94
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,190
then I have become the bad person that accused the good person.

95
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,270
I wonder if Foster Father and Xiao Shunzi are doing well.

96
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,510
Such a clever and obedient child,

97
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,110
Sun Decheng is willing to give up.

98
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,190
It really makes people's heart ache while watching.

99
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,840
Xiao Shunzi, I heard that your master

100
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:16,190
is in a hurry to cut relations from you to abandon you.

101
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,520
I originally didn't have to care about someone who was abandoned in jail,

102
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,050
someone who can only wait for death.

103
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,880
Water.

104
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,740
You have good luck. You still have a bit of worth.

105
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,480
Tell me!  Where is Xiao Douzi hiding?

106
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,970
What is his background? Why does he know how to do such good needlework?

107
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,400
I will go to Pan Qinhan now and plead for you,

108
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,990
ask him to release you. What do you think?

109
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,970
Xiao Shunzi,

110
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,700
this is your last chance.

111
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,950
If you don't grab it,

112
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,130
when you go to hell,

113
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,920
don't regret.

114
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,140
Water. Water.

115
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,810
Physician Dou is already gone.

116
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,360
What did you say?

117
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,260
Attire Expert Zhuo save me! Save me!

118
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,250
I don't want to die.

119
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,910
Water. Water.

120
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,380
Here.

121
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,860
What did you say? Physician Dou is already gone?

122
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,030
Physician Dou is already gone. He left the palace already.

123
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,510
Where did he go?

124
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,450
I don't know.

125
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:51,020
I don't know. I only know

126
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,580
that he left the palace.

127
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,160
Say it. Why did he leave the palace?

128
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,890
How did he leave?

129
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:04,250
I only know that he wanted to leave the palace.

130
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,790
You said that Physician Dou has disappeared. I guess that

131
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,860
he probably sneaked out of the palace.

132
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,660
I really don't know anything else.

133
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,090
Xiao Shunzi!

134
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,970
You have known him since you were young.

135
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,910
Who are his parents? How did he learn to make clothes?

136
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,120
You should know these best!

137
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,930
He is Master's...

138
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,040
He is an orphan from outside the palace.

139
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,060
He also doesn't know who his parents are.

140
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,380
How would I know?

141
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,450
As for dressmaking,

142
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:46,040
he taught himself.

143
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,320
He told me that he found a book of dressmaking secrets from the funerary items

144
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,990
belonging to a deceased concubine.

145
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,230
He burned it after reading it.

146
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,050
I only heard everything from him.

147
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,240
I didn't see any of this.

148
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,050
Everything you are speaking is the truth?

149
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:12,270
Yes. Yes. I really don't want to die.

150
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:17,570
Every word I said is the truth. Attire Expert Zhuo, please save me.

151
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,320
As long as you are speaking the truth, of course I will help,

152
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,690
and figure a way to get you out.

153
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,460
[West Gate]

154
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,240
Hurry up!

155
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,760
Lightly.

156
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,680
Hurry! Hurry!

157
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,780
Put it down lightly. Very Lightly.

158
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,390
- Hurry!
- Prince of Cao has eaten bear heart and leopard gall.
(Got emboldened)

159
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,450
He actually has dared to embed secret goods among the paper supplies.

160
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,370
What exactly are these secret items that Prince of Cao has to go through these maneuvers.

161
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,610
Prince of Cao is here.

162
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,380
This subordinate Xue Xu greets Prince of Cao.

163
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,650
Has it been successful?

164
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,180
We did encounter some problems,

165
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,360
but I have already solved them.

166
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,390
Prince of Cao, please rest assured.

167
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,390
This way.

168
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,640
Hurry.

169
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,090
Your Highness.

170
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,160
You can take a look.

171
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,430
[Seal]

172
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,070
How can Prince of Cao dare to secretly ship armor? Is he going to rebel?

173
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,230
Secretly transporting armor is the same as the major crime of rebellion.

174
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,410
Is Prince of Cao going to rebel?

175
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,780
The crown prince is pushing for reform, but the Prince of Cao is opposing it.

176
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,290
Not long ago, Crown Prince argued with reason

177
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:57,580
and submitted a proposal to reform the imperial examination system. He persuaded His Majesty.

178
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,350
His Majesty has decreed to let the crown prince implement the reform.

179
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:04,090
Unless he is not satisfied because of this?

180
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:07,590
So he is secretly transporting armor to plan for a rebellion?

181
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,880
This isn't right.

182
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,130
Even though reforming the imperial examination system is a major event, but it shouldn't lead Prince of Cao

183
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,150
to make this kind of move that disregards any consequences.

184
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,390
It doesn't help to overanalyze it. How do we know what he is thinking?

185
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,810
Anyway, secretly storing armor is the same as intending to rebel.

186
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,850
We saw it with our own eyes.

187
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,380
It's an absolute truth. The Prince of Cao is scheming

188
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:34,180
and good at allying factions. There are many of his cronies in court.

189
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,330
If he really intends to rebel, I worry for Great Tang.

190
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:42,600
It is only a week. What can he do?

191
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,080
No, it is not only these cars.

192
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,090
What?

193
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:52,170
Puzhou will continue to ship paper supplies for students to Chang'an.

194
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:57,240
It means, there could be more huge batches of armor that will continue to be sent to Prince of Cao's Manor.

195
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,840
Brother Pei, such a major event should be immediately reported to the Court of Judicial Review.

196
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,250
You must not be careless.

197
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,480
Crown Prince's reform must have affected the benefits of many aristocrats and nobles.

198
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,600
- These people mostly have sided with Prince of Cao and become his faction and spies.
- But...

199
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,190
You and I have low official ranks. Even if we risk our lives to submit a report to His Majesty,

200
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,540
the report will probably be intercepted even before it reaches His Majesty.

201
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,280
Everything Brother Pei has said is right. But knowing that there are people planning to rebel,

202
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,170
as His Majesty's subordinates, we shouldn't leave them alone either.

203
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,670
We have to report this.

204
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:40,480
But we have to do it through someone we can trust to send it.

205
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,750
Brother Pei, why not ask your teacher, Su Dingfang to do it?

206
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:50,020
My teacher is traveling and won't return for some days.

207
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,000
Besides, the risk is too big this time.

208
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,280
What if we can't knock down the Prince of Cao. I don't want to drag down Teacher.

209
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,580
Crown Prince.

210
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,810
Crown Prince?

211
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,800
Yes, Crown Prince.

212
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,400
Prince of Cao's plot is obviously to overtake the crown prince's seat as the heir to the throne.

213
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,800
We should tell him. This is the best way.

214
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,700
Why didn't I think of this?

215
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,170
But with our ranks,

216
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,400
it is hard to see Crown Prince.

217
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,900
Listen to me. Let's divide and conquer.

Take your turn to transport the paper supplies and use the chance to find out Prince of Cao's movements.

220
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,200
As for how to report this matter to Crown Prince, let me work on that.

221
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,500
All right.

222
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,000
I haven't thought this Xiao Douzi would be so capable.

223
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,500
He even managed to sneak out from the palace.

224
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,200
Master, what do you plan to do next?

225
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,000
I will obviously report the whole incident to the Directorate of Eunuchs,

226
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,700
and make the Directorate of Eunuchs order his arrest.

227
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,600
Even though Xiao Douzi stayed in the Courtyard of Misfortune

228
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,200
as a medical officer of sanitation for many years,

229
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,800
ultimately, his physician title is undeserved.

230
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,000
If this is reported to the Imperial Academy of Medicine,

231
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,800
it will probably be turned into a trivial matter that is ignored.

232
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,000
Since Xiao Douzi's transfer order

233
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,600
was issued by the Directorate of Eunuchs,

234
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,400
and Deputy Director Pan Qinhai also accepted bribery from me,

235
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
I will

00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:33,920
ask him to get to the bottom of this matter.

237
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,900
Strange.

This Xiao Douzi

239
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,400
would rather sneak out of the palace and not get a better position at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

240

00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,600
Didn't you leave for the shop? Why are you back?

351
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,200
Hide immediately. Your paternal aunt is here.

352
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,800
My paternal aunt? Why is she here?

353
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,600
The house is only so big. Where can I hide?

354
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,400
I'd better hide outside.

355
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
No, no!  There's no time.

356
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,000
Shopkeeper A'Ni, hurry and open the door.

357
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,200
I saw you just now. I know that you're at home.

358
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,100
Shopkeeper A'Ni.

359
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,200
Shopkeeper A'Ni.

360
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,800
Shopkeeper A'Ni, hurry and open the door.

361
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,400
- It's not good if I don't open the door.
- Shopkeeper A'Ni.

362
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,200
Go hide inside. I'll persuade her to leave.

363
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,800
Shopkeeper A'Ni!

364
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,300
All right.

365
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,400
Open the door, Shopkeeper A'Ni.

366
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,000
Shopkeeper A'Ni, open the door.

367
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,900
Shopkeeper A'Ni.

368
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,700
Shopkeeper A'Ni...

369
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,400
Aren't you Madam Kudi? Why are you looking for me here?

370
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,100
We can talk at the store if you want anything.

371
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,990
Several womenfolk at the Commandant' Manor

372
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,400
have greatly complimented the female artist.

373
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,600
I also want her to custom make some new dresses for me.

374
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,400
Just now, I went to the shop but you weren't there.

375
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:01,000
I heard that you and the female artist live together at the An family's old residence.

376
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,800
So I came here instead.

377
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Madam must be talking about Yu'er, right? I'm afraid to disappoint you.

378
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,200
You came a little late. Yu'er already resigned and left.

379
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
This female artist is so capable.

380
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,200
The customers like her, and she won at the Hu Merchants Fair.

381
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
How could she leave just like that?

382
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,800
How could you bear to let her leave Ruyi Resist Dye?

383
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,400
The artist originally came from out of town.

384
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,800
She is used to going around to different places and doesn't like to stay in any one place too long.

385
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,700
Even though we didn't want her to leave, but we can't force her.

386
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,800
Since you said it like this, I'd like to ask about something.

387
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Is this female artist related to the An family?

388
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,400
Madam, why do you ask?

389
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
That artist is not related to the An family.

390
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,700
It's just by coincidence that our shop's owner hired her.

391
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,800
If you are just strangers,

392
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,200
why did the An family allow her to stay at the old family residence?

393
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,000
Could it be that this female artist has an unspeakable secret?

394
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,600
You hid her away and don't want people to see her.

395
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,000
I might even know this female artist.

396
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,700
Madam!

397
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,800
Shopkeeper A'Ni, no need to make it difficult.

398
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,400
Since this madam is so curious about me,

399
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,800
go ahead and let her see me. It's no problem.

400
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,270
Madam! Madam!

401
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,000
Shopkeeper A'Ni, I don't know who this Madam...

402
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,700
This is Madam Kudi from Commandant Pei's Manor. She is a customer at our Ruyi Resist Dye Shop.

403
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,800
And this is...

404
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,200
I am responsible for purchasing at the Bureau of Imperial Attire in the palace.

405
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,400
I heard about Ruyi Resist Dye Shop's fame, so I came here today

406
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,000
to discuss purchases.

407
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,600
Purchasing in the palace involves interests among different areas.

408
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,800
Before it's finalized, we must keep it low-profile.

409
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
Therefore, I especially reminded Shopkeeper A'Ni

410
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,000
not to talk about it to any outsiders to avoid unexpected conflicts.

411
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,300
There are too many people in the shop, and Caoji Resist Dye is always watching us.

412
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,800
This is why I invited our esteemed guest to come to our old residence.

413
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,000
Unexpectedly, as I was about to go to the shop to pick up some samples for the esteemed customer,

414
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,800
I saw Madam by accident. I didn't mean to avoid Madam.

415
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,600
It's just that... this involves Ruyi Resist Dye's business secrets.

416
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,000
Madam is also related to Caoji. That's why I had to be extra cautious.

417
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It turns out that I made Madam misunderstand. Please excuse me, Madam.

418
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,900
What should we do then?

419
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,400
I almost disrupted Ruyi Resist Dye Shop's business.

420
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Shopkeeper A'Ni, since you have an important guest here, I still have official business to do.

421
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,600
I'll bid my farewell today, and will return another day to discuss the purchasing matter.

422
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,000
I have slighted you today. Please leave safely, Official.

423
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,600
I was the rude one. Please don't be upset, Official.

424
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,380
Take a look! 10 copper coins for one! Very cheap!

425
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,400
[Wang Pancakes Shop]

426
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,600
Physician Dou!

427
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,400
Good!

428
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,700
Make way!

429
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,260
How about this horse?

430
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,600
Patron, do you want to buy a horse?

431
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,600
To buy a horse... this horse...

432
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,500
Look at these horses! They are all fine breeds from the Western Regions!

433
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,200
I don't know what kind of horse my patron would like to buy

434
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,500
so that he has to sit next to its feet and write out compositions.

435
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,000
Can this horse run?

436
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,400
Of course, I have to sit next to its feet. When buying a horse, one has to check its feet.

437
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,800
Checking its teeth, its eyes, its hair,

438
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,700
is nonsense. We're not choosing horses for their beauty!

439
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,100
Could you please step aside?

440
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,800
It's the first time I've seen someone buying a horse this way!

441
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,400
There is even more you have not seen yet!

442
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
That must be true!

443
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,400
This is also my first time seeing...

444
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,400
the physician who died but became alive again.

445
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
Where are you running to?

446
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,600
Let me go! Why do you want to catch me?

447
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,200
- Don’t move!
- Let go of me!

448
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,300
If you move again, I will hit you!

449
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,600
Go!

450
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,200
Customers, please come inside.

451
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,500
-  Shopkeeper, do you have a private room?
- Yes, yes.

452
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,400
There is a private room upstairs.

453
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Attendant, hurry and take these two customers upstairs.

454
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,900
Customers, please go upstairs.

Thank you.

462
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,860
I warn you.

463
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,200
I am not interested in Long Yang.
(I am not gay. From a story about King of Wei and Lord Long Yang who were lovers.)

464
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Look at you.

465
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,400
You actually resemble your cousin who is the artist.

466
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,800
Not only do you look like her, but even your stinky temper is also similar.

467
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,000
Fortunately, I am alert and have sharp eyes.

468
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,400
I saw you and recognized you right away.

469
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Otherwise, I don't know how much longer I'd be falsely accused.

470
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,700
Sharp eyes? I think you're blind.

471
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,900
What did you say?

472
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Speak. Why did you pretend to be dead?

473
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,400
Does Yu'er know that her older cousin is still alive?

474
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,000
Even though I found your bundle,

475
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,800
to avoid arousing suspicion, I never even opened it.

476
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,600
But your cousin insists on saying that I exchanged the content in the bundle.

477
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,800
She won't quit until she gets her money back.

478
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,600
Right now, it seems that you two cousins colluded in a scam.

479
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,000
You looked for an easy target to blackmail a bundle of money.

480
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,800
I think this is a misunderstanding.

481
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,400
I'm just a little medical officer at the Courtyard of Misfortune. Because I yearned for freedom outside the palace,

482
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:00,000
I pretended to be dead and hid in the coffin so that I could escape out of the palace to reunite with my cousin.

483
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Who was to know that as soon as I got out of the palace that day, the coffin was hit and overturned.

484
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I hurried to run away and carelessly dropped the bundle.

485
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,400
That bundle really contained money, and it was my complete savings.

486
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,800
Yu'er saw that Sir Pei found the bundle, so she went to Simen College to ask for it back.

487
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,600
Who would have known that the bundle was switched?

488
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:25,000
The money never went through anyone else's hands, and now they are missing for no reason.

489
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,200
Naturally, Yu'er and I

490
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,800
thought that you did it. We just wanted to get it back.

491
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,000
- Except that—
- Except what?

492
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Except that when you saw the victim, not only didn't you avoid me but actually kept chasing,

493
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,200
It really doesn't seem like what a thief would do.

494
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,000
So now I am feeling doubtful, too.

495
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,800
I'm concerned that we two cousins have blamed you by mistake.

496
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,380
In that case, you have a little conscience.

497
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,600
I won't randomly wrong a good person.

498
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,300
Since I can't be sure that Young Master Pei did it,

499
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,200
I will tell Yu'er to withdraw the lawsuit from Simen College.

500
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,300
We'll wait for the truth before we decide.

501
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:14,200
So, thank you for your hospitality. I'll bid you farewell now.

502
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,200
Wait!

503
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,600
Is this incident considered over and done with?

504
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,000
I've already explained everything, and I've also agreed to withdraw the lawsuit.

505
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,400
What else do you want?

506
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,200
Excuse me, but I've changed my mind.

507
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,800
It doesn't matter if you withdraw the lawsuit from Simen College. I don't care.

508
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,600
But you must do something to recompense for falsely accusing me.

509
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,400
As a eunuch that sneaked away, what can I do for you?

510
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,200
Loan me your waist badge.

♫  Fate has its uncertainties  ♫

518
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,600
♫  I've spent this life with brush and ink in hand  ♫

519
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:42,200
♫  Writing about what love is  ♫

520
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:47,400
♫  Borrow from the relentless of the night  ♫

521
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,600
♫  To exchange for the certainty of a promise  ♫

522
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:59,200
♫  To exchange for the certainty of a promise  ♫

523
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,200
♫  The more twists, the deeper it is  ♫

524
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,000
♫  Breaking up and making up is like an illusion  ♫

525
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,000
♫  Resembles a traveler traveling through this life

526
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,600
♫  Time ignores everything including obsession  ♫

527
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:25,800
♫  With the candlelight flickering indefinitely  ♫

528
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,500
♫  After the fire, there was only one thing left  ♫

529
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:37,900
♫  A bright moon that makes one's heart tingle  ♫

530
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,200
♫  After the fire, there was only one thing left  ♫

531
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:53,900
♫  A bright moon that makes one's heart tingle  ♫
