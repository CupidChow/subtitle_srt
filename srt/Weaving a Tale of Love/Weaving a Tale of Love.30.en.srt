4
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,900
Where's the miraculous medicine Talented Lady Wu gave His Majesty?

5
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,300
Didn't you say there was a miraculous cure to it?

6
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,520
This miraculous medicine is really great at the beginning,

7
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,570
but after eating it for a period,

8
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,200
then it slowly doesn't work.

9
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,360
Then, you are saying he is dependent on the so-called miraculous medicine

10
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,740
so he got his life back?

11
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,900
Prince of Cao, I don't understand what you are saying.

12
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,800
If it weren't for you to tell,

13
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,140
how would he know she was about to die?

14
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,810
Gao Quan, stop pretending to not know in front of me.

15
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,810
Do you really think I am that easily fooled?

00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,960
Qiniang, why are you here?

20
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,530
I am here to rescue you.

21
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,160
Hurry up and leave. If Attire Expert Zhuo finds out, you won't be able to leave.

22
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,420
It was so hard for me to sneakily follow Master here.

23
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,650
I have to rescue you out of here!

24
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,540
Before Pei Xingjian went out of the palace for errands he told me,

25
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,390
that I have to look after you well, and anything else would be said after he came back.

26
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,470
But now... But now, we probably cannot leave.

27
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,810
I am afraid before he comes back,

28
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,980
your life will be in my master's hand.

29
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,900
Qiniang, I don't want to leave.

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,170
What are you saying?!

31
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,720
Attire Expert Zhuo wants to learn my skills.

32
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,690
She wants to use the imperial robe I made to win the title, "Number One Needle in the World."

33
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,900
So, I am really safe right now. She doesn't want to kill me.

34
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,340
Staying here, you naturally don't want to make the dragon robe for her,

35
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,650
to let her win the title, "Number One Needle in the World".

36
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,430
What exactly are you thinking?

37
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,510
Qiniang, don't ask so much.

38
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,210
Anyway, I won't leave.

39
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,450
Also, if you rescue me, then how would you face Zhuo Jinniang?

40
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,570
There are only two days until the last round. Even if I escape now,

41
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,950
Zhuo Jinniang will still think of other ways to harm me. It's better if I stay here

42
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,520
and wait until the day of the competition.

43
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,870
No, I cannot leave you here alone.

44
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,740
I have a plan!

45
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,360
Sister Qiniang, if you really want to help me, then bring me something secretly.

46
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,130
With that, even if Zhuo Jinniang traps me in this secret tunnel,

47

Once he dies,

51
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,490
Li Zhi will successfully become emperor.

52

If Li Zhi becomes emperor, he will for sure kill me.

make me become Crown Prince.

There is not a big chance of that.

I have a plan for Crown Prince to poison His Majesty to death.

61
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,940

Eunuch Pan,

90

I asked you to come so I can help you,

I am not sure if you are willing?

You are joking, Your Highness.

Pan Qinhai.

120
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,800
Do you know why Gao Quan died?

121
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,080
It's because he picked the wrong side.

122
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,340
He dared to help Crown Prince and Talented Lady Wu to oppose me.

123
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,440
Talented Lady Wu has shaved off her hair and become a monk

124
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,510
to cultivate in solitude in the Hall of the Sunset Pool.

125
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,080
After His Majesty has passed on, she will enter Ganye Temple.

126
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,450
She will live there to the end of her life.

127
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,500
It's the best ending for her.

128
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,130
As for the crown prince? He will end up worse than Talented Lady Wu.

129
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,420
Very soon, because of regicide and patricide,

130
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,830
he will be executed.

131
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,300
Your Highness, the crown prince commits regicide and patricide...

132
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,290
What do you mean?

133
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,970
This talk naturally starts with the packet of poison in your hands.

134
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,500
Your Highness, spare me! Spare me!

135
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,990
Whatever else Your Highness wants me to do, I will not quibble.

136
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,150
But I just don't dare to kill anyone.

137
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,800
Especially when that person

138
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,920
is His Majesty.

139
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,850
What are you afraid of?

140
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,410
At that time, just push the guilt to Li Zhi. Mother and I will protect you to be safe.

141
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,310
Besides, it's not up to your decision now.

142
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,790
Either you go to your job happily as Director Pan,

143
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:41,550
or you go to the netherworld to be Gao Quan's companion.

here's what you wanted.

148
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,930
Tomorrow is the day of the final competition between you and my teacher.

149
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,400
You must take extra care.

150
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,280
Older Sister, Zhuo Jinniang is evil and will bring her own death.

151
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,180
I won't allow her scheme to succeed.

152
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:06,930
Don't sleep anymore. Quickly get up to sew the robe.

153
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,700
The competition will start in another four hours.

154
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,280
I'm hungry. I can only work after I have eaten.

155
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,010
Where is the food?

156
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,320
This dragon robe is only missing the two eyes.

157
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,910
But you keep dragging and won't finish them.

158
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:54,680
Xiao Douzi, are you perhaps hoping to get lucky

159
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,440
and still covet my status as Number One Needle in the World?

160
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,190
Your own skills are deficient and you will forcefully take the dragon robe that I've sewn.

161
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,750
Yet you are still so shameless and say you are the Number One Needle in the World.

162
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,630
Don't think you'll win with your sharp tongue.

163
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:19,400
It's getting late. Hurry and finish sewing the dragon eyes.

164
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,940
If you dare to make a fuss,

165
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,920
today will be your death day.

166
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,170
Sewing the dragon's eyes takes detailed handiwork.

167
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,180
It's too dark in here. I can't do it.

168
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,250
How is one enough? Bring another one.

169
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,730
- Hurry up.
- Don't shout.

170
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,680
Right, just put it there.

171
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,290
It's bright enough now, right?

172
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,710
It's just enough.

173
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,810
Oh no!

174
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,930
What's wrong now?

175
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,500
Why is this dragon robe's embroidery different from what I did?

176
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,170
Nonsense! Other than you and me, no one else has touched this dragon robe.

177
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,430
If you don't believe it, look at it yourself.

178
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,790
There are many brown spots on it.

179
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:02,570
Could it be so damp and dirty here that little bugs have bitten it?

180
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,180
The light is too low here. Come!

181
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,550
Take a closer look.

182
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,610
I can't see it clearly.

183
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,280
You can't see it clearly. Move closer to the candlelight to see.

184
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,370
Get closer! Closer to the candlelight.

185
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,390
Closer, closer.

186
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,820
Closer.

187
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,310
Closer.

188
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,580
Can you see now?

189
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,540
This... This...

190
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,570
- What happened?
- Let me tell you. The brown powder is phosphorus powder.

191
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,010
It burns when it meets heat. You have poor skills,

192
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,370
but actually want to take the dragon robe that I sewed,

193
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,410
and win the title of Number One Needle in the World in front of the grand consorts.

194
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,570
I just won't let you get it.

195
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,360
Great, Xiao Douzi, you actually dare to fool me!

196
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,280
Aren't you afraid of dying?

197
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,410
I embroidered this dragon robe.

198
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,980
I'm happy to burn my own thing. What's it to do with you?

199
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,260
I know you want to kill me. But your dragon robe isn't finished,

200
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,280
and my dragon robe is burned.

201
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,000
The competition is about to start. You go there empty-handed by yourself.

202
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,250
How will you explain to the two grand consorts?

203
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,490
At that time, if I am dead or missing,

204
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,570
the first person to be suspected will be you!

205
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,450
Xiao Douzi,

206
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,600
the dragon robe that you burned

207
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,750
is the one I embroidered.

208
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,650
But you, the dragon robe

209
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,920
that you embroidered with all that hard work

210
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,410
is still here in perfect condition.

211
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:39,040
When I watched you embroider every day here,

212
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,000
I would go back at night to imitate

213
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,350
to learn it,

214
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:50,120
even though I don't understand everything, but I learned about 70% or 80%.

215
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,220
You wanted to cheat me so much just now,

216
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,350
so you didn't notice anything.

217
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,630
How is this possible? How is this possible?

218
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,450
It's not possible! Give it to me!

219
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,170
How did you know I wanted to burn the dragon robe? How did you know?

220
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,140
I didn't know previously that you wanted to burn the dragon robe.

221
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,160
That's why I was really scared of you.

222
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:25,010
This time, thanks to the clever A'Bi

223
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,840
to catch Qiniang, the mole.

224
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:22,570
Even though Qiniang has sneakily found this place by following me,

225
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,810
but you, not only that you didn't escape,

226
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:29,780
you actually obediently sat here and continued to embroider the dragon robe for me.

227
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,830
Last night, I kept thinking and knew something was wrong.

228
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:37,990
I was on guard against you doing tricks on the dragon robe.

229
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,590
Luckily I made a move. When you were asleep,

230
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:47,240
I secretly swapped the two dragon robes.

231
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:07,380
Otherwise, I would have been trapped by you.

232
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,500
Since you won't do the dragon eyes, I won't force you then.

233
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,610
I will do them myself then.

234
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,960
Once I finish embroidering the dragon's pupils,

235
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,490
I will let you go.

236
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,650
Don't worry.

237
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,840
I don't want you to die yet.

238
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,520
I want you to see with your own eyes

239
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,000
when I sit in the seat of Number One Needle in the World.

240
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,590

Director Pan.

243
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,000
Director Pan, the medicinal soup for His Majesty is ready.

244
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,750
Eunuch Gao, how is His Majesty? Is he awake yet?

245
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,620
Replying to Your Highness the Crown Prince.

246
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,470
His Majesty is still unconscious.

247
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,960
I was just getting ready to serve His Majesty to take his medicine.

248
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,590
I got used to being called...

249
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,340
How is Eunuch Gao's funeral coming along?

250
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,140
He served his own life for His Majesty and did everything well.

251
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,620
Transmit my order that his burial must be good.

252
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,740
According to your previous command, he has already had a good burial.

253
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,630
I will personally serve His Majesty to take the medicine then.

254
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,210
Eunuch Pan.

255
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,230
Imperial Guard Pu.

256
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:03,040
What Prince of Cao ordered you to do,

257
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,620
have you completed it well? He is still waiting for me to tell him.

258
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:11,130
You can't rush this matter. Let me think of a good way.

259
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:16,390
Eunuch Pan, if His Highness hears this kind of dodging talk,

260
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,680
he will doubt your loyalty to him then.

261
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,020
Eunuch Gao is an example.

262
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,900
You need to think it over.

263
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,170
Imperial Guard Pu,

264
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,690
I've thought of a perfect idea.

265
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,120
The crown prince has been visiting His Majesty often lately.

266
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,630
Sometimes he will also help His Majesty take his medicine.

267
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,620
I only need to make my move before the crown prince

268
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,660
helps His Majesty take the medicine.

269
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,210
The crown prince will commit the crime of

270
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,590
regicide and patricide.

271
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,370
I will report this as you said.

272
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,650
Please hurry on with this, Eunuch Pan.

273
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,950

is the only disciple of Madam An, Number One Needle in the World.

276
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:44,700
She received the skills of dyeing, dressmaking, and embroidery directly from Madam An

277
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,340
and has reached the level of utmost ingenuity.

278
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,560
She should succeed the title of Number One Needle in the World.

279
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,450
I hope that you will continue to spread the dressmaking skills

280
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,120
to revive the past glory of the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

281
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,810
Thank you, Grand Consorts.

Zhuo Jinniang accepts your command and thanks your graces.

283
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:51,520
I will ask for days off for you. You just get a good rest today.

284
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,620
Remember to eat this bowl of porridge.

00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,920
Get some strength so that you'll recover.

00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,290
Sister Qiniang, you'll be late if you don't go yet.

287
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,920
Today is Attire Expert Zhuo's big day.

288
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,950
If you don't leave, you'll get scolded again.

289
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,030
What big day? What are you doing?

290
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,750
Nothing. It's not an important day.

291
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:27,210
It's just the regular lecture at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

292
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,260
Don't keep worrying about anything.

295
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,480
Attire Chief Lin, please be seated.

296
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,850
Where is Xiao Douzi?

297
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,540
Why isn't Xiao Douzi here?

298
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,480
Replying to Master. Xiao Douzi didn't feel well last night.

299
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,830
He had a fever all night, so he is taking a sick leave today.

300
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:06,190
I don't think he is sick. He probably is too embarrassed to see people because his boast is burst.

301
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,780
Attire Chief Lin, in order to revive the spirits at the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

302
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,250
she encourages everyone to enthusiastically improve dressmaking skills.

303
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,590
That's why she permitted him to overstep boundaries to challenge me.

304
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:23,300
Now that the winner and loser are determined, he should have a good attitude

305
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,610
to acknowledge the levels between high and low

306
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:30,590
so that we don't disappoint Attire Chief Lin's thoughtfulness.

307
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,060
When Xiao Douzi offended his high-ups,

308
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,070
he had sworn that if he lost,

309
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,690
he would be willing to be punished with two crimes.

310
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:42,790
Now that it's time to fulfill his promise, why has he gone into hiding?

311
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:46,790
Could it be that he will go back on his word?

312
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,520
Qiniang,

313
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,950
you are the closest with Xiao Douzi usually.

314
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,440
You should go and get Xiao Douzi to come here then.

315
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,140
Yes.

316
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,230
No need to get me. I'm here.

317
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,720
He's here?

318
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,700
Xiao Douzi, why are you here? You should hurry and go back.

319
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,220
We are busy in the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

Attire Expert Zhuo is mobilizing everyone to gather here.

321
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:05,220
Do you mean to boast in public of the title of Number One Needle in the World?

322
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:10,820
Xiao Douzi, you are deficient in skills and lost the competition.

323
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,450
You must learn the difference between the noble and the lowly.

324
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,380
Be careful.

325
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,250
Don't act so arrogant and forget your own status.

326
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,160
Attire Expert Zhuo,

327
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,090
in front of the founding ancestors, do you dare

328
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,950
to swear an oath

329
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:31,470
that you embroidered the winning dragon robe?

330
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,770
What is he saying?

331
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,190
What's going on?

332
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:40,590
That can't be. He can't have embroidered it, right?

333
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:45,030
Xiao Douzi? That can't be.

334
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:55,720
Is it true?

335
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,390
Yesterday, both grand consorts made

336
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,520
a fair decision in front of everyone.

337
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,910
They judged that my dragon robe won. This the best proof.

338
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:08,620
Xiao Douzi, how dare you speak nonsense

339
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,840
to instigate everyone to doubt the grand consorts' decision.

340
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,850
Are you trying to rebel against the superiors?

341
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:17,880
The two grand consorts didn't judge you as the winner.

342
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:21,530
They judged the dragon robe that you were holding as the winner.

343
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:31,360
You secretly swapped and took my dragon robe as your own

344
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,330
to cheat the two grand consorts and steal the title of Number One Needle in the World.

345
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,900
This is the real rebellion against the superiors.

346
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,030
I am a palace maid from the Bureau of Imperial Attire and need to see His Highness the Crown Prince.

347
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:51,200
If you are not summoned, how can such a lowly palace maid see the crown prince whenever you wish?

348
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,680
I beg you. Please go in and announce it.

349
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,490
It concerns someone's life.

350
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:58,930
Hurry and leave. If you don't leave now, don't blame me for being mean.

351
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,460
Female Officer Qiniang.

352
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,680
Imperial Guard Leader, you're back?

353
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,590
I just came back after finishing my mission.

354
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,780
Has something happened to Xiao Douzi?

355
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,670
Physician Dou is in big trouble!

356
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:15,530
Go! Tell me along the way.

357
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:20,950
Xiao Douzi, do you have any proof for what you say?

358
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,910
Words aren't enough to prove real or fake.

359
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,980
Everyone, please follow me to find the secret chamber. You will know when you see it.

360
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,130
What secret chamber?

361
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,110
Attire Chief Lin, don't listen to her nonsense.

362
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:43,480
What secret chamber? I've never heard of it.

363
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,560
If there is really a secret chamber, how can you ascertain

364
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,030
that it has something to do with me?

365
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,160
If I weren't locked in the secret chamber by you,

366
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,420
how would I have known about such a hidden place?

367
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:03,350
Everyone here, you have all been in the Bureau of Imperial Attire longer than I have.

368
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:06,040
May I ask?  Did you know

369
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,400
about a secret chamber in the Bureau of Imperial Attire?

370
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,200
Really?

371
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,360
Such a hidden secret room,

372
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,550
only someone in a high place like Attire Expert Zhuo would know.

373
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:26,330
A few days ago, Xiao Douzi was missing.

374
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:29,270
Attire Expert Zhuo also didn't appear much.

375
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,570
Therefore,

376
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,350
it seems to fit with what Xiao Douzi is saying.

377
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,890
Besides, the dragon robe that Attire Expert Zhuo embroidered

378
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,190
also looks quite different

379
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,900
from your regular style.

380
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:57,400
Attire Chief Lin, the title of Number One Needle in the World

381
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,080
was bestowed by the two grand consorts in front of everyone.

382
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,500
Xiao Douzi disobeys palace regulation and wants to deceive everyone.

383
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,120
You must not let her confuse you

384
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,030
and ruin our regulation in the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

385
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,870
If everyone learns from Xiao Douzi about how to offend their superiors in the future,

386
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:21,590
there'll be a day when they won't obey you.

387
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:24,410
Don't forget, Xiao Douzi is

388
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,760
despised by Consort Yang now.

389
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,570
Both grand consorts have already decided that I won.

390
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,720
If you help Xiao Douzi,

391
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,920
won't you fear offending the two grand consorts

392
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,100
and Consort Yang?

393
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,940
Eunuch Wang!

394
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,160
Imperial Guard Leader, why are you here?

395
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,680
I have an urgent matter to see the crown prince.

396
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,090
His Majesty was unconscious for two days and just woke up.

397
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,590
All the imperial princes are serving him in front of the sick bed now.

398
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,520
This involves Xiao Douzi's life. It's extremely urgent.

399
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,490
Please be tolerant, Eunuch Wang, and announce it now.

400
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,490
This...

401
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:12,650
Sure, I will go try.

402
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,590
Thank you, Eunuch Wang.

403
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:29,600
The reason that I allowed Xiao Douzi to overstep her level to challenge Attire Expert Zhuo

404
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,740
is to encourage everyone in the Bureau of Imperial Attire to seek improvements.

405
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,650
I wanted to tell you that

406
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:39,420
as long as you have real skills, you will have the opportunity to get promoted.

407
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,790
Do you all understand my thoughtful effort?

408
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:46,480
Attire Chief is thoughtful.

409
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:50,120
Now, the three rounds of the competition have finished.

410
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,470
The winner and the loser have been determined.

411
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:57,130
If you are willing to gamble, then you must accept the loss.

412
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,590
Otherwise, how will I dare to give you more chances?

413
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,940
That's right. You are the loser.

414
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,250
Xiao Douzi, don't keep messing things up,

415
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,430
or you will block other people's chances and future.

416
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,700
Xiao Douzi, this time

417
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,700
you showed your face in front of the two grand consorts and everyone else.

418
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,110
It gave you hope in a way.

419
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,880
A person must know when to step up and when to retreat,

420
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,250
and know when it's time to stop.

421
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:36,520
Besides, you yourself didn't do a good job this time.

422
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,530
You missed consecutively two rounds.

423
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:42,510
You gave up the win on your own.

424
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,340
- Attire Chief Lin...
- Xiao Douzi.

425
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,480
As it is, the ownership of Number One Needle in the World has been decided.

426
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,990
In the future, no one is allowed to dispute it.

427
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,350
Attire Chief Lin has wisely decided between right and wrong.

428
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:20,310
I, Zhuo Jinniang, am thoroughly in admiration.

429
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,390
[Hall of Immortal Nectar]

430
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,380
His Majesty cannot take in any porridge,

431
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:51,590
he should at least drink a few sips of the ginseng soup.

432
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:53,110
That's right.

433
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:56,090
Your Majesty, you should at least drink a few sips.

434
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:26,590
The ceremony to pay respect to the golden needle will start now.

435
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:30,770
Today, the ceremony to pay respect to the golden needle

436
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:33,370
will be in A'Bi's charge.

437
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,050
Attire Expert Zhuo, Qiniang is your disciple.

438
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,700
Previously, Qiniang always was the one to do these things.

439
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,420
Why have you changed to A'Bi today?

440
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:50,520
Qiniang has average talent, mediocre skills, and is lazy.

441
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:54,140
I'm afraid that she won't be able to succeed in my skills.

442
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:59,100
A'Bi is more talented than Qiniang,

443
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,490
more diligent in studying, and she is reliable.

444
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:05,610
Therefore, I want to accept A'Bi as a disciple

445
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:09,720
and let A'Bi take over Qiniang's duties.
