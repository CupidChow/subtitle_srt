[Weaving a Tale of Love]

3
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,380
[Episode 8]

4
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,090
It was obviously your daughter that came here on her own

5
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,370
to steal the dress design that I made for Madam Pei Yan.

6
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,210
That's why you made a fool out of yourself at the banquet.

7
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,260
You people have no introspection and rely on me.

8
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,260
I'm not talking about that.

9
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,270
Then let me ask you!  You know you cannot reveal yourself.

10
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,020
If you can survive until now, it is already extremely lucky.

11
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,240
You should be hiding in wild mountains, living and disappearing on your own.

12
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,800
How dare you flaunt the banner of a daughter from the Kudi family?

13
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,930
You're going everywhere under another name to swindle.

14
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,510
Lately, both the Hedong and Duwei families came to propose a marriage alliance.

15
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,250
You acted like that!

16
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,090
Tell me how are we supposed to come to a close and figure everything out?

17
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,380
Even if I cannot reveal myself,

18
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,480
our tendons are still connected even when the bones are broken.
(T/N: we are still blood relatives)

19
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,880
Why would I want to ruin myself?

20
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,860
Even if I die, you evildoers will get the punishment you deserve.

21
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,050
We can have a secret reunion.

22
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,660
If you don't care, you can scream and shout all you want.

23
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,920
And scream loudly and let the whole world know!

24
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,880
I don’t care.

25
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,620
If you have anything to say, say it inside.

26
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,490
From what I just heard,

27
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,800
this Lady Cao is the madam of Kudi Yanzhong. Right?

28
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,660
You can say that.

29
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,750
This artist is most likely the illegitimate daughter of Kudi Yanzhong.

30
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,220
She has always been kept out.  Out of sight.

31
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,390
The Kudi family must find itself being stuck in a dilemma, right?

32
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,210
These are the artist's family matters. We have made our customers laugh at us.

33
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,400
Why don't you go back first? As for the screen,

34
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,510
I will try to get our artist to change her mind.

35
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,200
It's not urgent. I will take a walk first.

36
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,480
After the artist has finished with her family matters,

37
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,770
it's not too late to continue our conversation.

38
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,940
In that case, both Duke of Hedong's heir and Pei Yan

39
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,590
are really here for you?

40
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,830
I have met them before.

41
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,070
Everyone thinks that the Kudi family only has one daughter.

42
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,110
That's why there is such a misunderstanding.

43
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,620
But don't worry, as long as you keep the secret

44
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,870
to yourself, I won't reveal my identity.

45
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,750
I don't want to be involved with you either.

46
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,280
When the time is right, I will be far away from here.

47
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,240
I will never return again.

48
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,550
Your family can also continue to live with a peace of mind.

49
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,340
It's so easy for you to talk after ruining Shanhu's marriage.

50
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,900
It sounds like you are sparing us.

51
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,280
You are unable to recognize others' good intentions.

52
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,020
Even if I wasn't the one to cause the misunderstanding, those two noble families

53
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,870
would have looked down on Shanhu anyway.

54
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,190
Just forget about it.

55
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,300
It's easy for you when you want to leave.

56
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,560
If you leave a mess, how do you expect us to clean up after you?

57
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,910
How do we explain to the two noble families?

58
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,370
It’s all your fault! You're like a death messenger who is set to harm people.

59
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,870
If it weren’t for you, we would be living peacefully.

60
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,190
But as soon as you appear, you make us all restless.

61
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,780
As I see it, we should uphold justice over blood relatives,

62
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,050
report to the authorities about your being the remnant of a guilty person.

63
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,690
Then explain everything to the two noble families and everything will return the way it was.

64
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,490
They would definitely forgive us.

65
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,340
Okay then.

66
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,000
I will wait for you to uphold justice over blood relatives.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,330
I already died once over ten years ago.

68
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,130
So the thing I am the least afraid of is death.

69
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,060
I am scared of one person living in this world alone.

70
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,120
But I won’t be like my mother.

71
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,960
A good person gets taken advantage of by other people.

72
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,070
Protecting your family by taking advantage of another's difficulties with a lower status than you.

73
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,870
This is all your retribution for what you did.

74
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,980
I have said, I like liveliness.

75
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,480
I like my whole family all together and can be reunited in secret.

76
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,670
If you don't take it personally,

77
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,800
I would be happy to tell the authorities.

78
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,230
How your entire family helped me escape and hid me for eleven years.

79
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,410
How you used my mother's garment-making skills to make your fortune!

80
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,250
At that time, I wonder

81
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,020
how they will deal with you.

82
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,850
What do you think?

83
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,230
Do you want to give it a try?

84
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,310
Nonsense. How could they listen to your lies?

85
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,110
Why don’t you try then?

86
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,320
I'm making things up? Don't you forget what happened at the end.

87
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,640
In the end, I was still a child.

88
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,310
Without your help,

89
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,630
I was able to survive and live for eleven years.

90
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,990
Will the authorities believe you,

91
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,300
or what I said?

92
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,260
What do you want to do?

93
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,320
You can't get crazy and make things up to say.

94
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,150
Pulling your father and your younger sister into the deep water!
(T/N: To lead astray)

95
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,310
I won’t tell lies.

96
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,930
But I also want you to see the reality.

97
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,720
Remember.

98
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,870
I've said it, your family and I are still connected by tendons even if the bones are broken.

99
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,890
If you dare to harm me, I won’t let you go.

100
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,280
A newborn calf isn't afraid of the tiger.
(T/N: young people don't have much fear)

101
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,400
If you aren’t afraid of death,

102
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,890
then I don’t mind following you.

103
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,780
Then... Then... Now with the situation,

104
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,010
what do you plan to do?

105
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,750
You go back first.

106
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,830
Let me think about how to solve what is happening right now.

107
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,670
You'd better obediently stay there.

108
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,360
Don’t do anything impulsive out of stress and anger.

109
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,350
And don’t even try to harm me.

110
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,740
A’Ni.

111
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,040
Hurry and go to the Commandant Manor.

112
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,590
Tell Eighth Miss Pei that I am not interested in marriage, and ask them to choose another one.

113
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,320
You can't do that. If you reject Pei Yan, you would have to marry Pei Ruzhuo.

114
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,870
The Duke of Hedong's heir is a famous rogue.

115
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,260
The shopkeeper is right. The spectators truly see things more clearly.

116
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,060
I didn't expect you would also get into trouble.

117
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,610
Why are you still here?

118
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,290
I was thinking that you will need my help.

119
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,780
It seems that I was overthinking.

120
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,760
I will leave now.

121
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,490
Right. If you change your mind,

122
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,390
you can go to the residence of the heir to the Zhongjuan Branch of the Pei family. Find me there.

123
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,350
Goodbye.

124
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,680
So he is the famous disastrous star in Chang'an,

125
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,060
heir to the Zhongjuan Branch of the Pei family, Pei Xingjian.

126
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,900
He is so arrogant. Clearly, he needs my help.

127
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,710
When did it become I'd be needing help from him?

128
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,930
As I see it, just let Shanhu marry into that manor during this mess.

129
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,230
They only said they wanted to marry the Kudi family's daughter.

130
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,260
Husband, you only need to insist that Shanhu is our only daughter.

131
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,570
What can they do about it?

132
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,180
Can they return Shanhu after she is married?

133
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,760
But the person they like isn’t me!

134
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,720
No matter which family I marry into, they will quickly find out.

135
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,380
At that time, how will I behave in front of my husband and my in-laws?

136
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,330
What Shanhu says is still not just a small problem.

137
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,250
There is an even bigger problem.

138
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,900
Whichever family finds they married the wrong person, they will definitely investigate.

139
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,350
If they discover that Liuli is a missing remnant from the death row back then,

140
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,050
then they will drag us down as well.

141
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,520
Liuli this a troublemaker!

142
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,290
She has tied our whole family up.

143
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,270
She is supposed to be dead, but we cannot do anything about it.

144
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,990
It’s fine now. Until when are you still talking about this stuff?

145
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,050
Well, Liuli is also a poor child.

146
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,030
As things are now, we should not enrage her.

147
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:53,290
We should find a way to back out of the wedding engagements first.

148
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,830
But if we backed out of both wedding engagements,

149
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,990
then doesn’t that mean we will offend both families?

150
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,390
But we cannot afford to offend both these families!

151
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,440
Liuli this horrible person! I’m so angry!

152
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,590
[Pei Residence]

153
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,340
Why has the artist come so late?

154
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,240
How did you know that I was going to come?

155
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,800
My young master is never wrong when he speaks.

156
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,960
Young Master has been waiting for a long time. Artist, please come this way.

157
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,740
Young Master, the artist is here.

158
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,370
You can go now.

159
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,260
You came so late.

160
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,580
You must have thought it over several times and found there is no other solution.

161
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,570
That’s why you decided to come and find me, right?

162
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,320
Since you already knew I was coming,

163
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,800
then I’m guessing you don’t need me to say much.

164
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,590
Are you going to help me or not? Please be direct.

165
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,300
Artist is here to ask a favor from me,

166
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,500
but you don’t even have the sincerity to ask me for help.

167
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,330
You are wrong.

168
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:38,790
This artist came here to discuss business with Young Master Pei.

169
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,090
At best, it counts as helping each other out.

170
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,570
Why would I come to ask for an opinion or help?

171
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,890
Fine.

172
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,810
I'd like to hear the details.

173
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:59,570
Amongst the people I know, only Young Master Pei both knows the heir of Duke of Hedong

174
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,020
and Pei Yan from the House of Duwei.

175
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,970
If you could convince them both to give up on their marriage proposal at the same time,

176
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,020
I would promise to tailor a birthday present for your teacher.

177
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,660
Young Master Pei, do you think this is fair?

178
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,390
It doesn't sound bad.

179
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,470
There's just one thing I don't understand.

180
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,930
Since you are a Kudi daughter that grew up out of the way,

181
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,600
why don't you take this opportunity to secure a wealthy husband?

Was my guess wrong?

185
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,500
It looks like he misunderstood from the start.

186
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,600
A bastard is just a bastard.

187
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,370
It's still better than letting him know I escaped from being a medical officer.

188
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,630
That's because I like someone.

189
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,980
So I won't marry anyone.

I don't understand this even more.

191

Since you like someone,

192
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,350
why don't you get married to the one you like

193
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,570
then you could get rid of those two proposals?

194

is my cousin who died not long ago in the palace.

to die at such a young age?

204
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,100
Even though he was young, but he was very promising and had a talent for medicine.

205
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,410
He was praised by the imperial physician and became a medical officer.

206
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:03,550
All these years, he got sick from missing me, so he died in the palace.

208
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:09,110
was the last memory that my cousin left me.

I don't give it to anyone no matter how much money they offer.

Why are you giving me such a precious good?

An artist relies on their fingers' skills to make a living.

00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,320
A high-ranked concubine is still a higher rank.

346
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,400
How dare you, a little servant, be rude to me!

347
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,550
I may be a servant, but I'm a servant sent over by the Duke of Hedong's manor.

348
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,990
Today, if I let a concubine at the Commandant Manor snatch the marriage agreement from me,

349
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,430
then I have wasted 20 years working as a matchmaker.

350
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,110
Both of you, please calm down.

351
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,610
The Kudi family is small and lowly.

352
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,830
We can't afford to offend either one of your households.

353
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,090
If you don't go out yet, your mother won't be able to hold them off.

354
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,130
This courtyard full of betrothal gifts

355
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,850
are all prepared for me, Kudi Shanhu.

356
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,050
Duke of Hedong's manor and Commandant Pei's manor

357
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,190
are both here to compete

358
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,630
to marry me and are almost in a battle.

359
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,530
This must be the most

360
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,710
glorious time in my life.

361
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,700
But I have just reached the summit in my life,

362
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,320
it hasn't even been the time to burn half of an incense stick,
(T/N: half an hour)

363
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,280
I will be falling into the bottomless abyss.

364
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,940
Why? Why?

365
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,430
Hurry!

366
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,260
Shanhu!

367
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,980
Hurry, hurry! Come over here.

368
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,610
Come to greet your auntie and the matchmaker.

369
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,850
Shanhu greets Auntie,

370
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,210
and greets Madam Matchmaker.

371
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,690
Shanhu, you've come at the right time. Tell her!

372
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,160
Didn't you agree to go to the Commandant Manor to matchmake first?

373
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,270
And the proposal from Duke of Hedong's Manor came later?

374
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,960
So what? If a meeting for consideration counts,

375
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,960
why would a document and betrothal gifts be required?

376
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,450
Our Duke of Hedong's Manor came first with the betrothal gift.

377
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,110
According to you then, anyone who wants to marry a wife or a concubine

378
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,740
only needs to barge into someone's family and put down the betrothal gift,

379
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,570
then it will be considered a done deal?

380
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,730
No matter how high-ranking Duke of Hedong's Manor is,

381
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,770
you still wouldn't win this lawsuit.

382
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,830
How dare a mere Commandant Manor boast to filing a lawsuit against the Duke of Hedong's Manor?

383
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,110
Are you afraid that the big wind will twist your tongue?
(T/N: Don't boast too much and get pushed back)

384
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,300
If you really want to, Duke of Hedong's Manor will not be afraid

385
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,350
of meeting Commandant Manor at the Chang'an magistrate's hall.

386
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,960
Put down the gift boxes, let's go!

387
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,550
Wait!

388
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,150
Madam Matchmaker, please wait.

389
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,600
What is it, have you decided to marry into the Duke of Hedong's Manor?

390
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,450
Shanhu, hurry and tell her which one you'll marry.

391
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,600
Kneel.

392
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,730
Auntie, you've been so kindhearted.

393
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,570
I am so grateful.

394
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:10,140
But I have a bad fate and got into such a mess today.

395
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,690
If it turns out to be like what the matchmaker says,

396
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:16,040
these two manors end up in the magistrate's court over marrying a concubine,

397
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,330
wouldn't this become a laughingstock?

398
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,160
At that time, how will Auntie and Madam Matchmaker

399
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,750
have a good explanation for your separate masters?

400
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,850
How is this difficult to explain?

401
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,270
This is a marriage that was already agreed upon between related families.

402
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,800
If it's snatched by an outsider,

403
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,050
that's what's not explainable to the Commandant Manor.

404
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,440
Auntie, think it over carefully.

405
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,480
Pei Yan and Madam Cui have a good relationship.

406
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,070
He was really forced to marry a concubine.

407
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,980
If I am taken into the manor as a concubine because of your help,

408
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,510
Madam Cui will definitely not be pleased with you.

409
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,090
If, because of the lawsuit,

410
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,220
Pei Yan's career as an official is affected,

411
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,670
how will Auntie be viewed

412
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,130
in the manor thereafter?

413
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,230
Very well said. I am different.

414
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,660
Being a matchmaker is my job.

415
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,800
I will fight till the very end.

416
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,320
Madam Matchmaker, the risk you take

417
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,220
may actually exceed that of my auntie's.

418
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,500
What do you mean?

419
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,760
Duke of Hedong's Manor sent you to offer the betrothal gifts, but not only will the marriage be refused,

420
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,540
you even go back with a lawsuit.

421
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,620
Ultimately, if Duke of Hedong's Manor is angry,

422
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,890
your rice bowl will be smashed!
(T/N: You will lose your job!)

423
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:36,740
My good niece, what do you think should be done then?

424
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,290
About today's incident,

425
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,860
neither Auntie nor Madam Matchmaker should be blamed.

426
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,710
Just blame...

427
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,990
Just blame my own bad luck.

428
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,490
Not only that I can't help relieve Father's trouble,

429
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:53,420
I even entangle the family with such a difficult matter.

430
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,770
If we are embroiled in a lawsuit,

431
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,970
I can't even atone for my guilt even with death.

432
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,100
Therefore...

433
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,510
Therefore...

434
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,610
Daughter, just say it then.

435
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,640
Therefore, Shanhu

436
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,950
is a person with poor luck!

437
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,290
I do not deserve to be loved by both manors.

438
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:42,230
Both of your manors are noble families. You meet each other frequently.

439
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,690
Because of me, a person of poor luck,

440
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,690
if you end up to be in enmity,

441
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:49,500
wouldn't it be a loss over something trivial?

442
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,010
Both of your manors want to elevate my daughter, it's too bad

443
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:58,560
that my daughter has bad luck and is not fortunate,

444
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,160
and she is abandoned by both of your manors.

445
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,340
Both of you, what are we to do?

446
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,730
You...

447
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,900
To avoid gossip in the future

448
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,760
leading to damages to the reputation of both manors,

449
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,470
I, Shanhu, will pledge an oath right here.

450
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:29,840
In this whole lifetime,

451
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,070
I will never become a concubine at your manors.

452
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,560
Forget it, forget it then.

453
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:39,220
Our Pei Yan will soon go to his new job.

454
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,730
How can he marry someone

455
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:44,980
who will be so unlucky as to bring a lawsuit?

456
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,060
Duke of Hedong's Manor is such a noble household.

457
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:52,440
How can they marry a woman that is even scorned by the Commandant Manor?

458
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,140
Let's go back, and  I will report to Heir Apparent.

459
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,550
The heir apparent will definitely want to protect the prestige of Duke of Hedong's Manor

460
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,520
and choose another marriage.

461
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,040
I... Auntie...

462
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,600
Madam Matchmaker!

463
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,840
Madam.

464
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,430
Take along the betrothal gifts. Go back to the manor.

465
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,840
Bring the betrothal boxes. We're leaving!

466
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,860
- Stop it.
- I'm so angry.

467
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,460
This feels good.

468
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,040
It is indeed a rare treasure.

469
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:58,170
[Spring Flower]

470
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,590
Master, Ruyi Resist Dye Shop just sent over someone with a message.

471
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:10,030
They said that they'll accept the order of the screen that you want.

472
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:13,930
They also said that you will be satisfied. Otherwise, they won't accept any payment.

473
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:20,830
It appears that porcupine-like artist won't have to marry.

474
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:24,050
Master, you are pleased, so it's because of that?

475
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,540
If she gets married, who will work on the birthday gift for my teacher then?

476
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,370
Will you do it?

477
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,090
Anything else?

478
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,620
No, no.

479
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,370
[Hall of Sunset Pool]

480
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,870
I wonder why Your Highness the Crown Prince is here at the Hall of Sunset Pool?

481
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,310
A'Sheng.

482
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,200
I passed by the imperial garden just now and saw that it needed to be abandoned by its parents.

483
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,380
It fell down the tree and was on the brink of last breaths. Although I saved it,

484
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,360
I don't know how to feed it and raise it.

485
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,950
I wonder if I could ask Talented Lady Wu to take care of it.

486
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,790
Since Your Highness is willing to trust me,

487
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:27,090
just leave it at the Hall of Sunset Pool and keep me company then.

488
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,650
You are so lucky to run into the crown prince.

489
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,360
Your Highness, why don't you bestow it a name?

490
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,430
How about calling it Bao'er?

491
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,230
Bao'er.

492
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,530
Song Tao, hurry and put Bao'er in a warm place.

493
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,190
Feed it some food and water.

494
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:50,060
Remember, be gentle; don't hurt it.

495
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,560
I didn't know that Talented Lady Wu was a female Zhuge.
(T/N: Zhuge Liang was a famous strategist and politician during the Three Kingdoms)

496
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,080
You can actually predict wisely and foresee the consequences.

497
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,900
If I had listened to Talented Lady Wu's advice,

498
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,060
I wouldn't have been in such an awkward embarrassment in the Imperial Study.

499
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,920
Everyone thinks that blood relations are the closest to people.

500
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,990
It's not necessarily so. Just like the cuckoo birds.

501
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,510
Does Your Highness the Crown Prince know what the first thing

502
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,580
- that a cuckoo bird would do once it's hatched?
- What is it?

503
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,690
It's to push all the other eggs out of the nest to fall from the tree to their deaths.

504
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,910
It's to ensure that it will have enough food to grow up.

505
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,620
How could its parents bear seeing their children kill one another like that?

506
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,940
Why can't these young birds live peacefully together?

507
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,440
Isn't it better to help each other and love each other?

508
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,800
Crown Prince, don't forget what Laozi said, "Doing nothing is effective as doing things by following nature's flow."

509
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:06,120
Furthermore, something in this world cannot be shared.

510
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,400
Such as the crown prince's seat,

511
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,890
and the emperor's throne.

512
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,830
Hearing Talented Lady Wu's remarks I can reap a lot of knowledge.

513
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:23,840
The sky is getting darker. I will take my leave.

514
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,600
Crown Prince has high aspirations.

515
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,600
What is the point of gaining a temporary advantage?

516
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,100
It is still not as good as keeping a low profile and seizing the opportunity.

517
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,940
Thank you for your advice, Talented Lady Wu.

518
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,150
Take care, Your Highness.

[Hall of Sunset Pool]

520
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,400
Your Highness, where are you going?

521
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
To clear out everything to His Majesty.

522
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,800
Hasn't Talented Lady Wu just said that you should be keeping a low profile and quietly wait for an opportunity?

523
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,400
You should reflect upon that!

524
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,000
[Hall of Immortal Dew]

525
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,600
Shouldn't I give him a little respect at least?

526
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,800
Eunuch Pan, you didn't know about this.

527
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,600
Even though Physician Dou is only in charge of epidemic prevention,

528
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,400
he has some exquisite embroidery skills.

529
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,200
I finally got ahold of Physician Dou,

530
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,800
but the Courtyard of Misfortune deliberately obstructed

531
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,000
and hid away that person!

532
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,200
Xiao Shunzi must know about what happened.

533
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,600
That's why I want to find out

534
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,200
some insider information from Xiao Shunzi.

535
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,800
This is a token of my appreciation.

536
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,500
Please accept it, Eunuch Pan.

537
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,000
Since it's a token of appreciation from Attire Expert Zhuo,

538
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,200
I will accept it then.

539
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,600
I have another matter to ask.

540
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,200
Speak.

541
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,400
You must not allow Sun Decheng to meet Xiao Shunzi.

542
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,200
Rest assured.

543
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,000
Whatever you lose from Sun Decheng,

544
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,500
I will make it up to you.

545
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,600
Good, good.

546
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,400
Since Xiao Shunzi's case is related to the Bureau of Imperial Attire's official duty,

547
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,600
I will have to handle this affair properly,

548
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,100
and give Xiao Shunzi to Attire Expert Zhuo for questioning.

549
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,600
Thank you, Eunuch Pan.

550
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,700
Eunuch Pan, Sun Decheng of the Courtyard of Misfortune would like to see you.

551
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,000
Tell him that I'm not here.

552
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,600
But...

553
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,800
But he said he has an appointment with you.

554
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,100
There's no such thing.

555
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,400
Go tell him that I will take care of Xiao Shunzi's case justly by following the law.

556
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,700
I will not play favors. Tell him not to bother me day and night.

557
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,000
Yes.

558
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,600
Attire Expert Zhuo,

559
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,600
I will accompany you to the jail right now.

560
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,600
We will question Xiao Shunzi.

561
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,200
No hurry.

562
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,800
Xiao Shunzi is anxiously waiting for his master to save him now.

563
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,400
He probably won't say anything.

564
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,700
Therefore,

565
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,920
the best method is to...

566
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,600
don't ask any question,

567
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,500
just use the harshest torture.

568
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,200
After a day or two,

569
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,000
Xiao Shunzi will know his master can't save him.

570
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,200
If he wants to live, he'll have to obediently

571
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,900
tell me the truth.

572
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,000
Attire Export Zhuo, you are truly smart.

573
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,100
Eunuch Gao, will His Majesty see me?

574
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,790
Crown Prince, it's best that you go back.

575
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,290
Don't make it difficult for this servant.

576
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,700
Why won't His Majesty see me?

577
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,200
The matter over Your Highness's proposal to reform the imperial examination system

578
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,400
has offended many people.

579
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,200
Someone has reported to His Majesty that Your Highness lives an unbridled life

580
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,400
and is addicted to imbibing alcoholic drinks.

581
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,900
When did I ever get addicted to drinking alcohol and living an unbridled life?

582
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,600
How can His Majesty believe in such rumors?

583
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,500
His Majesty has been weak in his health, and he is further obsessed with taking elixir pills.

584
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,800
He is afraid of touching such dirty things as alcohol, that's why he won't see you, Crown Prince.

585
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,600
Your Highness the Crown Prince, you should go back for now.

586
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,800
If your cherished body is hurt, this servant will not be able to withstand it.

587
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,360
Talented Lady Wu.

588
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,800
Please go inside and tell Eunuch Gao

589
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,000
that I will be there just a little late.

590
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,600
Yes.

591
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:52,460
Your Highness the Crown Prince, since you won't listen to advice, why call me?

592
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:57,500
Talented Lady Wu, you told me to keep a low profile and wait for a good opportunity.

593
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,600
But you didn't tell me, what should I be doing now?

594
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,800
Your Highness the Crown Prince, you are young, ambitious, and easily irritated.

595
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,000
Why not go back and copy some scriptures?

596
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,600
For one thing, you can cultivate and nurture your temper.

597
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,000
Secondly, you can sincerely pray for blessings for His Majesty.

598
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,600
Whatever you want to tell His Majesty,

599
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,200
it's better to go back and show him by doing it.

600
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,200
There is the saying that "Sincereity can split open gold and rocks." His Majesty is a wise emperor.

601
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,000
He will sooner or later see how filial Your Highness the Crown Prince is.

602
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
This is what I meant by keeping a low profile to wait for a good opportunity.

603
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,200
Do you understand now, Your Highness?

604
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,800
I'm begging you.

605
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,600
I haven't shut my eyes for two days and two nights.

606
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,600
As long as you tell us where Physician Dou is,

607
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,600
I guarantee that your case will become trivial and you'll be out of trouble.

608
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,800
You won't lose any arms or legs,

609
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,600
and go back to work at the Courtyard of Misfortune.

610
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,290
This Physician Dou...

611
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,600
He is inside the Courtyard of Misfortune.

612
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,950
The day that I was arrested,

613
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,630
I even saw him there.

614
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,000
Fine.

615
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,370
You can continue to bear this responsibility

616
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,400
for your master and Physician Dou.

617
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,800
They are enjoying a good time outside.

618
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,300
Who would remember you?

619
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,400
Master, where are you?

620
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,240
Why haven't you come to save me?

621
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,300
I can't hold on much anymore.

You scared me.

What are you doing in the middle of the night?

627
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,800
Eunuch Sun, you are an important person and busy. I have an urgent plea.

628
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,200
That's why I couldn't help but wait here.

629
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,200
Is it still for the case of your disciple, Xiao Shunzi?

630
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,600
Yes, yes.

631
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,600
Don't worry about that case anymore.

632
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,600
Once the case is thoroughly investigated, I will let him go.

633
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,000
You... It's useless to worry.

634
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,100
Eunuch Pan, Xiao Shunzi is just a lowly eunuch.

635
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,600
Even if he secretly sold goods from outside the palace, the guilty shouldn't be punishable by death.

Sun Decheng, I don't know if you are really muddled or pretending to be muddled.

637
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,200
Originally it wasn't a big crime for Xiao Shunzi to secretly sell private merchandise from outside the palace.

638
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,700
I would have liked to do you a favor and let him go.

639
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:08,000
But you...

640
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,300
You think it over. Who have you offended?
