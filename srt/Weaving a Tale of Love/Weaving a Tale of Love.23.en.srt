[Weaving a Tale of Love]

3
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,990
[Episode 23]

4
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,340
[Hall of Sunset Pool]

5
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,200
Talented Lady Wu, your servant was wrong.

6
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,390
Please punish me severely, Talented Lady.

7
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:13,200
You can punish me however you wish, but just don't kick me out.

8
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,430
Talented Lady Wu, your servant knows wrong.

9
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,050
I should never have betrayed you.

10
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,680
Please, Talented Lady, spare this servant's life.

11
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,910
Song Tao, Talented Lady has treated us well.

12
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,590
How could you have betrayed your mistress?

13
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,490
Talented Lady, I was caught by Consort Yang when I did something wrong.

14
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,260
I was threatened and was forced to work for her.

15
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,890
Even so, if you were loyal,

16
00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:00,100
you should have come to me to deal with the problem, instead of choosing to betray me.

17
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,590
What Talented Lady said is right.

18
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,630
We've stayed by Talented Lady for over ten years and have been her most trusted.

19
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,320
How could you work for Consort Yang and betray Talented Lady?

20
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,530
If Talented Lady weren't smart and noticed the clues,

21
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,790
she would have been trapped by Consort Yang this time because of you.

22
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,110
Sister, you're right to scold me. I was muddled and lost my conscience.

23
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,120
But I don't understand something.

24
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,610
I've been loyal to Talented Lady for over ten years.

25
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,930
How did Talented Lady discover my betrayal?

26
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,680
I originally didn't suspect you.

27
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,110
But lately, you've been paying extra attention to the gown for the Feasts for All Souls Festival and kept asking about it.

28
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,430
I thought it was strange.

29
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,420
Since you want to know, I will tell you.

30
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,860
I think this peony flower's design is the best.

31
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,000
Peony is the king of flowers and its bloom symbolizes fortune.

32
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,590
If Talented Lady chooses this one,

33
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,550
I think we can use the most precious golden silk thread to embroider the peony flower's petals,

34
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,520
and inlay Tian Mountain Jade as leaves

35
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,450
in order to highlight its graceful luxuriance.

36
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,490
I didn't expect that you couldn't wait to go to Consort Yang to report.

37
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:15,490
If Yu Liu hadn't followed you and seen you enter the Hall of Brilliant Joy, I wouldn't have believed it.

38
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,540
I was muddled.

39
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,100
I beg that Talented Lady will consider my service of over ten years.

40
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,600
Spare this servant one time.

41
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,720
I swear that I will be wholeheartedly loyal to Talented Lady from now on.

42
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,300
If I am disloyal again, I will be struck down by heavenly lightening.

43
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,650
Swearing an oath is the most useless thing in the world.

44
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,450
Since you chose to betray me,

45
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,360
then the Hall of Sunset Pool can't keep you.

46
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,510
Considering that you followed me for all these years, I won't be harsh to you.

47
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,610
It's just that our relationship as master and servant is now terminated.

48
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,900
Yu Liu, go to the Directorate of Eunuchs and find Pan Qinhai.

49
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,680
Just say that Song Tao made a mistake in the hall.

50
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,240
Let Pan Qinhai transfer her to somewhere else.

51
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,360
Yes.

52
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,090
Talented Lady wants to kick me out of the Hall of Sunset Pool.

53
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,930
It's the same as killing me.

54
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,020
Consort Yang will believe that I colluded with you to lure her into a trap

55
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,460
and suffered such punishment.

56
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,180
Consort Yang won't let me go easily.

57
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,020
Once I leave the Hall of Sunset Pool, without your protection,

58
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,890
I will only have death as my destination.

59
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,550
Whether Consort Yang will believe you, how you will explain it to her,

60
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,700
and whether you can stay alive, it's all up to your own abilities.

61
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,580
I am not going to keep anyone who is disloyal next to me.

62
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,450
Leave.

63
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,080
Talented Lady. Talented Lady!

64
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,540
Go then.

65
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,460
Yu Liu. Yu Liu, I beg you. Please help me plead to Talented Lady.

66
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,160
Considering the master-servant relationship,

67
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,730
save me! Give me a chance to live.

68
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,320
If you had known about today, why did you do what you did?

69
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,680
Talented Lady didn't beat you to death and is willing to let you go.

70
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,860
It's already very compassionate of Talented Lady.

71
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,390
After you leave the Hall of Sunset Pool, I wish you luck.

72
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,630
Yu Liu. Yu Liu!

73
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,920
Consort Yang, I've asked around.

74
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,920
The crown prince really favors Xiao Douzi all the time.

75
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,080
He frequently gives him rewards and has even summoned him to drink at the East Palace.

76
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,280
This Xiao Douzi originally came from the Courtyard of Misfortune.

77
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,320
His background is lowly. Soon after he arrived at the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

78
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,450
he already became popular with Crown Prince and Talented Lady Wu.

79
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:49,080
I heard that he can speak up to the crown prince even more than Wang Fusheng.

80
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,620
When I first saw Xiao Douzi at the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

81
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,320
I immediately thought that he looked fair-skinned, pretty, and full of schemes.

82
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,470
He is indeed a calculating person.

83
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,990
Who knows what magic potion he's given the crown prince?

84
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,740
Is there any talk in the palace that the crown prince is into males?

85
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,940
I've never heard that.

86
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,010
Talk comes from people telling each other.

87
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,460
I understand what to do then.

88
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,910
Master is still wounded and wanted this disciple to

89
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,670
embroider for Lady Wei in your stead. I dared not slack off

90
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,910
and spent two days to draw this West Market Scene.

91
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,410
Lady Wei...

92
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,350
Lady Wei likes the folk scene.

93
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,830
It will be most appropriate to use this scene to make a table screen.

94
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,190
This drawing is quite good.

95
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,310
What embroidery technique do you plan to use?

96
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,240
A table screen is a small scene that has enough details to see the big picture.

97
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,920
Therefore, it's most suitable to use the Wuxi's fine embroidery technique.

98
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,230
It's just that my skill is limited.

99
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,960
Please teach me how to sew in the fine embroidery technique.

100
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,070
Fine embroidery isn't only about your skill,

101
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:17,250
it's also about your talent. You can't learn it quickly.

102
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,500
When you try to cram at the last moment,

103
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,420
it'll just be useless. You'll waste your effort for nothing.

104
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,910
You may as well change to another scene when you can.

105
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,270
It'll be more practical.

106
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,270
She is back.

107
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,370
Yes.

108
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,420
I told you. She definitely wouldn't teach it.

109
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,270
Really? She really won't?

110
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,820
She looks pitiful.

111
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,380
What pitiful? She is not talented. Why teach her?

112
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,900
That's right.

113
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,150
Look at her.

114
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,850
Yan'er, come here.

115
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,580
I already said so. Attire Expert Zhuo would not teach her.

116
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,430
It's hard for Sister Qiniang.

117
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,760
You've actually condensed all the views in the West Market into a small scene.

118
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,800
Indeed, only the technique of fine embroidery can make it work.

119
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,210
There is an old proverb, "Teach the disciple, the master will starve."

120
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,570
Attire Expert Zhuo is willing to accept Qiniang as a disciple.

121
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,080
It is, first of all, because of pressure from Attire Chief Lin

122
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,460
to have people inherit the dressmaking skills.

123
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,070
Secondly, it's because Qiniang is a nice person and knows how to serve.

124
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,860
Yes, that's true.

125
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,840
Have you all heard of talk about Xiao Douzi?

126
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,130
- Yes, I've heard.
- How dare you talk about filthy rumors?

127
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,090
It involves the crown prince. Aren't you afraid of losing your heads?

128
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,410
Sister Qiniang.

129
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,690
Master won't teach me. I can't help it, either.

130
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,190
So people are laughing at me.

131
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,230
You respect her as Master, that's why you serve her well.

132
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,020
How can people laugh at you?

133
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,810
It's Attire Expert Zhuo who is narrow-minded.

134
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,580
She is afraid of disciples that will surpass her.

135
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,640
If anyone is laughing, they should laugh at her!

136
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,220
We can't totally blame Master as narrow-minded.

137
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,280
Probably I'm just lacking natural talents,

138
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,950
so Master won't teach me.

139
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,010
Don't cry anymore.

140
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,680
This is for you.

141
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,970
I previously promised to give you a gift.

142
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:14,110
I've been too busy at the Bureau of Imperial Attire for the Feasts for All Souls Festival, so I just finished it.

143
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,870
Thank you.

144
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,110
You didn't have to hurry so. I know that it's been busy at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

145
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,340
Don't get so tired and hurt your eyes.

146
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,390
That's right. I rushed to complete it despite being busy.

147
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,480
You must praise me.

148
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,120
Sure, I praise you.

149
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,510
But you shouldn't make sleeping garments for other people anymore.

150
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,460
Why?

151
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,010
Because men and women are different.

152
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,930
Besides, men and women should stay apart.

153
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,010
The sleeping garment is something that touches the body.

154
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,970
Then I'm not giving this to you.

155
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,850
You just said that men and women are different. Men and women cannot touch. You are a man, so, of course, I can't give it to you.

156
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,480
- I am not a man...
- You are not a man?

157
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,710
I am a man, but...

158
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,100
You are not a man? Is my eyesight bad?

159
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,200
Fine.

160
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,710
Should I prove it then?

161
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,930
Let's prove whether I'm really a man.

162
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,720
No... No need.

163
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,150
If the target is you,

164
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,340
I'm quite happy to do it.

165
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,670
I'm wrong then. You are not a man.

166
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,290
You are a saint, a gentleman.

167
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,930
It seems that if I don't teach you a lesson,

168
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,520
you won't learn.

169
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,630
I'll let you know

170
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,690
how frightening men are.

171
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,890
I-I know I am wrong.

174
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,590
Why not hurry and greet Eunuch Wang yet?

175
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,690
Xiao Linzi greets Eunuch Wang.

176
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,830
- This one is...
- This is my foster son.

177
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,190
Since childhood, he has had white teeth and red lips.

178
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,980
He looks even more adorable than a little girl.

179
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,640
Just look at how cute he is.

180
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,560
Crown Prince will definitely like him.

181
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,440
I heard that the crown prince happens to

182
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,420
need a little eunuch in his study.

183
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,480
What about him...

184
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,420
Eunuch Jiang, this is not choosing a concubine for the crown prince.

185
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,500
What's the use of having a cute face?

186
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,150
We servants must have good character,

187
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,970

188
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,860
Besides, the Directorate of Eunuchs has already picked someone.

189
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,090
Eunuch Jiang, please go back.

190
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,380
- I...
- Please go back.

191
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,560

[Reserved Peace and Calm]

193
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,410
Yu Liu, wait outside.

194
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,480
- I need to discuss an urgent matter with the crown prince.
- Yes.

195
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,400
- Shulan, you can leave, too.
- Yes.

196
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,910
- Your Highness, I—
- You don't need to leave.

197
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,440
Yes.

198
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,430
I wonder what's so urgent with Talented Lady Wu?

199
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,300
Lately, there have been many rumors about Your Highness.

200
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,090
They are extremely ludicrous.

201
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,400
I originally just wanted to ignore them.

202
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,730
But these rumors have become more and more fierce.

203
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,230
That's why I disregarded being abrupt and came over to remind you.

204
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,650
Rumors about me?

205
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,770
Lately, there are many talks in the palace

206
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,590
that Your Highness is interested in males. The rumors are detailed,

207
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,120
and even say Your Highness protects that person

208
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,030
and often summons him to the East Palace to meet secretly.

209
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:25,660
I thought about it and realized it's probably hinting at Your Highness and Xiao Douzi.

210
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,660
This kind of baseless rumor should be ignored.

211
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,840
How can Your Highness laugh about it?

212
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,730
People's talk can melt gold. One should fear rumors.

213
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,230
Your Highness should be cautious and not be careless.

214
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,970
Talented Lady Wu is right.

215
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,350
Your Highness, the crown prince, please be cautious.

216
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,730
I've been wondering why there have been many young and cute eunuchs

217
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,640
volunteering themselves to work at the East Palace.

218
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,490
It must be because of the rumors. If I had known they came for this,

219
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,770
I would have slapped them for believing in this ridiculous rumor.

220
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,790
An upright person does not fear a slanted shadow.

221
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,670
If I am in a hurry to refute the rumors, then it would seem like there is something real to it.

222
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,960
A'Sheng, tell the Directorate of Eunuchs.

223
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,760
After the opening is filled in the study, we won't need any more help in the East Palace

224
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,740
to avoid people getting bad ideas.

225
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,330
Yes.

226
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,190
Even though some rumors will be reduced this way,

227
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,960
but the one Your Highness the Crown Prince should avoid to prevent suspicion is... Xiao Douzi.

228
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,110
I like Xiao Douzi because he is capable and very loyal.

229
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,530
If I keep him away because of these ridiculous rumors,

230
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,720
won't it disappoint people who are loyal to me?

231
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,280
Your Highness is the heir to the throne and you will do great things.

232
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,440
If you are hurt by these baseless rumors,

233
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,800
isn't it a waste?

234
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,100
If one wishes to make a false charge, there is no shortage of excuses.

235
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,430
If I try to deliberately avoid suspicions, they will probably say I'm hiding.

236
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,280
Besides, I happen to want to discuss something with Xiao Douzi these days.

237
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,870
I won't let the rumors stop me from what I need to do.

238
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,860
- But Your Highness—
- Talented Lady Wu, no need to keep dissuading me.

239
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,280
I know what to do.

240
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,780
What is this?

241
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,600
Your Majesty, this is ginseng soup that was personally brewed by Consort Yang.

242
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,670
Didn't I already say? I don't need her to get up every morning to brew the ginseng soup for me.

243
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,120
Your Majesty, I told her

244
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,140
but I couldn't convince her.

245
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,510
Your Majesty, Consort Yang also sends people here every day

246
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,910
to ask if Your Majesty is eating well and sleeping soundly.

247
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,250
Mother seems to be in better spirits and will come out for a relaxing stroll.

248
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,890
I'm very pleased.

249
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,350

250
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,200
to brew herbal supplement soup for your imperial father for a month.

251
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,790
Your imperial father has finally allayed his anger.

252
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:11,000
The Feast for All Souls Festival's incident has finally subsided.

253
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,020
The talk that the crown prince is into males has already spread to your imperial father.

254
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,790
What does Imperial Father say? Is he angry?

255
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,070
Your imperial father came to the Hall of Briliant Joy yesterday,

256
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,160
looking very worried and absent-minded.

257
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,850
He even asked me by beating around the bush

258
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,180
whether I had heard of any rumors that were negative against the crown prince.

259
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:37,080
I just pretended that I didn't understand and even praised the crown prince some.

260

Ming'er, you must remember this.

261
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,000
Don't let any of the rumors regarding the crown prince

262
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,550
spread from our place to your imperial father

263
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:49,820
to prevent him from suspecting our intentions.

264
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,980
But rumors won't be enough to topple the crown prince.

265
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,000
If we want to substantiate the rumors, we must let Imperial Father see the crown prince in an embarrassing state.

266
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,010
At that time, let's see if he can still protect his seat as the crown prince?

Shouyue? Why are you still here?

268
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,090

Your Highness, you have been summoning Xiao Douzi a little too frequently in recent times.

272

I'm afraid there'll be more rumors and Your Highness will be hurt.

00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,200
A'Sheng, can you do what Xiao Douzi does?

274
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,450
- I... I can't do it.
- Since you can't do it, why keep nagging?

275
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,620
If you could do it, then I wouldn't have asked him.

The crown prince shouldn't be looking for you these days, right?

Perhaps he has something else to ask me to do?

00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,060
I've been finding it strange, too.

341
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,490
Zhi'er has always been cautious in his words and behavior.

342
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,300
Why have these rumors come from nowhere?

343
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,570
Your Majesty, Prince of Cao is here to greet you.

344
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,660
This son and subordinate greets Your Majesty.

345
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,190
Greetings, Mother.

346
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,580
Ming'er, you may rise.

347
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,360
Thank you, Your Majesty.

348
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,000
Mother, haven't you gone to the East Palace?

349
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,920
Beloved Consort, why are you going to the East Palace?

350
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,550
Replying to Your Majesty.

351
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:16,010
Mother said that the weather has been too hot and Your Majesty's appetite hasn't been good.

352
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,210
There is a wonderful lily pond in the East Palace.

353
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,040
Mother wanted to pick some lotus seeds herself

354
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,370
to make lotus cakes for Your Majesty in order to reduce the heat.

355
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,290
Beloved Consort, you are thoughtful.

356
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:34,570
Right now, it is the time when the lotus flowers are blooming and the lotus seeds are ripe.

357
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,840
I want to go take a walk outside, too.

358
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,620
It's better to be spontaneous when selecting a day.

359
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,650
I'll go with my beloved consort to the East Palace

360
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:44,450
to view the lotus flowers and pick the lotus seeds. How about it?

361
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,470
With Your Majesty by my side, it's my best wish fulfilled.

362
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,020
Ming'er, you can come with us.

363
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,950
Yes.

364
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,830
Your Highness, I suddenly feel uncomfortable and weakness in my limbs.

365
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,850
My face is hot and the heart is thumping. Why don't I take the drawing back,

366
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,670
and bring it back once I've finished it?

367
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,200
Should I summon the imperial physician for you?

368
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,110
I just feel discomfort. I'll be fine after I go back and lie down for a while.

369
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,690
Imperial Guard Leader.

370
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,490
I want to see His Highness. Please announce it.

371
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,170
His Highness is busy and shouldn't be disturbed.

372
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,820
Please come back later, Imperial Guard Leader.

373
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,990
Just rest here then.

374
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,750
Your Highness is joking.

375
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,790
How would I dare to take a rest here?

376
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,570
There's no outsider here.

377
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,270
I say you can rest here, then you can rest here.

378
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:21,180
I suddenly feel... feel better. It's fine now.

379
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,840
It's just that I feel really thirsty.

380
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,070
Will Your Highness bestow a cup of water to me?

381
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:32,040
Yuan Lang! Yuan Lang!

382
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,950
I have something urgent to report. It'll be delayed if not reported now. Please announce it now.

383
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:40,060
Your Highness has ordered that no one can disturb him. Please go back.

384
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:00,630
Talented Lady, didn't you go for a stroll in the garden to relax?

385
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,640
I couldn't find you after looking twice.

386
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,830
I see that the weather is good, so I walked more.

387
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,640
I didn't rest inside the garden.

388
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,750
Why are you looking for me?

389
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,140
Imperial Guard Leader just came by. He originally wanted to wait here for you,

390
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,770
but he was restless and wouldn't say what it was about.

391
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:23,560
Eventually, he left with a message asking that Talented Lady visit the East Palace.

392
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,020
East Palace? How long ago was this?

393
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,210
About an hour ago.

394
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,430
Eunuch Wang,

395
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,540
are His Highness and Xiao Douzi still inside?

396
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,660
- Yes.
- All right.

397
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:53,260
His Highness said not to disturb him. Eunuch Wang, just leave this here and I'll take it inside.

398
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,300
- Move aside.
- Yes.

399
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,130
Unruly.

400
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,030
Yuan Lang.

401
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,130
You don't need to serve here anymore. Leave now!

402
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,100
- But—
- Quit wasting time! Just go.

403
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,370
Go!

404
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,950
Yes.

405
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,360
Come back.

406
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:39,490
Do not tell anyone that His Highness and Xiao Douzi are in the Hall of Esteemed Virtues. Understand?

407
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,080
- Yes, I understand.
- Go!

408
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,960
[Proclaiming Brightness Gate]

409
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,850
I didn't know that Your Majesty and Consort Yang were coming to the East Palace.

410
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,720
I will go tell the crown prince now.

411
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,420
Wait.

412
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,810
His Majesty and Mother rarely come to the East Palace. The crown prince must not have expected them.

413
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:32,910
Why don't we just go on in and give the crown prince a pleasant surprise?

414
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,820
What do you think, Your Majesty?

415
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:39,170
I also want to see what the crown prince is busy doing.

416
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,980
No need to report to the crown prince then.

417
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,690
It's just... that it's not sufficient decorum.

418
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:47,090
No problem. What is the crown prince doing?

419
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,330
Crown Prince is reading... in the Hall of Esteemed Virtues.

420
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,420
- Why are you dawdling? Hurry and lead the way.
- Yes.

421
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,380
Talented Lady Wu.

422
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,290
You are?

423
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,750
I am Wu Kun, Deputy Imperial Guard Leader.

424
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,370
I was ordered to wait for Talented Lady Wu here. It's urgent.

425
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,330
Please follow me through the side door.

426
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,770
[Hall of Esteemed Virtues]

427
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,380
Why are you stopping?

428
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,290
Your Highness, I wasn't with the crown prince just now.

429
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:52,260
So I don't know for sure where the crown prince is now.

430
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,550
Why don't Your Majesty and Consort Yang rest in a side hall?

431
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,990
I'll go find the crown prince.

432
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:04,290
Your Majesty, Wang Fusheng is the closest personal eunuch to the crown prince.

433
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,770
How could he not know where the crown prince is?

434
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:09,970
This is clearly a lie.

435
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:13,330
Wang Fusheng, you seem to be hiding something.

436
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:17,800
It will make His Majesty think there is something unseemly with the crown prince.

437
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,240
It will actually hurt His Highness the Crown Prince.

438
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,990
Your Majesty, forgive me. Consort Yang, forgive me.

439
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,490
Speak. Where is the crown prince? What is he doing?

440
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,310
Why don't you lead me to him?

441
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,120
I dare not lie to Your Majesty.

442
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,110
It's just that the crown prince has repeatedly reminded me

443
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,430
not to let anyone know about this matter.

444
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:41,240
Especially, not to let Your Majesty know.

445
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,690
I am not hiding from you. Your Majesty, please judge wisely.

446
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,980
- Immediately take me to see the crown prince!
- Yes.

447
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:51,940
Please follow me, Your Majesty and Consort Yang. The crown prince is in the back garden.

448
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,840
Wang Fusheng, didn't you say the crown prince was inside the Hall of Esteemed Virtues?

449
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,090
No, no, no, the crown prince isn't inside the Hall of Esteemed Virtues.

450
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,230
- The crown prince is in the back garden.
- How dare you!

451
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,630
You dare to lie to His Majesty.

452
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:05,520
The crown prince is really in the back garden.

453
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,400
Your Majesty, what are they doing?

454
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,490
You live a pampered life, no wonder you don't know this.

455
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:37,480
They are reeling silk threads. Back then, Empress Zhangsun

456
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,990
personally led people to do it.

457
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:45,000
Is that Zhi'er?

458
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,530
Replying to Your Majesty. That person who is working there is indeed His Highness the Crown Prince.

459
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:05,790
Your Majesty personally arrived at the East Palace and I didn't get to welcome you. Please forgive me.

460
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:10,980
I came to your place to view the lotus flowers, and originally I wanted to give you a pleasant surprise.

461
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,580
I didn't expect to be the one to be pleasantly surprised.

462
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,620
Zhi'er, you are usually weak physically.

463
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,670
Why are you personally raising silkworms and reeling silk threads?

464
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,630
And deliberately did not let me know and were hiding it from me?

465
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:27,180
I am preparing a gift for Your Majesty's birthday this year.

466
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,910
- My birthday gift?
- I've prepared for several months.

467
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:34,100
I've told my subordinates not to say a word.

468
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,170
I didn't know that Your Majesty would still find out.

469
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:41,960
Royal Older Brother, where is the birthday gift?

470
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:49,570
Does Your Majesty remember, when Royal Mother was alive, she used to raise silkworms, reel silk threads,

471
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:54,130
and weave into silk fabrics in order to show the importance of sericulture?

472
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:57,320
After Royal Mother's death, Royal Father has missed mother greatly

473
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,730
and often visited the Hall of Establishing State to take a look at Mother's weaving frame.

474
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,080
That's true.

475
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,530
You were still a child at that time.

476
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,350
I was still young.

477
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,670
When your mother was raising silkworms and reeling silk threads,

478
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,320
we used to go help frequently.

479
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,160
I also often reminisce about that happy and joyful past.

480
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,860
That's why I have gathered the household to raise silkworms and reel silk threads.

481
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,440
Then let the princess consort weave into silk fabric,

482
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,560
then sew the fabric into clothes to present to Your Majesty.

483
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,810
This is a token of my filial piety to Your Majesty.

484
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:51,530
I hope that I can also comfort Your Majesty's yearning for Imperial Mother.

485
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:08,200
I have been worrying about you.

486
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,160
Too much kindness, not enough toughness.

487
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,720
I think I've worried too much.

488
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:24,200
As crown prince, my son knows the value of setting an example by doing,

489
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,790
and also knows to remember filial piety.

490
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,440
I am very gratified.

491
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:48,490
Your Majesty, I heard that the technique in weaving silk fabric is complicated.

492
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,770
I didn't know that Crown Princess Consort was so capable.

493
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:55,390
I would like to take a look myself.

494
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,110
Your Highness the Crown Prince!

495
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,850
Your Highness the Crown Prince!

496
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,900
Eunuch Yuan, why are you so careless? Are you all right?

497
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,960
It's nothing. But Imperial Guard Leader is a step late.

498
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,160
His Highness the Crown Prince has already left.

499
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:09,010
- Greetings, Your Majesty. Greetings, Consort Yang.
- Greetings, Your Majesty. Greetings, Consort Yang.

500
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,770
Meiniang, why are you here?

501
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,850
I came to the East Palace to learn how to weave silk fabric.

502
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:19,140
If I can weave and sew with my own hands, compared to putting on rouge and powder, teasing cats and dogs

503
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,950
in the palace, this is much more interesting.

504
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,140
Well said.

505
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,630
Your Majesty.

506
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:57,300
This silk fabric is woven with the silk threads made from the silkworms raised by Crown Prince.

507
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,420
Please look, Your Majesty.

508
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:08,860
This fabric is soft and smooth.

509
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,520
Very high quality.

510
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:16,890
Crown Princess Consort, where did you learn this weaving skill?

511
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:21,540
Replying to Your Majesty. I asked Xiao Douzi of the Bureau of Imperial Attire to teach them.

512
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,810
Xiao Douzi?

513
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:27,330
Your Majesty, this Xiao Douzi is the one

514
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:30,090
rumored to be favored by Crown Prince.

515
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,300
Is Xiao Douzi here?

516
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:43,530
[Enlighten]

517
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,510
Xiao Douzi kneels to greet Your Majesty.

518
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:50,500
Raise your head.

519
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,560
Does Your Majesty still remember the Feast for All Souls Festival?

520
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,470
The one who made the gown for the late empress is this Xiao Douzi.

521
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:21,800
Recently, the womenfolk in the East Palace and I have wanted to learn some dressmaking skills,

522
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,830
so we asked him to come here. Probably because we are too used to bing served,

523
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,070
we learn one thing today and we forget it tomorrow.

524
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,330
Xiao Douzi, however, is very patient.

525
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:35,530
He keeps coming to the East Palace. It's truly hard for him.

526
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:38,210
Replying to Your Majesty. Talented Lady Wu is humble.

527
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:40,690
The silk weaving technique is very complicated.

528
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:43,430
The ladies are naturally smart and are also diligent.

529
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:47,400
That's why they have learned in such a short time. It's really not easy.

530
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,410
A'Quan.

531
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:55,230
Present.
