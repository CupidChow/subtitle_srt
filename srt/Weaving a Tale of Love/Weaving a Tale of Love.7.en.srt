[Episode 7]

4
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,140
Your Highness the Crown Prince, excuse this old minister for speaking straightforwardly.

5
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,030
The imperial exam system is the foundation of the nation.

6
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,380
It's an important event for the country to search of talented people.

7
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,940
Furthermore, Your Majesty's health is weak

8
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,890
and you need a lot of rest. So I hope Crown Prince won't' be too anxious.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,130
Minister Fang has a point.

10
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,920
Some things, we have to be patient with.

11
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,340
To me, nowadays Crown Prince

12
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,040
has been impatient.

13
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,710
While His Majesty is sick, his mood is naturally unstable and irritable.

14
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,640
I hope Your Highness won't discuss too much about state affairs and perform more acts in filial piety.

15
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,070
Your Majesty, His Highness the Crown Prince has grand aspirations and is very interested in state affairs.

16
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,040
This son and subordinate cannot compare with His Highness the Crown Prince.

17
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,600
I see that Your Majesty is not feeling well.

18
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,990
All I worry about is Your Majesty, and I can't care about anything else.

19
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,780
Filial piety is the foremost among all virtues.

20
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,660
Ming'er is so filial. I feel very grateful.

21
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,890
Attire Expert Zhou, slow down.

22
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,810
Attire Expert Zhou, please listen to me.

23
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,930
Attire Expert Zhou, Eunuch Sun is really not here.

24
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,510
Attire Expert Zhou.

25
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,040
Is Sun Decheng purposely avoiding me?

26
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,460
If Attire Expert Zhou doesn't believe me, you can take a look.

27
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,760
Attire Expert Zhou, Eunuch Sun is really not here.

28
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,370
Eunuch Sun is not here

29
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,790
then you get Physician Dou for me.

30
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,780
Let him come to the Bureau of Imperial Attire with me.

31
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,430
To be honest, we haven't seen Physician Dou for a few days.

32
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,680
If Attire Expert Zhou has seen him,

33
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,880
I beg you to inform me.

34
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,430
How dare you!

35
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,150
Taking me for a fool!

36
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,360
Fine.

37
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,170
I want to see

38
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,210
where you can hide Physician Dou

39
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,340
and until when!

42
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,040
Servant Wei Lin sends my greetings.

43
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,940
It's you?

44
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,500
I boldly ask if Attire Expert Zhou

45
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,160
is here for Physician Dou?

46
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,540
You know where he is?

47
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,430
To answer Attire Expert Zhou.

48
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,430
Soon after the Directorate of Eunuchs sent over the transfer order, Physician Dou disappeared.

49
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,790
I thought he was mad at Sun Decheng

50
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,440
and left for the Bureau of Imperial Attire by himself.

51
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,580
At that time, I don't take notice.

52
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,790
Until Attire Expert Zhou sent people looking for him,

53
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,410
everyone was nervous

54
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,210
and searched the entire place,

55
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,080
even searched coffins.

56
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,840
But they didn't find anyone.

57
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,070
I've heard enough of this!

58
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,000
But I think there is something up.

59
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,920
This place is not a very convenient place to talk.

60
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,210
Come with me.

61
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,540
Yes.

63
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,710
There is no one around. You can talk now.

64
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,690
Physician Dou's disappearance,

65
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,760
what is weird about it?

66
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,710
To answer Attire Expert Zhou.

67
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,960
Physician Dou is Sun DeCheng's foster child.

68
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,840
Sun Decheng's favorite. This is what I know.

69
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,980
But a few days ago, Sun Decheng

70
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,320
suddenly wanted to kick him out of the palace.

71
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,450
Since then, Physician Dou has been missing.

72
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,540
People in the courtyard were curious.

73
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,030
Why did Sun Decheng

74
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,130
only thinks about saving Xiao Shunzi?

75
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,350
Attire Expert Zhou, please think...

76
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,870
Somewhere in this situation, there must be something strange.

77
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,020
Do you mean...

78
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,600
Sun Decheng didn't actually kick Xiao Douzi out,

79
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,620
but found a reason to

80
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,750
purposely released him from the palace?

81
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,390
What evidence do you have to prove that happened?

82
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,540
Right now, I don't.

83
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,010
But finding evidence may not be that hard.

84
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,030
Tell me about it.

85
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,550
At the courtyard, Physician Dou and Xiao Shunzi have a good relationship.

86
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,660
Xiao Shunzi is Sun Decheng's disciple.

87
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,470
If there is something on, Xiao Shunzi would know about it.

88
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,900
He might be an accomplice.

89
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,460
Xiao Shunzi is being held by the court.

90
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,800
Whether or not he can speak the truth,

91
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,690
depends on Attire Expert Zhou.

Previously, I had offended an official and was degraded to the courtyard.

To earn the praise of Attire Expert Zhou,

99
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,040
then I am willing to work for you.

Sure, I'll remember you.

she has easily made such a dress.

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,680
When my older sister puts it on tomorrow, she won't be overshadowed by those younger women.

I can take her measurements

and custom-make some fitting clothes for her.

119

Why don't we invite Miss Yu'er to come over and meet Sister-in-Law?

125

By that time, Sister-in-Law will have already seen this dress.

00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,330
A little artist like you shouldn't denigrate me.

178
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,510
I gave you advice but you wouldn't listen.

179
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,370
Don't regret it later.

180
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,360
You can't even afford to wear an acceptable peony flower.

181
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,550
And you even dare to come and find a partner?

182
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,680
Don't lose your teeth from being laughed at!

183
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,220
- Let's go and have a look over there.
- Let's go

184
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,920
- This is a really nice place.
- Yes, so imposing.

185
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,870
- It's your turn.
- I'll make this move.

186
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,360
Watch me throw this arrow.

187
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,780
- Young Master Pei, please.
- Please.

188
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,360
Please.

189
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,070
My Lady, Eighth Miss, asked me to tell you,

190
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,880
that she and Madam will be coming shortly.

191
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,400
Please wait here for a little.

192
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,830
I want to ask you for a favor.

193
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,080
Please say.

194
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,850
Madam asked this servant to tell Master

195
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,150
that she invited a few young ladies from noble families today.

196
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,450
They are playing games in the rotunda downstairs.

197
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:34,820
If Master and the young masters here want to drink wine and compose poems, why not use this theme?

198
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,510
Therefore, it's two birds with one stone.

199
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:41,420
The young ladies can also get to read the masterpieces written by these young masters here.

200
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,150
Of the three unfilial acts, not having children is the worst.

201
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:53,030
As the first-born son, I am responsible for having heirs to carry on the family name.

202
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:57,000
That's why my family is forcing me to marry a concubine. I feel really helpless.

203
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,780
On the other hand, Brother Shouyue is older than I am.

204
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,770
Don't you need to marry again after your wife passed away?

205
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,720
Me?

206
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,650
Among all the good daughters in Chang'an,

207
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,680
who wants me, Pei Xingjian, an unlucky disaster?

208
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,940
Brother Shouyue.

209
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,090
Come and look.

210
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,350
This... How could there be such a coincidental matter?

211
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,000
Look at this. Their clothes are exactly the same.

212
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,300
How can there be such a coincidence?

213
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,630
- They are the same.
- Yes, the same.

214
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,090
Look at her. It’s making me laugh to death.

215
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,390
It's Dong Shi imitating Xi Shi.
(T/N: ancient idiom about the ugly Dong Shi who tries to mimic the beautiful Xi Shi)

216
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,280
- Does she even understand?
- Exactly.

217
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,140
- Exactly!
- Even the hair pins are the same.

218
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,850
- Isn’t it?
- Look at her

219
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,220
It's exactly the same.

220
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,640
Nanny Yan, who is that madam?

221
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,870
She is the main madam of the Pei family.

222
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,060
The wife of Pei Yan.

223
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,990
Who is that lady who doesn’t understand anything? Who invited her over?

224
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,760
She is Madam Kudi's niece. She’s from the same family as Kudi Yanzhong.

225
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,230
Who cares who her relatives are!

226
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,400
She sees that she is wearing the same dress as the madam of the manor, but she still won't leave yet.

227
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,520
She will certainly be an arrogant, improper mistress.

228
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,130
She cannot enter our Pei family door.

229
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,330
Yu'er greets Madam.

230
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,620
I don’t know whether Madam likes this dress?

231
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,690
You can even ask!

232
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,770
Older Sister was just praising this dress, but what is happening about that?

233
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,040
How could her dress be seen all over the place?

234
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,380
You should give me an explanation!

235
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,180
She is the daughter of the owner of Caoji Resist Dye Shop.

236
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,340
She often comes to our shop and gossips.

237
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,060
I am thinking that she saw the drawings of the clothes that I was making for Madam.

238
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,330
She really liked it and decided to learn how to make it and wear it.

239
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,480
Most of the popular dresses in Chang'an

240
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,440
look similar.

241
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,120
If it is pretty, then there will be people who come and wear it.

242
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,530
Never mind. It isn’t something too bad either.

243
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,840
I’ll just change into something else.

244
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,040
Sister-in-Law, how can you be so good-natured?

245
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,820
Today, it's your clothes; tomorrow, it will be your husband!

246
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,640
Madam, you do not need to be so rushed. What you just said earlier, only half is correct.

247
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,280
And?

248
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,930
Pretty clothes are worn and adored by people.

249
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,030
They can choose the clothes, but cannot choose their demeanor and aura around them.

250
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,600
Please come to the rotunda with me.

251
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,760
I will custom measure and make it for you

252
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,150
a dress that is incomparable in the world.

253
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,470
What are they doing? Competing on flowers,

254
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,950
and they have really carried out the flower pots?

255
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,010
Artist, here are the flowers you asked me to bring over.

256
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,640
This pot is called Ink Jade, and was bought especially for me by my husband.

257
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,440
There have only been three that have bloomed. The largest out of the three

258
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,920
has already been taken and used as a hairpin for the Flower Pageant.

259
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,110
But you have gotten people to bring one over.

260
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,460
What is the meaning of this?

261
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,210
I will pick another Ink Jade flower for your dress.

262
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,010
You want to use a flower to make clothes?

263
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,480
This dress was custom-designed for today's flower pageant.

264
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,630
I didn’t know what flower Madam would be wearing,

265
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,370
so the dress is only half-finished.

266
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,860
[The Meaning of Justice]

267
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,820
Zilong, look at that Hu woman who isn't wearing a flower in her hair.

268
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,440
She is the one who angered Ruzhou at Da Ci'en Temple that day.

269
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,790
That heir to Duke of Hedong has always been a rampant tyrant.

270
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,550
He didn't get his way?

271
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,060
Quick. Tell us.

272
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,940
What are you doing? Do you realize how expensive this pot of Ink Jade is?

273
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,400
How expensive it is is not so important.

274
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,650
Flowers have a price, but love is priceless.

275
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,960
My brother used lots of energy and time to get that for my sister-in-law!

276
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,380
That Hu woman is indeed an unusual person.

277
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,230
If I had such a female confidante,

278
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,380
studying would not be so boring.

279
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,710
Look. What is that young lady doing?

280
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,610
- It's done.
- So pretty.

281
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,640
I want to try doing it, too.

282
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,560
It is indeed an incomparable dress.

283
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,050
Ruyi Resist Dye Shop's craftsmanship

284
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,030
is really the best in the entire Chang'an City.

285
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:13,720
Caoji Resist Dye Shop claims to have inherited the skill of the Number One Needle in the World,

286
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,390
but turns out it only knows to steal from other people's designs.

287
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,670
And it only copied partially.

288
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,640
They say that Caoji Reist Dye Shop inherited from the Number One Needle of the World.

289
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,840
But they don't know there is a great misunderstanding.

290
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,800
What do you mean?

291
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,850
From what I know, Attire Expert An never accepted any disciples among the civilians.

292
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,610
Nonsense!

293
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,870
Regarding relationships, the owner of Ruyi Resist Dye Shop's owner, An Silang,

294
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,310
is the maternal older brother of the Number One Needle in the World, Attire Expert An.

295
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,240
They are brother and sister,

296
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,920
but the brother doesn't even use his sister's name to do business.

297
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,310
I wonder what Caoji Resist Dye Shop relies on?

298
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,310
Well said. From now on, the Pei Manor's clothes

299
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,290
will be entrusted to Ruyi Resist Dye Shop.

300
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,550
Ruly Resist Dye Shop will not disappoint you.

301
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,290
Madam, what are you doing?

302
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,030
This isn't proper. How can I wear the same flower as Madam?

303
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,670
It's nothing improper.

304
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,860
A pretty flower to match a poised young lady.

305
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,220
This is a great match. I want you

306
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,570
to stay at the flower pageant and enjoy the fun.

307
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:38,390
Keeping company with Eighth Miss and Miss Yu.

308
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,180
Thank you, Madam, for your kind thoughts.

309
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,150
So pretty.

310
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,950
Pei Xingjian? Such bad luck.

311
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,160
Why is he everywhere?

312
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,730
Looking at this situation, could Madam Cui be interested in me?

313
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,050
I don't want to get mixed up in this mess.

314
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,930
I must find a way to get out of here.

315
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,840
Zilong, I noticed your gaze when you were looking at that woman.

316
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,090
Are you interested?

317
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,830
She is prettier than the flower and smarter than many people.

318
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,800
This kind of woman is very rare.

319
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,480
Zilong, don't miss this chance.

320
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,280
Brother Zhaolin and Genius Luo must be amused.

321
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:05,220
I heard that Ruzhuo is very unsatisfied after suffering that day at Da Ci'en Temple.

322
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,500
He especially sent someone to investigate this woman's background. Is that true?

323
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,990
Ruzhuo is used to getting his ways, how can he let it go?

324
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,030
Besides, he has already found out everything.

325
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,840
This woman is the daughter of Kudi Yanzhong from the Conghua Neighborhood.

326
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,260
I heard that he even wants to take her as a concubine.

327
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:24,180
No matter how smart and sharp this woman is, if she enters the Duke of Hedong's manor,

328
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,340
she will be tormented by Ruzhuo.

329
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,020
If Zilong is interested, you should hurry to get ahead.

330
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:36,000
Brother Shouyue, I invited everyone today to drink wine and compose poetry. Let's not delay.

331
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,740
The ladies are enjoying the flower pageant.

332
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,790
We should drink wine and compete on writing poems, too.

333
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,840
Come, let's continue our drinking.

334
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,550
- Please.
- Please.

335
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,630
The weather is quite nice today. Young ladies,

336
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,940
come with me to enjoy the flowers and the garden.

337
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,750
- Go.
- Let's go.

338
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,700
- What's wrong?
- What's happened?

339
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,900
Yu'er, you were just walking right in front of me.

340
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,990
Why did you fall?

341
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,590
Such a precious Ink Jade flower,

342
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,530
you have ruined it.

343
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,760
Are you disappointing Madam's thoughtfulness?

344
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,220
It's fine about the flower.

00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,200

Is Shanhu back?

It's the official matchmaker coming to propose on behalf of the Pei family.

Shanhu hasn't even returned from the matchmaking,

00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,860
but the matchmaker is already here to propose?

360

You must be Madam Cao.

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,780
I am ordered by the Duke of Hedong's manor to propose marriage with your family.

365
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,860
The heir, Young Master Pei, wants to marry your daughter as his concubine.

366
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:26,290
If you don't disagree, I will bring over the document and betrothal gift tomorrow

to settle this agreement.

368
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:32,030
You are talking about the heir to the Duke of Hedong,

369
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,030
and not Pei Yan of the Commandant Pei's family?

370
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,790
What does this have to do with Commandant Pei?

371
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,140
Even though Commanandant Pei's family is also esteemed,

372
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,030
but it simply can't compare to the nobleness of the Duke of Hedong.

373
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:46,290
The madam in charge of the Duke of Hedong's manor is Grand Princess Linhai.

374
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,030
If your daughter becomes the heir's concubine,

375
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,290
it will bring glorious honor to your family.

376
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:55,120
Don't tell me you won't want such a good arrangement?

377
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,740
Of course, we want it.

378
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,160
But it's quite coincidental that my daughter

379
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,730
was invited by her auntie to Commandant Pei's manor today.

380
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,460
I mean, unfortunately,

381
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,520
that my husband isn't home today.

382
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,300
How can I make a decision by myself on such an important matter?

383
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:18,140
It's better to wait for my husband to return to decide.

384
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,060
What did you mean about Commandant Pei's manor?

385
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,430
Is your daughter already promised to another family?

386
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,940
No, no! My daughter is still at home

387
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,470
and has never been promised to anyone.

388
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,260
In this case, I'll consider it that you've agreed.

389

about how long will it take to get the money?

401
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,770
Master, you will have to repay ten times the amount.

402
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,340
There is no other way.

I'm afraid that I'll disappoint Esteemed Customer.

427
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,750
The screen you asked for is too large, and the drawing is using "hunting" as the theme.

428
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,540
I've asked all the artists and craftsmen that work with our shop,

429
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,820

To appease the rich families, the artists

432
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:10,080
mostly draw about flowers, birds, fish, insects, and romance.

433
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,660
To design such a large hunting scene in such a short time,

434
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,430
it is indeed difficult.

It's good that this marriage prospect is ruined.

No marriage with Comandant Pei's manor,

Can the artist draw my hunting scene?

466
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,620
The artist said that if the esteemed customer is willing to pay half more of the original payment,

467
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,650
she will accept this screen's order.

468
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,670

Esteemed Customer, are you sure?

470
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,790
Ten thousand coins is not a small amount.

471
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,420
The higher the skill, the higher the price.

472
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,940
As long as the artist's drawing can satisfy me,

473
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,550
it's fair to charge half more of the money.

474
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,260
This drawing isn't difficult.

475
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,930
What's difficult is to make my drawing into the screen in such a short time.

476
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,550
I asked for the extra payment

477
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,260
for the workers that will make the screen.

478
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,760
I will only take what I'm supposed to get, not a coin more.

479
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,310
In this case, will the esteemed customer please step inside the inner chamber and meet the artist.

480
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,380
There is a reason that the other artists didn't dare accept your order.

481
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,520
The main reason is that the screen's size is too large.

482
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,150
In my opinion, you should separate the screen into four pieces.

483
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,560
Put the prints inside each of the four frames.

484
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,510

- Isn't it?

517
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,250
I... I...

518
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,130
Auntie, are you mistaken. Today, at the Commandant Manor,

519
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,360
I wore the same clothes as Madam Pei.

520
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,390
I was also embarrassed due to that little artist giving me trouble.

521
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:17,920
Why does Pei Yan like me?

522
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,320
Nanny Yan told me that you had an embarrassing episode.

523
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,430
I also thought there was no more chance.

524
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,070
But Pei Yan actually told me himself

525
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,050
that he likes the daughter of the Kudi family.

526
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:31,760
He even let me arrange the betrothal gift to immediately settle the marriage agreement.

527
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,600
Immediately?

528
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,570
- This...
- This...

529
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:39,070
This is clearly a happy event.

530
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:42,930
Why are Older Brother and Sister-in-Law looking worried?

531
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,310
Fifth Madam, you didn't know about this.

532
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:52,790
Just now, the heir of Duke of Hedong sent a matchmaker to propose marriage.

533
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,490
He wants to marry Shanhu.

534
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,690
The Duke of Hedong's manor is such a noble household.

535
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,040
We really can't offend them.

536
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,320
That's right.

537
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:07,450
You can't offend Duke of Hedong's manor?

538
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,960
So you can offend our Commandant Manor?

539
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,070
Don't forget, you were the ones that originally begged me

540
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,680
to let Shanhu marry into Commandant Manor.

541
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,690
I didn't expect that you would secretly lure the Duke of Hedong's manor.

542
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:24,240
How can you step on two boats at the same time?

543
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,500
Be careful that you won't capsize!

544
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:32,400
Auntie, please don't misunderstand. I have never met that heir to Duke of Hedong.

545
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,650
How could I have lured him?

546
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,810
Who would believe this kind of nonsense?

547
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:41,640
Pei Yan didn't fall for that popular little woman from Ruyi Resist Dye Shop today,

548
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,010
but he likes you, who was totally embarrassed.

549
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,190
It's already a stroke of great luck that befell you.

550
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,060
You would actually say that heir to Duke of Hedong

551
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:51,550
has never met you but wants to marry you.

552
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,990
Who do you think you are?

553
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,490
Older Brother, I'm coming over tomorrow with the betrothal gifts.

554
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:02,200
If you dare to go back on your promise, I won't be gentle.

555
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,730
- This...
- What Fifth Madam said is not wrong.

556
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:11,490
There is something odd about this.

557
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,950
Shanhu, just now, your auntie mentioned

558
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:21,190
that popular little girl from Ruyi Resist Dye Shop.

559
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,800
Who is she exactly?

560
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,730
The one that auntie mentioned is the new artist at Ruyi Resist Dye Shop.

561
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,510
That artist happened to be at the Commandant Manor today.

562
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:34,140
At first, I thought Pei Yan's wife wanted her.

563
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:39,320
Oh yes, you two have met that artist.

564
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:44,130
She was the one that was asking for directions the other day.

565
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,890
She is the one making trouble?

566
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:55,830
Husband, I saw that you looked strange that day.

567
00:39:55,830 --> 00:40:00,630
Tell me the truth. Who exactly is that woman?

568
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,470
She is...

569
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,930
She is Liuli.

570
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,280
- Liuli isn't dead?
- Liuli isn't dead?

571
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,180
Leave!

572
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,780
- Leave!
- Artist, listen to me.

573
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,500
Calm down.

574
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,420
How about this? I'm willing to pay twice the original amount.

575
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,580
Please complete the screen, Artist.

576
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:29,370
You are acting so generous, isn't it because you stole my money?

577
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,560
You want me to make the screen? Sure.

578
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,750
But you must give my...

579
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,670
my cousin's things first.

580
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:40,180
Otherwise, I don't care however much you pay.

581
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,700
I really didn't take your things.

582
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,880
How can I pay you back?

583
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,260
I must be muddled. You will soon marry into the Commandant Manor.

584
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,220
Glory and fortune will soon by your side.

585
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,000
No wonder such a small sum from me

586
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,620
isn't enough to impress you, Artist.

587
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,390
What nonsense is this? I don't want to marry.

588
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,080
Don't be embarrassed, Artist.

589
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,940
It's normal that men and women of age will marry.

590
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,980
If you don't want to marry Pei Yan,

591
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,400
why did you participate in the flower pageant at the Commandant Manor today?

592
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,280
I went to the Commandant Manor today to help Madam Cui's dress.

593
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,470
Don't think that everyone wants to marry into a rich and noble family.

594
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:18,040
This artist doesn't care about it.

595
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,230
- Are you telling the truth?
- Of course.

596
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,710
A'Ni, see the customer out!

597
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:27,870
- Customer, please leave.
- Artist, please stay.

598
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:31,140
If what you just said is the truth,

599
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,260
I'm afraid you'll soon see trouble coming.

600
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:41,140
Trouble? What trouble will I have?

601
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:45,970
I heard that Duke of Hedong's heir, Pei Ruzhuo,

602
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,870
has already proposed marriage to your family.

603
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:51,070
That day you offended the heir. He is narrow-minded.

604
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:55,980
He wants to marry you as a concubine as an act of revenge.

605
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,900
You want to threaten me with Duke of Hedong's Manor again?

606
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,980
Too bad you are really not good with this story.

607
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,810
You said that Duke of Hedong's heir is going to my family to propose marriage.

608
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:10,180
But he doesn't know who I am, so how will he know where to go propose the marriage?

609
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:14,510
May I ask... Are you the daughter of

610
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,790
Kudi Yanzhong of Chonghua Neighborhood?

611
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,560
How did you know?

612
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:33,530
Bless Chonghua Neighborhood's Kudi Yanzhong. Bless my father to be safe and healthy.

613
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:35,110
That day you were praying in the temple.

614
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:38,230
Live happily the whole life. Bless my father...

615
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,050
to be safe and healthy.

616
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,460
Duke of Hedong's heir deliberately found out about your family's background.

617
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,820
I happened to see it.

618
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,270
Anyone here? Anyone here?

619
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:53,930
Madam Cao, have you come here by mistake?

620
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,410
Or is it like your daughter,

621
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,970
you are here to secretly copy our design?

622
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:00,760
I came here to find her!

623
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,780
Move aside!

624
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:25,000
You really look like your mother, another foxy tramp.

625
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,540
Your mother made the Kudi family into a chaotic state back then.

626
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,420
Now you want to come and ruin your younger sister's marriage. Isn't that right?

627
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:34,080
Your daughter came in here on her own.

628
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,360
She stole the design that I made for Madam Pei Yan.

629
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,280
That's why she got embarrassed at the flower pageant.

630
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:45,650
You don't know to self-reflect, but blame me?
