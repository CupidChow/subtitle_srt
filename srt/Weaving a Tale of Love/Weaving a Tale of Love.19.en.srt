[Weaving a Tale of Love]

3
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,400
[Episode 19]

4
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,000
Please rest assured, Talented Lady Wu.

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I went to the Bureau of Imperial Attire a few days ago and made a big ruckus.

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,800
I told them Crown Prince's injury had worsened, so I asked them to make more clothes.

7
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,700
This is great.

8
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,620
Unless...

9
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,600
This is Bao'er?

10
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,700
This is the Bao'er you rescued the other day.

11
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,400
Bao'er is such a pretty bird.

12
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,500
It's often lonely in the palace.

13
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,000
Good thing Bao'er brought a lot of happiness.

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,800
I was thinking you were bored and angry every day at the palace,

15
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,400
so I brought Bao'er to ease some boredom.

16
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,000
Your Highness, the Bureau of Imperial Attire has just brought this here.

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,700
Let me have a look.

18
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,320
[Dou]

19
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,360
Xiao Douzi is caring.

20
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,300
How about... we ask Xiao Douzi to the East Palace to work?

21
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,800
I have been thinking that Xiao Douzi working at Courtyard of Misfortune is a shame.

22
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,000
I didn't think he would go to Bureau of Imperial Attire.

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,200
He has great needlework, too.

24
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,100
What do you think, Talented Lady Wu?

25
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Xiao Douzi is smart, attentive, and kind.

26
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,200
He takes responsibility for his actions.

27
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,100
I also like him.

28
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,600
But... working at the Bureau of Imperial Attire is not a bad thing.

29
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,800
This way, you can have another person in the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

30
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,000
You also won't stop his skills.

31
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,400
It is just that it is too boring here.

32
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,400
If Xiao Douzi could come, he could make me happy.

33
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,600
I wouldn't need to look at A'Sheng's bitter face all day.

34
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,100
Please endure for a few more days.

35
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,300
Only when Prince Cao and Consort Yang think

36
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,000
that you have not gotten well, will we then have peace.

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,100
And they wouldn't do more tricks in tomorrow's competition.

38
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,700
As long as Pei Xingjian can beat Pu Banu and become Your Highness' personal guard,

39
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,700
then, in the future, your safety will be guaranteed.

40
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,200
You are right, Pei Xingjian is good at martial arts and is scholarly.

41
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,600
As long as he is by Crown Prince's side, we can feel safe.

42
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,000
If Prince of Cao's scheme succeeds and Pu Banu is placed next to Your Highness,

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,700
then wouldn't that be placing an assassin?

44
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,600
- What if...?
- A'Sheng. A'Sheng. A'Sheng!

45
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,500
Can you learn from Xiao Douzi?

46
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,100
Say less unlucky things.

47
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,400
He is also considerate of you.

48
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,900
Being more careful of everything is not a bad idea.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,200
Tomorrow will be the Martial Arts competition.

50
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,200
I am thinking why don't you ask Pei Xingjian to come to the East Palace sooner.

51
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,000
This way you can look after one another and we can prevent outsiders.

52
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,000
You are right.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Then I will go meet up with him now.

54
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,100
Is there any news from the East Palace?

55
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,700
Crown Prince has been resting these days in his chamber.

56
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,700
Everyone in East Palace is staying quiet about the crown prince's condition.

57
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,000
There is actually a lot of movement in the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,600
Every other day or so, Attire Chief Lin will dispatch Cai Yue to pick up new fabrics,

59
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,800
saying that the daily change of clothes for the crown prince...

60
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,500
There is more and more each day.

61
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,900
It looks like the wound is bad.

62
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,720
This is a good thing.

63
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,100
Why are you uneasy instead?

64
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,400
Tomorrow is the martial arts competition.

65
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,000
If the crown prince is really deeply wounded,

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,400
he should have asked His Majesty to withdraw from the competition.

67
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,000
Right.

68
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,460
Crown Prince looks highly upon Pei Xingjian.

69
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,940
He even personally pleaded with His Majesty

70
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,800
to make an exception to the rule in order to keep Pei by his side.

71
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,150
It looks like he is not an ordinary person.

72
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,300
Martial arts are important. There cannot be any mistakes.

73
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,200
I have to go to the East Palace myself.

74
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Greetings, Prince Cao.

75
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,000
I came specifically to visit Crown Prince.

76
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,800
This is...

77
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,600
This is...

78
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,200
I am Pei Xingjian. Greetings, Prince Cao.

79
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,430
Prince Cao is here to visit Crown Prince!

80
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,470
Greetings, Brother.

81
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,930
You have been injured for so many days, why are you still not well?

82
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Reply to Prince Cao. It is not sure if it is because the Crown Prince's body is weak.

83
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,400
These days the wound doesn't get better.

84
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,100
Instead, it has gotten worse.

85
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,300
I know your body is weak.

86
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,800
That's why I've brought some high-quality deer antler and mountain ginseng

87
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,000
for you to nourish your body.

88
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,400
Thank you, Fourteenth Brother.

89
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,600
I am afraid about your health.

90
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,300
So I specifically asked people to invite Imperial Doctor Zhong from the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

91
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,600
Greetings, Crown Prince.

92
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,200
These couple of days are hot and dry. It is really easy to infect the wound.

93
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,400
Please let me check your wound. Afterward, I will prescribe you some good medicine.

94
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,000
No need.

95
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,400
Every time they change the medicine, it's like peeling the skin and cutting the muscle.

96
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,000
The pain is unbearable.

97
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,800
I have just changed the medicine. No need to check.

98
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,500
You are unwell.

99
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,600
How about we tell His Majesty to reschedule the competition?

100
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,800
The date was chosen by His Majesty.

101
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't want to ruin his happiness.

102
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,400
Tomorrow, it is. Don't change it.

103
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,200
I have been bored these days resting.

104
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,820
I can go out for a walk tomorrow.

105
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,400
Pei Xingjian.

106
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,000
Yes.

107
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,800
I have praised you in front of His Majesty.

108
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Tomorrow, you have to show some real skills.

109
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Don't cause me to lose face.

110
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,400
I will try my best.

111
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,100
Pu Banu.

112
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,300
Yes.

113
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,800
I forgot to tell you earlier, this is the bodyguard I want to give you,

114
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,950
Pu Banu, the warrior I've recommended.

115
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,400
I have chosen him with much difficulty.

116
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,500
Pei XIngjian, if you want to become Crown Prince's bodyguard,

117
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,200
tomorrow, you have to go through him first.

118
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,610
Please.

119
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,000
Please.

120
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,200
Your body is unwell, so I will not bother you any longer.

121
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,700
A'She,

122
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,300
help me see off Fourteenth Brother.

123
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,000
Yes.

124
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,820
Seeing off Prince Cao.

125
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,000
- Pu Banu.
- Yes.

126
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You were really great earlier.

127
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,500
I saw that you gave way to him, saving strength for tomorrow's competition.

128
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,000
It is great to let them be happy tonight.

129
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,700
Tomorrow, it will be great to finish him.

130
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,200
Your Highness is smart. I couldn't tell.

131
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,500
I almost thought that Pei Xingjian was capable of winning over Warrior Pu.

132
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,300
Pu Banu was only trying him out.

133
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,900
Where did he show off his strength?

134
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,200
My apologies, Your Highness.

135
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
I also showed my strength earlier.

136
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,600
Pei Xingjian's strength is above mine.

137
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,000
For tomorrow's fight, I cannot guarantee I will win completely,

138
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,400
but I will try my best for you.

139
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,000
Pu Banu,

140
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,200
I don't care what strategies you use tomorrow.

141
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,100
You have to beat Pei Xingjian!

142
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,600
Or else,

143
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,600
I cannot keep useless people by my side.

144
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,500
Yes.

145
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,400
[Bureau of Imperial Attire]

146
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,600
Qiniang! Qiniang! Qiniang!

147
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,000
Qiniang!

148
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,100
My stomach hurts terribly. Please help me ask Attire Expert Zhou

149
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,400
to give leave time. I really cannot endure it anymore.

150
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,800
Qiniang!

151
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,400
Last night, I caught a cold and I cannot endure my headache.

152
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,800
Also, help me request a leave.

153
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,300
Me, too!

154
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,320
You guys have all said the excuses,

155
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,300
then what should I say?

156
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,300
My throat hurts.

157
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,200
Your throat hurts and you're still speaking so loudly?

158
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,400
Don't think that I don't know what you are up to.

159
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,800
You are all taking leave to see

160
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,000
what... Pei... and what... Nu... competition?

161
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,300
Attire Expert Zhuo, it is not Nu.

162
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,600
It is Pei Xingjian and Pu Banu.

163
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,200
The person who wins will be Crown Prince's bodyguard.

164
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,800
I heard that His Majesty is encouraging soldiers, guards, and maids to watch.

165
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,400
So... we Bureau of Imperial Attire...

166
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,700
His Majesty is asking soldiers and guards to compete

167
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,800
to encourage them to be better.

168
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,600
And we Bureau of Imperial Attire...

169
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,700
The loyalty we have to His Majesty

170
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,500
is making great clothing!

171
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,600
You have all asked to take leave to watch.

172
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,900
Isn't it to be lazy?!

173
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Feast of all Souls Festival is coming up soon.

174
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,100
The workload at the Bureau of Imperial Attire is a lot,

175
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,300
and you still have the thought to go play?

176
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,300
Today, who dares to leave this room,

177
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,700
I will punish them heavily!

don't act like there's grass growing in your hearts.
(Get stirred up and can't concentrate)

181
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,200
I heard the personal maids at the East Palace say

182
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,200
that Pei Xingjian is really handsome.

183
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,000
If we are able to have him look at us once,

184
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,200
then our heart can jump out.

185
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,000
So all the palace maids are hoping that he wins.

186
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
This way, they can see him often.

187
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Really? Is he really that handsome?

188
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,500
I want to see him.

189
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,400
Shouyue, Prince Cao must have come prepared.

190
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,000
You have to be careful in everything.

191
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

192
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,400
This time's competition is within our palace.

193
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,400
I don't think Prince Cao can do anything.

194
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,600
Besides, I am confident in my martial arts.

195
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,000
I won't let Prince Cao's evil plan succeed, for sure,

196
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,200
for him to place his spy by your side.

197
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,400
If it was an open competition,

198
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,200
I am completely confident in your martial arts.

199
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But I am afraid the enemy has some evil skills and we cannot prevent it.

200
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,400
Shouyue,

201
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,600
you and I are monarchs and friends.

202
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,500
I don't wish for you to get hurt.

- Pu Banu.
- Yes.

207
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,400
This competition is really important,

208
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,600
especially since His Majesty has set the location at the East Palace.

209
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,000
This is why you can only win and cannot lose.

210
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,020
Do you understand?

211
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,200
I will try my best.

212
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,900
Not "try my best,"

213
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,300
but you have to win.

214
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,200
Your Highness, this pill can instantly increase my strength,

215
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,000
but its after-effects are really bad.

216
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,390
Before, I have also had a few.

Your Highness, how about I talk to Pei Xingjian first?

219
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,400
If it is not successful, it is not too late to use it at the crucial moment.

220
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
Important moment?

221
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,600
It is the crucial moment now!

222
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,600
When you realize you cannot beat him, it'll be too late.

223
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,200
The chance to place a bodyguard at Crown Prince's side is so precious!

224
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,800
If we miss it, there won't be another one!

225
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,600

So I have set the competition to be at the East Palace.

To be able to have Your Majesty's judgment and oversee this competition

263
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,000
is Pei Xingjian and Pu Banu's luck.

There has been no king as great,

why has Xiao Douzi been gone to the warehouse for so long?

Exactly. He has already been gone for 2 hours.

00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:10,860
May I report, Your Majesty, that when I decided to kidnap Prince of Cao just now,

354
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,880
I already disregarded my life.

355
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,140
I dueled with Pu Banu today to fight for the position of Crown Prince's personal guard.

356
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,220
As Crown Prince's personal guard,

357
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,060
the primary mission is to rescue the crown prince from peril.

358
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:27,040
Even if I fight to the last drop of my blood, I would safeguard the crown prince.

359
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,050
While sparring just then,

360
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,990
my old illness suddenly recurred and I couldn't continue to fight.

361
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,680
I could only quickly end the sparring.

362
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,880
If I was fighting for real, under my weakened condition,

363
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,030
the first thing to do was to protect Crown Prince.

364
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,650
Therefore, the best thing I could think of

365
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,370
was to capture the opponent's leader first.

366
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,700
Your Majesty, please don't listen to Pei Xingjian's chicanery.

367
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,130
In front of everyone, he almost harmed Ming'er.

368
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,530
He must not be tolerated and must be harshly punished.

369
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,380
Meiniang, what do you think?

370
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,220
Your Majesty, I'm just an ignorant woman in the palace. I dare not randomly talk.

371
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,990
I only know that Your Majesty is intelligent and wise. You've acquired talented people without being restrained by rules.

372
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:42,480
Our dynasty is full of talented people.

373
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,940
Your Majesty is kind and generous. Even women and children know about how you use competent people.

374
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,670
Your Majesty not only has gathered 24 famous officials in Lin Yan Pavilion, (Lin Yan Pavilion is like a Hall of Fame)

375
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:54,170
you also highly relied on the Wei Zheng and others who were knowledgeable, (People who worked for the emperor's older brother)

376
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,600
and it became an exemplary story for the millennium.

377
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:02,490
Talented Lady Wu, you said you were ignorant and didn't dare to talk randomly,

378
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,750
but you kept talking so much nonsense.

379
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,130
Pei Xingjian was arrogant and dared to offend royals.

380
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:10,630
How can you compare him to the 24 famous meritorious officials of Lin Yan Pavilion?

381
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,600
Older Sister is right to teach me.

382
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,600
I was only admiring His Majesty's kindness and tolerance that I temporarily got impudent.

383
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,460
All right.

384
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,730
I will make my own judgment.

385
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,000
What do you think, Crown Prince?

386
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,650
Since childhood, I've been learning from what I saw and heard by Your Majesty's side.

387
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,520
Even though I can't reach even one-thousandth of Your Majesty,

388
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,890
but I also understand the principle of trusting the people you use, and not using the people you doubt.

389
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:37,800
I highly regard Pei Xingjian's martial skills.

390
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,050
I also believe in his character and ethos, and furthermore, I admire his courage.

391
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:01,580
Pei Xingjian, even though your behavior was somewhat rude,

392
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,530
but you were sincerely thinking for Crown Prince's sake.

393
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,600
You didn't disappoint Crown Prince's trust in and support of you.

394
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,460
You are smart, courageous, and didn't panic when facing danger.

395
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,030
I quite admire you, too.

396
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,200
I judge that you won the duel.

397
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,010
You will stay by Crown Prince's side and protect him.

398
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,400
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your kindness. I will wholeheartedly protect Crown Prince.

399
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,310
Your Majesty!

400
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,100
Pu Banu, you are outstanding in martial skills.

401
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:43,310
You impressed me and all the imperial guards. You will continue to stay by Prince of Cao's side

402
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,370
- to protect the Prince of Cao.
- Yes.

403
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,540
- A'Quan.
- Present.

404
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,650
Bring the swords that were recently offered by Dragon Spring.

405
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,640
Each will be bestowed to Pei Xingjian and Pu Banu.

406
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,390
Yes.

407
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,740
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your bestowment.

408
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:17,860
Pei Xingjian! Pei Xingjian!

409
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,680
Pei Xingjian! Pei Xingjian!

410
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,230
- A'Sheng, summon the imperial physician!
- Yes.
- Pei Xingjian.

411
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,100
Pei Xingjian!

412
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,990
Is His Majesty old and muddled?

413
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,600
We saw Pei Xingjian pointing his sword to kidnap,

414
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,010
just relying on a few cunning words of evasive retorts,

415
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,810
and the crown prince and Wu Meiniang

416
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,380
were talking nonsense to help him.

417
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,140
He got off so easily!

418
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,290
Mother, you should have realized Wu Meiniang's fierceness today.

419
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:50,450
She dared to retort what you said in front of everyone.

420
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:54,910
His Majesty even listened to her and totally disregarded any respect toward Mother.

421
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,810
If Talented Lady Wu becomes Crown Prince's insider in the palace,

422
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:01,900
then if the crown prince wants to kill me,

423
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,660
all that's missing is an opportunity.

424
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,730
From today on,

425
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,940
I will never stand by and compromise,

426
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,860
I will fight, for my sake

427
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,870
and also for Ming'er.

428
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,060
With me around,

429
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,820
no one will dare touch my son, Ming'er, even a little bit.

[Upstanding Virtues Gate]

431
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,770
How is it? I saw Sir Pei's condition

432
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,960
and knew to summon the imperial physician to help.

433
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,560
It's just that–

434
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,330
It's just that Prince of Cao's eyes and ears are in the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

435
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:04,180
It could be harmful to Young Master Pei.

436
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,380
This is also what I am worried about.

437
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,790
Earlier, Pei Xingjian was busy trying to win.

438
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,240
Something must have happened to him that we don't know of.

439
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,280
Anyone could see that his arm suddenly didn't listen to his actions.

440
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,930
It was as if it had been poisoned.

441
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,330
The East Palace is really protected.

442
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:24,030
The enemy can give poison in such a short amount of time.

443
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,500
How can I easily trust the Imperial Academy of Medicine?

444
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:33,460
It's all my fault. I never thought of

445
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,910
building my own power inside the palace.

446
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:40,110
Your Highness, you are kind and just, and you don't need to blame yourself.

447
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,330
Talented Lady Wu.

448
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,670
Talented Lady Wu.

449
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:50,250
Your Highness, earlier at the competition,

450
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,720
I realized that Pei Xingjian's arm was not right.

451
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,010
So I dispatched people to go outside the palace to invite Physician Lu

452
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,130
as preparation just in case.

453
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:02,890
Now that Physician Lu has arrived, he can diagnosis Pei Xingjian.

454
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,510
Thank you, Talented Lady Wu. You got Physician Lu here

455
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,110
just in time to solve my urgent problem.

456
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:20,370
Young Master Pei is unconscious because he lost too much blood.

457
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:28,740
His arm suddenly lost strength because of poisoning.

458
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,830
Fortunately, the poison's effect has a time limit.

459
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:36,730
It will disappear automatically in a cup of tea's time. It's not a big problem. (about 15 minutes)

460
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,500
I will sanitize the wound and stop the bleeding now.

461
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,730
I will also prescribe a few orders of herbal medicine

462
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,740
for him to take. He only needs to rest quietly.

463
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,100
Thank you for your trouble, Physician Lu.

464
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:29,160
Xiao Douzi,

465
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,310
Qiniang said you went to the supply room to pick up threads.

466
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,150
What threads?

467
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,980
It took you four hours.

468
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,180
Where are the threads?

469
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:43,660
I was too eager to have fun. When I heard there was a martial competition in the palace,

470
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,630
I couldn't stand it, so I went there to watch the lively scene.

471
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:49,670
You are quite honest with your reply.

472
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,920
What did I say this morning?

473
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,120
The Bureau of Imperial Attire is not the Courtyard of Misfortune, and it does not tolerate your slacking off.

474
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,630
How dare you treat my words as the wind that blew by your ears.

475
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:02,230
I did wrong. Please punish me, Attire Expert Zhuo.

476
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,830
Punish? Of course, I will punish you!

477
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,640
I will even punish you very harshly.

478
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,680
I can't let you show a bad example and ruin the rules in the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

479
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,630
You sneaked away for four hours. So I'll punish you

480
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:19,590
to kneel four hours, and no dinner.

481
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:23,910
After you've kneeled, you must finish all the work that I assigned you today.

482
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,760
If you can't finish,

483
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,920
I'll double the punishment tomorrow.

484
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,140
Xiao Douzi is wrong. Xiao Douzi accepts the punishment.

485
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,230
Those that come from the Courtyard of Misfortune just don't follow rules.

486
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:53,390
As I see it, the punishment is too light.

487
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,990
A'Bi is right.

♫  I've spent this life with brush and ink in hand  ♫

520
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:28,000
♫  Writing about what love is  ♫

521
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,980
♫  Borrow from the relentless of the night  ♫

522
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:39,130
♫  To exchange for the certainty of a promise  ♫

523
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:44,880
♫  There are too many bumpy roads along the way  ♫

524
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,100
♫  The more twists, the deeper it is  ♫

525
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,590
♫  Breaking up and making up is like an illusion  ♫

526
00:44:53,590 --> 00:45:00,720
♫  Resembles a traveler traveling through this life  ♫

527
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,420
♫  Time ignores everything including obsession  ♫

528
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:11,610
♫  With the candlelight flickering indefinitely  ♫

529
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:15,340
♫  After the fire, there was only one thing left  ♫

530
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:25,080
♫  A bright moon that makes one's heart tingle  ♫

531
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,970
♫  After the fire, there was only one thing left  ♫

532
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:39,670
♫  A bright moon that makes one's heart tingle  ♫
