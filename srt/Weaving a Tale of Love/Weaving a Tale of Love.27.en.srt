[Weaving a Tale of Love]

3
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,140
[Episode 27]

4
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,200
Liuli presented the golden needle.

5
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,600
She said it is a treasure that can trade for money to help cure illness,

6
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,200
but she couldn't wait to sell the golden needle.

7
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,900
And she already died.

8
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,600
Life and death are fate. This is her fate.

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,000
Buddist Master, in the remaining belongings of Liuli,

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,200
have you ever seen a secret sewing book?

11
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,200
I have never seen any secret book.

12
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,000
Buddhist Master, please think again.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,600
Maybe there is some secret book she has never told you about.

14
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,800
When Liuli came, she had no belongings.

15
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,200
If she hid a golden needle, I would not have known.

16
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,200
If she had a book,

17
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,000
how would I not know?

18
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,400
Buddhist monks don't lie.

19
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,400
It looks like you are speaking lies.

20
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,600
No matter what, now that I have gotten the golden needle,

21
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,000
then I am actually Number One Needle in the World.

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,200
Such a happy event!

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,600
Liuli, don't do things out of anger. Calm down.

24
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,400
I promise I sent this golden needle out.

25
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,800
I will bring it back for sure and give it back to you.

26
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,000
You are not me.

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,600
You don't know how important this golden needle is to me.

28
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,700
My matters, please don't be involved again.

29
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,900
You are so angry, I am at fault.

30
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,100
But the Bureau of Imperial Attire is a dangerous place. Attire Expert Zhuo is wicked.

31
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,800
You have to protect yourself.

32
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,500
Otherwise, your mother's golden needle is sacrificed for nothing.

33
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,300
As for me...

34
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,470
I will protect you.

35
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,800
Congratulations Master for getting the golden needle.

36
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,300
You don't need to worry about Attire Expert An's descendant.

37
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,400
As long as I can't find the person who was worshipping at the Hall of Thinking Heart that night,

38
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,000
I cannot be at ease.

39
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,500
This Xiao Douzi is still the most suspicious person.

40
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,400
You have to watch her carefully.

41
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Yes.

42
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,900
Attire Expert Zhuo,

43
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,200
I have waited for you for a long time.

44
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,900
Why are you waiting for me?

45
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,000
I came to get my badge back.

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,500
Your badge... why would it be in my hands?

47
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,800
Attire Expert Zhuo, others don't say it,

48
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,200
but that day I broke the palace rules.

49
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,100
I was paying respect to the dead at Hall of Thinking Heart and you coincidentally saw me.

50
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,800
I was in a rush to leave, and in the midst, I lost my badge.

51
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
But when I returned to look for it,

52
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,000
this badge had already gone missing.

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,100
I was thinking you must have picked it up.

54
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,200
This badge is important. Without it, it will be hard for me.

55
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
I really had no choice,

56
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,200
so I could only come and find you.

57
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,800
That day at the Hall of Thinking Heart,

58
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,800
it was you?

59
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,400
It was me.

60
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,900
Who are you paying respects to?

61
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,700
Why ask when you already know?

62
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,000
That day, it was Attire Expert An's death day.

63
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,800
I heard from Xiao Douzi that a fairy shared skills with her in her dreams.

64
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,600
And that fairy claims to have lived in Hall of Thinking Heart.

65
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,800
And this Hall of Thinking Heart often has ghosts lately.

66
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,700
I am really not at ease.

67
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,000
So I thought that the fairy must be Attire Expert An.

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So that day, I went to pay respects.

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Who would have thought that you would catch me? So I could only evade you.

70
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,200
Since you know that in the palace it is a crime to pay respects,

71
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,500
it breaks the rules, then why did you still do it?

72
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,800
Of course, it is because I have guilt in my heart.

73
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Thanks to you.

74
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,000
Thanks to me?

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,200
The Courtyard of Misfortune has always respected the dead, no matter rich or poor.

76
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,600
They would help them carry out their death matters.

77
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,000
Yet only Attire Expert An's body

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,400
was burned by myself to ashes.

79
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
She couldn't be buried.

80
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,700
Attire Expert Zhuo, 11 years ago,

81
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,000
who was it that forced me to burn the body to ashes?

82
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,100
Did you forget?

83
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,800
That night, I didn't see your badge.

84
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,000
Look elsewhere.

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,300
Did you really not see it?

86
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Attire Expert Zhuo,

87
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,600
you have no use for that badge.

88
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,400
Why don't you return it to me?

89
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,000
I really haven't seen it.

90
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,800
You have also said that I have no use for it.

91
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,300
If I had seen it, I wouldn't need to keep it.

92
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Thank you for your help.

93
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,000
Please persuade Xiao Douzi

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,900
for her to not be in danger because of that golden needle.

95
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,000
Thank you, Qiniang.

96
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,000
Being in the palace was to avenge my mother.

97
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,600
But now, not only can I not take revenge for mother,

98
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,600
I even gave the golden needle to the enemy that killed Mother.

99
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Why am I so useless? So mischievous?

100
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,080
Xiao Douzi.

101
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Xiao Douzi, I know you must feel really bad right now.

102
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Good thing Master doesn't suspect your relationship with Attire Expert An anymore.

103
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,800
In order to learn sewing skills from you, she won't cause harm to you for the time being.

104
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Your foster father also asked me to persuade you.

105
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,600
He said that the golden needle is something not with you.

106
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,900
Don't be in danger because of a golden needle.

107
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,400
Pei Xingjian.

108
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,600
Foster Father, Qiniang. They are the people I trust the most,

109
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,000
yet they all have kept it a secret from me, making me an unfilial person.

110
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,800
I am so useless. How can Mother forgive me?

111
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,050
- Xiao Douzi.
- Qiniang.

112
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,400
I...

113
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Actually, she understands everything we have said. She just can't accept it.

114
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,900
Let her be by herself.

115
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,500
[Embroidered Splendor Blooming Flowers]

116
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,400
It's not the new year or festival time.

117
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,500
Why have you caused such a big ruckus and called me?

118
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,000
You even invited the portraits of Yellow Emperor, founder of clothmaking,

119
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and Lei Zu, founder of weaving. (Lei Zu was Yellow Emperor's wife, the first person in ancient China to grow silkworms for weaving.)

120
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,200
Is it because you have gotten the golden needle yesterday?

121
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Replying to Attire Chief Lin.

122
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,200
This golden needle is from my teacher.

123
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,200
It represents the title, "Number One Needle in the World".

124
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,800
The meaning is not ordinary.

125
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,400
I am Madam An's only disciple. I should receive this item.

126
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,300
After Master died, the golden needle was nowhere to be found.

127
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,000
After 11 years, it has returned to its owner, in my hands.

128
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,400
This is my luck and the Bureau of Imperial Attire's happiness.

129
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,400
This is why I'm holding a solemn ceremony to pay tribute to the golden needle today,

130
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
To tell everyone in the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

131
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,000
It's also... to announce to the world.

132
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,940
Attire Chief Lin, please take your seat.

133
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,990
I'll introduce you to it. The ceremony today has three parts.

134
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,560
In the first part, Attire Chief Lin and Attire Expert Zhuo

135
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,890
will lead everyone to pay respects to our founding ancestors, Yellow Emperor and Lei Zu.

136
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:44,310
In the second part, Attire Expert Zhuo will lead everyone to pay respects to the golden needle.

137
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,210
In the third part, everyone in the Bureau of Imperial Attire

138
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:51,260
will pay respects to the new Number One Needle in the Wolrd, Attire Expert Zhuo.

139
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,340
Wait!

140
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,110
Is she stupid?

141
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,040
Based on what I know, years ago when His Majesty bestowed the golden needle to Attire Expert An,

142
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,120
and also bestowed her the title of Number One Needle in the World,

143
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,380
it was because Attire Expert An's dressmaking technique had attained perfection.

144
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,130
In other words, it doesn't mean whoever obtains Attire Expert An's golden needle

145
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,230
can call herself the Number One Needle in the World.

146
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,140
The title of Number One Needle in the World should belong to the most capable

147
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,510
and most talented person.

148
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,590
Xiao Douzi, you are but a lowly sanitation medical officer,

149
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,780
and are temporarily loaned from the Courtyard of Misfortune to the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

150
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,350
You've only been here a short time,

151
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,160
but you dare to spew nonsense here. Are you tired of living?

152
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,620
What I'm saying is probably what everyone in the Bureau of Imperial Attire is secretly wondering.

153
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,090
I'm just more candid and speaking up about what I'm thinking.

154
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,700
I am Madam An's only disciple and have focused on dressmaking for over 20 years.

155
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,050
If I call myself Number Two in the Bureau of Imperial Attire, no one will dare to call herself Number One.

156
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,080
Who dares to secretly disagree?

157
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,330
Don't talk anymore. Hurry and apologize to Attire Expert Zhuo.

158
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,010
If you can't hold it for now, then you may ruin your ultimate plan. Please think clearly.

159
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:03,540
Attire Expert Zhuo, you call yourself Attire Expert An's only disciple,

160
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,660
but everyone in the Bureau of Imperial Attire knows

161
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,710
that Attire Expert An didn't teach everything she knew to you.

162
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,270
Since you claim to be the number one in the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

163
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,610
do you dare to compete with me?

164
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,850
Xiao Douzi, are you crazy?

165
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,240
You rely on some cleverness, read some books, and learned some simple skills.

166
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,960
You dare to boast nonsense in front of me!

167
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,660
Guards! Drag her out and lock her up!

168
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,940
Once the needle tribute ceremony is over, I will deal with her.

169
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,020
Teacher, it's a celebratory event that you obtained the golden needle.

170
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,350
It's also a great day today to pay respects to the golden needle.

171
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,850
Let's not ruin your good mood because of Xiao Douzi.

172
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,170
Please consider that he is young and ignorant. Just forgive him this time then.

173
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,830
Xiao Douzi, hurry and admit you were wrong to Attire Expert Zhuo.

174
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,610
How did I speak anything wrong?

175
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,360
Attire Expert An didn't teach you her unique skills in dressmaking.

176
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,530
She also didn't personally pass on the golden needle to you.

177
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,670
How can Attire Expert Zhuo inherit the title of Number One Needle in the World?

178
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,020
If you want to be proper and convincing to everyone in the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

179
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,070
please accept my challenge. If you win,

180
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,200
I, Xiao Douzi, will accept you as Number One Needle in the World.

181
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,090
Attire Expert Zhuo, you said so yourself that you've focused on dressmaking for over 20 years.

182
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,560
I am, however, not even 20 years of age.

183
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,050
I was only a lowly sanitation medical officer at the Courtyard of Misfortune.

184
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,880
You don't dare to accept my challenge. Could it be that you are afraid of this lowly medical officer?

185
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,600
Are you afraid of me, a junior who never learned formal dressmaking?

186
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,250
I don't want to listen to your nonsense. Why are you all standing dazed?

187
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,160
Hurry and drag out this insubordinate crazy person!

188
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,830
Wait!

189
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,230
Attire Chief Lin, you are the chief of the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

190
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,610
I hope that you will speak a word of justice.

191
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,670
If Attire Chief Lin also thinks that the bestowed golden needle and the title of Number One Needle in the World can be given out like playthings,

192
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,790
I won't say anything then.

193
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,870
I'm only afraid that once His Majesty hears about this,

194
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,260
His Majesty will accuse Attire Chief Lin of incapable management as well as cronyism.

195
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,390
Xiao Douzi has the Crown Prince and Talented Lady Wu behind her.

196
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:04,620
Is he saying this to threaten me?

197
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:14,360
Attire Expert Zhuo, Xiao Douzi should be punished for her rude words and insubordinate demeanor.

198
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,960
However, he is publicly challenging your dressmaking skills.

199
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,600
If you drag him out to punishment, it would actually lead to gossip.

200
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,930
Even if you have proclaimed yourself to be Number One Needle in the World,

201
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,030
people will say you didn't get it properly later on.

202
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,120
How about we wait until after Attire Expert Zhuo wins the challenge,

203
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,620
then we will punish Xiao Douzi for both charges.

204
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,460
Thereafter, Xiao Douzi can't speak up again,

205
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,920
and everyone in the Bureau of Imperial Attire will be convinced. I can also report everything to the Directorate of Eunuchs

206
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,490
to officially award you with the title of Number One Needle in the World.

207
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,980
Wouldn't this be a perfect way?

208
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,670
Attire Chief Lin is indeed a thoughtful planner and good manager.

209
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:01,000
If I lose the challenge, I'm willing to accept punishment for two charges

210
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,430
and be accountable to everyone.

211
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:08,500
I announce that the tribute ceremony will temporarily be suspended.

212
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,500
Who gets the golden needle and who receives the title of Number One Needle in the world

213
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,160
will be fairly decided through competition.

214
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,000
Xiao Douzi dares to challenge Attire Expert Zhuo. Her spirit should be commended.

215
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,640
The competition will motivate everyone in the Bureau of Imperial Attire to learn from one another.

216
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,940
Improving everyone's skills

217
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,870
is originally why I transferred Xiao Douzi

218
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,290
from the Courtyard of Misfortune to the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

219
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,640
Xiao Douzi,

220
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,500
why are you opposing me this way? Who gave you such boldness?

221
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,120
People walk up, water flows down.

222
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,960
Attire Expert Zhuo's dressmaking skill is clearly not as good as mine

223
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,290
but you covet the seat of Number One Needle in the World. Why can't I then?

224
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,760
Do you really think you can defeat me based on yourself?

225
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,510
Why is Attire Expert Zhuo so angry?

226
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,400
Didn't Attire Chief Lin say it?

227
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,180
We learn and improve from each other through competition.

228
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:25,530
Isn't this your original intent to ask Attire Chief Lin to transfer me from the Courtyard of Misfortune to the Bureau of Imperial Attire?

229
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,300
Don't keep sweet talking!

230
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,720
Dressmaking depends on the hands, not the mouth.

231
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,560
I will let you lose in a very embarrassing way.

232
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:43,830
Then, Attire Expert Zhuo, please use your best skills

233
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,500
so that I can be impressed.

234
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,650
Imperial Guard Leader.

235
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,170
Has something happened with Xiao Douzi?

236
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,390
In front of Attire Chief Lin and everyone in the Bureau of Imperial Attire, Xiao Douzi

237
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,460
openly challenged my master, saying only the person with the best dressmaking skills

238
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,920
will be worthy of getting the golden needle and the title of Number One Needle in the World.

239
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,970
As a subordinate who offends his superior, if Xiao Douzi loses the competition,

240
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,470
he will be punished for two crimes.

241
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,670
Did Attire Chief Lin allow it?

242
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,600
Attire Chief Lin has reported to the Directorate of Eunuchs, and Director Gao is paying high attention.

243
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,430
He said that this competition can not only motivate everyone to be more energetic,

244
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,740
but it can also improve the dressmaking skills in the Bureau of Imperial Attire

245
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,590
and set a good example to all the departments in the inner palace.

246
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,710
The competition is set for three days from now.

247
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,890
It has three rounds, including skills in dyeing, embroidery, and craftsmanship.

248
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,660
Whoever wins two of the three rounds is the winner.

249
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,430
Several of the grand consorts in the inner palace will be the judges.

250
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,920
The winner will obtain the golden needle and the title of Number One Needle in the World.

251
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,870
Xiao Douzi has made a risky move,

252
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,100
but it is the best method to retrieve the golden needle quickly.

253
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,700
By comparing the skills, of course, Xiao Douzi should win.

254
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,520
I'm just worried that my master will come up with some fierce tricks.

255
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,020
I can't wield any influence in the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

256
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,040
I would still need you to help from the inside.

257
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,030
The golden needle and the title of Number One Needle in the World are secondary in importance.

258
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,730
The most important is Xiao Douzi's safety.

259
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:30,090
If Xiao Douzi runs into any dangers, please come find me immediately.

260
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,940
I've tried several times.

261
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,000
Why can't I successfully dye it in the red shade in the rosy dawn?

262
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,160
This fabric looks dull. It doesn't even look as good as the result from an ordinary dye house.

263
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,220
Have I made a mistake in one of the steps?

264
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,560
To dye the red fabric, the ingredients are usually Rubia cordifolia,

265
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,290
red flower, ocher, and Laccifer Lacca.

266
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,400
There is nothing wrong with my dyeing process, either.

267
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,500
All the dyes are distributed by the Directorate of Eunuchs.

268
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,400
So what is the problem?

269
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:48,470
[Embroidered Splendor Blooming Flowers]

270
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,830
What is happening with Xiao Douzi?

271
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,230
Xiao Douzi has been testing her formula day and night.

272
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,500
But the dyed fabric has been dull in the coloring.

273
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,460
He has been very bothered by it.

274
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,000
A kid who still stinks of mother's milk. How dare he challenge me?

275
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,440
He is still green.

276
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,610
He overestimates himself.

277
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,280
Master, the competition starts the day after tomorrow.

278
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,830
Why aren't you making any preparation yet?

279
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:22,360
The timing is just right. There is time to start the preparation now.

280
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,540
I will get some ingredients for you from the Directorate of Eunuchs then.

281
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,330
Go on.

282
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,200
Master, what ingredients do you still need?

283
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,890
Just get a little of all the ingredients.

284
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,830
Yes.

285
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:01,450
This Laccifer Lacca clearly has gotten damp. Take a closer look if you don't believe me.

286
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,460
Using damp Laccifer Lacca to mix the dye, the colors will lose effect.

287
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,740
That's why the red cloth I dyed is dull and not bright at all.

288
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,660
What do you mean by that? You can't dye successfully, so you blame other people.

289
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,490
Laccifer Lacca is the most precious ingredient among all the ingredients here.

290
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,900
We have always stored it carefully.

291
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,190
There have never been any problems.

292
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,900
What? It is useless when you use it?

293
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,200
Say... Either you have a problem in your procedure, or you haven't stored it correctly.

294
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,000
It has nothing to do with us.

295
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,600
Eunuch Yin, if you don't believe me, you can bring some more Laccifer Lacca from the storage.

296
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,200
You'll see as soon as you compare them.

297
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,000
Didn't you already receive all the last of the Laccifer Lacca in storage?

298
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,800
Received it all? When will the new supply arrive then?

299
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,200
At least 10 days even with the fastest speed.

300
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,000
Ten days? How can that be?

301
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Without Laccifer Lacca, I won't be able to dye in red, and it's the best-looking red.

302
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,200
I'm only in charge of the supply storage. I'm not in charge of your dyed fabrics.

303
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,600
Please help me check then, lately who has received Laccifer Lacca?

304
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,220
I will go ask for some to meet my urgent needs.

305
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,310
Only you, there's been no one else.

306
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,400
That's not right.

307
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,000
The box that I just saw in Master's room

308
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,800
should be containing Laccifer Lacca.

309
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,670
Why does Eunuch Yin say that no one else has received it?

310
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,000
Physician Dou.

311
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,400
- Female Office Qiniang is here.
- Eunuch Yin.

312
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,200
What are you picking up today?

313
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,600
Attire Expert Zhuo wants to dye red fabrics, so she ordered me to pick up some

314
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,400
red Rubia cordifolia, flower, ocher, and Laccifer Lacca.

315
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,400
There is no more Laccifer Lacca, but there is plenty of the other ingredients.

316
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,400
If the other ingredients are out, we can manage to think of other ways.

317
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,300
But, without Laccifer Lacca,

318
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,900
Attire Expert Zhuo will scold me when she finds out.

319
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,100
You can go back with ease. Your master won't scold you.

320
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,030
Physician Dou!

321
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,200
Physician Dou, don't be impatient. I know where you can get Laccifer Lacca.

322
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Sister Qiniang, are you thinking of stealing from Attire Expert Zhuo for me?

323
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,000
How do you know that?

324
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,200
Laccifer Lacca is a precious item.

325
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,400
The storage room has always stored it properly, and there has never been any shortage.

326
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,500
With so many coincidences, it's naturally Zhuo Jinniang doing tricks.

327
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,000
Sister, you don't need to take risks for me. Such a trivial matter won't be able to stop me.

328
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,800
Xiao Douzi, why do you have time to come to the East Palace today?

329
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,600
Greetings, Eunuch Wang.

330
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,300
I came today because I'd like to plead to the crown prince for something.

331
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:20,600
It's bad timing. His Majesty isn't feeling well, so His Highness is serving him in his sickbed.

332
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,870
What do you need from Crown Prince? Just tell me.

333
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
I came today because I'm hungry for snacks.

334
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,800
I wanted to ask the crown prince for some berries to eat.

335
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,200
This berry is precious, so I can't find it anywhere else.

336
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,000
But I've seen it a few times here at the crown prince's place.

337
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,600
You... You...

338
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,400
In this entire palace, you are probably the only one who dares to ask Crown Prince for berries to eat.

339
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,800
There are just berries, right? No need to wait for Crown Prince to return.

340
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,100
I'll take care of it for you.

341
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,400
Thank you very much, Eunuch Wang.

342

Mother.

343
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,400
Liuli, what's wrong?

344
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,800
Mother promised me to use the Impatiens balsamina flower to dye my nails.

345
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,200
But the Impatiens balsamina flower has wilted.

346
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Mother, look.

347
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,900
Come.

348
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,600
Don't cry.

349
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
It's all right that the Impatiens balsamina flower has wilted.

350
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,800
Mother has plenty of solutions.

351
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,700
But I love the color of the Impatiens balsamina flower the most.

352
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,600
Yes, you'll have it.

353
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,710
Mother, you are awesome.

354
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,200
You didn't use even one petal of the Impatiens balsamina flower,

355
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,800
but the color you mixed looks the same as the Impatiens balsamina flower.

356
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Among the tens of thousands of things in the word,

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,200
has its own ingenius use.

359
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,500
There isn't anyone or anything

360
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,200
that can't be substituted.

361
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,900
Liuli, when you run into problems in the future,

362
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,200
just calm down and think it over.

363
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,200
You'll be able to think of a solution as a replacement.

364
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,700
- Understand now?
- I understand now.

365
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,660
Look.

366
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,500
- Is it pretty?
- It's pretty.

367
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,800
Mother, thank you for the wisdom that you've imparted.

368
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,800
You've given me the courage to defeat difficulties.

369
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,000
Your spirit in heaven must bless me

370
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000

373
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,200
Today is the first round of competition between Attire Expert Zhuo and Xiao Douzi.

374
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,800
I especially invited two respected Grand Consorts as judges

375
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,000
to show solemnity and impartiality.

376
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,800
Attire Chief Lin,

377
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,000
may I be bold to make an unreasonable request?

378
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,800
Go ahead and say it.

379
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,500
I suggest that our results will be shown in the competition

380
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,400
without letting everyone know who did which one.

381
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,000
This way, it will be the fairest way to judge without having a preconceived impression.

382
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,800
It's not too late to announce the winner at the end of all the rounds.

383
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:31,500
Xiao Douzi, are you doubting the two grand consorts' fairness? Against you,

384
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,200
of course I will win.

385
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,400
I wouldn't need the two grand consorts to favor me.

386
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,600
I'm just afraid that Attire Expert Zhuo won't concede after losing

387
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,600
and complain that the two grand consorts favor me.

388
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,590
She is so clever.

389
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,000
She isn't even afraid that she'll be too boastful and get embarrassed in the end.

390

We won't be biased at all.

Therefore, why don't we do as they say?

393
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
First of all, it will be fair.

394
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,700
Secondly, it will be more amusing.

395
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Your Highness, Talented Lady Wu just sent a messenger saying that His Majesty's high fever won't recede.

- Yes.
- I'm going to the Hall of Immortal Nectar to see His Majesty.

398
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,200
Oh yes, Your Highness. I heard that Xiao Douzi challenged Attire Expert Zhuo in public a few days ago.

399
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,600
He wants to compete for the title of Number One Needle in the World against Attire Expert Zhuo.

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
When did this happen?

401
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,400
They are competing in the first round today. I heard that the winner is based on two out of three rounds.

402
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,800
A few days go, Xiao Douzi came to the East Palace to get some berries but didn't mention this matter.

403
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,100
Probably-Probably he didn't want to let Your Highness get worried.

404
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,600
Xiao Douzi is something.

405
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,600
He has courage and insight.

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,400
Xiao Douzi, you premeditated what just happened. Right?

426

Attire Expert Zhuo, I can guess that I will win,

427
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,670
but I couldn't guess that you would collude with the steward in charge of the supply storage

to do tricks with my Laccifer Lacca.

If you really used the damp Laccifer Lacca,

433
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,380
how did you dye fabric with

434
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,510
such a luxurious sunrise red color?

00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,950
Attire Expert Zhuo, you've confessed without being tortured.

But thanks to Attire Expert Zhuo doing tricks with my Laccifer Lacca,

437

otherwise, how would I have thought of

438
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,840
using grape juice to replace the dye?

that this sunrise red fabric came from your hands.

Replying to Your Majesty. The elixir is still being refined.

504
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,890
I will go rush them now.

505
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,060
Consort Yang.

506
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:08,420
This time, His Majesty's illness is very different from the past.

507
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:12,260
He actually wakes up less, but falls into a deep sleep more.

508
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,320
Imperial Physician Zong, tell me the truth.

509
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,410
How is His Majesty's illness?

510
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:22,740
His Majesty's pulse is erratic and irregular.

511
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,010
I don't have the patience to here your elaborate words.

512
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:28,050
Just tell me if he can be cured this time.

513
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:31,780
His Majesty's vital energy is weak. He's suffering from multiple

514
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,350
organ failures. I'm afraid he doesn't have

515
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:39,160
much more time.

516
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,650
Remember, you must not mention this in front of anyone else.

517
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,070
Yes, I understand.

518
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,090
Leave then.

519
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:01,480
Mother, there isn't much time left for us.

520
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,630
It's not hard to topple Li Zhi,

521
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:07,140
but Wu Meiniang and Pei Xingjian are two big obstacles.

522
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,270
They keep ruining our good plans.

523
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:13,080
Let's first get rid of Wu Meiniang.

524
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,770
And then gid rid of Pei Xingjian.

525
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:21,160
His Majesty has been relying on Wu Meiniang a lot lately,

526
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,360
but has kept more and more distance from me.

527
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,220
I actually have an idea.

528
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,180
Even if His Majesty won't believe you,

529
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,550
he will definitely believe this other person's words.

530
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,140
Your Majesty, are you awake?

531
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:02,100
Reporting to His Majesty. Master of Pure Energy has arrived to offer the elixir.

532
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,440
- Summon him.
- Yes.

533
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,430
Summon him!

534
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,590
Congratulations to Your Majesty.

535
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:28,990
The Red Flame Elixir has finally been refined.

536
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,380
Bring it to me.

537
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,630
Your Majesty, tomorrow night at 11:00 is the auspicious hour that occurs once every hundred years.

538
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:04,800
At that time, using divination to foretell fortune will be most accurate.

539
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,070
Your Majesty should not miss the chance to have your divination read.
