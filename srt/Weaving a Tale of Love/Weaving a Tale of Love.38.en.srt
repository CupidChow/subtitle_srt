00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,390
Meiniang!

7
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,480
Meiniang!

8
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,880
Meiniang!

9
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,360
Replying to His Majesty. Lady of Bright Deportment Wu woke up early in the morning, saying she had to take care of Bao'er.

10
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,630
She ordered us to not disturb you from your deep sleep.

11
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,710
It has been raining for so long.

12
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,960
You can't go and frolic on the mountain.

13
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,020
You must be very depressed!

14
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,920
Lady of Bright Deportment Wu...

15
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,260
What's the matter, so early in the morning, Eunuch Wang?

16
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,200
Reporting to Lady of Bright Deportment Wu.

17
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,150
Lord Magistrate Pei returned.

18
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,550
He is now waiting outside

19
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,620
asking to see His Majesty.

20
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,360
This Wan Niang Palace is administered by Wan Niang Prefecture.

21
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,600
Lord Magistrate Pei is the County Magistrate of Chang'an. He turned up uninvited.

22
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,710
He must have heard that Attire Expert Kudi

23
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,610
has come along with the imperial procession to escape the summer heat in Wan Niang Palace.

24
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,050
What is Shouyue suffering this time for?

25
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,350
Even though he might find a reason to show before His Majesty,

26
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,200
Liulli is here.

27
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,410
How could His Majesty not be aware of the real reason he wants to come here for?

28
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,770
Why haven't you convinced him already?

29
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,940
I tried to... I have tried to use reasoning with him.

30
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,460
But this time, Lord Magistrate Pei is so determined to see His Majesty.

31
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,770
I am afraid he doesn't even try to make up an excuse anymore!

32
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,980
It's as if he wants to speak bluntly.

33
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,660
In fact, Lord Magistrate Pei returned yesterday.

34
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,740
I didn't even dare to report this to His Majesty.

35
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,630
But who would have even imagined that he would have been waiting in the rain for the entire night?

36
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,090
I did not have the heart to leave him hanging like that,

37
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,200
so I promised I would report.

38
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,550
By no means can you let His Majesty know that Lord Magistrate Pei showed up here.

39
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,330
Yes.

40
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,050
His Majesty should also be awake already. Go attend him.

41
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,730
I will also come in a little later.

42
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,630
Yes.

43
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,070
Yu Liu... help me run some errands.

44
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,220
Attire Expert Kudi knows that Your Majesty can't withstand the summer heat.

45
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,060
They are especially using improved thin muslin silk to make this coat.

46
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,870
When worn, it is calm and cool.

47
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,100
It's been already five years.

48
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,670
Liuli still doesn't want to accept my heart.

49
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,240
I can't bear forcing her.

50
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,660
I am unwilling to let her go, for her to be with Pei Xingjian.

51
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,030
I am afraid she is bored in the palace,

52
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,230
that's why I especially brought her to Wan Nian Palace to escape the summer heat.

53
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,250
I didn't actually want her to do this laborious work of crafting clothes for me.

54
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,820
A'Sheng, you don't have to attend to me.

55
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,640
When you have time, accompany Liuli in her strolls.

56
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,760
I tried to convince her to move around a little bit,

57
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,310
come have a chat with Your Majesty and Lady of Bright Deportment Wu.

58
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,630
What did she say?

59
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,320
She said she did not like lively environments.

60
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,330
Yesterday, she even especially moved into the highest elevated Dressing Tower.

61
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,380
Attire Expert Kudi said that even though the Dress Tower is far from the main hall,

62
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,900
but the ground is high, the view is nice, and there is no one to interrupt.

63
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,620
She wants to draw a landscape image there,

64
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,950
make it into a screen as a birthday present for Your Majesty.

65
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,360
Your Majesty!

66
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,630
- What happened, Meiniang?
- Our precious dove, Bao'er, is missing.

67
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,530
I have been looking for it all over. I don't know where it flew to.

68
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,740
How is this a good sign?

69
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,730
Could it be that it missed the palace and returned to it by itself?

70
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,230
Don't be alarmed, Meiniang!

71
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,210
Wait a while. I will send people to look for it.

72
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,450
A'Sheng, go!

73
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,890
Yes.

74
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,760
This is something Lady of Bright Deportment Wu ordered me to hand over to you.

75
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,970
She said that when you saw this,

76
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,500
you would know what you have to do.

77
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,320
[Dressing Tower]

78
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,560
It has already been raining for seven days, without any break.

79
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,960
Moreover, it has been raining even more.

80
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,340
I actually like rain.

81
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,050
The rain hinders the journey on the mountain path.

82
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,580
No people have come as of late because of it.

83
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,380
Attire Expert Kudi!

84
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,390
Attire Expert Kudi?

85
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,460
How come you are here, during such a big storm!

86
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,130
I have heard that you wanted coal and oil.

87
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,540
I have prepared it and asked people to bring it.

88
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,050
I have asked people to put it in the back storage.

89
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,710
Attire Expert Kudi, you can use it whenever you like.

90
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,390
These are small matters. You didn't need to bring them, Eunuch Wang.

91
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,760
Look at you, you are all soaked!

92
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,990
His Majesty heard you needed charcoal for the stove.

93
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,980
He's afraid it is cold here and you would get chilled.

94
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,780
If it is so,

95
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,590
let me take you down the mountain.

96
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,370
I need charcoal so I can brew some gelatin.

97
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,140
Once the gelatin is brewed, I dilute it with alum water,

98
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,750
using a brush to brush layer by layer on the silk fabric.

99
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,040
Once the silk is brushed and dried, then I can draw on it.

100
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,620
Those oils have other purposes.

101
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,020
They can warm the plates when I dissolve the paints.

102
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,240
Before you even pick up the drawing brush, there are already so many steps in order to make the screen.

103
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,860
My brain hurts by just listening to it.

104
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,090
This is you being crafty,

105
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,930
and you have this much patience.

106
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,300
Eunuch Wang, Lord Magistrate Pei Xingjian of  Chang'an came.

107
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,000
He said there is an urgent matter he needs to report to His Majesty.

108
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,860
I got it.

109
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,060
Attire Expert Kudi, I still have other affairs. I will leave now.

110
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,900
If you still need anything, ask someone to tell me.

111
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,360
Thank you, Eunuch Wang. The grounds are slippery with rain.

112
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,190
Take care on your way, Eunuch Wang!

113
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,840
Yes.

114
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,410
It is not time. You cannot be in a rush.

115
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,780
If you can see Liuli, it is your good fortune.

116
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:27,710
If you overstep even a bit, beware that you will hurt yourself and hurt other people.

117
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,860
Look, Your Majesty.

118
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,620
This really is Bao'er.

119
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,920
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
🧵Team 7️⃣ Needles & Threads🧵 @ Viki.com

120
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,410
Shouyue, where did you find Bao'er?

121
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,950
I heard that His Majesty had asked people to look for Bao'er.

122
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,750
I remembered that Bao'er used to fly between Ganye Temple and Taiji Palace

123
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,900
to pass messages many times between Your Majesty and Lady of Bright Deportment Wu.

124
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,810
It is as long ago as two years.

125
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,840
I didn't think I would really find Bao'er.

126
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,120
How did I not think of Ganye Temple?

127
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,970
It looks like Bao'er regards friendship highly.

128
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,980
It still remembered the road to Ganye Temple. On a rainy day, it still flew so far.

129
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,200
Meiniang, now you can be at ease.

130
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,390
Bao'er is mine and Your Majesty's bird.

131
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,550
In my hardest times,

132
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,540
it saw my friendship with Your Majesty.

133
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,720
If you had gone missing, I would be thinking of you deeply.

134
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,310
This time is all thanks to Lord Magistrate Pei.

135
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,520
Shouyue,

136
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,760
thank you.

137
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,100
I will be taking my leave.

138
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,100
It is a rainy night tonight. The road is slippery.

139
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,890
Your Majesty, the night road is not easy to travel.

140
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,010
How about...

141
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,690
Shouyue, you should stay here at Wan Nian Palace tonight.

142
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,800
When the weather gets better tomorrow, then go back.

143
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

144
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,260
Eunuch Wang ordered the kitchen to make cold noodles for you, Lord Magistrate Pei.

145
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,490
Please enjoy, Pei Mingfu.

146
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,600
- Thank you.
- Yes.

147
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,180
This guest room is really elegant. It does not look like a temporary stay.

148
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,760
I wonder who lived here before?

149
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,880
This room's location is good and the scenery is nice.

150
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,090
It was for Attire Expert Kudi to live in.

151
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:01,690
I don't know why but Attire Expert Kudi had insisted on moving to Dressing Tower at the mountain top.

152
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,490
Mountain top?

153
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,330
Then is it not far from the stay? Is it not convenient?

154
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,810
That's right. The mountain trail is winding, and there have been rainstorms for days.

155
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,490
It's extremely difficult to go through, so few people go there.

156
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,990
Attire Expert Kudi prefers quiet. Even when His Majesty holds a feast and invites her,

157
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,970
she is drawing peacefully up the mountain.

158
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,180
Look. That high place where it's lit, that's Dressing Tower.

159
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,100
Tonight's rain is heavy, so you cannot see clearly.

160
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,290
♫  As long as I close my eyes  ♫

161
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,640
♫  I can see you back  ♫

162
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,400
♫  as you rush forward without a care   ♫

163
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,720
♫  as you rush forward without a care   ♫

164
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,070
♫  You pass by the wind if the flowers are like falling   ♫

165
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,820
♫  I think it's all my fault   ♫

166
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,710
♫  I can’t see you smiling while sad   ♫

167
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,130
♫  I can’t see you smiling while sad   ♫

168
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,080
It is late. Outside is full of lightning.

169
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,350
Sitting in front of the open window, be careful not to catch a cold.

170
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,840
Everyone down the mountain is already sleeping. You should also sleep early.

172
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,940
♫  But I love you more than all this   ♫

173
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,990
Why is the room you used to stay in lit up?

174
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,090
Is it Lord Magistrate Pei?

175
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:45,280
♫  To guard with my back   ♫

176
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,920

♫  Flowers that can’t be blown by the wind   ♫

178
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,620
Tonight's road is hard to go on.

179
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,880
I think His Majesty must have had him stay for a night.

180
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,800
It is him. It must be him.

181
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:20,030
Look. Lord Magistrate Pei has also turned off his light and gone to sleep.

182
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,360
You should also sleep early.

183
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,680
Mountain flash flood. It is a mountain flash flood!

184
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,510
Liuli.

185
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,620
What's wrong?

186
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,140
The mountain flash flood has come! Everyone hurry up and beat your metal pans!

187
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,920
Report to the people down the mountain! Hurry!

188
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,710
Hurry!

189
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,010
Liuli! Liuli!

190
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,720
Liuli! Stop!

191
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,560
Where are you going? It is so late and there is a mountain flash flood!

192
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,160
Are you looking for death?!

193
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,400
I have to go down the mountain to save people. Pei Xingjian is still there!

194
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,130
Liuli, don't go! Come back!

195
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,040
Liuli!

196
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,490
It is you.

197
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,250
It really is you.

198
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,290
Sorry.

199
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,470
I have come late.

200
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,570
Lord Magistrate Pei, hurry up and take Liuli and leave!

201
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,720
The world is big. Go wherever you want!

202
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,170
Today, this rain will cause many deaths.

203
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:14,000
Hurry up and leave! No one will know the truth!

204
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,260
The chance is hard to find and it won't come again.

205
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,490
Hurry up and leave!

206
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,630
Hurry up and leave!

207
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,970
Mountain flash flood! Mountain flash flood!

208
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,170
Hurry up and leave! Mountain flash flood!

209
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,050
Hurry up and leave!

210
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,010
Leave! Leave!

211
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,770
Mountain flash flood! Hurry up and leave!

212
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,450
Mountain flash flood! Hurry up and leave!

213
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,990
Mountain flash flood! Hurry up and leave!

214
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,210
Your Majesty, why is there so much water?

215
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:17,530
Your Majesty, the outside is about to be flooded!

216
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,400
Replying to Your Majesty and Lady of Bright Deportment Wu. It's completely dark on the mountain.

217
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,000
You cannot see the mountain road clearly.

218
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,570
Many people who have escaped up the mountain have also been flushed away.

219
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,650
This is more ominous than propitious. What should we do?

220
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,170
- Where's Pei Xingjian?
- How did I forget about Lord Magistrate Pei?

221
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,780
Shulan, hurry up and find Lord Magistrate Pei!

222
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,020
I have already looked for him. He is not in the room.

223
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,920
- Look again!
- Don't look!

224
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,480
This is fate and the people's thoughts.

225
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,400
He probably has already taken Liuli to leave faraway.

226
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,860
This is also good. They used this time to make it good.

227
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,920
Your Majesty, it is urgent! Let's hurry up and leave.

228
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:15,100
Forgive me for coming late to save Your Majesty. Please come with Lady of Bright Deportment Wu to follow me quickly out of here.

229
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,390
Shouyue?

230
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,440
Your Majesty, you should not stay here long.

231
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,010
I will take Your Majesty and Lady of Bright Deportment Wu to go up the mountain.

232
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,690
The mountain road is winding and muddy, and the rainstorm is huge.

233
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,530
You cannot see the road clearly. How can you go up the mountain?

234
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,390
Liuli has already thought of a plan.

235
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,570
Please come outside. You will know once you see it.

236
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,000
Hurry up and look there is firelight up the mountain! We can see the road!

237
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,400
We have hope!

238
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,200
Hurry up and go!

239
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,700
We have hope! Everyone let's go!

240
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,200
Your Majesty, let's hurry up and go.

241
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
[Hall of Magnificent Sky]

242
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,800
Isn't that Dressing Tower?

243
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,700
Liuli, Liuli is still up there!

244
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,200
Your Majesty and Lady of Bright Deportment Wu, rest assured.

245
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,900
Liuli is fine. She set fire to Dressing Tower to light the way for Your Majesty and Lady of Bright Deportment Wu.

246
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,400
This is what Liuli came up with.

247
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,200
In order to make a painting, Attire Expert Kudi asked for coal and oil.

248
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,000
I can't believe it has been used for this!

249
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,900
Shouyue!

250
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,200
I thank you.

251
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,800
And I represent everyone else who is rescued tonight

252
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,700
to thank you guys.

253
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,500
You're welcome, Your Majesty.

254
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,000
Please follow me, Your Majesty.

255
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,200
Your Majesty.

256
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,030
Your Majesty, the mountain flash flood is dangerous. Please hold onto my arm.

257
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,400
I'll take you up the mountain.

258
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,400
Your Majesty, Attire Expert Kudi has arrived.

259
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,430
Greetings, Your Majesty.

260
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,800
No need to be so formal.

261
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,800
The thunderstorm of a few days ago,

262
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,200
you and Shouyue saved Meiniang and me and everyone else.

263
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,000
I have asked you to come so I can reward you.

264
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,400
As to what to reward, I have thought hard a few days.

265
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,750
I am in Your Majesty's service, so I'm just doing my duty.

266
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,000
I don't dare to ask for any reward.

267
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,800
At the Bureau of Imperial Attire, everything is well.

268
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,400
You have already given more than enough. There is nothing missing.

269
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,100
So, Your Majesty, you really don't need to give anything.

270
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,550
Your answer really is as expected.

271
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,800
Ever since I have become emperor,

272
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,000
you and me, Shouyue and me...

273
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,300
You guys have all been really formal.

274
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,300
Only greetings, there is less friendship.

275
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,800
I really miss the days before becoming emperor,

276
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,400
the moments at East Palace.

277
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,200
That was when I was young and naive.

278
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,600
Liuli, you don't need to be so careful in front of me.

279
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,600
Liuli, you say you have nothing to ask for. You don't need anything,

280
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,000
but I have thought of a reward.

281
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,600
It must be what you want most.

282
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,200
It is just that I am hesitant.

283
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,800
I really am not willing to reward it to you.

284
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
Have you thought clearly?

285
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,400
If you reject now, don't regret it later on.

286
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,400
How about I take back the reward I thought of now?

287
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,200
Your Majesty, you still have not said what you will reward me.

288
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,600
Why-Why have you taken it back?

289
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:00,260
You just said you didn't want rewards. Why are you changing your mind now?

290
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,300
It has been five years.

291
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,800
You have been doing what you should in the palace all this time.

292
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,800
You've lived a life that asks not and wants not, plain as water.

293
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,860
Only in the moment just now,

294
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,990
at that moment,

295
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I saw that active Liuli.

296
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,600
The Liuli with hope in her eyes.

297
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:37,620
I shouldn't trap you in this palace.

298
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,400
As you wish,

299
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,600
I reward you to leave the palace.

300
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,400
For you to live the life you want.

301
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,300
See the person you want to see.

302
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,000
Is what Your Majesty speaking of real?

303
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,100
That is my true intention.

304
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

305
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,200
Thank you, Your Majesty, for the reward.

306
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:28,780
This time you have done great things. The reward cannot be less.

307
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,200
The jewelry behind me is used by the royal harem.

308
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,500
I especially reward it to you.

309
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,200
If there is a day where we see each other again,

310
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,400
I hope the person standing in front of me

311
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,600
is still this beautiful Liuli.

312
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,810
Thank you, Your Majesty.

313
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,100
Stand up.

314
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:26,700
After you leave the palace, without my protection,

315
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,800
you have to be safe and happy.

316
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,000
Whatever is yours, will be yours in the end.

317
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,970
It is returning to its rightful owner.

318
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

319
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,900
Have a look.

320
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,000
All these years, I've been fortunate to have Sister Wu take care of me.

321
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,600
I dare not say a simple thank you for such benevolence.

322
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,400
This time I am leaving the palace. I am not sure when we will meet again.

323
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,000
I hope you will have good health.

324
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,800
You and Shouyue have mutual affection.

325
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:41,200
Loved ones should be together. I am happy for you.

326
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,400
Liuli, you are sensitive more than men

327
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:55,100
to speak frankly. I really don't want you to leave.

328
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,600
But everyone has one's own aspiration.

329
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,200
I can only hope you will do as you want.

330
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,400
But after you leave this palace gate,

331
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,800
His Majesty and I cannot protect you any longer.

332
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,200
You have to be well.

333
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:25,400
Thank you, Attire Expert Kudi, for saving our lives.

334
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,080
We three can never return back to the very beginning.

335
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:48,260
Your Majesty, are you regretting it?

336
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:58,060
For those two to be happy, it's better than for the three of us to stay in pain.

337
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,580
Letting Liuli leave the palace to be together with Shouyue,

338
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:08,130
is something I am perfectly happy with.

345
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,200

uncontrollable as it turns into a haze  ♫

351
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Liuli, do you know how scared I have been these days?

352
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,800
I was scared I would miss the only chance to take you with me!

353
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,800
If His Majesty hadn't let you leave the palace,

354
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,000
I would have regretted it my whole life.

355
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,100
I wouldn't be able to find a way to forgive myself.

356
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,600
Your explanations sound beautiful.

357
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,800
I don't believe you would have disregarded all those people's lives

358
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,300
and taken me away.

359
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,300
I never regretted risking my life to go down the mountain to save people.

360
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,700
What I regret...

361
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,200
was that I didn't take you away.

362
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,800
I, once known as Attire Expert Kudi, have lost my official position.

363
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,800
I have also become a poor and humble Hu woman.

364
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,200
I don't know how Lord Magistrate Pei will find a suitable place for me.

365
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,400
Liuli,

366
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,100
I want to make you my wife.

367
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,000
We will never be separated from life until death. Are you willing?

368
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,700
I am willing.

369
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,300
♫  I only wish to be together with you hand in hand  ♫

370
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,200
In case you don't know,

371
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,000
I am the famous disaster star in Chang'an City.

372
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,500
When we are together, we are fated to have turbulence.

373
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,750
Are you afraid?

374
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,410
Having you by my side

375
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,800
there's nothing I will fear.

376
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:22,620
♫  I only wish to be together with you hand in hand  ♫

377

[Su Manor]

379
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,600
[Hall of Great Ideals]

380
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,400
Master. Madam.

381
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,200
This is Attire Expert Kudi, the one I want to get married to.

382
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,600
Greetings General Su. Greetings Madam.

383
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,000
All right. All right.

384
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,710
Shouyue has talked about the hardship you've encountered.

385
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,000
Shouyue's mother and father have passed away a long time ago.

386
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,400
Besides the clan members, he has no other family members.

387
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,000
Ah, right! Regarding your wedding, either my wife or I

388
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,500
will arrange it for you.

389
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,600
There's a separate yard to Shouyue's residence.

390
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,800
We have already discussed it over with Shouyue.

391
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,000
Before getting married, you may spend a few days in our manor.

392
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,900
When the big day arrives, you should return to your father's house,

393
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,800
and wait for Shouyue to help you cross the threshold with the big sedan.

394
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,800
Thank you for your good intentions, General Su, Madam.

395
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,300
But in fact, I don't want to return to my father's house.

396
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,600
I also don't want to bother General Su.

397
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,000
How about Shouyue sends me to my uncle's house, for a short period?

398
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,400
He has opened up a silk fabric shop in the West Market.

399
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
My uncle's family really dotes on me.

400
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,900
If they are to know I will live there, they will for sure be very excited!

401
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,800
Liuli, we want you to live here for your own good.

402
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,190
Also, for your family's safety.

403
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,400
Liuli, you must know, that getting married to Shouyue overnight

404
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,400
you will become a thorn in the eyes of

405
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,800
Duke of Hedong's household and the Zhongjuan branch of the Pei clan.

406
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,600
You must know that Shouyue's first wife, Lu Qiniang,

407
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,100
had been hounded to death by them.

408
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,900
Shouyue, so you have been married before.

409
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,000
Liuli, at that time, I had come to Chang'an to take the Imperial Civil Examination

410
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,400
and to marry. That's why I accidentally met you.

411
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,700
The reason I did not tell you about Qiniang...

412
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,000
First of all, I could not find the appropriate timing.

413
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,700
Secondly, Qiniang's death...

414
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,500
has always been a deep thorn hidden in my heart.

415
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:04,000
Years ago, Shouyue's father and older brother planned to surrender to Great Tang.

416
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,600
They were executed along with three generations by Wang Shichong.  (Wang tried to reign after the fall of Sui dynasty)

417
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,800
At that time, the Xijuan Pei branch of the  Pei family's patriarch, Duke Pei, was respected.

418
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,600
Shouyue's mother entrusted him to Duke Pei.

419
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,000
Emperor Gaozu and Shouyue's father were old friends.

420
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,200
Later, the emperor posthumously promoted Shouyue's father, and after Duke Pei's persuasion,

421
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,000
also returned the estate.

422
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,300
Duke Pei promised that

423
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:32,100
when Shouyue is married, the estate would be returned to him.

424
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,000
How much is this estate?

425
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It's not important how big this estate is. I don't really care.

426
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,800
It's just that Father and Older Brother's failed revolt

427
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,200
dragged down the Zhongjuan branch of the Pei clan. Some were stripped of their properties and others were executed.

428
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,300
As the heir of Zhongjuan Pei, I am obligated to take care of them.

429
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,200
Therefore, my mother arranged for my marriage with Qiniang early on,

430
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,200
so I could get the assets and be the owner of Pei.

431
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,600
If I remember correctly, the Duke of Hedong, son of Minister Pei,

432
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:08,000
married the Grand Princess Linhai, who is the current emperor's aunt.

433
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,800
Princess Mother-in-Law, you told me to pay attention to Pei Shouyue's marriage situation.

434
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,400
This daughter-in-law dares not slack.

435
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,800
So I have something to report to Princess Mother-in-Law.

436
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,400
That Lu Qiniang has been dead for many years.

437
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,400
Pei Shouyue has stayed single all this time.

438
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,600
Could it be that he plans to remarry?
