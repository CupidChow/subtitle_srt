[Weaving a Tale of Love]

00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,090
[Episode 28]

4
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:39,010
[Hall of Immortal Nectar]

5
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,950
Your Majesty, are you having headaches again?

6
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,860
How about...

7
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,120
With the success of Great Tang,

8
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,520
to sincerely pray to the Supreme Deity,

9
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,960
to be told Great Tang's future fortune,

10
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,710
and hope the Supreme Deity will share the wisdom.

11
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,790
What does God say?

12
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,140
God has already said his words. Please have a look, Your Majesty.

13
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,820
After three generations of Tang,

14
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,620
Female ruler, Wu.

15
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,230
After three generations of Tang,

16
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,340
Female ruler, Wu.

17
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,320
Your Majesty, I protect Great Tang.

18
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,240
I am not afraid to reveal God's plans.

19
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,660
It is Your Majesty's heart as well as Great Tang's heart.

20
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,920
Do you have a consort in the royal harem with the surname Wu?

21
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,720
If you do, I am afraid you have to be prepared.

22
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,270
It is better to be prepared.

23
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,600
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

24
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,700
Your Majesty.

25
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,080
[After three generations of Tang, Female ruler Wu.]

26
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,010
I am tired.

27
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,800
Please take me back to rest.

28
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,530
Yes.

29
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,760
Consort Yang, I have already gotten a hold of the news.

30
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,830
There is no problem. Everything was a success.

31
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,530
Ming'er finally has done something successfully.

32
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,680
Even if Talented Lady Wu is Zhuge (historical figure of wisdom) reincarnated,

33
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,740
she probably won't be able to live.

34
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,440
I especially sent people to find mint from the damp wilderness.

35
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,590
Please bring it back for me, Eunuch Gao.

36
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,310
Mint? Isn't this a medicinal herb?

37
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,000
This is the first time I have seen one fresh.

38
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,530
Please have a smell, Eunuch Gao.

39
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,640
The smell is fresh. The smell is cool.

40
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,820
It makes people awake and full of energy.

41
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,110
This is really wonderful.

42
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,840
Most people dry mint to make medicine.

43
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,260
Yet they don't know that fresh ones also have many benefits.

44
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,770
The most interesting way is to put it on the desk.

45
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,080
It can help you relax and be awake.

46
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,370
Today, His Majesty is not well.

47
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,240
He often sleeps and doesn't awake easily.

48
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,380
I especially found this.

49
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,610
Please bring it back, Euncuh Gao. Then put it by His Majesty's side.

50
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,660
I hope it will help His Majesty's health.

51
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,060
Talented Lady Wu, why don't you wait till tomorrow?

52
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,200
You can bring it to His Majesty yourself.

53
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,160
It is can also let His Majesty know of your sincerity.

54
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,570
Bringing it to him a day earlier will benefit His Majesty's health a day earlier.

55
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,370
As for who sends it, there is no difference.

56
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,930
Talented Lady Wu, you think of His Majesty in everything.

57
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,580
Yet you never fight with the sisters in the palace. I am touched.

58
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,920
Talented Lady Wu, let's have a talk privately.

59
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,380
I have an urgent matter to inform you.

60
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,520
- This is–
- It must be Prince of Cao and his mother's doing.

61
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,450
After three generations of Tang, female ruler Wu.

62
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,710
This is too absurd.

63
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,780
Since history, there has never been a female ruler.

64
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,540
His Majesty is wise. He obviously won't believe it.

65
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,580
Crown Prince, you are missing something.

66
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,820
This involves the country.

67
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,760
Also, this message was shown to His Majesty when he was ill.

68
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,780
His Majesty will surely believe it and

69
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,350
will take precautions.

70
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,890
Talented Lady Wu, your concerns are with reason.

71
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,190
Although it is a scheme, the danger in this

72
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,650
is that it is only words and cannot be proven.

73
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,190
You have to be careful because the meaning cannot be erased.

74
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,820
Compared to the country and the capital's safety, the royal harem's

75
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,380
women seem to be weak.

76
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,690
Even if this woman

77
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,930
is liked by His Majesty.

78
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,880
This is what I am also concerned about.

79
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,280
I think His Majesty has already come to a decision.

80
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,760
His Majesty's death day

81
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,550
will be my death time.

82
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,830
Whether it is three feet of white silk (strangled) or a cup of poison,

83
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,380
His Majesty will surely kill me before he dies,

84
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,640
in order to rest in peace.

85
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,560
His Majesty won't be this confused.

86
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,180
Today, His Majesty has gifted me many things.

87
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,580
I think he feels guilty towards me.

88
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,810
Before he kills me, he wants to

89
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,910
comfort me.

90
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,710
As long as he wants me dead, I have to die.

91
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,270
Maybe this is my fate.

92
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,290
No.

93
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,610
I have to find His Majesty to clear it up. I have to expose this absurd saying.

94
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,180
Your Highness. Your Highness!

95
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,400
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

96
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,190
His Majesty has not yet said anything and has not passed any orders.

97
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,650
What do you want to say?

98
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,280
I have a plan we can try.

99
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,440
After His Majesty was ill, the person in the royal harem

100
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,980
who was the most hard-working was Talented Lady Wu.

101
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,790
His Majesty's rewards today

102
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,550
mean that he feels guilty towards you and doesn't dare touch you.

103
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,360
Even if he has made a choice,

104
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,790
but as long as his health is well and is not at risk,

105
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,450
he won't hurry to kill you.

106
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,660
The interpreter said

107
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,600
after three generations of Tang, a female ruler Wu.

108
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,440
His Majesty is Tang's second ruler.

109
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,490
As long as His Majesty's health is good,

110
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,980
then I can live for a few more days perhaps.

111
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,120
So, what we have to do is make His Majesty believe that his health is well first,

112
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,070
and he won't be in a hurry to kill you.

113
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,070
This way, we can only have time to plan for the second move.

114
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,540
- Then what about the second move?
- The second move...

115
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,410
Sorry, Talented Lady Wu.

116
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,310
In the time of death, if I can live,

117
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,490
I can suffer.

118
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,260
The second competition...

119
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,660
is to make a dress

120
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,520
to match the red shawl made previously.

121
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,850
The pattern cannot be repeated.

122
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,610
As long as it is what the consorts wear daily, it will be okay.

123
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,240
This problem seems to be simple,

124
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,260
but it makes people nervous and not know where to start.

125
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,400
- Qiniang.
- Yes?

126
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,000
What type of dress do you think Xiao Douzi will make?

127
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,350
Should I make the same as her,

128
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,060
or should I avoid her?

129
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,880
You ask like this. I also don't know what to answer.

130
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,090
Useless!

131
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,090
You don't know anything I ask!

132
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,720
I ask you to do stuff and you don't do any of it well!

133
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,280
I asked you to spy on Xiao...

134
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,490
I asked you to spy on Xiao Douzi's actions.

135
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,700
She used grape as dye, such a big matter. You also didn't know!

136
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,900
It caused me to be careless and lose the competition!

137
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,980
Usually, you are protective of her!

138
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,200
Say! Are you helping the outsider?!

139
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,280
I...

140
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,470
Master, please reconsider! I have not been insincere!

141
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,780
Leave!

142
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,340
Useless thing! I don't need you to serve me in the future!

143
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,090
- I...
- Leave!

144
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,910
Such a temper!

145
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,020
Hurry up and leave!

146
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,410
Let's go back.

147
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,600
Your Majesty.

148
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,440
Your Majesty.

149
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,300
Eunuch Gao, His Majesty has awoken.

150
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,990
I have been sleeping a lot lately.

151
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,040
Why have I slept so long again?

152
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,360
Your Majesty manages everything every day and has become overworked

153
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,150
so it has made you overly tired.

154
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,870
Your Majesty, from a skilled person,

155
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,720
I have asked for miraculous medicine.

156
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,340
Your Majesty, as long as you eat it for 7 days, you will be cured.

157
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,920
If you eat it every day, you can also become younger.

158
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,220
Your Majesty,

159
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,090
I have already asked the Imperial Academy of Medicine to check it.

160
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,160
This elixir is refined from several dozen precious ingredients.

161
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,460
It can help your health a lot. Please feel safe to take it.

162
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,210
Thank you, Talented Lady.

163
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,910
What happened to your arm, Talented Lady?

164
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,430
There is nothing.

165
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,540
You have already been injured this much, and you call it nothing?

166
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,890
Say, what happened?

167
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,770
A few days ago, I got injured accidentally.

168
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,400
There is nothing big. You don't need to worry, Your Majesty.

169
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,300
Tell me the truth.

170
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,410
To find a skilled person,

171
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,350
I begged him for medicine.

172
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,080
He said this medicine is not ordinary.

173
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,860
This is because it needs a young, rich girl

174
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,990
to use their own blood as medicine.

175
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,210
They also have to pray in front of Buddha, and promise

176
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,580
then they can only use it as medicine.

177
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,360
You are saying the miraculous medicine I just had

178
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,950
was made with your fresh blood?

179
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,180
If my sincerity

180
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,850
can exchange your health's well being,

181
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,840
this is nothing.

182
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,650
Talented Lady, you are so nice to me.

183
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,730
But I...

184
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,670
I have made you suffer.

185
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,350
Your Majesty, what are you saying?

186
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,330
You have cared for me so much, Your Majesty.

187
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,140
A few days ago, you rewarded me much. There isn't any suffering.

188
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,560
A'Bi must have been ordered by Master.

189
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,940
They want to find clues about Xiao Douzi's sewing.

190
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,450
It looks like Master is suspicious of me.

191
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,390
Who is it?

192
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,810
Attire Expert Zhuo, it is me, A'Bi.

193
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,140
Say.

194
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,250
Reply to Attire Expert Zhuo. The place where Xiao Douzi hides things, I have already searched.

195
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,540
I didn't find anything.

196
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,720
These few days, her actions have been mysterious.

197
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,150
She also hasn't been making clothes in the main room.

198
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,020
I don't know what the dress she made looks like.

199
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,250
I have watched carefully these days.

200
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,010
Xiao Douzi leaves early and comes back late. Her eyes are already red.

201
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,490
She also carries a bag with her always.

202
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,330
It never leaves her side.

203
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,990
I think... inside it must be the dress.

204
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,470
Leaves early and comes back late?

205
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,760
Eyes red?

206
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,440
This Xiao Douzi's sews fast.

207
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,000
Yet she rushes to sew day and night,

208
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,300
it must be a complicated and delicate dress.

209
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,270
But... when the consorts gave out the problem, didn't they say

210
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,700
that this dress doesn't need to be so complicated?

211
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,210
Matching the fabric made before

212
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,930
it will be good if you match the clothes the consorts usually wear.

213
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,090
What do you understand?

214
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,730
Xiao Douzi must have thought that I would make a simple dress

215
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,860
so she used a lot of strength.

216
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,880
He wanted to use this chance to make my skills less superior to his.

217
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:13,420
The consorts, although they say it like so,

218
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,500
but once they see a beautiful dress,

219
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,920
they will like it.

220
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,090
You are right, Attire Expert Zhuo. I have spoken too lightly.

221
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,700
A'Bi, help me well.

222
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,080
Don't be like Qiniang.

223
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,780
Qiniang is not talented and does things too slowly.

224
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,220
She is indecisive and can't be trusted with important tasks.

225
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,370
As long as you are loyal to me,

226
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,320
I will use you a lot and help you.

227
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,560
I won't let you down.

228
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,880
I will do my best to help you.

229
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,000
Okay. Leave.

230
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,390
It looks like my dress...

231
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,700
It is embroidered too simple still.

232
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,720
Xiao Douzi.

233
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,240
Qiniang, you shouldn't find me in the future;

234
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,130
or else, you will get scolded by Zhuo Jinniang again.

235
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,010
Master has already started to be suspicious of me.

236
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,920
Even the person who serves by her side has changed to A'Bi.

237
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,220
Master kept from me that she asked A'Bi to investigate your sewing.

238
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,790
You have to be careful.

239
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,880
Since you know that Zhuo Jinniang has become suspicious of you,

240
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,090
why do you still come here?

241
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,200
If she knows that you are still protecting me,

242
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,250
you will have to be scolded again.

243
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,640
Xiao Douzi, you're not angry at me anymore?

244
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,730
You didn't know how important this golden needle was to me.

245
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,770
So you listened to Pei Xingjian.

246
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,160
If you want to blame anyone, then blame Pei Xingjian.

247
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,130
You wanted good for me. You wanted me to be out of danger.

248
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,930
Sister,

249
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:56,050
in the future, you should look after yourself first. Don't mind me.

250
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:59,290
For the competition, I have my own sense.

251
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,890
Xiao Douzi, these days you weren't in the sewing room.

252
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,840
Where are you hiding to sew?

253
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,330
I know Zhuo Jinniang is trying to find me.

254
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,790
She wants to know what type of dress I am making.

255
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,120
I'm hiding in the Courtyard of Misfortune. I want to make her super worried.

256
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,820
Attire Expert Zhuo is working all day on the dress in the small sewing room. She doesn't even leave the room.

257
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,490
She is determined to defeat you.

258
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:34,390
This is the dress you are making?

259
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,800
In order for her not to do something, I bring it every day, wherever I go.

260
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,530
Even when eating, washing, and sleeping, I have it by my side.

261
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,070
Let's see what way she has.

262
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,300
Now that you say, I am even more curious.

263
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,550
What dress can make you go out early and come back late, and not being able to see you for several days?

264
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:58,260
Can... I have a look?

265
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,460
No, no. Wait two more days.

266
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:06,200
Then when it is the competition, I will show it. It will surprise you, for sure.

267
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,030
It looks like not only are you taking caution against others, but also me.

268
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,320
If I knew, I shouldn't have asked.

269
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,780
I'm just asking for a rebuff.

270
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,560
Don't get angry. If you really want to know,

271
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,450
I won't hide it.

272
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:30,530
But the dress I am making is the most simple white dress.

273
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,220
There is nothing special.

274
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,000
Are you lying to me?

275
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,880
Why would you make it so simple?

276
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,070
It is not that I am simple, it is to match.

277
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,440
This time's dress is used to match the red shawl.

278
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,440
The red shawl is already elegant and unordinary.

279
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,260
If I use another elegant, unordinary dress to match it,

280
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,880
It will overwhelm the primary theme. It violates a major rule in dressmaking.

281
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,560
Xiao Douz, not only are your sewing skills good,

282
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,820
your thoughts are strong and you have great daring! I admire you.

283
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,690
If you say it like so, your dress should have already been finished.

284
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,200
Why are you so busy?

285
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,000
How am I busy? I am not busy one bit.

286
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,390
I only pretended in order to scare Zhuo Jinniang.

287
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,900
Zhuo Jinniang also knows overwhelming the primary theme violates a major dressmaking rule.

288
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,760
But the busier I am, the more nervous she gets.

289
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,820
She will think all she can to make the most elegant, unordinary dress.

290
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,230
Yet she doesn't know, the more effort she puts,

291
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,080
the higher the chance of her losing.

292
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,990
His Majesty, today you look

293
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,670
better than yesterday.

294
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,580
Talented Lady's miraculous medicine really is useful.

295
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:15,240
I only ate it for 2 days and I already feel much better.

296
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,930
I also don't know where Talented Lady found this skilled person.

297
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,360
Where's Talented Lady?

298
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,720
Ask to see Talented Lady.

299
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,750
A'Quan, you go yourself.

300
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,800
Select a few high-quality tribute jades, also ten bolts of silk fabrics,

301
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,960
ten hanging pearls, ten strands of agate.

302
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,100
I will go now.

303
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,630
Talented Lady, Eunuch Gao is waiting outside.

304
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:45,030
You are just sitting here and not letting me help you get ready.

305
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,680
What happened?

306
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:56,620
Talented Lady, how about I put up your hair for you?

307
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,500
Sister Yu Liu, Eunuch Gao is rushing again.

308
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,040
He asks if Talented Lady has finished getting ready.

309
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,970
Talented Lady.

310
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,460
Bring the scissors.

311
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,550
Scissors? Why do you want scissors?

312
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,910
You cannot!

313
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,810
If you don't want to see me wrongfully die,

314
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,470
then bring me the scissors.

315
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,020
Your Majesty, Talented Lady Wu has arrived.

316
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,240
Talented Lady, have a seat. Wait for me to finish this order.

317
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:34,780
Your Majesty, I came to ask for forgiveness.

318
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:38,390
I used your miraculous medicine for a few days and feel much better.

319
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:41,770
You have credit. What crime do you have?

320
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,350
I have committed the wrong of lying to the emperor.

321
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,810
Please punish me harshly, Your Majesty.

322
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,120
Lying to the emperor?

323
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,690
Where is your silky hair?

324
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,920
Who dares to take your hair?

325
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:27,520
I haven't told you the complete truth of the miraculous medicine.

326
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,000
Please punish me.

327
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:42,770
Unless, becoming bald is related to the miraculous medicine?

328
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,440
What else have you hidden from me?

329
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,600
The condition for refining that elixir is very harsh.

330
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,760
Other than using my blood as medicine,

331
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,300
you also have to promise in front of Buddha severely.

332
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,600
If the illness is cured, you have to become someone who follows Buddha for the rest of your life.

333
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,760
I have shaved off my hair to become a female monk and stay by Buddha's side.

334
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,110
Your Majesty, your illness has gotten better.

335
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:18,790
I don't dare to go against the promise. I am afraid the medicine will no longer be effective.

336
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:23,670
For Your Majesty's safety and to have a long life,

337
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:27,590
I am willing to go bald as a promise.

338
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,680
Please agree, Your Majesty.

339
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,320
How can you do this at your most beautiful time?

340
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,110
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

341
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:11,990
Your Majesty is a virtuous and kind emperor, and you have shown me great affection.

342
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,940
If I told you,

343
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,890
how would you be willing for me to lose everything?

344
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:21,790
To become bald?

345
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:27,250
I don't want you to feel bad, so I went ahead and did it.

346
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,390
I only wish for your health to be well.

347
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:34,490
If I can fulfill this wish, even if I die,

348
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,560
there is no harm.

349
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:48,490
I really owe you too much.

350
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:54,200
The more good you are to me, in my heart

351
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,420
I am more not at ease.

352
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,220
Crown Prince, Talented Lady Wu is already asleep.

353
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,000
It's not convenient to see visitors.

354
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,030
She said thank you for visiting.

355
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,700
She also said

356
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,010
that she hopes Your Highness and Imperial Guard Leader will each take good care.

357
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:32,420
The kindness you guys have given her, she will remember forever.

358
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:37,140
If she cannot repay in this life, then she will in her next life.

359
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,700
I know Talented Lady Wu has not slept. Go inside and report again!

360
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,390
Your Highness, let's head back first.

361
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,320
Talented Lady Wu now

362
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,940
has too many grievances and is too unwilling.

363
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,880
Rather than telling her comforting words which will make her sad,

364
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:57,390
let's let her calm down alone.

365
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:19,260
Talented Lady Wu, don't despair. Everything can be resolved in time.

366
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,180
I hope you know.

Yu Liu, do you still remember...

382
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,010
what I used to fear the most...

383
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,510
was being sent together with those consorts

384
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,220
who had no male offsprings to Ganye Temple,

385
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,820
after His Majesty's death

386
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,700
to get old by accompanying Buddha?

387
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,570
I didn't expect...

388
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,510
to have tried everything possible today.

389
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:05,210
I have racked my brain.

390
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,100
Only by shaving my head and becoming a nun,

391
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,490
can I protect my life.

392
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,880
Talented Lady, don't be scared!

393
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,100
I will stay by your side!

394
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,660
Together from birth to death.

395
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,810
How is Xiao Douzi doing?

396
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:19,570
I went to watch him. He has already fallen asleep.

397
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:22,440
He has most probably already finished embroidering.

398
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,410
Zhuo Attire Expert, you have already embroidered many auspicious flowers and plants on the muslin skirt.

399
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,850
If you are to add more,

400
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:43,360
the design would go over the top, right?

401
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,450
What do you even know?

402
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:49,950
Xiao Douzi has been conducting some furtive actions.  He would go out in the morning and return back late at night.

403
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,470
He, for sure,

404
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:54,920
is doing everything to defeat me in one strike tomorrow.

405
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,020
Therefore, I must exhibit all my embroidery skills

406
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,780
through this muslin skirt.

407
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,280
A'Bi! Come!

408
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:10,730
Take a look! The embroidery method

409
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:14,760
of each plant and flower is unique.

410
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,770
Isn't it so beautiful? Very vibrant!

411
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,100
What you are saying is right!

412
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,310
Right! Right! You are just like Qiniang! You can only say right!

413
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,660
I am asking you. Did you even hear me?

414
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,220
I asked whether these flowers I embroidered

415
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,760
are beautiful or not.

416
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,820
Zhuo Attire Expert's skills and techniques are unrivaled in the entire state!

417
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,920
Extremely splendid and magnificent.

418
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,620
You will most probably win tomorrow's competition.

419
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,740
Well said.

420
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:54,460
Such a splendid and magnificent muslin skirt!

421
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,950
How could I even lose?

422
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:35,310
Mother, your daughter has to definitely claim back your golden needle tomorrow.

423
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:38,050
As well as the Number One Needle title of the state.

424
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,330
For Mother's sake, I'm going to punish

425
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:45,310
that vicious Zhuo Jinniang who has cheated and eliminated her master.

426
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:48,690
Mother... wait patiently this night.

427
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,270
Wait for your daughter's good news.

428
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:00,200
[Bureau of Imperial Attire]

429
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,950
Attire Expert Zhuo, it's daybreak. Hurry and wake up.

430
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,840
Hurry and wake up, Attire Expert Zhuo.

431
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,610
Attire Expert Zhuo.

432
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:26,190
Oh no, we're late, we're late. Are we late?

433
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,760
There is still time.

434
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,990
Hurry, iron my dress to get it ready for the competition.

435
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,730
- Yes.
- Hurry up!

436
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,570
Xiao Douzi is indeed smart.

437
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:47,970
This dress really fulfills the topic's requirement from the grand consorts.

438
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,750
It looks like

439
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,210
Attire Expert Zhuo will lose again today.

440
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,950
Good Brother, wait for me for a moment here.

441
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,530
Yes.

442
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,370
Liuli.

443
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,660
What are you doing here?

444
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,790
I was ordered by the crown prince to leave the palace on a mission.

445
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:42,290
So I came here to say farewell to you in advance.

446
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:44,510
The second round of the competition is about to start.

447
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:47,490
How are you? Do you feel confident?

448
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,920
As long as you don't interfere in my affairs,

449
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,390
I have 100% confidence to win the golden needle back.

450
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,620
Of course, I also wish that you will get the golden needle back soon.

451
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,210
But I worry more about your safety.

452
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,490
While I'm away from your side these days,

453
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:06,230
you must be extra careful and not be headstrong.

454
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,140
If you run into any difficulty,

455
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,650
don't be reckless, just tolerate it and hold back first.

456
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,710
Wait until I get back.

457
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,050
Imperial Guard Leader is being so naggy.

458
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:18,210
Are you deliberately delaying me from the competition?

459
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,010
I won't bother you then.

460
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:30,420
I wish you good luck today.

461
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,070
Oh yes, there is one more thing.

462
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,030
Talented Lady Wu may be leaving the palace soon.

463
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,980
Talented Lady Wu is leaving?

464
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,790
- Where is she going?
- Xuan Ling greets Your Majesty.

465
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:01,970
May Your Majesty live ten thousand years and many more.

466
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:04,610
Sir, please rise.

467
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,070
If Meiniang hadn't offered the elixir refined by you,

468
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:11,670
I wouldn't have known about such a master as you

469
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:15,300
who can refine an elixir to revive someone back from the brink of death.

470
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:19,590
Your Highness, His Majesty is meeting guests.

471
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:22,650
He is not available. Please come back later, Your Highness.

472
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,210
Your Majesty is overpraising me.

473
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,800
Xuan Ling has read a hexagram for Your Majesty.

474
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,890
Your Majesty's fortune is as high as the sky.

475
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:31,030
As long as you can get through the current trial,

476
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:34,230
you will still have several dozens of years in this world.

477
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:36,240
Are you sure?

478
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,810
Who is so bold

479
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:40,500
as to wear a cape in front of His Majesty?

480
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,930
That person is Talented Lady Wu.
