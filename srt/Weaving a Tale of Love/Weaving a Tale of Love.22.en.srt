[Weaving a Tale of Love]

3
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,170
[Episode 22]

4
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,060
Young Master Pei.

5
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,770
You've come.

6
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,590
Didn't you say you were giving me something today?

7
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,250
It's something that I'll be very happy to see.

8
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,270
What is it? What is it? Hurry and give it. I'm so curious.

9
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,830
I have a friend who gave me some wine from the western region.

10
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,140
I knew that you'd like it and was going to give it to you.

11
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,970
But then I thought, you don't know how high the sky is nor how deep the earth is,  (being careless and rash)

12
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,450
I'm afraid that you'll get drunk and make a mistake. So, never mind.

13
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,640
You are just being stingy and don't want to give me the good wine,

14
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,820
even found an excuse!

15
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,020
Here.

16
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,890
Your favorite osmanthus cakes.

17
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,480
Someday you will understand

18
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,870
about what I'm doing today.

19
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,990
It's all for your safety.

20
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,310
So there is such a beautiful place in the palace!

21
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,990
If we have to talk about something in the future,

22
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,410
we can just come here, all right?

23
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,690
You are thinking too much.

24
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,880
This is an imperial garden.

25
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,590
We can't come whenever we want to.

26
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,960
From now on, we can arrange to meet at the Hall of the Thinking Heart.

27
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,140
Hall of the Thinking Heart?

28
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,060
I heard that a concubine died by hanging in the Hall of the Thinking Heart.

29
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,170
It's been vacant ever since.

30
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,090
They also say it was later haunted.

31
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,460
In the next few days, I will spread around

32
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,000
this haunted story.

33
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,340
Let people avoid that place all they can.

34
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,390
Why are you afraid?

35
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,680
You can always trust me.

36
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,450
Perhaps...

37
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,870
not just for today.

38
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,750
Maybe...

39
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,030
it even started a long time ago.

40
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,490
What are you talking about?

41
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,660
Heaven's secret. (Heaven's secret cannot be revealed)

42
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,830
[Hall of the Thinking Heart]

43
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,060
[Hall of the Thinking Heart]

44
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,150
Let's walk faster. Every time I pass by this Hall of the Thinking Heart,

45
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,280
I also feel a chill down my back and my whole body gets cold.

46
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,890
Sister, quit talking about it.

47
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,830
They say the Hall of the Thinking Heart is haunted.

48
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,560
I was already afraid of walking by here.

49
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,140
Now you talk about that, I'm even more afraid.

50
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,590
Ever since this spring, my health hasn't been good.

51
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,020
To let me rest quietly, all the activities in the palace

52
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,380
have been reduced or simplied,

53
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,180
except for today's Feast of All Souls Festival that's held on the 15th day in the 7th month.

54
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,970
Not only that it's not skipped, but it's especially important.

55
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,340
Crown Prince, do you understand why?

56
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,220
Replying to Your Majesty. I think

57
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,530
the main theme of the Feast of All Souls Festival involves filial piety, taking care of parents, and helping the people.

58
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,670
Your Majesty pays such great attention to the Feast of All Souls Festival

59
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,240
and have set up a praying chamber in the palace.

60
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,900
It's also to set an example to all the people, and to all the royal princes and subjects.

61
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,360
You want us to always keep in mind, no matter when, where, or the situation,

62
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,050
we must always be filial and have compassion.

63
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,980
Crown Prince verbalized my thoughts exactly.

64
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:19,290
A'Quan, are all the Feast of All Souls Festival's ceremonies prepared?

65
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,290
Replying to Your Majesty. Everything is ready.

66
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,510
We are just waiting for the auspicious hour when Your Majesty will personally start the activities.

67
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,850
Why aren't Consort Yang and Meiniang here?

68
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,750
Replying to Your Majesty. The ceremonies involved in the Feast of All Souls Festival are complicated.

69
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,070
Mother is personally taking care of everything regardless of big or small

70
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,170
lest any mistake occurs.

71
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,400
My guess is that she is delayed by some miscellaneous matter,

72
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,430
so she is a little late in coming.

73
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,410
I apologize for her guilt on behalf of Mother to Your Majesty.

74
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,300
Your Mother is helping me

75
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,930
to take care of the Feast of All Souls Festival.

76
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,430
If she is a little late, there is no need to apologize for guilt.

77
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,760
Consort Yang, why don't we walk a little faster?

78
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,090
Prince of Cao has already sent someone to rush us twice.

79
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,620
He said everyone else had arrived,

80
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,400
and they were just waiting for you, Consort Yang.

81
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,500
Since I'm already prepared this time

82
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,420
to use the "One Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" that I'm wearing

83
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,900
to announce my status in the harem.

84
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,350
I should appear by myself

85
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,900
so that everyone can see clearly,

86
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,270
so as not waste this elegant dress

87
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,710
and not waste my effort.

88
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:33,470
Only this way will all those ingratiating appeasers in court and the harem

89
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,630
not take advantage of my Ming'er because he has no support behind him.

90
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,850
Consort Yang arrives!

91
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,960
So beautiful! She looks like a goddess.

92
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,220
That's right.

93
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,810
Consort Yang's beauty is unparalled in the harem.

94
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,510
This consort greets Your Majesty. I'm sorry for coming late.

95
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,040
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

96
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,830
You may rise.

97
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,010
Thank you, Your Majesty.

98
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,760
I haven't seen this dress on you before.

99
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,050
Is it custom-made for this Feast of All Souls Festival?

100
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,890
Your Majesty, a few days go, some foreign envoys brought in bird features as tribute,

101
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,720
because they had heard it was difficult to obtain bird feathers in Chang'an even with a high payment.

102
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,570
They thought this was a popular trend in Great Tang and found it inexplicable.

103
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,130
Now, I can see how it started.

104
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,050
Consort Yang has used many precious bird feathers to make the gown.

105
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,630
This is so ingenious.

106
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,780
It's so refreshing and impressive to see.

107
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,320
Your Majesty had ordered me that this Feast of All Souls Festival

108
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,890
must be held in grand style.

109
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,900
All the consorts and concubines haven't dared to slight it.

110
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,230
Everyone had an elegant gown made.

111
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,210
Talented Lady Wu even used golden silk thread for embroidery,

112
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,910
inlayed with Tian Mountain Jade,

113
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,390
for the design of peony flowers.

114
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,950
On such an important occasion,

115
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,050
why is Talented Lady Wu so late and making Your Majesty wait?

116
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,100
Your Majesty, it's so that Your Majesty not lose face

117
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,820
that I also had a new gown made.

118
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,160
Talented Lady Wu arrives!

119
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,100
Greetings, Your Majesty.

120
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,300
I heard that, in order to attend the Feast of All Souls Festival,

121
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,630
you used golden silk threads and Tian Mountain Jade to make an elegant gown.

122
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,160
If you regard the event so highly, why are you late?

123
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,770
Is there an explanation?

124
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,390
Your Majesty ordered Consort Yang to organize the Feast of All Souls Festival

125
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,600
and let me assist.

126
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,160
Sister is very capable, so I couldn't do much.

127
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,790
But I remembered Late Empress Zhangsun's virtues.

128
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,680
She worked hard in her whole life for the harem

129
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,790
and was truly a worthy example for all the consorts and concubines.

130
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,830
I dare not forget the virtues of Late Empress.

131
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,010
The Feast of All Souls Festival is dedicated to ancestors and the deceased.

132
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,660
The elegant grown that Your Majesty mentioned

133
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,920
is what I especially arranged to have Xiao Douzi of the Bureau of Imperial Attire

134
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,720
to make, according to what the late empress liked,

135
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,340
into a gown with the peony flowers in the design.

136
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,770
I took a bath and changed clothes, then personally

137
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,470
took the gown to offer as tribute to Empress Zhangsun's hall, that's why I came late.

138
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,680
Please mete out punishment, Your Majesty.

139
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,550
Meiniang, you are so pure-hearted and understanding.

140
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,660
You understand and obey proper etiquette.

141
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,690
You also understand why I want to hold the Feast of All Souls Festival in grand style.

142
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,150
I am very pleased.

143
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,670
You may rise.

144
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

145
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,360
Meiniang, I haven't seen the design of

146
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,600
the dress that you're wearing.

147
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,110
It doesn't appear to be the pleated skirt that is popular with Tang women, right?

148
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,250
Your Majesty's eyesight is like the blazing torch.
(Sharp eyesight)

149
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,760
The Feast of All Souls Festival is solemn and serious.

150
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,650
I thought that this gown should not look poor

151
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,410
but also not losing the imperial family's dignity.

152
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,020
Nor can it be extravagant and wasteful

153
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,280
and disobey Your Majesty's frugality and caring for the people

154
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,770
as well as the original goal for the Feast of All Souls Festival.

155
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:29,520
So, I jointly designed this gown with Xiao Douzi of the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

156
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,470
The craftsmanship isn't complex

157
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,140
and the fabric isn't opulent.

158
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,250
Simplifying the pleated skirt

159
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,160
can not only save some fabric

160
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,040
but also save handwork. It's sumptuous and exquisite,

161
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,360
and easy for the civilian women to imitate.

162
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,070
Meiniang is thoughtful.

163
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:50,620
It's my blessing that you can be so thoughtful for my sake.

164
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,610
Meiniang has skin that's fairer than snow.

165
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,500
It perfectly matches

166
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,990
this pleated skirt.

167
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,070
Your Majesty, the auspicious hour has arrived.

168
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,710
The ceremony can begin.

169
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,200
All the princes, consorts, and concubines,

170
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,970
follow me to go pay tribute together.

171
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,680
Your gown is improper for today's ceremony,

172
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,310
you should return to the Hall of Brilliant Joy and self-reflect.

173
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,480
[Hall of Immortal Nectar]

174
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,010
The summer heat is so strong.

175
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,470
Consort Yang, you have already kneeled for over two hours.

176
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,180
We are worried about your precious body.

177
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,160
That's right. His Majesty only told Consort Yang to go back and self-reflect.

178
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,140
He didn't say he would punish you.

179
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,510
Consort Yang, you don't need to suffer like this.

180
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,160
Our hearts ache for you, Consort Yang.

181
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,460
What do you two know?

182
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,860
His Majesty told me to go back to self-reflect.

183
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,320
It's so that he didn't have to see me and get annoyed.

184
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,040
If I can't appear frequently in front of His Majesty,

185
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,540
our feelings will reduce after a while.

186
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,270
I may as well kneel here so that His Majesty knows that I am remorseful.

187
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,050
It's heart-aching to see you like this.

188
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,780
If His Majesty will see me today

189
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,640
and hear my regrets in person,

190
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,960
and lecture me a few words, he will lose his anger.

191
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,420
That's how this page can be turned over.

192
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,200
Consort Yang is smart. So you are actually using the tactic of inflicting injury to yourself. (Tactic to win the enemy's confidence from the Book of War)

193
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,470
I originally thought I had inside help in the Hall of Sunset Pool

194
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,170
and I would win without any worry.

195
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,860
Who would have known that I still got trapped by Wu Meiniang.

196
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,580
This time, it's not only that I couldn't use the gown of "One Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix"

197
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,870
to clearly affirm my status in the harem,

198
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,150
I actually helped Wu Meiniang

199
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,260
get ahead by stepping on me.

200
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,920
Consort Yang, His Majesty has asked you to go inside.

201
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,160
Consort Yang, you have kneeled for such a long time outside the hall,

202
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,050
His Majesty's anger has reduced quite a lot.

203
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,830
Your Majesty.

204
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,170
Your Majesty, I know I did wrong.

205
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,550
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

206
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,670
I told you to go back and self-reflect.

207
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,430
Why did you insist on kneeling outside to see me?

208
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,760
It's all my fault to make Your Majesty angry.

209
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,100
If I can't be forgiven by Your Majesty in person, I cannot be at ease.

210
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,330
When I was kneeling outside, I kept reflecting on my wrongdoing.

211
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,420
I know that I really did wrong.

212
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,670
Since you've reflected, then tell me,

213
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,020
what did you do wrong?

214
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,890
Your Majesty trusted me

215
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,710
and assigned me to organize the Feast of All Souls Festival.

216
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,920
But I disappointed Your Majesty's trust.

217
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,660
I reminded the Bureau of Imperial Attire

218
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,360
to make clothes that adhere to the rules of prosperity

219
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,340
so that the imperial family will not lose dignity.

220
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,160
But I didn't expect that Attire Expert Zhuo

221
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,420
didn't fully understand my intent.

222
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,110
Because I was busy with the event,

223
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,850
I didn't inspect the gown first.

224
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,430
I hurriedly changed into the gown right before the ceremony started.

225
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,310
Even though I thought it was inappropriate,

226
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,990
but it was already too late.

227
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,430
This is the result of your self-reflection?

228
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,410
It's to push off your wrongdoing?

229
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,060
You've misunderstood me, Your Majesty.

230
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,390
I am definitely guilty of oversight.

231
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,680
Let me tell you what you did wrong.

232
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,830
"One Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" is for the empress.

233
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,460
It's inappropriate for a consort or concubine to wear it. That's the first mistake.

234
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,500
Killing living things for the Feast of All Souls Festival disobeys Buddha's teachings. That's the second mistake.

235
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,320
To satisfy your personal need and be extremely wasteful, it goes against the need of the nation.

236
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,680
That's the third mistake.

237
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,530
Your Majesty, please allay your anger.

238
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,980
I know what I did wrong.

239
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,830
I don't think you really reflected.

240
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,000
You are only trying to push this mistake totally away from you.

241
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,320
Go back to your hall and continue to self-reflect. If you don't receive my summons,

242
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,510
do not appear in front of me.

243
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,700
Your Majesty!

244
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,380
I am willing to be punished for what I did wrong.

245
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,700
But there is one thing,

246
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,750
I beg that Your Majesty

247
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,570
won't deny my seeing you.

248
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,100

Among the civilians, they will light up lotus lamps to help light the way for the deceased.

I have especially brought two lotus lamps here today

255

in the hope of lighting Your Majesty's path to return to the palace.

256

His Majesty misses you greatly.

257

258
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,370
His Majesty's health hasn't been good.

His Highness the Crown Prince has great aspirations as well as caring for the nation and the people.

260
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,650
His Majesty appreciates and likes him very well,

261
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,650
I hope Empress Zhangsun's spirit in Heaven

262
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,500
will bless His Majesty

263
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,550
and bless the crown prince.

Your Highness.

265
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,550
I came to light incense for my imperial mother

266
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,750
and unexpectedly ran into Talented Lady Wu.

267
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,370
I heard everything that Talented Lady Wu just said.

268
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,630
Talented Lady Wu is thoughtful.

269
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,560
In this inner palace, probably

270
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,870

other than His Majesty and me,

272
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,020
is only Talented Lady Wu then.

273
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,120
The late empress was virtuous.

274
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,530
I have always admired the late empress.

275
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,660
Today is the 15th day of the 7th month.

276
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,780
I am merely following the traditions among the civilians

277
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,940
to come to offer two lotus lamps

278
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,440
to the late empress and show a token of my thoughts.

279
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,670
You had the Bureau of Imperial Attire make the gown for imperial mother,

280
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,320
and defeated Consort Yang through this incident today.

281
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:35,550
To be honest, I have even more appreciation for Talented Lady's intelligence,

282
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,760
and I am in awe of your strategic thinking.

283
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:44,130
But tonight, you brought two lotus lamps for my imperial mother.

284
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,140
I am really touched.

285
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,280
I know that this has nothing to do with schemes or with the infighting in the harem.

286
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,530
There is no calculation to take advantage of.

287
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,630
This is your true sincerity to my imperial mother.

288
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,040
I will remember your kindness.

289
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,050
Your Highness is too serious.

290
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,360
Your Highness should hurry and light incense for the late empress.

291
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,810
I shall take my leave first.

295
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:55,170
Talented Lady, do you really believe that the lotus lamp will guide the dead souls to return to home?

296
00:24:55,170 --> 00:25:00,050
The lotus lamps are lit for the living and to show those that are alive.

297
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,960
I purposely went this time

298
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,360
to show the crown prince.

299
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,750
The crown prince has a kind nature, but he is not stupid.

300
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,560
The talk about making a gown for the late empress today

301
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:22,040
could move His Majesty's heart, but not move the crown prince.

302
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,460
The crown prince is intelligent.

303
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,700
He knew it was just a ploy among the harem's infighting.

304
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,390
But these two lotus lamps,

305
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:37,560
although meager, could warm the crown prince's heart.

306
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,570
You are so smart, Talented Lady Wu.

307
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,730
I don't really want to scheme so much,

308
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,240
especially to scheme against a kind person like the crown prince,

309
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,360
but I have totally offended Prince of Cao and his mother.

310
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,950
If I can't win the crown prince's heart,

311
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,770
I won't be able to survive in the harem.

312
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,370
What you did really can't be considered a scheme against the crown prince.

Attire Expert Zhuo is the ultimate culprit,

345
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,110
but you, Attire Chief Lin, are involved, too.

346
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:03,830
After all, you are the chief of the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

347
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,970
Consort Yang, please allay your anger. We do not shirk from our wrongdoing.

348
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,280
But the culprit is actually Physician Dou.

349
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,490
This Physician Dou, in order to appease Consort Yang,

350
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,460
he came up with the idea of "One Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix," and even drew the design.

351
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,910
Physician Dou is scheming. I really cannot give him cover.

352
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,610
I hope Consort Yang will wisely judge.

353
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,310
Xiao Douzi is in big trouble.

354
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,020
[Lizheng Hall]

355
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,310
Your Highness! Your Highness!

356
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,600
You...

357
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,550
What's wrong, A'Sheng? You are in such a panic.

358
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:46,170
Your Highness, I was taking Xiao Douzi's favorite snacks to him.

359
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,610
But as soon as I arrived at the Bureau of Imperial Attire, I saw Consort Yang criticizing them for accountability.

360
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,280
Attire Chief Lin and Attire Expert Zhuo, in order to protect themselves,

361
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,600
pushed all the wrongdoing to Xiao Douzi.

362
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,770
I'm afraid Xiao Douzi is in big trouble.

363
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,950
- Follow me to the Bureau of Imperial Attire.
- Yes.

364
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,570
So you are Physician Dou.

365
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,230
Xiao Douzi greets Consort Yang.

366
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:11,550
I didn't know that there was such a talent like you in the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

367
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,920
I heard that you made the seven-fold skirt for Talented Lady Wu.

368
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,170
You also made the gown with peony flowers' design for the late empress.

369
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:22,310
My "One Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" was also your creation.

370
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:25,220
You are quite popular everywhere.

371
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,390
Replying to Consort Yang.

372
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,970
I saw that Attire Expert Zhuo was out of ideas for Consort Yang's gown.

373
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:34,100
To relieve her worries, I came up with the idea of "One Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix."

374
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,370
Consort Yang, you have a supreme stature in the palace,

375
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,200
and you are deeply respected by all the other consorts and concubines.

376
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,910
You are also unparalleled in His Majesty's heart.

377
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:44,200
The design of "One Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" is most suitable for you, Consort Yang.

378
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,410
I was originally the sanitation medical officer at the Courtyard of Misfortune.

379
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,010
Attire Expert Zhuo temporarily borrowed me to help at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

380
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,790
Naturally, I don't have much experience with the world.

381
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:54,090
I only told Attire Expert Zhuo of my immature ideas,

382
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,810
just as a suggestion.

383
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,080
Firstly, I wanted to express my affection and respect to Consort Yang.

384
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,830
Secondly, I wanted to relieve my master's worries. I thought, even if there was anything inappropriate,

385
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,640
Expert Attire Zhuo would know what not to do.

386
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,750
Attire Expert Zhou has served Consort Yang for many years, so she knows the best about propriety.

387
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,060
Xiao Douzi, shut up!

388
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,290
How dare you talk to Consort Yang?

389
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,130
You are the one who did wrong.

390
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,840
Why are you arguing to cover the truth

391
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,700
and falsely drag me in?

392
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:22,660
You're so clever with your mouth.

393
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,340
You say you are lowly, ignorant, and full of affection and respect for me.

394
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,340
It sounds really good.

395
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:32,180
If there weren't the seven-fold gown for Talented Lady Wu, nor the peony flower gown for the late empress,

396
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,930
I might have believed your sweet talk.

397
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:39,350
But now, however I look, I feel that you are framing me.

398
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:43,860
And you still dare to talk back? Watch out that I pull your tongue out!

399
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,170
Consort Yang is wise. Consort Yang judges wisely.

400
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,420
All of this trouble is caused by Physician Dou.

401
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,730
You, shut up!

402
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,760
You can't wait for me to deal with you?

403
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,940
Consort Yang, please allay your anger. It's all my ignorance.

404
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,620
I originally wanted to help Consort Yang but ended up making a mess.

405
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,230
Guards!

406
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,500
Take Xiao Douzi out for a beating. Keep beating him until I say stop.

407
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,060
Stop!

408
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:28,740
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

409
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,750
Crown Prince, you are noble and also busy.

410
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,560
In a place like the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

411
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,210
there can't be much for Your Highness to personally sort out, is there?

412
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,430
I came to the Bureau of Imperial Attire to personally reward Physician Dou.

413
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:52,260
The gown he made for my imperial mother was based on Mother's favorite pattern when she was alive.

414
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,720
I think her spirit in Heaven should be very gratified.

415
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,580
Crown Prince, as the heir to the throne,

416
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,360
it seems that you are only busy with these trivial matters all day.

417
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,450
Wouldn't people criticize you if this were spread outside?

418
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:06,630
Filial piety is the top of 100 virtues. How is filial piety toward my imperial mother something trivial?

419
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:11,450
Besides, that Talented Lady Wu and Physician Dou together made the peony flower gown for Mother was also praised by His Majesty.

420
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,020
Have I heard wrong?

421
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,710
Why does Consort Yang want to punish by beating the person that His Majesty has praised

422
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,310
and that I am about to give a reward to?

423
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:21,490
The design of "One Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" was created by Physician Dou.

424
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:24,330
He harbors evil intentions and embroiled me in injustice! Shouldn't he be harshly punished?

425
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,340
Consort Yang, that doesn't sound right.

426
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,080
Physician Dou was transferred to the Bureau of Imperial Attire from the Courtyard of Misfortune

427
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,730
to provide temporary help here. Based on his experience,

428
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,750
even if his designs are inappropriate,

429
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,820
they should have followed the procedure to be checked.

430
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,710
If his superiors didn't give approval, the designs

431
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,670
wouldn't have been made into clothes

432
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,720
that offended His Majesty.

433
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,880
Consort Yang, you said you were too busy to affirm the propriety of the gown.

434
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,600
That's why you didn't know it was inappropriate and pushed the responsibility to the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

435
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,110
Consort Yang, do you think this kind of argument will convince His Majesty

436
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,790
and the entire palace from top to bottom?

437
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,160
You–

438
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,950
Crown Prince,

439
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:04,970
must you make it difficult for me today over a mere Physician Dou?

440
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,740
I am definitely protecting Physician Dou today.

441
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,920
Of course, I'm not only protecting him.

442
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,190
I'm protecting the word, "truth."

443
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,970
I advise Consort Yang.

444
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:21,010
If you insist on making a scene of this matter today at the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

445
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:25,120
you will be suspected by the people of covering up your own wrongdoing.

446
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,140
I remember that His Majesty told Consort Yang to return to your place to self-reflect,

447
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,230
instead of coming over to criticize the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

448
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,710
Guards!

449
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,580
Drag Zhuo Jinniang outside!

450
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,390
Cane her 50 times as a warning to everyone!

451
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,780
From now on, will anyone still dare to commit dereliction of duty at the Bureau of Imperial Attire?

452
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:52,490
Consort Yang, please allay your anger! Consort Yang, have mercy!

453
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,660
This servant was wholeheartedly working for you!

454
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,960
Consort Yang, have mercy! Consort Yang, have mercy!

455
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,580
I was really just doing work for you!

456
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,050
Consort Yang, have mercy!

457
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,960
[Hall of Immortal Dew]

458
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:21,080
I have been summoned here by decree. Greetings, Your Majesty.

459
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,450
Meiniang, I feel a little lonely today.

460
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,950
Come over and talk with me.

461
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,420
Yes.

462
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,140
Come here.

463
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,560
Meiniang, you know that after Empress Zhangsun departed,

464
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,840
within the harem,

465
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,610
my favorite has been Consort Yang.

466
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:06,670
If it weren't for the opposition from all the court officials back then,

467
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,830
she would be sitting in the empress's seat now.

468
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,620
I've remembered her suffering and given her extra affection and respect.

469
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,280
But during today's Feast of All Souls Festival,

470
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,560
she really disappointed me.

471
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,890
I was also self-reflecting today.

472
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,380
Has my special affection for her

473
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,260
turned her into how she was today:

474
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,440
arrogant, overstepping,

475
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,880
haughty because of the favor she's received?

476
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,910
She is no longer the gentle, virtuous,

477
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:45,130
humble Consort Yang from years ago.

478
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,590
Your Majesty, you don't need to worry.

479
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,410
I'm sure Consort Yang knows she's done wrong

480
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,090
and is feeling regretful.

481
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,470
I hope so.

482
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,990
But, Meining, today,

483
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,500
you really touched me.

484
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,720
I didn't expect that

485
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,640
you've been keeping respect and affection for Empress Zhangsun in your heart.

486
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,660
You don't know I've always missed her.

487
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,740
I'm very gratified.

488
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:23,280
Your Majesty has been missing Empress Zhangsun and feeling upset.

489
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,890
How about I sing a song for you

490
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,740
to relieve your yearning?

491
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,890
Meining, you want to sing a song for me?

492
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,350
Sure, sing for me.

493
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,710

It's Empress Zhangsun's

504
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,410
"Song of Spring Tour."

505
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:57,890
I didn't know Meining would match it with a melody and sing it so beautifully.

506
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:03,160
I am stupid. Empress Zhangsun's poem is pure, elegant, joyful, and romantic.

507
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,120
I don't think I was able to sing the full flavor.

508
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,790
I just wanted to sing it

509
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,720
to allay Your Majesty's yearning feelings.

510
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,630
You sang well.

511
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,230
It made me suddenly go back to that year.

512
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:23,390
I still remember that day. The weather was lovely.

513
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:28,490
Empress Zhangsun and I came back from visiting the imperial garden.

514
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,030
Empress Zhangsun was in a great mood

515
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,870
and wrote this Song of Spring Tour.

516
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,150
I really liked it.

517
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:44,120
That was Empress Zhangsun's good time.

518
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:49,000
It was also a good time for me and Empress Zhangsun.

519
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,860
Consort Yang!

520
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:00,960
Consort Yang, don't worry about smashing things,

521
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,000
but it's not worth it to get angry and upset your body.

522
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,120
Have you forgotten Imperial Physician Zong's reminder?

523
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,050
Too much anger will upset your health. Don't be angry anymore.

524
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,850
His Majesty asked you to stay here and self-refect.

525
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,590
But if you make such a ruckus now,

526
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,790
what if it's spread outside and His Majesty finds out. Wouldn't he get more upset?

527
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:17,000
I suffered enough outside.

528
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,160
Why can't I vent a little in my own palace?

529
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,500
I just want to smash. Who dares to spread this outside?

530
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,230
Move aside!

531
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,510
Consort Yang, allay your anger. Consort Yang, allay your anger.

532
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,330
We are loyal to you until death,

533
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:35,010
and we won't ever spread any gossip against you, Consort Yang.

534
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,800
Do you think that I'm angry because

535
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,100
I lost to Talented Lady Wu and also got scolded by the crown prince?

536
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:02,150
I am feeling upset that I couldn't protect my son.

537
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:07,080
I see the crown prince getting stronger every day under Talented Lady Wu's support.

538
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,900
But I...

539
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,960
probably don't have much time left.

540
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,700
Consort Yang, you are in the prime of life. You can't say this about yourself.

541
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,810
That's right. Consort Yang, you are tired.

542
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,680
You should take a good rest.

543
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,480
After you've rested, then

544
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,210
make a long-term plan for you and for His Highness.

545
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,510
You are right.

546
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:42,620
The more urgent it is, the calmer I should be

547
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,850
and think of a good plan to fight the enemy.

548
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:48,630
After the incident at the Bureau of Imperial Attire today,

549
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:52,060
it seemed that I was defeated by Li Zhi on the surface,

550
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:56,980
but it's not so. That Xiao Douzi is only a little physician,

551
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,160
as lowly as an insect, but Crown Prince

552
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,950
is protecting him so much.

553
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:05,700
This is too abnormal.

554
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,590
Perhaps...

555
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,260
this is Crown Prince's weakness.

556
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,630
Dan Qing, order people to monitor Xiao Douzi.

557
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:24,400
Find out exactly what his relationship is with the crown prince.

558
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,130
Yes.

559
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,370
Yu'er.

560
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:42,070
You are right, this is really a good place.

561
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:45,270
Remote, quiet, and no one to disturb us.

562
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:49,470
This is a rare paradise within the inner palace.

563
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,450
It's the 15th day of the 7th month today.

564
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:55,670
According to folk traditions, people would release water lanterns

565
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,370
to guide the road home for their deceased family members and friends.

566
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:02,930
I heard you say previously that you hid your identity in the palace

567
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:06,160
so that you can hide from your enemy.

568
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,540
I know it's probably not easy to pay tribute to your mother.

569
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,500
This place is remote, so no one will notice.

570
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,010
You can release a water lantern, too, then.

571
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,240
It's so rare for you to still remember it. Thank you.

572
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:43,380
Mother, it's the 17th day of the 7th month today.

573
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,320
Have you returned to the mortal realm to take a look?

574
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:53,430
It's too bad that we don't have a home of our own.

575
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,930
I also don't know if you came back,

576
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,050
where would you return to?
