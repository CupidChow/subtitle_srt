[Imperial Hunting Ground Warehouse]

5
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,240
What are you guys doing?

6
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,200
Put it down!

7
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,870
What are you guys doing here?

8
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,500
The inspection for the accepting of goods isn't completed yet, how can you unload the goods on your own already?

9
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,150
Didn't we already check with your people?

10
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,300
Who did you check with?

11
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,780
Me.

12
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,520
Why are you here?

13
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,150
All eight carts of goods have been inspected fully.

14
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,880
It's just that I have a question.

15
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,840
Why do these eight carts of goods require so many people to escort?

16
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,290
I am only taking orders.

17
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,980
If you have any doubts,

18
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,430
just ask my superior, Adjutant Mo.

19
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,320
- Then, may I ask where Adjutant Mo is?
- Pei Xingjian.

20
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,960
You are only a scholar, can you have some respect?

21
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,430
Everyone, listen well. Simen College's Director of Studies

22
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,530
has appointed me to inspect the goods for acceptance. I am solely in charge here.

23
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,570
No one can interfere.

24
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,470
Understood?

25
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,390
- Yes.
- Where's your supervisor?

26
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,890
Adjutant Mo got a stomach ache on the way over, so he went to the restroom.

27
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,620
Look! Adjutant Mo is here.

28
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,450
Good Brother Mo, I didn't expect to see you again so soon.

29
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,430
I originally wanted to come and pay respects after I finished my tasks.

30
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,250
Unexpectedly, I ran into Brother Pei.

31
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,730
I just don't understand why you pretended not to know me in the storage room.

32
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,100
Is there something wrong with the goods that I transported?

33
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,740
Let me ask you.

34
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,270
In the past, transporting the goods never needed assistance from the Ministry of War.

35
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,210
Why is it such a big deal this time?

36
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,530
About this, I also have asked many.

37
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,560
But no one answered.

38
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,600
This is odd.

39
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,030
I inspected those eight carts of goods.

40
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,470
Inside were just paper used by Simen College. Nothing seemed improper.

41
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,230
Those eight carts were what was transported today. There will be another batch tomorrow.

42
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,720
There's more tomorrow?

43
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,010
The shipment this time has 20 carts in total.

44
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,400
Another Adjutant and I are responsible for the transport.

45
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,700
There is one lot of goods among them that have been delayed for some reason.

46
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,660
If there are no accidents, it'll arrive tomorrow.

47
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,290
That's it.

48
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,080
The problem is with the lot of goods that will arrive tomorrow.

49
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,810
Brother Pei, why are you so sure that there is a problem with this lot of goods?

50
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,080
Xue Xu is someone who is greedy for fame and fortune.

51
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,900
He is always declining to do the work that he is supposed to do.

52
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,170
This time, he just went to serve Prince of Cao,

53
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,690
yet he volunteered to do.

54
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,110
This inspection work requires effort in minute detail.

55
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,950
There must be a secret within this.

56
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,820
In that case, this matter is related to Prince of Cao.

57
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,920
The crown prince has proposed to His Majesty to emphasize more on imperial scholars and less on classics comprehension

58
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,870
to promote reforming the imperial examination system. Prince of Cao thinks

59
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,370
that the crown prince's reform will take on the privilege and benefits enjoyed by the aristocrats and nobles,

60
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,950
and he is trying to block it.

61
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,270
Now that he would even utilize the Ministry of War,

62
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,980
he must be planning something big.

63
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,150
Master, the artist from Ruyi Resist Dye Shop is here and wants to see you.

64
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,980
So soon?

65
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,850
Good Brother, have some tea first. I'll be right back.

66
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,780
Hunting white rabbit in the spring, the ferocious tiger in the summer,

67
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,680
fat deer in the autumn, and grey wolf in the winter.

68
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,740
These four paintings, when combined as one,

69
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,500
can be made into the screen that Master Pei wants.

70
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,960
Is Young Master Pei satisfied with these four paintings?

71
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,760
I'm satisfied. They are even better than I had imagined.

72
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,820
And even faster in completion. Artist, you've worked hard.

73
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,410
May I ask Artist to make the screen

74
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,460
with the image of these four paintings?

75
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,780
The spirit of the original paintings must not be lost.

76
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,990
I also want to thank Young Master Pei for giving me the medicine.

77
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,030
If it weren't for this miraculous medicine given by Young Master Pei,

78
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,320
my hand wouldn't have recovered so fast.

79
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,330
The paintings would have been charged with a discount then.

80
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,810
Since Young Master Pei is satisfied,

81
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,250
have I repaid all the favors that I owe you?

82
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,780
You mean, the idea that I came up with to help you reject the marriage proposals?

83
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,930
It's a trivial matter. Don't mention it.

84
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,490
Artist, you don't need to worry about it too much.

85
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,290
Young Master Pei, you don't have to be courteous.

86
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,630
Just tell me if these four paintings are sufficient to repay your favors.

87
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,820
Since Artist is asking so directly,

88
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,430
I'll say they are about sufficient in repayment.

89
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,530
Excellent.

90
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,860
Since I have repaid everything that I should repay,

91
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,610
then Young Master Pei, please pay me back what you should repay me.

92
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,280
Artist, you were waiting for me here.

93
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,950
You saw it too, that

94
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,570
I am not an impoverished person.

95
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,350
Why would I take your cousin's things and not return them?

96
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,540
This is exactly what I want to ask Young Master Pei.

97
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,630
I am someone who takes a strong stand on benevolence and grievance.

98
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,760
I repay benevolence with benevolence and grievance with a grievance.

99
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,590
If Young Master Pei insists on not returning those things,

100
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,580
this artist knows how to find a way to get them back.

101
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,020
At that time, I'm afraid our harmony will be hurt.

102
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,670
Young Master Pei will actually resent me for burning the bridge after crossing the river.

103
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,230
What do you mean by that?

104
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,870
I'm very clear with what I said.

105
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,280
Give me back my things, or you'll suffer the consequences.

106
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,000
You... are really a smart person who gets muddled sometimes.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,550
I already told you that I didn't take your cousin's things.

108
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,760
How can I return them to you?

109
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,880
I have already been as kind and dutiful as I could.

110
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,080
It's needless to talk more. Goodbye!

111

[Simen College]

112
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,950
This civilian woman Yu'er greets Lord Xue.

113
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,640
I have a grievance and would like to ask Lord Xue to uphold justice.

114
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,500
This is not the magistrate's office. I don't have the time to accommodate you.

115
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,830
This is not the magistrate's office.

116
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,960
How can I uphold justice for you?

117
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,700
Lord Xue, don't you remember me, Yu'er?

118
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,920
Last time you said you would help me

119
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,530
to get justice from Pei Xingjian.

120
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,380
I remember it now.

121
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,230
See, I didn't recognize you without your facial covering.

122
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,440
It's me who has bothered you, Lord Xue.

123
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,000
This is my plea. Please help me, Lord Xue,

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,190
to get my cousin's remaining items back.

125
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,580
Little Lady, rest assured.

126
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,750
This official has always found thieving rascals like Pei Xingjian.

127
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,010
Don't be impatient. Just go home and wait for the news.

128
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,530
This official will definitely get justice for you.

129
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,410
Thank you.

130
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,330
Pei Xingjian, Pei Xingjian.

131
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,710
I was just needing a way to deal with you.

132
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,860
Good.

133
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,330
This...

134
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,230
This way, please.

135
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,580
Shopkeeper Shih, come this way, please.

136
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,320
Please sit.

137
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,560
Madam Cao, I heard that your nephew

138
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,910
likes that shopkeeper, A'Ni, at Ruyi Resist Dye Shop.

139
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:57,310
He even helped her win the top prize at the Hu Merchants Fair.

140
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,490
Is this true?

141
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,870
Our family's dirty laundry has spread so quickly

142
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,400
to Shopkeeper Shih?

143
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,980
If it weren't for this matter, why would I go for this secondary plan?

144
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,550
So that's how it is. Just as I thought.

145
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,090
With your Caoji's strength, why would you use this method

146
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:19,210
to deal with Ruyi Resist Dye Shop?

147
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,850
That matter that I asked Shopkeeper Shih about last time,

148
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,950
can you guarantee it fully?

149
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,150
This business fair held by the Hu Merchants

150
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:30,200
is for getting the best clothes to ship to the western region to sell.

151
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,530
At that time, it's not only the design that will be competed on,

152
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,140
even more important is the quality.

153
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,750
They will test whether the sample dress

154
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,650
will fade and change shape after getting wet.

155
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,750
The fabric used by Ruyi Resist Dye Shop

156
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,410
has already been through processing to prevent fading and shrinkage. It's a high-quality fabric.

157
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,350
This is not a problem.

158
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,650
I deliberately gave unprocessed materials to A'Ni this time.

159
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,280
No matter how beautiful a dress she makes,

160
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,500
it will definitely lose.

161
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,010
Excellent!

162
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,790
I'll remember Shopkeeoer Shih's favor.

163
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,420
Please have some fragrant tea and sit for a moment.

164
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,320
Shopkeeper Shih, this is a little token of appreciation from Caoji.

165
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,960
You must accept it.

166
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,020
Then... I won't be impolite.

167
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,570
Helper to outsiders,

168
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,950
are you going to tip off Ruyi Resist Dye Shop?

169
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,110
Auntie, you are utilizing some sneaky tricks.

170
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,700
I am helping what's right over family ties.

171
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,110
I won't stop you this time, but you'd better think it over.

172
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,560
If you really want to marry A'Ni,

173
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,190
you can't go and tell them.

174
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,850
Why not?

175
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,200
When I went there to propose marriage for you,

176
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,690
A'Ni was very arrogant and simply looked down on you.

177
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,670
Someone like A'Ni is very competitive.

178
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,540
She is trying her best to win over us at the Hu Merchants Fair

179
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,740
to help Ruyi Resist Dye Shop show off.

180
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:57,460
This kind of woman, the more softhearted you are, the more she looks down at you.

181
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,040
She will only look up at you if you win over her.

182
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,740
If Caoji can get the contracts

183
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,810
from the Hu merchants, we will be the leader in this business,

184
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,920
and you will be a successful entrepreneur.

185
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,140
She will then see you in her eyes and will be willing to marry you.

186
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,290
I've said everything I should say.

187
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,160
Whether you want to tell them or not,

188
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,240
you decide.

189
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,680
This kind of woman, the more softhearted you are, the more she looks down at you.

190
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,360
She will only look up at you if you win over her.

191
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:15,240
If Caoji can get the contracts from the Hu merchants, we will be the leader in this business,

192
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,300
and you will be a successful entrepreneur.

193
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,630
She will then see you in her eyes and will be willing to marry you.

194
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,680
A'Ni! A'Ni!

195
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,130
A'Ni!

196
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,830
A'Ni. A'Ni.

197
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,680
Listen. Isn't there some sound coming from the outside?

198
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,240
A'Ni! A'Ni!

199
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,920
- Who is that?
- It's me, Cao Wu.

200
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,960
Cao Wu?

201
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,500
It's late, what are you doing here?

202
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,350
I came to tell you that there is a problem with the fabric for your sample dress.

203
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,100
Tomorrow is the Hu Merchants' Fair.

204
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,830
You must be careful.

205
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,980
We're doomed. We're totally doomed.

206
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,070
A'Ni, it's useless to panic now.

207
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,780
Why not think about a solution?

208
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,790
From choosing the fabric, deciding on the color, to design,

209
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:55,290
this dress took me a whole month to do.

210
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,770
But now, there are only a few hours before sunrise.

211
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,600
What solution can there be?

212
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:11,970
This dress has already shrunk and set its shape.

213
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,550
The colors are smeared, too.

214
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,000
We might as well change this one.

215
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,810
As long as the design is good,

216
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,250
we won't be afraid of the water test again.

217
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,140
Change this one?

218
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,120
How is it different from a reject right now?

219
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,710
It takes effort to achieve. Since it's not at the last moment,

220
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,810
why don't we try our best?

221
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,460
Don't worry.

223
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,630

Liuli. Liuli.

226
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,780
You must be exhausted. Go sleep in the bed for a while.

227
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,720
A'Ni.

228
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:49,510
A'Ni, look!  How does this dress look?

229
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,070
It's pretty.

230
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,790
This is the first time that I've seen anyone who can make a skirt look like a flower.

231
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,210
Red with a tinge of pink, beautiful and alluring,

232
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,330
just like a peony flower.

233
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,960
Liuli, you really worked hard.

234
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,550
In just six hours, you made a new skirt.

235
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,670
A'Ni, don't be too worried.

236
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,790
Even though this skirt doesn't look as opulent and poised,

237
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,450
but it looks more lively when worn now.

238
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,820
More lively when worn?

239
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,740
You just wait and see.

240
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,740
Even if this dress won't get the Hu merchants' orders,

241
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,730
it can still boost our Ruyi Resist Dye Shop's reputation.

242
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,070
So early?

243
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,960
The goods for today have already been stored?

244

Young Master Pei.

245
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,240
Early this morning when the sun just started shining, Assistant Professor Xue brought people over already.

246
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,770
All twelve carts are already stored inside?

247
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:09,820
It's 20 carts.

248
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,280
Why eight extra carts?

249
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,860
Wait! Let me go take a look inside.

250
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,260
Assistant Professor Xue already told us that

251
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,730
no one is allowed into the forbidden storage room.

252
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,090
I lost a jade pendant yesterday.

253
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,230
It was passed down from my ancestors.

254
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:33,000
I thought back carefully. It may have been dropped inside the storage room.

255
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,340
Just let me go inside to take a look. I can tell right away.

256
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,970
All right then, I'll wait right here.

257
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,710
Hurry.

258
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,700
I'll go in and come right back.

259
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,600
Thank you so much.

260
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,230
Have you found it?

261
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,780

Guards! Arrest Pei Xingjian!

265
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,750
Xue Xu, what are you arresting me for?

266
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,320
The crown prince is just carrying out a reform for the imperial examination.

267
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,940
He gave out orders to keep the Imperial Academy under strict control.

268
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,490
This is the repertory place of four schools of the Imperial Academy.

269
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,170
It is strictly forbidden for people who waste their time with trivial matters to enter here.

270
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,050
- Did you maybe not know that?
- Absurd!

271
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,060
I am a student of these four schools. How do I spend my time with trivial matters?

272
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,720
Besides, I didn't look through the merchandise.

273
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,420
If you don't believe me, open those boxes and see for yourself.

274
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,540
See what's really in there.

275
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,220
All right.

276
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,400
You are getting smart with me and even denying it.

277
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,800
An ordinary woman called Yu'er has filed a lawsuit against Pei Xingjian.

278
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,730
He misappropriated a huge amount of goods.

279

As signed by Simen College's Director of Studies.

280
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:40,410
Effective immediately, Pei Xingjian is suspended until further investigation.

281
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,430
You are such a muddled artist.

282
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,390
Aren't you causing trouble for me?

283
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,190

292
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,330
there really has been a young woman going in and out with A'Ni.

293
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,630
They've gone to the Hu Merchants Fair in the Western Market since early this morning.

294
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,950
- Hu Merchants Fair?
- I was just about to go to the Western Market to find A'Ni.

295
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,850
If you have an urgent matter, why not just go with me?

296
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,910
- Okay. Thanks.
- Let's go.

I had no idea that Ruyi Resist Dye's reputation would be so high in the dressmaking business.

It's all thanks to Attire Expert An leaving us a peerless craft in dyeing fabrics.

- It really kills two birds with the same stone.
- You—

00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:03,280
You said previously that you like your cousin.

324

For your cousin, you would rather never marry.

325
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,950
Yet soon after your cousin died,

326
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,890
I don't see a trace of sadness in you.

336
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,650
Young Master Pei, you're overthinking. This matter, even if you don't go and find her,

337
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:53,780
she will go to you to get her possessions back. How can she run away?

338
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,380
Why must you use martial arts to constrain a delicate girl?

00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,840
If you help me take it backstage to Shopkeeper A'Ni of the Ruyi Resist Dye Shop,

349
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,830
- I will buy a dough figure for you. All right?
- Yes, yes!

350
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:22,820
Okay, it's this bundle. Carry it well.

351
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,740
- You—
- Your stomach doesn't hurt anymore?

352
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,630
It's such an important bundle.

353
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:35,140
It'll be safer with me.

354
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,500
Older Sister, the dough figure?

355
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,700
Hurry up and buy him a dough figure.

356
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,990
- Why should I buy it?
- Of course you should. You stole his business.

357
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:57,040
Besides, haven't all my riches been conned away by you?

358
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,370
You—

359
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:17,340
- Boss, give me a dough figure.
- Yes.

360
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,080
Which one do you want?

361
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,580
[Suguard Dough Figures]

362
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,360
Here. Next time you meet a stranger, you can't interact with them.

363
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,640
Thank you.

364
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,820
Buy one for me, too.

365
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:46,840
You never did anything good. Why should I buy one for you?

366
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,990
- I didn't take your things.
- I didn't falsely accuse a good person.

367
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,290
- Then withdraw the lawsuit.
- Then give me my things back.

368
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,950
If you withdraw the lawsuit, I'll give you those things back.

369
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,110
No, that's not right. I got dizzy because of you.

370
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,750
How many times have I told you? I didn't take your stuff.

371
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,910
Go to Simen College and withdraw the lawsuit.

372
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:17,430
If you don't return the things, I won't withdraw it.

373
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,350
- What good does it do me to lie to you?
- Are you returning or not?

374
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,950
I really didn't take your stuff.

375
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,700
Who are you?

376
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,570
This time's fair was organized by us.

377
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,210
Because there are more shops participating than we expected,

378
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,830
so we're going to take the shops' sample backstage to pre-register.

379
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:43,820
This way, we'll have sufficient time to analyze the samples' quality and design.

380
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,950
You've really thought it through. Then I'll leave it to you.

381
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,480
Give it to me.

382
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,630
I'm warning you.

383
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,700
Don't have any ideas on this sample dress.

384
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,950
This fair is very important to our Ruyi Resist Dye Shop.

385
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,260
You can pick on me, but you can't make it hard for others!

386
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,120
This is Ruyi Resist Dye Shop's. Don't forget.

387
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,560
I won't forget. Please rest assured.

388
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,320
Thank you.

389
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,470
Laughable, laughable.

390
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,760
What do you mean by this?

391
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:39,060
Did you really not notice? He's not some Hu merchant at all.

392
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,490
What are you saying?

393
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,860
Look at you.

394
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,420
You have a smart face, yet you're so dumb.

395
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:50,430
Not only can you not recognize who stole your stuff, but you also gave your sample to a con man.

396
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,820
I really worry about Ruyi Resist Dye Shop.

397
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,570
You... You're lying!

398
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,550
If you don't believe me, you can ask other embroidery shops.

399
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,930
Ask them if they turned in their samples.

400
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:12,420
But even if you ask now, you'll be wasting your time.

401
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,060
How about this.

402
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:18,060
Go to Simen College and withdraw your lawsuit that falsely accuses me.

403
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,470
I'll help you chase down your sample. How about that?

404
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:27,080
Don't you dare try to trick me! Whether or not he is a swindler, I will know once I go to the back.

405
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:32,650
Hey! If you don't go after him, it'll be too late!

406
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,210
- Can you help me over here?
- Okay.

407
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,240
Have you sorted things out?

408
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,860
We need to check it.

409
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,610
Smoothen it out again.

410
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:45,170
- Don't be nervous.
- It's not even.

411
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,970
Great!

412
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:19,690
Honored friends of Great Tang,

413
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,510
are you well?

414
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:24,370
We're good!

415
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:28,370
My name is Cao Lushan. My tribesmen and friends

416
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:30,870
came from the west of the faraway Cong Mountains,
(Today's Pamir Mountains)

417
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,020
the vast western region.

418
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,190
We crossed many moutains and rivers to come to Chang'an

419
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:39,100
so that we can take Chang'an's bustle and riches

420
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,710
to bring it back to our home.

421
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:45,290
Today, we want to pick the most

422
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,450
beautiful clothing in Changan.

423
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:50,950
Hurry up and check carefully, don't let there be any problems.

424
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:53,720
The business that gets ranked the highest

425
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,830
will not only enjoy a one-year contract with the western region,

426
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:00,960
but will also become the king of business

427
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,780
to the Hu merchants!

428
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,690
Great!

429
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:10,460
The dressmaking competition starts now!

430
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,960
#1 and #2 go on stage.

431
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,200
#3 and #4 prepare.

432
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,310
Hurry, hurry!  We are next.

433
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,920
Good Brother, sorry to bother you,

434
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,300
can you still change the order to go on stage?

435
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,760
We, Ruyi Resist Dye Shop want to be further back.

436
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,490
- This--
- No way!

437
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,650
The order was chosen from drawing sticks between so many businesses.

438
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,520
Why can you guys change whenever you guys like?

439
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,210
- That is not fair!
- Exactly!

440
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:42,200
Exactly! That is not fair.

441
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,560
- On what basis? We're all here to compete.
- That's right.

442
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,980
I'm sorry, Shopkeeper A'Ni.

443
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:51,720
The rules are already set. They can't be easily changed.

444
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,220
Please help out.

445
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,320
A'Ni!

446
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,300
[Ruyi]

447
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,240
- A'Ni.
- Let's go.

448
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,300
Why are you back just now? The competition has already started.

449
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,430
Hurry up and give me the clothing.

450
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,200
Come back!  You cannot go.

451
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,530
It hurts! Auntie!

452
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,390
Where's the clothing?

453
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,800
What happened?

454
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,690
I think I was scammed.

455
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,270
Just now, a man told me that he was from the Hu Merchant Fair

456
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,650
and needed to take the sample dress first.

457
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,930
I really believed it.

458
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:36,290
It must be Caoji's trick. I'll go deal with them.

459
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,770
Wait.

460
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:40,450
We don't have proof. We cannot accuse them.

461
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:43,110
If we do, people will make use of it.

462
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:48,770
Then what should we do? Do we really just leave it?

463
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,770
Here are the clothes made by Wangji Shop and Gaoji Shop.

464
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,810
Without the clothing, how do we attend the competition?

465
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:15,960
A'Ni, don't get worried yet. Let's wait a bit.

466
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,620
Wait for Pei Xingjian.

467
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,750
Pei Xingjian?

468
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,160
#9 Caoji Resist Dye Shop is up.

469
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,610
Mother, hurry! Hurry!

470
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:16,440
#10 Ruyi Resist Dye Shop is up.

471
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,280
Caoji is coming.

472
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,510
- Wow!
- Yes.

473
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,430
Wow!

474
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,410
Beautiful!

475
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,390
A'Ni. Sorry.

476
00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:00,290
How can I blame you? It is Caoji's fault.

477
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:04,500
If it weren't for you, Ruyi Resist Dye Shop wouldn't even have a second sample dress.

478
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:11,810
This is the sample dress of our Caoji Resist Dye Shop.

479
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:14,150
We used the best cloth

480
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,810
and the most fantastic skills

481
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:20,640
to represent Great Tang's highest level of dressmaking skills.

482
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,670
Our Caoji Resist Dye Shop is the Number One Needle in the World.

483
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,390
There is only one in the world.

484
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,310
A'Ni, why have you still not prepared to go up?

485
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:41,980
I am really sorry. Ruyi Resist Dye Shop's clothing has gone missing.

486
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,040
We can only withdraw from the fair.

487
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,460
What are you doing?

488
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,730
Yes, what's happening?

489
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,860
Give me the sample dress and I'll let you live.

490
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:57,660
You guys... really want to withdraw?

491
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:01,300
Yes, we don't have a sample dress now.

492
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,090
Ruyi Resist Dye Shop's clothing is here!
