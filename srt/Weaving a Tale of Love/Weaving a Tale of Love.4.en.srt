[Episode 4]

4
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,240
I still have some left. I will give all of them to you.

5
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,610
This purse is quite exquisite.

6
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,960
I seem to have one that looks similar.

7
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,810
May I be bold enough to ask,

8
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,860
where did Talented Lady Wu

9
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,920
get your sachet?

10
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,320
My own sister at home went to the Western Market and bought it from a Hu merchant that she was familiar with.

11
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,110
If Attire Expert Zhuo wants, I can ask her

12
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,660
to buy more next time she sees them again.

13
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,830
This servant is only admiring the embroidery technique on the sachet.

14
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,790
That's why I was bold enough to ask about it.

15
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,640
I would not dare to bother Talented Lady Wu.

16
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,710
It's no bother.

17
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,300
[Bureau of Imperial Attire]

18
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,510
Physician Dou,

19
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,920
show me your sachet.

20
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,850
Did you make it yourself?

21
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,890
Of course not.

22
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,830
Then those purses that Xiao Shunzi bought, you made them?

23
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,660
All the purses were bought by Xiao Shunzi from the Hu merchant.

24
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,960
Let's just forget it, if you don't want to tell the truth.

25
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,380
You are trying so hard to lie, there must be a reason.

26
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,910
I don't intend to keep questioning, but I'd like to remind you of something.

27
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,880
If you have decided to lie, then don't show any loopholes.

28
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,130
Even though your sachet is made with exquisite craftsmanship,

29
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,620
but it is old. It looks about ten years, or at least eight years old.

30
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,020
Also, the fabric used is not any ordinary fabric used by civilians.

31
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,590
Those that are sold by Xiao Douzi

32
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,870
are newly made with high-quality fabrics used in the palace.

33
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,870
Attire Expert Zhuo was momentarily inattentive

34
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,770
and got fooled by your little trick.

35
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,520
Once she carefully thinks it over later, she will definitely realize some inkling.

36
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,530
Luckily there is still a chance to remedy the situation.

37
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,740
You can use the ordinary civilian fabric, mixed with some old fabric,

38
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,740
make another batch of purses and distribute them.

39
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,940
Remember to send one over to me.

40
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,920
If my guess is right, in a few days,

41
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,910
Attire Expert Zhuo will find an excuse to come to my place about the sachet.

42
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,280
At that time, if I don't have any,

43
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,210
I won't be able to keep helping you.

44
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,080
Talented Lady Wu is truly astounding.

45
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,580
Excellent writing!

Attendant.

49
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,990
Young Master Pei, what would you like?

50
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,400
Change that banner.

51
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,500
This... Young Master Pei, you probably don't know.

52
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,110
The phrase on top was left by a noble young master.

53
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,950
He said he wanted to challenge the elites in Chang'an.

54
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,220
Whoever can match with a bottom phrase, he will provide ten days of payment for wine.

55
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,480
If no one can do it, then...

56
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,700
Then it means the scholars in Chang'an are useless.

57
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,520
He even said he will ruin our Drunken Fragrance Tower's reputation.

58
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,950
"Mist locking" mountaintop locking mist.

59
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,490
It is indeed ingenious.

60
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,000
There was a big fog yesterday morning. Drunken Fragrance Tower was covered by the thick fog which didn't disperse for a long time.

61
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,350
The top phrase was inspired by the scene.

62
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,180
That young master also said the bottom phrase must also be inspired by this scene so as to become a couplet.

63
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,830
Now that the two-day limit is about to be reached.

64
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,250
I really don't dare to arbitrarily move it. Please be understanding, Young Master Pei.

65
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,240
Find another place to write then.

66
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,940
No.

67
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,830
I just want this place.

68
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,450
Good skill.

69
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,160
Let's go take a look.

70
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,580
- Go.
- Let's go.

71
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,190
This is written well.

72
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,990
Also in line with the phrase.

73
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:46,640
You've come. We have found for you the 30-year vintage wine kept in the cellar.

74
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,380
Good. The two-day limit has arrived. Has anyone come up with the bottom phrase?
[Crown Prince Li Zhi]

75
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,690
Our Drunken Fragrance Tower is the gathering place of all the gifted scholars and famous writers.

76
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,380
It's just that the two-day limit given by Young Master was really too short.

77
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,110
Why not extend it a few more days?

78
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,030
Someone will definitely be able to match with a bottom phrase by then.

79
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,130
This is really meaningful.

80
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,130
- Waiter!
- I'm here.

81
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,160
Who ate a bear heart and leopard gall?  (Who was so audacious?)

82
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,670
How dare he erase His—

83
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,590
...my young master's top phrase?

84
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,630
Young Master, don't be upset. Your top phrase is still there.

85
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,750
If you don't believe it, just look. It's an acrostic poem.

86
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,920
Laughingly I ask how much an exam candidate is worth.

87
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,460
Ten years of study fills me with ambition.

88
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,820
These two lines are really fierce.

89
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,870
The entire piece criticizes current affairs. The words are really sharp as swords and blades.

90
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,470
Which crazy rascal wrote this?

91
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,690
How dare he criticize Great Tang's imperial exam?

92
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,790
This... I am not good at reading and writing.

93
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,830
The signature is written at the end of the poem.

94
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,780
Will the noble guest please take a look himself?

95
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,670
Shouyue?
[Shouyue written at Drunken Fragrance Tower]

96
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,260
Who is this Shouyue?

97
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,320
This Shouyue is a student at the Imperial Academy's Simen College.

98
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,990
His surname is Pei, given name is Xingjian, courtesy name is Shouyue.

99
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,030
Shouyue is quick-witted with a fierce literary style.

100
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,220
His calligraphy and martial arts

101
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,810
are famous in Chang'an.

102
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,080
It's a minuscule skill.

103
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,040
If he is really skilled, he should have matched my young master's top phrase.

104
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,970
- Ingenious!
- Ingenious?

105
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,980
Young Master, how is it ingenious?

106
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,420
That Pei Xingjian has matched my phrase.

107
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,100
A'Sheng, look over there.

108
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,710
The first words across from the top phrase.

109
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,790
The bottom phrase is the third word from the bottom.

110
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,150
My top phrase is "Mist Locking Mountaintop Locking Mist."
[Read from right to left]

111
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:37,220
His bottom phrase is "Wine Entered Sadness Entered Wine."

112
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,290
It's nothing rare to write an acrostic poem,

113
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,930
but to hide both the top and the bottom phrases,

114
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,380
this is the first time I've seen so.

115
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,220
Such is Pei Xingjian!

116
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,510
To so cleverly think of such a matching method,

117
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,220
this Drunken Fragrance Tower is indeed full of hidden dragons and crouching tigers. (Full of hidden talents)

118
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,210
A'Sheng, pay the cashier.

119
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,550
- I want to invite him to drink this 30-year vintage wine.
- Yes.

120
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,340
- Attendant.
- I'm here.

121
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,090
Give my message to Young Master Pei.

122
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,490
I'll meet him five days later at Drunken Fragrance Tower.

123
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,030
Yes, I've got it.

124
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,030
The brush strokes are strong, too.

125
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,260
Talented Lady, Physician Dou has arrived.

126
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,450
Physician Dou greets Talented Lady Wu.

127
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,970
You are here to deliver the sachet, right?

128
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,970
Let me take a look.

129
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,810
This sachet is very similar to the ones sold by Xiao Shunzi.

130
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,520
Except the material used is different.

131
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,160
I wasn't wrong, right?

132
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,050
All these sachets were made by you.

133
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,500
Talented Lady Wu, I am ashamed.

134
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,590
I had my own reason and difficulties for not telling.

135
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,310
In this palace,

136
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,480
who doesn't have secrets and difficulties?

137
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,690
I will not force you.

138
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,450
Talented Lady, the guards at the door

139
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,860
said Attire Expert Zhou is here.

140
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,100
As expected, she came at such a coincidence.

141
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,210
That day, I said I had the same sachet.

142
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,380
Maybe Attire Expert Zhou

143
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,960
has come to ask about the sachet.

144
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,030
But don't you worry, Attire Expert Zhou

145
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,880
will not have any suspicion towards you.

146
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:49,780
Send Physician Dou out through the back door.

147
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,600
I thank Talented Lady Wu for saving me and Xiao Shunzi.

148
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,300
I owe you an explanation.

149
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,770
One day, I will reveal my reasoning to Talented Lady.

150
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,510
I help you because I can see that you are kind-hearted.

151
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:06,110
Let's count this as me returning you the favor for Talented Lady Di.

152
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,010
Master, there is such a sachet at Talented Lady Wu's.

153
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,650
This means that Xiao Shunzi and Physician Dou didn't lie.

154
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,370
Indeed the sachet came from the Western Market.

155
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,940
The Bureau of Imperial Attire got many rewards from my lady.

156
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,720
I'm just asking you to make her one last new attire.

157
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,670
But all of you are making a ruckus.

158
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,040
We make clothes for a living.

159
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,120
We don't have such a time to make clothes for the dead.

160
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,270
I'm actually not impressed by the workmanship and morals at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

161
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,250
I heard Physician Dou's

162
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,320
skills and morals are better than any of you.

163
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,580
I will go and beg him.

164
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,830
Just now what you said about Physician Dou is true?

165
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,400
I can't be wrong. Talented Lady Di's personal maid told me.

166
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,570
Talent Lady Di died of an illness, so Talented Lady Wu brought a new gown to see her off.

167
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:03,420
Unexpectedly, Talent Lady Di was already wearing a beautiful gown.

168
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,420
Talented Lady Wu asked and found out

169
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,790
that Talented Lady Di's gown was actually

170
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,480
made by Physician Dou of the Courtyard of Misfortune.

171
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,040
Master, based on what she said,

172
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,790

Does that file say who his parents were? How did he enter the palace?

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,230
Physician Dou has no father and no mother. When Sun Dechang left the palace to run errands,

he found this orphan alongside the street.

Originally, he was supposed to be castrated to become a little eunuch.
