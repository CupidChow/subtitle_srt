5
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,370
Pu Banu, quite a few days have passed.

6
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,880
Is there any news on Pei Xingjian's side?

7
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,840
Your Highness, Pei Xingjian is picking up the drug more and more often.

8
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,100
Based on my experience,

9
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,540
the person who is taking the drug must be already addicted and can't break it anymore.

10
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,840
Since the fish has already taken the bait, let's reel it in then.

11
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,760
Pu Banu, from this moment,

12
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,720
cut off the drug.

13
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,240
Yes.

14
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,370
Are you also out of your drug?

15
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,690
May I ask Your Highness for more of the drug?

16
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,320
- Xiao Liuzi.
- Your Highness.

17
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,620
Bring some of the drug for Pu Banu.

18
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,200
Yes.

19
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,780
Thank you, Your Highness, for giving me the drug.

[Hall of Shining Virtues]

21
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,210
Just three pills.

22
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,590
Your Highness, this essay is full of wisdom.

23
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,230
It complements Minister Chu's advice from yesterday.

24
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,720
They are different in tune but serve the same theme.

25
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,480
You said that Xiao Douzi's injury is improving every day,

26
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,360
and he can come to the East Palace very soon.

27
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,170
But many days have passed, why hasn't he come yet?

28
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,320
Could it be that you've been fooling me in case I worried too much?

29
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,780
I've been telling the truth. I wouldn't dare to lie to Your Highness.

30
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,070
Xiao Douzi's injury has recovered very quickly.

31
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,950
At this speed, in another two days,

32
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,500
Xiao Douzi's medicine will be out.

33
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,490
I will find the time to leave the palace

34
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,920
to pick up the last medicine from the clinic.

35
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:19,880
Your Highness, someone is looking for Imperial Guard Leader and says it's an urgent matter.

[Esteemed Virtues Gate]

37
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,660
- Xiao Shunzi.
- Imperial Guard Leader.

38
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,060
What are you doing here?

39
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,420
Do you have more of the medicine?

40
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,450
The ones that I gave you last time have already been eaten?

41
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,330
That's right. Xiao Douzi seems to be eating them fast like she is addicted.

42
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,920
She is taking more and more of them.

43
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,420
Once she's eaten them, she is energetic and vivacious.

44
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,630
Once the medicine's effect is over, she loses energy and gets tired.

45
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,700
I didn't want her to eat more, but she hides away to eat more.

46
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,220
She said that she could recuperate faster if she ate them

47
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,090
and won't bother me anymore. But this morning, the medicine was out.

48
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,190
She started to go crazy. Imperial Guard Leader!

Just as the proverb says, 30% of the medicine is poison.

How many pills a day? How many days for each course? Please tell me, Physician Heng.

how Pei Xingjian will beg me to help his sweetheart.

101
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:26,570
At that time, I will exchange his sweetheart's life for the East Palace's military power.

I was just about to reply to Your Highness,

105
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,710
Pei Xingjian's sweetheart appears to be inside the palace.

106
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,660
A palace maid?

107
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,160
Why are you just telling me now this important news?

108
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,340
Your Highness, please allay your anger. I am only speculating and can't be sure.

109

110
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,620
Which young woman would get beaten by planks?

111
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,460
Then she is most likely to be a palace maid.

112
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,430
Xiao Liuzi, go to Hall of Brilliant Joy and tell my mother about this.

113
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,380
Ask her to check, which young palace maids

114
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,780
have been beaten by planks and have been injured?

115
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,600

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,370
How is it? Have you found out?

118
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,450
Consort Yang, I investigated carefully.

119
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,850
During those days, there was no palace maid being punished.

120
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,540
However, a young physician

121
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,190
was beaten several dozens of times and almost got killed.

122
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,580
They say it's a young woman.

123
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,460
How could it be a physician?

124
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,750
Which physician in the Imperial Academy of Medicine would be punished so harshly?

125
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,020
I haven't heard anything about it.

126
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,640
It's not a physician from the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

127
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,760
It's Xiao Douzi, who was loaned from the Courtyard of Misfortune to the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

128
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,190
Xiao Douzi?

129
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,100
Xiao Douzi lost to Attire Expert Zhuo in the competition for Number One Needle in the World,

130
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,610
but he wouldn't concede his loss

131
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,320
and even accused in public that Attire Expert Zhuo stole the dragon robe that he had made.

132
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,330
Attire Expert Zhuo felt awkward and ordered him to be severely punished.

133
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,060
I heard that he was supposed to be beaten to death.

134
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,080
In the end, Pei Xingjian saved him and took him away.

135
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,430
Everything fits now.

136
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,480
The only difference is the last part.

137
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,980
That Physician Heng said the person Pei Xingjian was saving was a young woman.

138
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,080
But Xiao Douzi is a male.

139
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,580
What is going on?

140
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,650

Come take a look!

145
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,340
It looks that the young lady you want to save is out of medicine now.

146
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,020
It is really you.

147
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:31,090
Speak... Where is the antidote?

148
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,630
I am looking for the antidote, too.

149
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,180
But this poison doesn't have an antidote.

150
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,840
To live, you must keep taking the pills.

151
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,930
Otherwise, death is the only way.

152
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,310
If you don't tell the truth, I will kill you now!

153
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,760
Go ahead and kill me. I am a useless person anyway now.

154
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,880
I would like to ask you something, Pei Xingjian.

155
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,360
How does it feel when you have ruined the person you wanted to save?

156
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:09,110
Who is she? Is she your sweetheart?

157
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,540
I understand very well the pain she is suffering now.

158
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,920
It's like a hundred bugs biting me, ten thousand needles piercing my bones.

159
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,690
Dying is better than staying alive. All of this

160
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,720
is thanks to you.

161
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,480
If you have to time to vent your anger upon me here,

162
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,610
why not think of a way to beg the person you should beg.

163
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,710
I don't need to remind you who that person is, do I?

164
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,090
Xiao Douzi!

165
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,130
Xiao Douzi!

Eunuch Sun.

167
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,020
Xiao Douzi!

168
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,280
- What's the matter with Xiao Douzi?
- Xiao Douzi is missing.

169
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,120
I'm afraid that she is getting desperate.

170
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,230
Reporting to Consort Yang. Xiao Douzi has been recuperating from injuries at the Courtyard of Misfortune.

171
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,590
When we picked him up, he was already tied up.

172
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,480
We don't know why.

173
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,360
Then this fits.

174
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,780
The drug addiction must be taking effect. That's why he's tied up,

175
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,840
so that he gets crazy and hurts himself.

176
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,310
Therefore, you are the person that Pei Xingjian is trying to save.

177
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,750
Xiao Douzi, you and I

178
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,840
are quite connected by fate.

179
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,330
You have a fair face with rosy cheeks.

180
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,420
The soft face...

181
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,250
is even prettier than a palace maid.

182
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,480
I was recuperating in the Courtyard of Misfortune. It's not against any palace rules.

183
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,770
I don't know why Consort Yang captured me here.

184
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,560
Recuperating?

185
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,460
It's good timing.

186
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,870
I have the best medicinal ingredients from the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

187
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,760
You only need to take off your clothes,

188
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,260
and soak your body with the steam from the medicine.

189
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,990
Your wound will recover very quickly.

190
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,080
Replying to Consort Yang.

191
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,070
I am a lowly person.

192
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:05,120
How can I overstep boundaries and use the imperial physician and ingredients from the Imperial Academy of Medicine?

193
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,820
Consort Yang brought me here.

194
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,690
If you want me to do anything, just order me.

195
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,450
I can't do that.

196
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,860
How can I be so coldhearted to order a sick person to work?

197
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,720
Come, disrobe Xiao Douzi.

198
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,840
Let go of me! Let go of me!

199
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,810
Let go of me!

200
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,800
Let go of me!

201
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,400
You... are you crazy? I am being kind to help you recover from your injuries.

202
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,310
You actually hit me?

203
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,830
Speak.

204
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,450
Why are you disguising as a male to hide your true identity?

205
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,990
With your fantastic skills in dressmaking,

206
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,570
you can become a famous dressmaker anywhere you go.

207
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,900
Why are you being hard on yourself

208
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,120
by disguising as a male in the palace

209
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,270
and living under dangers?

210
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,730
I've already investigated your background.

211
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,180
You came into the palace at the age of seven, grew up in the Courtyard of Misfortune,

212
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,200
and taught yourself skills in dressmaking and embroidery.

213
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,930
That's why Zhuo Jinniang paid attention and transferred you to the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

214
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,820
Thereafter, you challenged Zhuo Jinniang for the seat of Number One Needle in the World.

215
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,750
Despite taking the risk of being beaten to death,

216
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,010
you still wouldn't give up.

217
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,820
There must be a real reason involved.

218
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,820
Speak. Who exactly are you?

219
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,710
Where did you learn your dressmaking skills from?

220
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,600
You want to kill me. Just do it.

221
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,120
Why do you ask so many questions?

222
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,450
I guessed it right.

223
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,590
You are indeed a female.

224
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,750
And even a pretty girl.

225
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,780
Dan Qing, take her away.

226
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,860
Change her into female attire to let me take a look.

227
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,650
- Yes.
- Yes.

228
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,410
What happened today, no one can spread it outside.

229
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,570
Otherwise, I will take your lives.

230
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,520
Did you feed her that half of a pill from the Prince of Cao?

231
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,700
She's already eaten it.

232
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,040
Consort Yang, why did you make Xiao Douzi wear female clothes?

233
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,460
I seem to have seen that face somewhere.

234
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,310
But I can't remember it right away.

235
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,260
I remember it now.

236
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,830
We met at the Hall of Sunset Pool.

237
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,610
In that case, Talented Lady Wu made you disguise as a male

238
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,820
and arranged for you to enter the Bureau of Imperial Attire?

239
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,480
Speak. Wu Meiniang

240
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,530
let you hide in the palace for many years. What is your scheme?

241
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,590
Wu Meiniang and Crown Prince are in collusion.

242
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,040
I have been needing a reason to knock them down.

243
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,500
This is perfect.

244
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,490
My disguise as a male has nothing to do with Talented Lady Wu.

245
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,050
Don't use it as an excuse

246
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,840
to drag down Crown Prince and Talented Lady Wu.

247
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,880
You say it's nothing, so it's not connected?

248
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,610
I am the daughter of

249
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,410
Attire Expert An, who was wrongly accused

250
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,140
and killed eleven years ago,

251
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,300
Kudi Liuli.

252
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,360
I disguised as a male to hide in the palace

253
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,260
because I couldn't help the circumstances.

254
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,270
No one ordered me to do it.

255
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,630
Indeed you resemble Madam An very much.

256
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,270
At such a young age, you overshadowed Zhuo Jinniang.

257
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,620
It's because you inherited Madam An's unique skills.

258
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,440
Now everything makes sense.

259
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,630
For several times, you helped the crown prince oppose me.

260
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,470
You also purposely entered the Bureau of Imperial Attire

261
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,060
to challenge Zhuo Jinniang for the seat of Number One Needle in the World.

262
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,530
It's for the incident of your mother secretly making the pheasant robe for the empress

263
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,410
and being punished to die by His Majesty.

264
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,590
That's right. I stayed in the palace

265
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,730
in order to avenge my mother

266
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,510
and exonerate her from the grievance.

267
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,870
Back then, Madam An secretly made the pheasant robe for the empress

268
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,900
and let Zhuo Jinniang offer it to me.

269
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,790
It attracted court ministers' criticism and dragged me into gossip and danger.

270
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,610
She deserved to die ten thousand times. What's the grievance?

271
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,420
My mother was framed!

272
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,620
My mother already received the late empress's kind permission

273
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,470
to let her resign her duty and leave the palace so that she could stay away from palace intrigue

274
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,500
and live a simple and quiet civilian life.

275
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,820
Why would she take the deathly risk

276
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,340
to appease you, a woman who wasn't conferred as the empress yet?

277
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,640
I was still young those years ago, but I remember it very clearly.

278
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,380
It was Zhuo Jinniang

279
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,110
who forced my mother

280
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,080
to fix the pheasant robe that she had made for you.

281
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,180
To protect the Kudi family, my mother

282
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,090
was forced to agree to it.

283
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,690
But who would have known that after the incident blew up, my mother

284
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:12,980
was falsely accused of the high crime of conspiracy of overstepping boundaries to make a dress to appease you.

285
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,200
Consort Yang,

286
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,560
I would like to ask you.

287
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,570
Is my mother's death connected with you?

288
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,550
Did you ask Zhuo Jinniang...

289
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,520
Didn't you order Zhuo Jinniang to make it?

290
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:41,280
Back then, His Majesty did want to confer me as empress.

291
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,190
But I was timid and didn't want to exceed my station.

292
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,900
Zhuo Jinniang and Attire Chief Lin took the initiative to offer the pheasant robe.

293
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,350
His Majesty happened to see it.

294
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:56,480
His Majesty was enraged and wanted to mete out punishment. Zhuo Jinniang got scared.

295
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,080
She confessed saying that the pheasant robe for the empress

296
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,370
was secretly made by your mother

297
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,600
and lied to her that it was just an ordinary dress,

298
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,130
and coaxed her to bring it into the palace to offer it to me.

299
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,100
It had nothing to do with her and the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

300
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,110
Consort Yang is saying all this so lightly.

301
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,970
If this is true,

302
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,060
you should hand this case to the Court of Judicial Review to investigate thoroughly.

303
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,960
Why didn't you listen to my mother's explanation,

304
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,750
and convict my mother to death row based on Zhuo Jinniang's version of what happened?

305
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:31,210
Clearly, you harbor ulterior motives and wanted to frame her

306
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,920
and shut her mouth by killing her.

307
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,310
It seems that, those years ago,

308
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,920
it was very likely that Zhuo Jinniang framed Madam An

309
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,500
in order to extricate herself from the crime.

310
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,640
Consort Yang, why are you so quiet?

311
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,120
Are you feeling guilty?

312
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,740
What happened those years ago,

313
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,280
it does seem to be full of suspicion when thinking about it now.

314
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,610
But even if your mother was framed,

315
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,580
the person who accused your mother was Zhuo Jinniang.

316
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:06,100
The person who convicted her was His Majesty. The investigation was handled by the Court of Judicial Review. I'm not involved.

317
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,970
Besides, the incident passed many years ago.

318
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,060
I hold your little life in my hand.

319
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,580
Why should I lie to you?

320
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,020
You only need to agree to work for me.

321
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,440
I will help you deal with Zhuo Jinniang

322
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,440
and revenge the grievance of her killing your mother. How about it?

323
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,470
You want me to help you?

324
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:36,540
What can I do?

325
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,560
You are a good chess piece that I've finally obtained.

326
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,650
Let me think it over nicely.

327
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,580
How can I use this little chess piece well

328
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:50,810
and win the big chess game from Pei Xingjian and Li Zhi?

329
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,930
I advise you to kill me quickly.

330
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:58,840
You want me to help you? Don't even dream about it.

331
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,910
When your drug addiction's withdrawal symptom occurs in a while,

332
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,590
we'll see if you can still talk tough.

333
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:10,030
Dan Qing, take her away and guard her well.

334
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,750
Yes.

335
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,640
[Regulations Bureau]

336
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,410
Imperial Guard Leader.

337
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,990
Have you seen Xiao Douzi?

338
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,630
Xiao Douzi? Isn't he recuperating in the Courtyard of Misfortune?

339
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,070
Xiao Douzi is missing. Did he return to the Bureau of Imperial Attire?

340
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,500
Why is he missing? What happened?

341
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,530
There's no time to explain.

342
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,600
I hope he is just hiding because he is feeling bad.

343
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,940
If he was captured by Prince of Cao or Consort Yang,

344
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,760
that would be terrible.

345
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,450
- Brother Pei.
- Please help me with a favor. Xiao Douzi is missing.

346
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:06,130
Take people to quietly search in the palace. Don't miss any place that you can think of or not think of.

347
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:09,580
Also, find a few most trusted ones to scout around the Prince of Cao's Manor.

348
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:14,230
It's also possible that Prince of Cao or Consort Yang has captured him.

349
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,550
- It's impossible to get inside Prince of Cao's Manor now.
- Why?

350
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,230
I was just about to report to Brother Pei.

351
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:23,040
You told me to pay attention to the armor stored inside Prince of Cao's Manor, and I have not dared to even slack.

352
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,880
Yesterday, two people who have been ordered to monitor Prince of Cao's Manor

353
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,750
finally saw that the armor has been secretly shipped out.

354
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,450
So they followed along the way to find where the armor was being sent.

355
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:35,000
Too bad that they were discovered.

356
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,140
One person was captured. The other one escaped and returned.

357
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,140
Are these two trustworthy?

358
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,090
These two are absolutely trustworthy. What I worry about is

359
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,560
that the one that has been captured will be seen through by the Prince of Cao

360
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,070
as one of our imperial guards.

361
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:54,020
Right now, the Prince of Cao Manor must be under heavy guard. If we try to get inside to investigate,

362
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,500
it would be practically impossible.

363
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,820
His Majesty's illness is getting worse and worse every day.

364
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,160
His Majesty also knows he doesn't have much time left.

365
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:10,540
That's why he has personally appointed Zhangsun Wuji and Chu Suiliang as ministers-regent to assist the crown prince.

366
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:14,260
His purpose is obvious. The crown prince will soon

367
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,540
inherit the throne.

368
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,510
For the Prince of Cao to secretly move the armor,

369
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,220
he is clearly prepared to rebel.

370
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,560
Don't do anything to alert the Prince of Cao Manor for now.

371
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,860
The most important task right now is to guard all the city gates.

372
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,820
What about the palace gates?

373
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,110
Don't do anything unusual at the palace gates.

374
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,960
Do you remember the Black Tortoise Gate's Coup years ago?

375
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:42,750
Thank you, Brother Pei, for the reminder, or I would have committed a great disaster.

376
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,820
Right now, the situation in court is beneficial to the crown prince.

377
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,540
But the more it's like this, the more we must exercise caution.

378
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,780
We must not get caught in any wrongdoing by the Prince of Cao.

379
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,940
He will use the chance to frame the crown prince.

380
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,880
We must also be wary of the Prince of Cao making a last strike with all he's got to revolt.

381
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,400
I shall keep it to heart.

382
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,570
The Prince of Cao is moving the armor, so something big will happen.

383
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,490
I'm going to report to the crown prince now to plan a countermeasure.

384
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,350
I didn't know that Imperial Brother and I are thinking the same way.

385
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:35,640
Pei Xingjian, why are you avoiding me when you see me?

386
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,210
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

387
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,450
Greetings, Your Highness the Prince of Cao.

388
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:47,010
You came here looking so rushed.

389
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,700
There must be some secret news to report to the crown prince.

390
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,850
Imperial Brother is busy with state affairs. This younger brother won't bother you then.

391
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,700
I will arrange to meet Imperial Brother to reminisce brotherly bonds.

392
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,690
Sure, we brothers haven't had a heart-to-heart chat like today.

393
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,460
You must come more often to the East Palace to chat.

394
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,870
Thank you, Imperial Brother, for your kind gesture. I will take my leave then.

395
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,950
A'Sheng, help me walk the Prince of Cao out.

396
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,590
Yes.

397
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,470
Your Highness the Prince of Cao.

398
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,930
You dropped your sachet.

399
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:28,180
It's such a finely made sachet, you should put it away.

400
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,800
That's what I think, too.

401
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,490
I remember that this sachet

402
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,980
was given to me by a beauty some years ago.

403
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,720
I will walk the Prince of Cao out for the crown prince.

404
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,350
No need.

405
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:51,170
There are important things to rush, and unimportant things that can wait. Don't reverse the order.

406
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,540
That's Liuli's sachet.

407
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,840
The Prince of Cao deliberately came to remind me that he has Liuli.

408
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,460
The Prince of Cao used the word "beauty" to remind me

409
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,680
that he already knows Liuli is a female.

410
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,680
Prince of Cao's visit today is quite suspicious.

411
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,860
He only chatted a little but dashed away in a hurry after he saw you come.

412
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,700
With the Prince of Cao's scheming mind, I don't think he would do this for no reason.

413
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,950
The Prince of Cao's purpose is very clear.

414
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,300
He is using Liuli's life to threaten me

415
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,210
to stop me from reporting about the armor's movement.

416
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:34,360
You looked to be in a hurry just now. Is there anything urgent?

417
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,670
I heard that the Prince of Cao came here, and was concerned that he would take advantage of you.

418
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,990
That's why I rushed over here.

419
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,100
[Esteemed Virtues Gate]

420
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,390
Your Highness, is this Xiao Douzi so important

421
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,260
to make Pei Xingjian betray the crown prince?

422
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,240
Pei Xingjian is someone who regards friendship highly.

423
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,140
This kind of person, once he falls in love,

424
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,630
it's like there is a door to his life.

425
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:15,480
Xiao Douzi is Pei Xingjian's door to his life.

426
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,360
Not only will I use her to control Pei Xingjian

427
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,940
to mobilize the East Palace's troops,

428
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:25,570
I also want her to add an iron-clad proof

429
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:28,350
to frame the crown prince as plotting to usurp the throne.

430
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:45,070
Liuli, I've already thought of what you should do.

431
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,360
You only need to make a dress for me,

432
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,160
and I will let you live.

433
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,270
Could it be a funerary gown?

434
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,100
Unless you want me to overstep my boundaries

435
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,990
and make you a pheasant robe for an empress?

436
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,900
This time, I want you to make

437
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,030
a dragon robe.

438
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:10,200
It seems that the Prince of Cao can't wait to usurp the throne.

439
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:15,920
I am having this dragon robe made based on the crown prince's measurements.

440
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,930
The crown prince?

441
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,160
I heard that, in spite of all the embroidery maids in the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

442
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,300
the crown prince only wears the clothes that you make.

443
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,000
The crown prince has great affection for you and often summons you to the East Palace.

444
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,090
Everyone knows about this.

445
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,860
What I want you to do is not difficult to do.

446
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,250
You only need to make a dragon robe for the crown prince,

447
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,830
then find a chance to hide it in the East Palace.

448
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,820
Back then you framed my mother

449
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,770
and made me lose my family.

450
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:50,740
Now, you actually want me to help you to frame the crown prince as a traitor.

451
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,520
You are dreaming!

452
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,400
I will never help the evil commit wrongdoings against my conscience,

453
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,120
and become Great Tang's sinner for a thousand years.

454
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,510
Don't be so agitated.

455
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:04,000
With or without you, the crown prince will rebel.

456
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,380
I will let you make a dragon robe for the crown prince.

457
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,490
It's just to add an iron-clad proof to the crown prince's high crime of treason.

458
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,690
The real high crime of treason

459
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,630
still requires Pei Xingjian's help.

460
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,700
You have conjured the wrong idea.

461
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,040
Pei Xingjian is upstanding and honorable. He would never be disloyal

462
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,620
and do anything to betray the crown prince.

463
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:32,560
Pei Xingjian is upstanding, honorable, and strong with conviction.

464
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,010
We originally couldn't do anything about him.

465
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,030
But it's different now.

466
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,250
We have you as a chess piece.

467
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:45,290
Now we can make Pei Xingjian listen to us.

468
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,880
Liuli, Liuli...

469
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,870
Between you and the crown prince,

470
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,820
who do you want Pei Xingjian to choose?

471
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:10,350
You should enjoy how it feels without the medicine.

472
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:14,010
I'll see how long you can still resist.

473
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,020
Don't let her pass out.

474
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,510
I want her to feel deeply

475
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:27,530
what it is like to wish she were dead.

476
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,200
Yes.

477
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:37,920
[Prince of Cao Manor]

478
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,990
Imperial Guard Leader.

479
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,560
Hurry and report to the Prince of Cao that Imperial Guard Leader Pei Xingjian seeks to meet him.

480
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,340
Prince of Cao has been waiting for you for a long time.

481
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,540
Imperial Guard Leader, please enter.

482
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,190
Your Highness.

483
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,680
Greetings, Prince of Cao.

484
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,190
Pei Xingjian, are you here for this sachet?

485
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,430
I never realized that Xiao Douzi would be such a beauty.

486
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:38,410
No matter that you risked your life several times to save her,

487
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,880
it's because you were cherishing a precious jade, (refers to a beautiful woman)

488
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,950
and heroically saved a beauty.

489
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,750
What does Your Highness want? Go ahead and say it.

490
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,870
Good.

491
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,610
Very candid.

492
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:01,810
I want you to change your allegiance to be loyal to me.

493
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,730
What if I don't agree?

494
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,400
Then, I will stop her medicine

495
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,010
and expose her real identity publicly.

496
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,720
What did you say?

497
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,880
I don't have to pretend with you.

498
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,800
Xiao Douzi's real name is Kudi Liuli.

499
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,750
She is the daughter of Madam An, who was convicted of conspiracy.

500
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,000
She escaped death elevan years ago, and then

501
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,820
disguised as a male to pretend to be a sanitation medical officer at the Courtyard of Misfortune.

502
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,290
That's how she has survived till now.

503
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,280
If this matter is revealed publicly,

504
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,490
no matter by national law or by palace rules, she cannot escape from the death punishment.

505
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,920
Pei Xingjian,

506
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,850
as long as you change your allegiance,

507
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,950
not only will I not forgive and forget the past,

508
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:55,330
I will even help you come together

509
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:58,220
and become a fairy couple

510
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,760
that everyone admires.

511
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,670
I want to see Liuli, to make sure that she is all right.

512
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,760
Then I will accept Your Highness's suggestion.

513
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,680
Good. It's precisely what I wish.

514
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,420
Come here tonight at 9:00, by yourself.

515
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,630
All right.

516
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,370
I'll take my leave.

517
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,830
I really can't bear being mean.

518
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,010
Don't leave! Don't leave!

519
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:12,230
Don't blame me for being mean.

520
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,710
Consort Yang won't go back on her promise.

521
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,660
Even though I want to help you very much, but

522
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,450
you are the only one who can help you. I advise you to agree to Consort Yang's demand.

523
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,810
Why suffer so much?

524
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:28,290
This is the last pill.

525
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:32,270
If you don't agree, I really can't help you even if I want to.

526
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,590
You've decided to die.

527
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,870
Don't blame me after you die.

528
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,400
I agree!

529
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,920
Isn't this good if you said so earlier on?

530
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,510
It would have saved our effort.

531
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:29,020
[Hall of Gentle Breeze]

532
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,740
- Untie her.
- Yes.

533
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,880
I heard that you've thought it through.

534
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,750
It seems that you are not willing yet.

535
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:09,340
When you're like this, how can I be at ease to let you do the work?

536
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,810
You feed me the poison,

537
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,650
while you want me to do work for you.

538
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,640
How can I be willing then?

539
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,380
I have the poison, then naturally I also have the antidote.

540
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,360
As long as you do everything obediently,

541
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:26,100
I guarantee that you can eliminate the addiction and be well again.

542
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,090
What do you want me to do?

543
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,810
I want you to write a note and give it to Pei Xingjian.

544
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,200
If you can complete this task,

545
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,930
I will believe that you are truly loyal.

546
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,120
Say it. What do you want me to write?

547
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:04,740
Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m., the Prince of Cao will raise an army at the Black Tortoise Gate.

548
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,430
What are you worried about?

549
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,140
Are you worried that Pei Xingjian will believe you

550
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:24,650
and encourage the Crown Prince to mobilize his troops at the Black Tortoise Gate and fall into our trap

551
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:28,610
and get accused of treason and lose his title as the crown prince?

552
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:33,150
Such a woman in love!

553
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:38,270
At a time like this, you are still worried about pushing Pei Xingjian into disloyalty and dishonor.

554
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:42,350
You didn't know that those pills that have made you suffer and wish you were dead

555
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:45,160
were given to Xiao Shunzi by Pei Xingjian himself

556
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,460
to let Xiao Shunzi coax you to take them.

557
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:53,700
Your suffering today is all thanks to Pei Xingjian.

558
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:58,460
Therefore, you really should not feel guilty toward him.

559
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:27,370
[Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m., the Prince of Cao will raise an army at the Black Tortoise Gate]

560
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,210
Prince of Cao has caught a cold.

561
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:40,550
Consort Yang is going to his manor to visit him.

562
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,440
Consort Yang, why are you making the effort to go to the prince's manor?

563
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,080
Why not just let Pei Xingjing go directly to the Hall of Brilliant Joy?

564
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,280
What do you know?

565
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,150
The Hall of Brilliant Joy is not big. What if Pei Xingjian plays a trick

566
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:06,410
to destroy both sides? We would lose.

567
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:09,500
The prince's manor is our territory and it's outside the palace.

568
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,370
If he wants to play a trick,

569
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,740
at worst, we'll just destroy the body and erase all traces.

570
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:23,940
[Prince of Cao Manor]

571
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,800
Your Highness, Pei Xingjian is here.

572
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,980
Greetings, Your Highness the Prince of Cao.

573
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,670
Bring Liuli.

574
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,170
Yes.

575
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:44,580
Pei Xingjian, when you two see each other in a little while,

576
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,060
you don't mind if I stay here, do you?
