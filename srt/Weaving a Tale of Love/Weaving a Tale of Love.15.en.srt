[Weaving a Tale of Love]

3
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,080
[Episode 15]

4
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,920
Skinny, isn't it boring doing our job every day?

5
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,860
Fatty, let me tell you. I know a good place.

6
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,630
A newly opened brothel.

7
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,200
- The girls there...
- Hey!

8
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,420
What are you doing? Who are you here to see?

9
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,150
Sirs, I am Physician Dou's friend.

10
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,440
I am here to deliver some food. Please allow me.

11
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,350
Xiao Douzi committed a high crime. You can't visit.

12
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,160
This is just a little gift.

13
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,150
Then, hurry. Don't take too long.

14
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,850
Thank you. Thank you.

15
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,180
- Share! Hey!
- It's mine!

16
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,530
Sir! Sir! Save me! Save me!

17
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,390
I have been wronged! Sir. Sir!

18
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:03,130
- What?
- Can you do me a favor?

19
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,940
I am a scaredy-cat.

20
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,650
Every time I visit somewhere dark like this,

21
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,610
my legs will get soft and my nose stings.

22
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,620
If I see Physician Dou,

23
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,680
I might end up sobbing.

24
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,660
If I cry my eyes out, it'd be hard to explain when I get back.

25
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,980
Can you help me to the end and deliver this food box to him?

26
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,580
Don't worry. You can go.

27
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,040
Thank you, Sirs!

28
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,470
All good. You can go.

29
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,520
You should save some for him.

30
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,070
Let me tell you!

31
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,810
There's only a little plate. It's not enough to pick my teeth with.

32
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,710
No, aren't you going to sit? Do you want one?

33
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,990
I don't like sweet things.

34
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,490
Your Highness, I can do things like this.

35
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,720
The imperial prison is cold. You don't need to personally make a trip.

36
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,310
Your Highness.

37
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,390
What are you doing, being like two wooden poles?

38
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,400
Don't you see His Highness the Crown Prince is here?

39
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,920
Greetings to Your Highness.

40
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,730
Courtyard of Misfortune's Physician Xiao Douzi is here, right?

41
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,000
Your Highness, Phydian Dou—

42
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,240
- Your Highness, Physician Dou is imprisoned in a hidden cell.
- Take me there.

43
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,320
- Yes!
- Yes!

44
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,690
This way, Your Highness.

45
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,000
What is the crown prince doing at the imperial prison?

46
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,890
I also thought this was weird.

47
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,220
I am worried.

48
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,330
Did you finish your task for Xiao Douzi?

49
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,930
- Sh-Should.
- What do you mean should?

50
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,320
I will only ask you.

51
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,780
Did you personally see Xiao Douzi stop breathing?

52
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,320
The guards wouldn't let me go in,

53
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,360
but Attire Expert Zhuo, rest assured.

54
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,580
I sent Xiao Douzi's favorite food,

55
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,680
and the guards received my bribes.

56
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,930
They promised to deliver it for me, so...

57
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,690
- so it should...
- Shut up.

58
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,730
Qiniang. Qiniang!

59
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,590
Go, investigate the imperial prison's situation.

60
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,510
If something happened at the imperial prison, report it immediately.

61
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,660
Master, what do you want me to find out?

62
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,960
You speak too much!

63
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,910
If I knew what happened there, I wouldn't need you to investigate!

64
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,140
I will go now.

65
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,490
A'Sheng.

66
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,790
Who are you?

67
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,190
How dare you be rude to the crown prince?

68
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,310
Bow!

69
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,470
Greetings to Your Highness. I am blind and my mouth is dumb.

70
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,680
I deserve death.

71
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,100
- Open it.
- Yes.

72
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,060
Yes.

73
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,720
- What is it?
- Go outside.

74
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,330
Yes.

75
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,430
As a favor to Pei Xingjian, I hurriedly came back to save you.

76
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,700
But I didn't think you'd be so calm and practice writing here.

77
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,380
Are you really not afraid?

78
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,520
I am afraid. It's because I'm too scared that I am like this.

79
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,310
What kind of logic is this?

80
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,380
If I am curled into a ball, crying, and feeling sad for myself,

81
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,780
then I will only make myself more miserable and pitiful.

82
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,380
There wouldn't be anything good for me doing that.

83
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,430
If so, then I should treat myself well.

84
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,870
Even if I am taking pleasure in hard times, it's better than blaming fate and others.

85
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,250
- A'Sheng.
- Your Highness.

86
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,380
Listen to that. You only know how to worry about this and that.

87
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,880
It's so miserable it makes me annoyed.

88
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,480
This Physician Dou has the ability to calm the mind and heart.

89
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,050
He knows what's important and what's not. It suits me more than you.

90
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,600
Get up first, Xiao Douzi.

91
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,050
Raise your head.

92
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,820
You are so quick-witted and bright-looking,

93
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,910
and you understand what's important and the meaning of courage.

94
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,900
How did you get buried in this Courtyard of Misfortune?

95
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,740
I heard that you ran away from the palace this time.

96
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,430
Why did you run?

97
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,040
I served as a sanitization physician at the Courtyard of Misfortune for many years.

98
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,650
I am the adopted son of Eunuch Sun of the Courtyard of Misfortune.

99
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,060
A few days ago, because I was naughty, I made Eunuch Sun mad.

100
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,300
Father was so mad that he said he'd chase me out of the palace.

101
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,120
I, therefore, asked to be transferred to the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

102
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,480
I ran away because I wanted to be stubborn with Father.

103
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,980
So that's what happened.

104
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,800
Fatty! Fatty!

105
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,630
What's happened to you, Fatty!

106
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,390
Don't scare me, Fatty!

107
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,350
Fatty!

108
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,930
Fatty, what happened to you?

109
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,920
Fatty, don't scare me.

110
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,170
Fatty. Fatty!

111
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,300
Your Highness, he was saying that his stomach hurt and was sweating profusely.

112
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,670
Not long later, he started spitting foam and fell dead.

113
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,840
Looking at this, it seems like he was poisoned.

114
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,340
There was only you two here.

115
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,220
Now one of you died.

116
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,470
Then, let me ask you, who could be the one who did the poisoning?

117
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,210
Your Highness, I did not do this.

118
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:15,350
This... must be the osmanthus cake. It has to be the osmanthus cake.

119
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,560
Your Highness, earlier someone sent a plate of osmanthus cakes.

120
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,060
They asked Physician Dou to eat them.

121
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,080
However, Fatty was tempted and ate it himself. Therefore, he died.

122
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,720
Someone wants Xiao Douzi to die. Therefore, they put poison in the osmanthus cake.

123
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,710
To think that Fatty became the scapegoat.

124
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,490
Who delivered the osmanthus cake?

125
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,380
It was a eunuch, twenty years old.

126
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,600
I've never seen him before.

127
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,010
Xiao Douzi, do you have enemies within the palace?

128
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,760
I can't think of any.

129
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,690
Hua Tian, ask for the body to be examined.

130
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,470
Check to see if it was the osmanthus cake.

131
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,960
Investigate. We must find the one who put the poison in.

132
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,520
Yes.

133
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,850
Where is Xiao Douzi's capture order signed?

134
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,510
Who gave the order to capture him?

135
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:28,810
Your Highness, it was Deputy Director of Directorate of Eunuchs, Pan Qinhai.

136
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,560
A'Sheng.

137
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,850
Your Highness.

138
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,420
Tell Pan Qinghai

139
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,400
that Xiao Douzi did not run away from the palace.

140
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,170
He went out to do my business.

141
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,100
I ordered him to keep quiet but didn't think he'd be so quiet.

142
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,160
He's been wrongly accused and locked up in the imperial prison.

143
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,440
This is the poisoning incident's witness. Watch after him.

144
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,540
When the poisoning incident's resolved, we can see about his release.

145
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,530
Yes.

146
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,540
Xiao Douzi, follow me.

147
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,170
Your Highness the Crown Prince!

148
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,870
Thank you for saving my life, Your Highness.

149
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,240
Speaking of which, I should be the one to thank you.

150
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,590
If you hadn't risked your life to enter the palace and turn yourself in,

151
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,830
and then thought of a way to send a message to Talented Lady Wu,

152
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,600
I'm afraid that I would have still been unaware of being in danger.

153
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,940
No wonder Pei Xingjian praises you so much.

154
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,370
You are indeed intelligent and brave, truly a talent to be used.

155
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,470
Thank you for the compliments, Your Highness.

156
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:48,080
Now that someone is going to harm you, you are in the open, he is in the dark. It will be difficult to defend yourself.

157
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,470
Xiao Douzi, if you don't want to return to the Courtyard of Misfortune,

158
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,000
nor go to the Bureau of Imperial Attire, why don't you come to work at the East Palace?

159
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,840
Under my protection, no one will dare to touch even a hair on you.

160
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,870
I probably will have to decline your kindness, Your Highness.

161
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,980
I caused trouble this time and dragged in my foster father and friend.

162
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,290
I worry about them, so I'll go back there to share fortune and misfortune, and get through the difficulty together.

163
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,310
You are indeed someone who regards compassion and friendship highly.

164
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,450
Xiao Douzi, rest assured.

165
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,040
I will definitely find out who put in the poison and safeguard you.

166
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,610
Thank you, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

167
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,050
Qiniang, did you see clearly?

168
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,960
I saw it very clearly. Physician Dou has been released.

169
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,670
He was standing right behind the crown prince.

170
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,300
The crown prince even said that he wanted to investigate who tried to poison Physican Dou.

171
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,840
Master, this incident isn't related to our Bureau of Imperial Attire, is it?

172
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,910
Of course, it's related!

173
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,260
The order from the Directorate of Eunuchs is already issued, so Xiao Douzi is already a member of our Bureau of Imperial Attire.

174
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,350
Of course, I have to pay extra attention.

175
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,360
Qiniang, we are out of silver threads.

176
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,660
Go to the Directorate of Eunuchs to get some more.

177
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,340
Yes.

178
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,360
Attire Expert Zhuo, please save me.

179
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,320
If the crown prince really investigates this matter, I will be dead.

180
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,860
My life isn't important. But if it drags in Attire Expert Zhuo and Eunuch Pan,

181
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,690
my guilt will be overwhelming.

182
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,560
Why panic?

183
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,520
Stay calm.

184
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,470
That was just the jail guard's version of what happened.

185
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,250
It's only one witness, so it's not enough.

186
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,740
But that guard died in front of the crown prince,

187
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,700
and the crown prince is determined to thoroughly investigate—

188
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,390
Why are you panicking?

189
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,160
If the sky falls, there are taller people to hold it up.

190
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,040
Xiao Douzi was arrested based on Eunuch Pan's order.

191
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,890
We will go to him to see what to do.

192
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,890
Eunuch Pan is the Deputy Director of the Directorate of Eunuchs.

193
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:02,030
He will definitely have a way to get through this.

You've suffered.

Foster Father!

211
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,040
Foster Father, I've come back safely.

212
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,560
It's good that you are back.

213
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,500
It's good that you have come back safely.

Foster Father is useless.

215
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,020
I let Xiao Douzi suffer a lot.

216
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,700
No, I'm the one that let Foster Father and Xiao Shunzi suffer so much.

217
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,130
I even let everyone worry for me.

218
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,360
All right now, let's go inside to talk.

219
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,640
Xiao Fuzi, go straighten up the room for Xiao Douzi.

220
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,220
I will prepare some good food and wine.

221
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,170
Today is an auspicious day at the Courtyard of Misfortune.

222
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,190
We will definitely celebrate tonight.

223
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,850
Good!

224
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,340
Mother, I have returned safely.

225
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,770
Please rest assured, Mother.

227
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,400
Xiao Douzi, come here.

228
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,770
Let Foster Father ask you something.

229
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,510
How did you come out?

230
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:59,180
The Directorate of Eunuchs created an uproar to capture you.

231
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,620
How did you so easily get released?

232
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,880
The crown prince saved me.

233
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,160
The crown prince?

234
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,650
When I left the palace, I met someone who is the crown prince's friend.

235
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,490
That person heard that I was arrested, so he asked the crown prince to save me.

236
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,110
The crown prince is kind and actually did it.

237
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,680
He said that I left the palace to do something for him, not to secretly run away.

238
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,570
That's how it happened.

239
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,280
Your mother must be blessing you from Heaven.

240
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,690
That's how you were able to meet a noble person to help you go through dangers.

241
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,950
It's good that you are safe.

242
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,080
Next time, let's think of a better way to send you out of the palace.

243
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,510
No, Foster Father. I've already decided,

244
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,700
I'm not leaving. I'm going to stay in the palace.

245
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,210
No, absolutely not! You must not stay in the palace.

246
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,340
Foster Father, tell me the truth.

247
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,380
Is the person who schemed to harm Mother long ago still here in the palace?

248
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,950
Is that person Zhuo Jinniang?

249
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,920
No.

250
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,940
Foster Father, how long will you keep hiding it from me?

251
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,040
While I was in jail these past few days,

252
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,880
I saw a lot, and also thought a lot.

253
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,130
Back then, even though I was young, I still remember a few things.

254
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,390
At first, it was a palace maid, from the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

255
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,900
who brought the pheasant robe to beg Mother for help.

256
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,260
After that, Mother was convicted with the high crime of conspiracy for overstepping a boundary to make the empress' pheasant robe

257
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,720
and was sent to the palace jail. I remember that pheasant robe.

258
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,770
The pheasant bird embroidered on the robe had eyes that

259
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,090
were embroidered in the same technique as the eyes of the pigeons embroidered by Zhuo Jinniang.

260
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,260
This is the first proof.

261
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,390
Secondly, back then, Mother died in order to save me.

262
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,380
She entrusted me to Foster Father.

263
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,140
Mother was more intelligent than most people.

264
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,950
She naturally would have known that I would have to disguise as a male to stay in the Courtyard of Misfortune.

265
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,160
But Mother would rather take this risk

266
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,300
instead of entrusting me to her only disciple, Zhuo Jinniang.

267
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,820
Thirdly, when Zhuo Jinniang mentioned Mother to me,

268
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,960
she didn't show any feelings for her teacher,

269
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,690
but only harbored greed and resentment in her heart.

270
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:30,010
If I am guessing it right, Zhuo Jinniang is the one from years ago,

271
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,150
the palace maid who came to ask my mother to fix the pheasant robe

272
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,440
and frame my mother afterward.

273
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,170
Foster Father, you would not let me reveal my identity to Zhuo Jinniang.

274
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,360
It's not to avoid dragging in Zhuo Jinniang,

275
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,620
but to protect me.

276
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:49,030
Foster Father, am I right?

277
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,750
Master, just tell her!

278
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,410
I can't stand this anymore.

279
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:04,010
That Zhuo Jinniang is clearly a vicious evil person.

280
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,520
It's not enough that she harmed her master to death,

281
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,780
in order to seize the golden needle and the book on dressmaking secrets,

282
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,580
whe would even come to the Courtyard of Misfortune to burn the corpses.

283
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,480
That day, if it weren't for Talented Lady Wu entering the palace and people wanting a lucky day,

284
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,330
Liuli would have been burned alive by her!

285
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21,540
Every time I saw you full of joy and wanting to treat Zhuo Jinniang as family,

286
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,660
I just got upset.

287
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,670
Foster Father, the person who harmed Mother to death

288
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,020
is really inside the palace. I'm not leaving the palace.

289
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,410
I want to stay here and avenge my mother.

290
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,380
Zhuo Jinniang didn't just harm my mother to death,

291
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:40,110
she also made Mother bear the crime of treason.

292
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,850
I swear, I will definitely vindicate Mother's conviction, and avenger her for this grievance.

293
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,250
You are just a little physician. What can you do to get revenge?

294
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,760
Foster Father, have you forgotten?

295
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,660
The Bureau of Imperial Attire already issued an order to transfer me to the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

296
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:58,060
Only if I can go to work at the Bureau of Imperial Attire will I be able to see Zhuo Jinniang.

297
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,810
I can then have the opportunity to find the proof that she framed Mother back then.

298
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,260
That's how I can vindicate Mother's wrongful death.

299
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,920
Child, have you gone crazy thinking of revenge?

300
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,100
I've thought it through.

301
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,710
I must do it this way.

302
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,130
Master! Master! Something bad happened!

303
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,570
Hurry and go see!

304
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,710
Master, you must help me.

305
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,780
I was going to the imperial kitchen to buy a chicken.

306
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:38,800
I came to get money but found that all the money I've saved these years is missing.

307
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,040
Where does Wei Lin put his stuff? Get it and see.

308
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,440
Master, is this proper?

309
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,090
It's because Wei Lin had dirty hands and feet, (he stole things)

310
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,580
that's why he was demoted to be in the Courtyard of Misfortune.

311
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,760
Obviously, if it's not him, it's fine.

312
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,350
But right now, he is the best suspect.

313
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,010
Go.

314
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,780
Look!

315
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,430
My money.

316
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,030
My jade pendant.

317
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,930
Xiao Douzi, when you left the palace, I put it inside your bundle.

318
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,610
Why is it here?

319
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,370
It's not just what you gave me,

320
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,980
but also what Foster Father and Mother gave me. They were all substituted.

321
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,440
I even thought the stuff was lost outside the palace.

322
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,940
So, even before I left the palace, things were already stolen by him.

323
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,820
Right, I remember now. Previously, Wei Lin

324
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,780
saw me hide money. He even asked me

325
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,310
what we all liked to eat in the Courtyard of Misfortune.

326
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,620
He especially asked what Xiao Douzi liked to eat.

327
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,750
Did you tell him then?

328
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,930
Yes, I said you liked to eat osmanthus cake the most.

329
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,030
So, it was Wei Lin that did it.

330
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:04,770
Wei Lin? What else did he do?

331
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,710
Someone went to the jail today and sent me some osmanthus cakes.

332
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:13,120
The jail guard sneaked a bite but died of poisoning.

333
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,000
In that case, that poisoned box of osmanthus cakes

334
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,720
must have been delivered by Wei Lin.

335
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,310
Why haven't you said anything about such a huge incident?

336
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,730
His Highness the Crown Prince has already promised to investigate it.

337
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,090
I didn't want to make you worry and be afraid for me.

338
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,440
Where is Wei Lin? Where did he go?

339
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,740
Master! Master! Something bad has happened!

340
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,160
Wei Lin has been sent back here.

341
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,980
Bring him to see me.

342
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,820
He is dead.

343
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,860
Wei Lin is dead?

344
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,010
What happened?

345
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,740
When we found him at the lake,

346
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,250
he had already drowned and didn't leave anything.

347
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,600
That's why we brought him to the Courtyard of Misfortune.

348
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,270
Thank you.

349
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,270
This kind of death

350
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,890
is still too easy for him.

351
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,550
Wei Lin must have been worried that Xiao Douzi

352
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,190
would discover his theft, so he came up with an evil idea

353
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,250
to kill Xiao Douzi to shut his mouth.

354
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,010
But the next one he would have killed would have been me?

355
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,780
What's the use to have more money and riches?

356
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,870
One isn't born with it, nor will one take it with after death.

357
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,140
Ultimately, he ended up with a bad death.

358
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,200
What for?

359
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,130
Xiao Shunzi, prepare a simple coffin for him

360
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,370
- and bury him as soon as possible.
- Yes.

361
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:03,390
Your Highness, Deputy Director Pan is here.

362
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,780
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

363
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:14,430
I didn't know that Physician Dou left the palace to run errands for Your Highness,

364
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,860
and also affected Your Highness's important business.

365
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,750
I, Pan Qinhai, am guilty. Please forgive me, Your Highness.

366
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,830
One who didn't know is not guilty.

367
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,320
But there is actually someone who could pass by the guards

368
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,390
to poison someone inside the palace jail.

369
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,010
Eunuch Pan, you are the Deputy Director of the Directorate of Eunuchs,

370
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,220
and the palace jail is under your supervision.

371
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,040
What is your explanation for this matter?

372
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,450
Replying to Your Highness. I have already thoroughly investigated this matter.

373
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,390
The person who did the poisoning is called Wei Lin.

374
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,190
He is a new eunuch at the Courtyard of Misfortune.

375
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,310
He is known to have unclean hands and feet. (T/N: he steals)

376
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:59,530
After he stole Physician Dou's money, he thought Physician Dou went missing

377
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,880
and there wouldn't be further investigation without evidence.

378
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,790
Unexpectedly, Physician Dou returned.

379
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,760
He feared that Physician Dou would confront him after he was released from jail,

380
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,970
so he delivered poisoned osmanthumus cakes

381
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,450
intending to poison Physician Dou to death to eliminate any evidence.

382
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,610
Now that he found out everything was exposed and he couldn't escape from conviction,

383
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,650
he has already committed suicide in fear.

384
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,930
He is dead?

385
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,620
He jumped into the lake and died.

386
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,150
Does Physician Dou know about it?

387
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,520
Wei Lin's corpse has been delivered to the Courtyard of Misfortune.

388
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,640
Physician Dou knows about this incident.

389
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,250
All the money stolen by Wei Lin has been found.

390
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,130
It's not just Physician Dou's money,

391
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,860
but all the lost money in the palace

392
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,890
had been found at Wei Lin's place.

393
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,900
Your Highness, for the palace jail to have such an incident,

394
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,810
I cannot escape from my guilt.

395
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,270
Please punish me, Your Highness.

396
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,100
The lax discipline is certainly your dereliction of duty.

397
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,080
I'll note your mistake for the time being.

398
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,260
You must doubly energize your attention to strengthen palace rules.

399
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,780
If there is another mishap,

400
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,570
there will definitely be a harsh punishment.

401
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,330
Yes.

402
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,020
You really can't tell someone's heart by looking at their face.

403
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,560
I heard that Wei Lin was well known for his thievery.

404
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,480
He'd stolen from everyone around him.

405
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,680
All the stolen money was hidden in his box.

406
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,350
He died without using any of it, really despicable and pitiful.

407
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,090
Can you quit talking?

408
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:36,950
Master, you told me to tell you.

409
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,700
I didn't expect that this Wei Lin

410
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,590
was this kind of person.

411
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,250
I almost got cheated by him, too.

412
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,800
Qiniang, from now on, do not tell anyone

413
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,760
that Wei Lin had dealings with the Bureau of Imperial Attire

414
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,340
to avoid gossip.

415
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,050
Yes.

416
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:30,560
Attire Expert Zhuo, what do I say when I see Eunuch Pan?

417
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,040
You'll know when we get there.

418
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,200
Oh no!

419
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,740
Hurry, my handkerchief dropped into the water.

420
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,440
Hurry and retrieve it for me.

421
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,060
Don't be impatient, Attire Expert Zhuo.

422
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,170
I will go retrieve it now.

423
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,320
Hurry!

424
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,960
Attire Expert Zhuo!

425
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,510
Attire Expert...

426
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,170
How did Wei Lin die?

427
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,250
Both you and I know it in our hearts.

428
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,170
Luckily, he has unclean hands and feet.

429
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,740
We can cover it up.

430
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,040
Physician Dou now has His Highness the Crown Prince's support.

431
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:38,260
I advise you to restrain your killing intention.

432
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,120
If you try to kill him again,

433
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,900
I'm afraid His Highness will track it down.

434
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,310
We won't be able to

435
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,840
luckily evade it.

436
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,170
I don't understand something.

437
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,200
The Courtyard of Misfortune has just sent a letter

438
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,370
that Physician Dou is willing to comply with the transfer order from last time

439
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:01,230
to go to work at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

440
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:05,040
I don't care what dirty stuff is between you two,

441
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,270
I advise you to behave.

442
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,840
Since I can't kill you,

443
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,120
then I'll keep you first.

444
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,740
Since you dare to come to the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

445
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:25,600
I will squeeze out the dressmaking techniques bit by bit.

446
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,450
You can't die under the crown prince's protection.

447
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,320
Then, I will let you

448
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,940
live a life that's worse than death.

449
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:47,080
A'Bi embroiders quite well, except

450
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,380
if you switch the green and pink colors

451
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,510
with blue and yellow, it will be better.

452
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,290
Attire Expert Zhuo, you didn't know this,

453
00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:00,630
but Talented Lady Wu has fair skin. The green and pink colors

454
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,930
will best present her qualities.

455
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:07,040
Previously, I also used these two colors to make a skirt for Talented Lady Wu.

456
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,760
Even His Majesty complimented how pretty she was.

457
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,900
Am I the attire expert or you are?

458
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,920
Retorting to me in such a strong manner, where are your manners?

459
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,330
A'Bi is wrong. A'Bi will not dare.

460
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:23,220
Qiniang, you tell me.

461
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:27,640
Why am I asking A'Bi to change the colors and embroider again?

462
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,460
While buying clothes for the imperial concubines,

463
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,390
Talented Lady Wu and Consort Yang chose the same color fabric.

464
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,600
Coincidentally, they also chose the same cloud pattern.

465
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,140
Green and jade go well together.

466
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:43,370
They highlight best Talented Lady Wu's complexion and elegance,

467
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:46,570
but in the harem, Consort Yang is most favored by the emperor.

468
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,880
Even though Talented Lady Wu chose the same clothing,

469
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,480
she can't snatch away her elegance.

470
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,270
Master making A'Bi changing colors and redo the embroidery

471
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,890
is for the good of Talented Lady Wu.

472
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:58,660
It's even better for our Bureau of Imperial Attire.

473
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,480
A'Bi,

474
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,730
do you understand?

475
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,400
I understand.

476
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,530
[Bureau of Imperial Attire]

477
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,860
Xiao Douzi from the Courtyard of Misfortune, temporarily transferred to the Directorate of Eunuchs by orders

478
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:40,010
came to the Bureau of Imperial Attire to report to Attire Expert Zhuo.

479
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,780
Good. It's good that you came.

480
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,590
The road to success is strewn with setbacks.

481
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:51,030
What a great thing that we were fated and finally met at the Bureau of Imperial Attire. Xiao Douzi,

482
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:54,680
although you're temporarily assigned from the Courtyard of Misfortune to the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

483
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,270
but as soon as you come through this door,

484
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,910
you must go along with the appointment of the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

485
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,180
Do you understand?

486
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,790
I understand.

487
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,410
As expected you're a clever and reasonable child.

488
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,110
At the Courtyard of Misfortune, you were a mere epidemic prevention physician.

489
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,500
Being in contact with dead people every day.

490
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,330
What future did you have?

491
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,750
You should rather seize that opportunity and perform well here at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

492
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,400
Perhaps you'll have a great future.

493
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:39,920
However, you must remember one thing.

494
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,520
The masters will reward good work.

495
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,810
After a while, there will be opportunities to be promoted.

496
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,860
But as soon as you commit one mistake,

497
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:54,650
it could be a light punishment or a heavy punishment that will cost your life.

498
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:59,660
Thank you for your guidance, Attire Expert Zhuo. Xiao Douzi will bear it in mind.

499
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:06,190
In the past, only palace maids worked in the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

500
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:11,120
And today, Xiao Douzi broke the precedent of the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

501
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,400
You must all take it amiss.

502
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,410
Thinking, what ability does he have?

503
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,950
Making him transfer from the Courtyard of Misfortune to the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

504
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:22,340
being on equal footing with all you skilled seamstresses.

505
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,090
Isn't that so?

506
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,570
Who prepared this place?

507
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,340
I did.

508
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,850
The order of sitting is based on skills.

509
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,390
This is the rule of the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

510
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,250
That's right.

511
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,450
A new person enters the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

512
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,930
there's no exception. They must all start at the back.

513
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:53,770
Without a year or two of strenuous effort to perfect their skills, there's no way they will sit in the front.

514
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:57,140
But if Xiao Douzi really was only at the back level,

515
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:01,100
would I need to muster large forces to break the rules for him?

516
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,420
How about this? Today, I'll make Xiao Douzi

517
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,590
compete with you all.

518
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,740
Letting you know his capabilities.

519
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:16,930
Who has the confidence to compete against Xiao Douzi?

520
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:20,040
Attire Expert Zhuo, I'm willing to compete.

521
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:24,370
Xiao Douzi just arrived at the Bureau of Imperial Attire, I should sit in the back.

522
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,400
How would I dare to compete against my eldest sisters?

523
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,910
You don't need to evade.

524
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:32,230
Just care about showing them your ability.

525
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,880
The Bureau of Imperial Attire is a place where one relies on one's capacity to earn one's living.

526
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,410
Craftsmanship is everything. If it's good, then one receives praise and respect.

527
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,820
If you win the competition today,

528
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:46,460
I'll let you make clothes for a master that gives respect.

529
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:50,270
I also will give you the opportunity to learn from me.

530
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,050
If you lose the competition,

531
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,410
then you'll go back to the Courtyard of Misfortune

532
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:59,660
and continue to work amongst the dead.

533
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:07,290
Even though I still don't know how to take revenge,

534
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:11,040
but only by staying at the Bureau of Imperial Attire and getting close to Zhuo Jinniang

535
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,990
can I wait for the opportunity to get into action. I must win this competition.

536
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:22,470
This stem of a Chinese rose is fair and graceful, delicate and plump.

537
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,830
How about having the queen of flowers as a topic?

538
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,740
Embroidering a pillow cloth for the concubines.

539
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,300
It is already 11:00 a.m.

540
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,480
Do you have the confidence that you can finish the embroidery before sunset?

541
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,890
Even though the time is short, I'll do my best.

542
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,790
I can also finish it before sunset.

543
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:49,040
Good. Then get ready to start.

544
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,530
There's already not enough time, yet he's still in a daze.

545
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,470
Is it stage fright?

546
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,620
Master said, first decide on a plan and then act.

547
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:13,590
He must be thinking about how to embroider in the best way.

548
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:17,000
It's only a few flowers. What is there to think?

549
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,160
- It will be Buddha's blessing if the embroidery can be completed before sunset.
- That's right.

550
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,140
All right. All go back to work.

551
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,830
Once they are done, I will bring it to everyone to compare and judge.

552
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,680
Yes!

553
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,630
What is he doing?

554
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,710
Yes, why hasn't he started yet?

555
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:53,140
- Yes.
- Exactly.

556
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,570
A'Bi already started embroidering.

557
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:09,380
Then, what about Physician Dou?

558
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,760
He's still in a daze.

559
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,930
Qiniang, don't worry. He's going to lose for sure.

560
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,990
What am I worried about?

561
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,820
Don't be ashamed to admit it.

562
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,790
You all want A'Bi to win.

563
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:28,590
We were able to get into the Bureau of Imperial Attire. Who went through training with a famous master

564
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:32,030
for many years and succeeded in every stage of the selection?

565
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,760
This Physician Dou comes from the Courtyard of Misfortune.

566
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,290
If he wins, we seamstresses of the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

567
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:40,240
how would we still have the courage to meet people?

568
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:11,900
What is he doing?

569
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,090
Exactly. Why hasn't he started yet?

570
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,660
Yes, what does he want to do?

571
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:31,530
Physician Dou started to use his pen.

572
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:34,520
- Come up, come up!
- Let's go have a look.

573
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,250
I'm really looking forward to it.

574
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,040
Come! Come!

575
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,270
Xiao Douzi's design has nothing special

576
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,550
Exactly.

577
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,030
How can he start drawing just now?

578
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:57,920
- Exactly.
- There's nothing special about this.
