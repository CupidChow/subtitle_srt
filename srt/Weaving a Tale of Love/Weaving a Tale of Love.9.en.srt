[Weaving A Tale Of Love]

3
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,030
[Episode 9]

4
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,570
Take a look!

5
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,530
Come and take a look!

6
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,760
Talk a look!

7
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,940
Come! Come!

8
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,490
Come!

9
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,870
Come take a look!

10
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,850
Take a look.

11
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,150
Liuli, you are too bold.

12
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,680
Your auntie is the high-ranked concubine in the Pei manor, but you dare to go there to make clothes.

13
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,130
Are you not afraid of being recognized by your aunt and expose your identity?

14
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,990
I'm also blaming A'Ni. You're usually reliable.

15
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,380
Now you're not so trustworthy.

16
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,750
Uncle, Auntie was still a daughter at home eleven years ago.

17
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,930
I didn't know that Auntie eventually married into the Commandant Manor

18
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,980
and wanted to promote Shanhu.

19
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,680
It was my oversight, not A'Ni's fault.

20
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,820
No, no!  It's all my fault.

21
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,160
It concerns Liuli's safety, so it's really my oversight.

22
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,800
Even now, I'm familiar with Pei Manor's Eighth Miss and Miss Yu,

23
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,680
but I didn't know that Madam Kudi was Liuli's auntie

24
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,560
and almost made a huge mistake. I'll be more cautious from now on.

25
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,640
Uncle, fortunately, Heaven is helping us.

26
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,500
The day that I went to the Pei Manor, Auntie wasn't at home.

27
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,390
So it was scary but we didn't get into danger.

28
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,690
Don't relax. You're just been back for a few days,

29
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,090
and you've already encountered such big trouble,

30
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,290
and even got found out as Kudi Yanzhong's daughter.

31
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,300
Fortunately, they have mistaken you to be Shanhu.

32
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,670
No one discovered that you were your mother's daughter.

33
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,810
Even though you avoided this one calamity,

34
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,460
but I am very fearful.

35
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,750
Liuli, from now on, you need to stay at the old house.

36
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,220
Don't come to Ruyi Resist Dye Shop anymore.

37
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,050
Uncle, aren't you concerned that I'll be bored to death?

38
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,020
If you are bored, just quietly help A'Ni at the old house.

39
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,830
A'Ni can also learn some skills from you.

40
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,670
A'Ni, from now on, if anyone comes to find Liuli because of her popularity,

41
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,970
just say that she has resigned and left without knowing her whereabouts.

42
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,880
I understand.

43
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,240
I will go pack your drawing utensils.

44
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,020
You go back first. I'll send someone with these things later.

45
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,380
I guarantee that you won't be delayed in drawing the Hunting Scene for Master Pei.

46
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,060
Stop with the pathetic look.

47
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,380
The marriage is gone.

48
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,580
You should bring up double the energy to help Caoji.

49
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,640
If Caoji wins at the Hu Merchants Conference,

50
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,100
then it will naturally be the leader in this business.

51
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,690
We'll soon get both fame and fortune.

52
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,660
At that time, matchmakers will naturally rush to come.

53
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,950
I will definitely find a good marriage for you.

54
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,560
Mother is doing business under Madam An's fame.

55
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,290
How can you win with her skills in the competition?

56
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,160
Now, A'Ni has that

57
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,230
tramp to help her.

58
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,060
It's like a tiger with wings.

59
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,600
That Qiniang at the Bureau of Imperial Attire in the palace, do you still remember her?

60
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,960
Auntie, are you talking about my older cousin from a distant relative's family?

61
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,500
That's right.

62
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,330
I've already asked someone to get from Qiniang the design styles in the palace.

63
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,340
The clothes are already made.

64
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,890
Those Hu people will definitely like them.

65
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,230
Mother is the smartest.

66
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,060
Who locked this door?

67
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,140
It hurts, it hurts.

68
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,950
Auntie, if you hurt me too much,

69
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,780
this will be the end of the line for the Cao family.

70
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,190
This is so painful.

71
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,340
Cao Wu, what are you holding in your arms?

72
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,730
Don't think that I don't know!

73
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,200
Do you want to steal Caoji's dress for the competition

74
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,890
to appease that A'Ni?

75
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,550
I—

76
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,180
I'm so upset.

77
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,320
How did my brother get such an unfilial son like you? Your elbow turns outward.  (Helping an outsider)

78
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,290
You are helping our enemy to oppose Caoji.

79
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,650
What soul seduction soup did that A'Ni feed you

80
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,020
that you would steal from your own to help an outsider?

81
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,240
Auntie, A'Ni is good.

82
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,150
Smart, capable, kind, and her boss relies on her.

83
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,570
If I can marry her,

84
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,230
it's like taking an asset away from Ruyi Resist Dye Shop.

85
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,450
How is getting their capable shopkeeper to come considered stealing from the inside to help the outsiders?

86
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,980
Stinky rascal!

87
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,040
What you said actually makes some sense.

88
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,170
That A'Ni, it's all right if she really wants to elevate into our Cao family.

89
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,960
She will have to show some sincerity then.

90
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,690
Auntie, where are you going?

91
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,940
To propose marriage for you.

92
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,560
This matter must be settled

93
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,270
before the Hu Merchants Conference starts.

94
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,590
Auntie, let me out of here!

95
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,330
Auntie!

96
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,470
A'Ni, I'm going out for a meeting. I'll get someone to come over to substitute for you.

97
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,760
You can go back to the old house and stay with Liuli so that she won't get bored.

98
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,310
Yes.

99
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,900
Over here.

100
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,160
This looks nice!

101
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,460
Our Cao Wu has a good eye. You are a good girl.

102
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,610
Madam Cao, what are you doing here again?

103
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,260
It's best that you speak directly.

104
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,840
Then I'll be straightforward.

105
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,210
I heard that you are a slave that An Silang bought?

106
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,560
So what if I am?

107
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,510
The An family is pretty good to you.

108
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,650
They even let you be the shopkeeper.

109
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,200
But have you ever thought, since you are not a man,

110
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,130
ultimately you'll need to have a good marriage

111
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,360
and depend on your husband to live?

112
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,350
My husband?

113
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,720
My thinking, it's pretty good for a woman to be self-sufficient and self-reliable.

114
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,630
No matter how clever and capable you are, you are still just a servant for the An family.

115
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,120
I won't beat around the bush.

116
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,210
You should have never been a good enough match for my nephew,

117
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:06,340
but who knew that our Cao Wu was sincere

118
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,290
and he really likes you.

119
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,770
It's fine. As long as you can secretly

120
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,620
obtain Madam An's skills

121
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,180
as your dowry, I will redeem you from the An family

122
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,550
and fulfill you and Cao Wu's marriage.

123
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,410
How about it?

124
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,640
- What are you doing?
- Come with me to the authorities.

125
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,260
What illegal act have I committed?

126
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,750
Using a marriage proposal as a lure to incite another family's maid to steal the master's dressmaking skill.

127
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,260
You can't deny this is fraudulent and swindling wrongdoing.

128
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,380
Go with me to the authorities. They can decide if you have committed a crime.

129
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,790
- Go!
- What an ungrateful lowly servant!

130
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,750
Who cares if you want to marry or not!

131
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,240
[Hall of Immortal Dew]

132
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,510
Your Majesty must have rested well yesterday.

133
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,540
You look much better than previous days.

134
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,430
You've suffered these days, Meiniang, and stayed by my side for a whole night.

135
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,530
Your eyes are red and you look withered.

136
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,540
Hurry on back to get some rest.

137
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,230
As long as Your Majesty can recover soon,

138
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,870
even if my eyes get red like a rabbit or if I become an old woman,

139
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,480
I would still be happy and not feel the difficulty.

140
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,850
Meiniang may be willing, but I can't bear it.

141
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,610
Reporting to Your Majesty.

142
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,250
Consort Yang, Prince of Cao, other consorts and concubines, and princes

143
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,600
are coming to greet Your Majesty.

144
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,580
- This consort greets Your Majesty.
- This son and subordinate greets Your Majesty.

145
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,100
Greetings, Your Majesty.

146
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,340
Please rise.

147
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

148
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,250
Your Majesty, are you feeling better today?

149
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,870
It's all thanks to Ming'Er, who sent me medicine. I feel much better after eating it.

150
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,830
You can all leave.

151
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,400
Just let Ming'er and his mother stay and talk with me.

152
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,420
Yes.

153
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,560
Yes.

154
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,820
His Highness the Crown Prince still hasn't come to greet His Majesty. How many days has it been?

155
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,850
Seems like the rumors aren't false.

156
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,830
The crown prince has displeased His Majesty recently.

157
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,110
So he gets worse since there's nothing to lose.

158
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,610
Now he is drinking at home every day,

159
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,970
using wine to vent his frustrations.

160
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,610
Talented Lady Wu.

161
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,010
Hey.

162
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,700
Ming'er, I heard that you've been having a crowd of guests at your manor.

163
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,920
It's even more lively than the crown prince's East Palace.

164
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,830
Your Majesty.

165
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,690
Imperial Father is wise.

166
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,980
This son and subordinate does not dare to make alliances for personal objectives.

167
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,310
It's only because the crown prince proposed to reform the imperial examination system.

168
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,970
Many noble families, renowned clans, and established eunuch families are feeling panicked.

169
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,130
They are concerned that their ancestral blessing won't be able to cover the descendants.

170
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,300
Regarding Crown Prince's proposal to reform the imperial examination system, what do you think?

171
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,070
His Highness the Crown Prince certainly has good intentions to reform the imperial examination system.

172
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,480
But...

173
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,930
Say it. You're beating around the bush even in my presence?

174
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,530
This son and subordinate thinks the person who governs the nation and keeps the world in peace

175
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,570
must have even bigger plans.

176
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,990
Those noble families are important court officials

177
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,530
who had contributed greatly to Great Tang and the Li family.

178
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,320
Crown Prince doesn't want to disappoint the civilian scholars,

179
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,800
but he doesn't know that if he disappoints those noble families,

180
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,690
he would push Great Tang into danger.

181
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,860
Since you have such thoughts, have you ever brought them up to the crown prince?

182
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,540
Crown Prince hasn't been in a good mood lately,

183
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,880
and he is getting more addicted to drinking.

184
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,130
He hasn’t even taken one step out of the house.

185
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,890
So I haven't found the opportunity

186
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,120
to have a conversation with the crown prince.

187
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,890
- A'Quan.
- Present.

188
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,440
Call for the crown prince.

189
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,780
Eunuch Gao, wait outside for a moment.

190
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,570
I will go and wish His Majesty peace in a moment.

191
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,890
These few days, Crown Prince has barely shown his face.

192
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,090
Within the palace, there are many rumors floating around about Your Highness.

193
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,210
Added to that, His Majesty has been irritable after a prolonged illness,

194
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,670
and he easily listens to these rumors.

195
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,970
I hope Crown Prince doesn’t do anything rashly.

196
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,810
Eunuch Gao, thank you for your kind thoughts.

197
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,320
Your Highness the Crown Prince is compassionate.

198
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,250
I, Gao Quan, was bestowed Empress Wende's benevolence.

199
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,220
He is supporting Crown Prince in his heart.

200
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:58,220
Your Highness, I will go in the back and wait.

201
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,690
Talented Lady Wu really is magical.

202
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,630
She just said that His Majesty will call for Crown Prince, and then he comes almost immediately

203
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,270
From what I think he just said,

204
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,510
this time His Majesty wishes to see me,

205
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,860
because he is swayed by rumors.

206
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,340
Man can try, but Heaven decides.

207
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,050
Your Highness, you only need to do what you should do.

208
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,580
His Majesty is observant and will definitely see the difference.

209
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,810
Then Your Highness should go quickly. Don’t let His Majesty wait for too long.

210
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,420
Yu Liu.

211
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,460
Your Highness, please use this before you go to the Hall of Immortal Dew.

212
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,150
What is this?

213
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,690
Your Highness, you mustn't use this!

214
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,690
Reporting to Your Majesty, Crown Prince has arrived.

215
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,770
I greet Royal Father and Consort Yang.

216
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,620
I hear that Imperial Father's body has recovered.

217
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,440
I am very happy.

218
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,590
May Imperial Father continue to be healthy

219
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,710
with longevity and fortune.

220
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,890
What have you been busy with lately?

221
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,820
Why do you look so weak?

222
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,810
These few days, I have been reflecting at home these few days. Even though I am a little skinnier,

223
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:52,510
but after cultivating the mind, my spirit is stronger than before.

224
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,480
Imperial Father, you need not be worried for me.

225
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,630
Zhi'er, have you been drinking alcohol lately?

226
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,690
After last time, I haven't sipped even one drop of wine.

227
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,080
It's good if that is so. Rise.

228
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,780
Thank you, Your Majesty.

229
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,300
Just then, all the princes came to wish for peace for Imperial Father. When Crown Prince wasn’t here,

230
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,400
His Majesty was missing you lots.

231
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,540
I have wanted to come and see Imperial father for a long time,

232
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,610
but I was afraid I would anger Your Majesty since I thought he was still angry at me.

233
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,500
I didn’t think that I made Your Majesty worried.

234
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,590
I was unfilial.

235
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,420
Your Majesty, calm down. It is all my fault. Please punish me.

236
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,270
Crown Prince wasn’t purposefully doing this.

237
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,900
Your Majesty's body has only just gotten better,

238
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,150
you cannot be angry.

239
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,600
Your Majesty, I’m afraid it was just Crown Prince acting a bit too full of himself.

240
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,330
Eunuch Gao, why does this medicinal soup smell different today.

241
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,340
It is like there is another medicine in there.

242
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,930
This medicine had nothing different from usual.

243
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,400
This is obviously the taste of wine! You still dare to disagree!

244
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,270
Ming'er, don't wrong A'Quan.

245
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,460
The wine smell obviously comes from the body of Crown Prince!

246
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,540
No wonder you look so frail.

247
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,840
You even dare to say that you were self-reflecting

248
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,270
cultivating your mind, and haven't touched any wine!

249
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,540
I think you were dancing happily at night and getting drunk!

250
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,250
This wine has gotten so deep into your bones that you can’t even hold a bowl of medicine properly.

251
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,780
How do you still look like a Great Tang's Crown Prince?

252
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,660
How can you let me entrust Great Tang's future to you?

253
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,600
Your Majesty is scolding me for my sake.

254
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,150
I do not dare to go against you. But if I do not explain myself,

255
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,290
then I am afraid I would make Your Majesty ill again from anger.

256
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,540
My hand was trembling because

257
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,440
I have been copying scriptures every day.

258
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,950
- Copying scriptures?
- I have been praying for Your Majesty's blessing,

259
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,340
and pledged to Buddha a promise to copy 100 times the Diamond Sutra and the Earth Store Bodhisattva Sutra.

260
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,410
I have not left the house at all,

261
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,270
I totally focused on copying the scriptures

262
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,020
so much that my hand is overused and its tendons are hurt,

263
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,290
which caused my right hand

264
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:22,340
to be unable to control itself and waver intensely. It is me who is useless.

265
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,420
If you were concentrating on copying the scriptures, why did you smell of alcoholic on your body?

266
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,730
My hand trembles and cannot grasp the brush.

267
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,200
A'Sheng couldn't dissuade me,

268
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,560
so he found medicine wine to rub my hand.

269
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,930
I did not know that Your Majesty would ask me to come over,

270
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,060
so I rubbed the medicine wine on my arm.

271
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,450
Call for the imperial physician!

272
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,510
I obey your order.

273
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,350
Eunuch Pan, please don't leave!

274
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,540
[Hall of Immortal Dew]

275
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,250
Your Highness, what are your orders?

276
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,150
There are numerous imperial physicians.

277
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:26,830
But I only trust Physician Zong's medical skills and moral qualities.

278
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,160
Your Highness, rest assured. I will for surely look for Physician Zong.

279
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,590
Eunuch Pan, you should do it properly.

280
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,410
I will make sure I never mistreat you.

281
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:41,420
Thank you for your support, Your Highness.

282
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,120
Yu Liu, ask for Physician Zong now.

283
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,970
Say that I am bloated and I have problems with regurgitation.

284
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,430
I heard that Physician Zong's specialty is digestive organs. He's a professional. I particularly want him to come and take a look.

285
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,260
Physician Zong and Consort Yang are related.

286
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,370
He usually fawns on Prince Cao and Consort Yang, at the cost of his own life.

287
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:04,720
Besides His Majesty, he only conducts medical examinations for Prince Cao and his mother.

288
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,170
Talented Lady, why do you insist on bringing him here?

289
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,920
I am afraid I won't be able to convince him to accept the invitation.

290
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,530
It must be Physician Zong, and besides that, you have to be quick!

291
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,030
You should say... that His Majesty said his medical skills were exquisite

292
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,400
and he recommended him to me. You should say it like this. This way he won't dare not come.

293
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,020
Yes. I will do exactly so.

294
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:33,730
Crown Prince, I can only help you out up to this point.

295
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:37,910
The rest... is in the hands of your Creator.

296
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,590
- Where is Physician Zong?
- Talented Lady Wu has just developed a foul sickness.

297
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,740
She asked for him in the Hall of Sunset Pool.

298
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,010
Your Majesty, the reason the Crown Prince's right arm is trembling

299
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,880
is because he has been using his hands way too much and hurt his tendons.

300
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,190
I don't know what the reason is that His Highness overworked himself.

301
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,600
I promise I will prescribe some proper medicine for him.

302
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,960
The Crown Prince is very filial. He always prays and asks for my well-being.

303
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,940
He even spends the night transcribing fragments of the Confucian classics.

304
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,030
Therefore, he overworked himself doing all of these.

305
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:26,310
Imperial Physician Jiang, is Crown Prince's arm severely injured?

306
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:29,090
Your Majesty, filial piety is the highest virtue.

307
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,250
Crown Prince's filial piety toward Your Majesty

308
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,590
is really touching and exemplary to all the people.

309
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,160
Your Majesty, please don't worry. Even though Crown Prince's arm is hurt,

310
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,450
but with good rest and nurturing,

311
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,690
it will quickly recover.

312
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,810
Go ahead and write the prescription.

313
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,760
- Take good care of Crown Prince.
- Your edict is obeyed.

314
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,790
Zhi'er, come here.

315
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:21,200
Zhi'er, I wronged you today.

316
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,600
They say, "The stronger the love, the harsher the scolding."

317
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,630
Imperial Father disciplined me for my sake.

318
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,690
It's good that you understand how I feel.

319
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:40,790
Zhi'er, it's good that you pray for my blessing and copy the scriptures,

320
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:45,610
but you should have told us sooner to avoid misunderstandings by the ministers.

321
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,970
To pray for Your Majesty's blessing is based on my filial piety as your son and subordinate.

322
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,990
Since it's filial piety, I don't need to publicize it and make Your Majesty worry.

323
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,200
Whether Your Majesty knows,

324
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,460
whether all the people know,

325
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,680
as long as it helps Your Majesty,

326
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,950
this son and subordinate will enjoy it no matter how tiring it is.

327
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,600
Crown Prince pledged such an oath to copy 100 times of the scriptures.

328
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,370
This filial piety is truly touching.

329
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:18,170
Did His Highness the Crown Prince really finish copying the scriptures 100 times during two days?

330
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,880
Not yet.

331
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,460
Through today, I've only completed copying 88 times.

332
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,430
88 times?

333
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,900
I wonder if this younger brother will be lucky enough

334
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,980
to view the graceful bearing of the scriptures?

335
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:42,220
This servant has already asked people to bring over the crown prince's copied scriptures.

336
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,570
Your Majesty, please view.

337
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:49,190
Consort Yang. Prince of Cao. Please view.

338
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,170
Submit them immediately.

339
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,590
Your edict is obeyed!

340
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,610
Announcing His Majesty's decree!

341
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,640
"Crown Prince Li Zhi, in praying for his father's blessing,

342
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,330
copying scriptures 100 times as to forgetting meals and sleep,

343
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,560
and hurting his right arm.

344
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,770
The sincerity of his filial piety is touching.

345
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:02,310
Crown Prince is humble with his merits, persistent despite setbacks,

346
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,850
has the demeanor of a wise person.

347
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:08,440
I am very gratified.

348
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,540
Today, I announce Crown Prince's gesture of filial piety to the public

349
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,680
so that he is the role model for all the princes

350
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,990
and sets the example for all the people."

351
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,580
As stated.

352
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,610
We will abide by the decree

353
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:29,020
to follow Crown Prince as the role model.

354
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,120
A'Ni, please let me explain.

355
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,590
A'Ni, slow down a little! A'Ni!

356
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,160
A'Ni, wait for me!

357
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,440
A'Ni, let me explain!

358
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,000
A'Ni! Open up the door!

359
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,590
A'Ni, I, Cao Wu swear that I only like you and no other.

360
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:00,180
- I have never coveted secrets from some Attire Expert An...
- What's wrong?

361
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,150
- Look at him.
- ...so that you can use the secrets as dowry.

362
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,820
That's my aunt's ideal, and it has nothing to do with me.

363
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,680
A'Ni!

364
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,610
A'Ni! You have to believe me!

365
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,540
- I'm telling the truth.
- Don't.

366
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,180
If my auntie didn't discover today,

367
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,070
I would have carried the Caoji sample dress to you to confess my heart.

368
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:20,030
I know that you really want to win at the Hu Merchants Conference.

369
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,880
To make you happy, I'm willing to let Caoji lose to you.

370
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,390
- A'Ni! A'Ni!
- No wonder Ruyi Resist Dye is good.

371
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:31,470
It's all thanks to Cao Wu then.

372
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,490
It turns out it was all your great contribution, Cao Wu.

373
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,990
Quit talking nonsense here.

374
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,540
I want to rely on my own skills to take the orders from the Hu merchants.

375
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,270
Those sneaky ways of yours

376
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,940
are not up to my standard.

377
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,820
And I also have to tell you that I have never liked you!

378
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,660
If you continue causing trouble like this, we won't even stay friends in the future!

379
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,250
- A'Ni!
- Girls are shy.

380
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:01,490
Of course, she'll talk like this in front of people.

381
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,920
You should go back. After she has vented, you can come to apologize.

382
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,530
Let's go then.

383
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,420
- Go.
- I've seen it many times.

384
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,890
A'Ni, Cao Wu is in fact the one you have on your mind!

385
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,010
Not at all!

386
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:41,730
Then this is one-sided love and you are not interested in him!

387
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,900
How could I be interested in him?

388
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,490
Didn't you hear the nonsense he was spilling in front of my door? How exasperating!

389
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,920
If anyone who didn't know the situation had overheard him, what would people think of me?

390
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,540
Most likely he was doing that on purpose!

391
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:59,280
He probably knows that I am most concerned about the reputation of Ruyi Resist Dye's Shop.

392
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,620
That's why he is helping his auntie to come and make a ruckus.

393
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,260
Concerned about reputation?

394
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,180
That's right. Why haven't I thought of this?

395
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,980
What?

396
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,640
I've thought of a way to deal with Pei Xingjian.

397
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,200
You are a business person and you particularly care about reputation.

398
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,340
Pei Xingjian is a student at the respected Simen College, and he is paid by the government.

399
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:26,560
When I tell people that he secretly took someone else's property, his career will be over.

400
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,730
At that time, he will shout and cry to give me back my mother's things.

401
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,780
You are right.

402
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,820
- How will you do it then?
- Since I know his weakness now,

403
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,920
of course, I have to strike it hard, and not be softhearted.

404
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,700
Liuli, you will for sure win with this surprise move!

405
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,800
Previously, I already felt that this silk dress was missing something.

406
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,400
But I couldn't figure out where this problem was coming from.

407
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,200
Now that you've added this layer of silk gauze to the skirt,

408
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,200
not only does the original sense of opulent elegance still fully remain,

409
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,200
it even adds the beauty of nuanced inner spirit.

410
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,800
It is so ingenious!

411
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,200
With this sample dress, I am even more confident in tomorrow's competition.

412
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,800
A'Ni, it's your craft that made this dress beautiful.

413
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,200
I am only adding flowers to the splendor.  (Adding to what is already beautiful)

414
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,400
This silk dress is beautiful for its glamorous elegance.

415
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,000
It's too bad that the beauty is so direct that it seemed a bit flaunting.

416
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,500
That's why I just covered it with a light layer of silk gauze to making it even better.

What are you doing?

419
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,200
This letter of accusation is written in a sad manner.

420
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,600
Of course, it needs to have some tears to suit it.

[Proposal to reform the imperial examination system]

428
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,400
Previously, I was quite hesitant about reforming the imperial examination system.

429
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,300
Now that I've read Crown Prince's memorandum,

430
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,000
I finally realized that emphasizing Imperial Scholars over Classics Comprehension

431
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,400
makes a lot of sense.

432
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,400
It can impact long-term planning for Great Tang.

433
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,000
Crown Prince is intelligent and knowledgeable.

434
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
He is really worthy to be the first-born son between the late empress and me.

Why are you helping Crown Prince?

440
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Crown Prince has a kind nature and he speaks sincerely.

441
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,400
He has a grand aspiration but also cares about the people.

442
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,500
When I see him, he reminds me of myself when I first entered the palace

443
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,700
and didn't know how high the sky was or how deep the earth was. (Didn't know her limits to what she could do)

444
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,200
It's just that Crown Prince doesn't know it yet.

445
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Sometimes, to reach one's ideal,

446
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,400
it isn't enough to have aspirations.

Brother Pan, haven't you heard?

462
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,800
His Highness the Crown Prince argued with reason

463

in his memorandum, to state the pros and cons of the imperial examination system

464

Of course, I've heard about such a big event.

Besides, this is just one of the benefits.

480
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,060

This is a fortune for Great Tang and a blessing for the people.

484
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,800
so he came wanting to be our Director of Studies.

485
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,600
He fawns and follows the Director of Studies every day.

I will give the bedding back to him then, right?

511
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,600
No... you...

512
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,800
Stinky Wei Lin, what are you doing?

513
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,000
- Give it.
- Give it to me.

514
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,400
- Don't take Xiao Shunzi's stuff!
- What...

515
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,600
- GIve it back!
- Give it to me!

516
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,800
Xiao Fuzi! Xizo Fuzi!

517
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,200
Forget it! Forget it.

518
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,600
Anyway, Xiao Shunzi will be back soon.

519
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,800
He can just move it back at that time.

520
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,000
Go, go. I was looking for you to do something.

521
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,200
About that scholar's opinion, I think...

522
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,800
I didn't totally understand what that scholar said.

523
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
Assistant Professor Xue.

524
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,600
Tell me more about it.

525
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,000
Xue Xu greets the Director of Studies.

526
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,900
Assistant Professor Xue, do you need anything?

527
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,000
Director of Studies, may we speak privately?

528
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Director of Studies, the goods have arrived.

529
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,300
I heard from the higher-ups that they want Simen College to officially accept it.

530
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,600
I didn't know that your ears were so long. (Sharp hearing)

531
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,000
I, Xue Xu, have just entered Prince of Cao's service.

532
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I know that I am lacking in experience, so I would like to volunteer myself.

533
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,200
I hope the Director of Studies will give me a chance to show my abilities.

534
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,400
This batch of goods is very important.

535
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,200
You must do this job very carefully.

536
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,600
Thank you, Director of Studies, for your support.

537
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,000
I will definitely be careful and not make any mistakes.

♫  Borrow from the relentless of the night  ♫

547
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:15,800
♫  To exchange for the certainty of a promise  ♫

548
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,400
♫  There are too many bumpy roads along the way  ♫
