00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,170
[Episode 13]

4
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,520
Reporting to Eunuch Pan. Just now the guards at the palace gate brought Physician Dou back.

5
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,550
They said that he tore down the arrest order and kept saying he wanted to see you.

6
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,370
- He said he wanted to tell you something important.
- Let him come in.

7
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,970
Yes.

8
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,820
Why have you returned?

9
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,960
First, you disappeared into thin air; now, you have come back on your own.

10
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,560
What do you both want?

11
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,710
I really can't seem to understand.

12
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,230
Physician Dou, don't you have something to tell me?

13
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,910
I'll give you this opportunity and let you speak.

14
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,670
Let's hear your explanation.

15
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,900
Deputy Director Pan, I'm just a little sanitation medical officer at the Courtyard of Misfortune. My wage is meager.

16
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,160
That's why I secretly brought into the palace some small and unusual items to sell.

17
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,270
After that... After that, I was discovered.

18
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,430
Eunuch Sun harshly scolded me.

19
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,070
He even wanted to kick me out of the palace.

20
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,380
Xiao Shunzi also got captured because of this matter.

21
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,950
I was afraid so I ran away from the palace.

22
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,420
Later, I saw the bulletin notice to arrest me.

23
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,220
That's when we knew the situation had got out of hand.

24
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,080
Xiao Shunzi gathered customers for me. I am actually the main culprit.

25
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,560
Eunuch Sun certainly didn't know anything about it.

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,690
I made the mistake myself. I didn't want to continue making mistakes and let someone else take the blame.

27
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,560
So I came back to the palace to take responsibility for my mistake.

28
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,440
I am willing to accept all of the punishment.

29
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,290
First, you were afraid so you secretly ran away from the palace.

30
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,200
After that, you were afraid that someone else would take the blame for you.

31
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,930
So you returned to take responsibility for the crime.

32
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,920
It sounds all very plausible.

33
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,520
But I still have a feeling that there is still...

34
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,830
some strangeness to this story.

35
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,630
Eunuch Pan, he is young and doesn't understand things.

36
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,020
Secretly selling things in the palace has never been a big crime.

37
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,670
Seeing as he has been good about acknowledging his mistake,

38
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,960
please excuse it this time.

39
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,970
I am willing to give you all my savings. How about it?

40
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,800
Sun Decheng, is secretly leaving the palace a trivial matter?

41
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,720
The Bureau of Imperial Attire has been asking me about it every day.

42
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,430
If he hadn't come back, you would have been full of injuries all over your body by now. Don't you know?

43
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,360
Now that Physician Dou has returned, this is now easier to handle.

44
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,460
I don't want to be nosy, either.

45
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,720
Xiao Shunzi is an accessory to a crime.

46
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,800
No wage for a year, 50 heavy strokes of caning.

47
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,960
As for Physician Dou?

48
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,760
Jail him first.

49
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,910
I'll decide after a thorough investigation.

50
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,680
- But—
- Deputy Director is wise. Thank you, Deputy Director.

51
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,710
This is great.

52
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,670
Really good.

53
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,130
Come take a look at this.

54
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,020
That's right. It's the best.

55
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,760
Shopkeeper A'Ni, don't panic.

56
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,550
Even though I don't have connections in the palace,

57
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,530
I will ask some relevant people to find out about Yu'er.

58
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,860
After that, let's discuss the countermeasure and see how we can help Yu'er.

59
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,240
This time, for Yu'er to go back to the palace, it's surely full of danger.

60
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,560
I really can't fully explain the reason within.

61
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,140
Even though, I don't know the real reason,

62
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,400
but for Yu'er to disguise as a physician by hiding her female identity

63
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,180
in the palace, there

64
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,460
must be an unspoken difficulty. I understand.

65
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,600
Shopkeever A'Ni, you don't need to blame yourself.

66
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,380
Thank you for your understanding, Young Master Pei.

67
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,450
I really don't have any place to go for help. I'll rely on you to help find out about Yu'er then.

68
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,070
With your help, I feel much better.

69
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,710
Shopkeeper A'Ni, you don't need to be formal.

70
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,440
Yu'er...

71
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,670
is also a friend I treasure.

72
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,430
I still have some important business and so will get going.

73
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,620
Once you have any news about Yu'er, can I trouble you

74
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,080
to come to the Ruyi Resist Dye Shop to find me?

75
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,560
All right.

76
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,760
Xiao Fuzi! Xiao Guizi!

77
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,970
Xiao Shunzi. Come, come!

78
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,560
- Xiao Shunzi.
- Get some water, water.

79
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,000
- You're finally back.
- Take it easy.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,410
I was so worried!

81
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,060
Both of you, hurry and help take Xiao Shunzi inside.

82
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,290
Spread the bedding to warm him up. I'll go get medicine for him.

83
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,940
- Quick, quick, quick! Quickly!
- Yes.

84
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,910
- Come on, take it easy.
- Be careful.

85
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,180
Be careful.

86
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,300
Can you see what's happening? Come and give us a hand.

87
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,580
Coming! Coming!

88
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,550
I already said, Xiao Shunzi is a lucky person

89
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,550
and will come back soon. You had to do that.

90
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,980
I also said it, too. Xiao Shunzi

91
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,900
is a lucky person.

92
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,480
- Let me! Let me.
- Take it! Take it!

93
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,380
Now that Xiao Shunzi is back,

94
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll just move back then. Right?

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,840
Spread an extra layer for him to sleep better.

96
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,440
Come! Come!  Give me a hand.

97
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,020
Come! Come!

98
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,900
- Xiao Shunzi...
- It's fine.

99
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,080
Master is here.

100
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,300
How do you feel now, Xiao Shunzi?

101
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,420
You can all leave. I'll talk with Xiao Shunzi.

102
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

103
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,440
Let me look at your wounds.

104
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,910
Does it hurt to touch?

105
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,540
Please.

106
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,390
Attire Expert Zhuo, this is the place.

107
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,770
Physician Dou.

108
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,120
Attire Expert Zhuo?

109
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,610
I wanted you to go to the Bureau of Imperial Attire because I recognized your talent.

110
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,870
I was full of goodwill.

111
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,400
No matter how I think about it, compared to the Courtyard of Misfortune,

112
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,340
the Bureau of Imperial Attire is a better place.

113
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,550
But I just can't understand

114
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,130
why you'd prefer to secretly run away from the palace and end up with a crime that warrants your arrest,

115
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,480
instead of going to the Bureau of Imperial Attire?

116
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,810
Attire Expert Zhuo, you are too serious.

117
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,420
You are the first person to visit me here in jail.

118
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,060
I am very grateful.

119
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,520
I disappointed your kind gesture. I also feel bad.

120
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,290
But why did you run away?

121
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,990
Can you give me a convincing reason?

122
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,580
I'm sorry, Attire Expert Zhuo.

123
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,530
I know that you are Mother's disciple, but I can't become reacquainted with you.

124
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,330
My real identity has brought too many dangers to people around me.

125
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,890
I can't let you get involved.

126
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,170
Reason? I already told Deputy Director Pan just now.

127
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,280
Xiao Shunzi selling those items from outside the palace

128
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,980
was only to help me.

129
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,190
Seeing that Xiao Shunzi was arrested because of it,

130
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,570
I was afraid of being punished. So I found an opportunity to run away from the palace.

131
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,080
I enjoyed the fun too much and without thinking,

132
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,070
I overstayed for a few days.

133
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:19,080
I originally thought that once I returned to the palace, Foster Father would have

134
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,650
covered everything smoothly just like how I made trouble before.

135
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,220
Big matters turned trivial, trivial matters turned into nothing.

136
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,930
Unexpectedly, I saw the bulletin notices for my arrest.

137
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,930
That's when I knew I committed big trouble this time.

138
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,630
That is why I hurried back to surrender myself and acknowledge my guilt.

139
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,800
This Xiao Douzi is clever and quick.

140
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,270
Why is he so stupid?

141
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,470
There must be another reason for this matter.

142
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,650
But this is not the main problem for my attention.

143
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,990
I want to quickly find out the truth that I want, to discover with this opportunity.

144
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,140
Secretly running away from the palace is a major crime.

145
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,700
The Directorate of Eunuchs will not go easy on you.

146
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,800
However, I appreciate your talent.

147
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,530
As long as you answer my questions fully,

148
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:06,910
my request to transfer you to the Bureau of Imperial Attire is still in effect.

149
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,460
Eunuch Pan and I are pretty good friends.

150
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,070
I can rescue you out of jail.

151
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,460
What does Attire Expert Zhuo want to know?

152
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,590
How did you learn your dressmaking skills?

153
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,630
Did someone teach you,

154
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,510
or did you read some journal of dressmaking secrets?

155
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,080
I want to hear the truth.

156
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,330
This is all that Attire Expert Zhuo wants to know?

157
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,280
Since young, I mended clothes for everyone from top to bottom at the Courtyard of Misfortune.

158
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,880
Everyone said that I did a good job.

159
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,580
After a few times, it stimulated my interest in dressmaking.

160
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,170
Also, at the Courtyard of Misfortune,

161
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,620
I often saw the consorts and concubines being buried in elegant clothes.

162
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,320
So I recorded the patterns and carefully studied the sewing techniques.

163
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,620
Slowly and gradully, I learned it myself.

164
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,920
You learned it yourself?

165
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,680
What a simple phrase of four words!

166
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,380
Let me ask you further.

167
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,360
Do you know the Number One Needle in the World, Madam An?

168
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,570
About Madam An's many fantastic skills in dressing,

169
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,470
I have heard a lot of them.

170
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,220
Even though I yearned to know more, how could I have known her?

171
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,920
But I have heard that you are Madam An's accomplished disciple.

172
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,830
Can you tell me some stories about Madam An?

173
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,440
What accomplished disciple of Madam An?

174
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,530
That Madam An was selfish, cold-hearted, and jealous of others' talents.

175
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,700
She never passed on her real skills to me.

176
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,860
We were only teacher and disciple in name only!

177
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,660
You are saying that Madam An was selfish, coldhearted,

178
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,070
jealous of others' talents?

179
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,590
That An woman is a guilty criminal. Let's not talk about her.

180
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,610
But her dressmaking skill

181
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,180
was really worthy of its fame.

182
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,250
If you know anything about Madam An's dressmaking skill,

183
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,870
and if you can tell me about it,

184
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,990
it will benefit the Bureau of Imperial Attire

185
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,190
and it can be redeemed for your crime.

186
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,470
I will not go back on my promise,

187
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,090
and I'll definitely help you

188
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,420
get out of jail.

189
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,470
I am only a sanitation medical officer at the Courtyard of Misfortune.

190
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,750
Why would I understand Madam An's dressmaking skill?

191
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,950
This opportunity won't happen again if you don't take it.

192
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,790
I'll let you think it over.

193
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,800
If you can remember, let the jail guard

194
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,310
notify me anytime.

195
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,580
Don't give him any food or water.

196
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,330
If he thinks things over and wants to see me,

197
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,970
notify me anytime.

198
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,490
Yes, Attire Expert Zhuo. I'll keep that in mind.

199
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,900
The way Attire Expert Zhuo sounded,

200
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,880
she clearly harbors a deep resentment and jealousy toward my mother.

201
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,810
It is not how one feels toward a teacher.

202
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,130
What's wrong?

203
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,410
Do not go to Attire Expert Zhuo.

204
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,820
In particular, do not let Attire Expert Zhuo know your real identity.

205
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,530
- Why?
- Don't ask!

206
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,990
Now that I recall Foster Father's attitude at that time,

207
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,300
it really was strange.

208
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,950
Foster Father wouldn't let me be reacquainted with Mother's only disciple.

209
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,210
Could it be that the reason isn't to protect her,

210
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,680
but to protect me?

211
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,760
Zhuo Jinniang...

212
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,170
Is she actually my enemy?

213
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,640
Xiao Shunzi,

214
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,900
ever since we saw each other today,

215
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,810
you haven't said a word to me.

216
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,480
I know that...

217
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,120
you blame me for not rescuing you.

218
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,430
Actually,

219
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,730
you are mistaken.

220
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,680
Could I not want to rescue you?

221
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,030
I thought of every idea

222
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,850
that I could.

223
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,840
In the beginning,

224
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,910
that Pan Qinhai...

225
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,390
said as long as I came up with enough money,

226
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,630
he would release you.

227
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,270
I got out all of my savings.

228
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,370
Xiao Fuzi and Xiao Guizi...

229
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,050
also gave their money,

230
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,200
but we still couldn't come up with enough.

231
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,520
So I went outside...

232
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,790
to borrow money everywhere.

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,930
Finally, I got enough of the money.

234
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,430
But that Pan Qinhai,

235
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,410
he didn't want to see me again.

236
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,960
I could tell without thinking.

237
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,860
It's all that Zhuo Jinniang's evil doing.

238
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,800
She gave more money...

239
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,350
and you suffered so much.

240
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,050
I really feel bad.

241
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,510
I am sorry to you.

242
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,320
If you can...

243
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,630
forgive me,

244
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,050
just say a word to me.

245
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,070
Can you, Xiao Shunzi?

246
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,020
Say a word to me?

247
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,080
[Courtyard of Misfortune.]

248
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,280
[Ruyi Resist Dye Shop]

249
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,110
This kid...

250
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,270
Why does this kid make me worry so?

251
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,950
Now that she returned there on her own,

252
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,790
isn't it throwing herself into the trap and getting into more danger?

253
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,920
It happened so quickly, and Liuli clamored to return to the palace.

254
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,120
I really didn't feel it was safe for her to be in the old residence by herself.

255
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,470
I feared that she would sneak away.

256
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,940
So I thought I would find time today

257
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,610
to come to the shop to tell you.

258
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,290
But who was to know that she would sneak away in the middle of the night?

259
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,280
It's my fault, all my fault!

260
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,310
How did I sleep so deeply that I didn't even know that she left?

261
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,870
You shouldn't be faulted.

262
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,030
This kid, Liuli, really cares about friendship and fairness.

263
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,940
She gets stubborn when something happens.

264
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,550
If she wants to do something, you can't pull her back even with several cattle.

265
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,010
The palace is guarded heavily.

266
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,610
Now that Liuli has gibe there, I'm afraid there won't be much news.

267
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,560
How can we get some news

268
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,960
to know whether she is safe?

269
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:00,330
I wasn't able to protect her 11 years ago.

270
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,330
Eleven years later, I lost her again.

271
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,440
How did I, her uncle, become so useless?

272
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,640
It's this cell.

273
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,140
Thank you.

274
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,300
Eunuch Sun, I'll go outside to keep watch.

275
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,950
Talk fast. If you delay too long,

276
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,620
I can't be responsible, either.

277
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,420
Xiao Douzi.

278
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,440
Foster Father!

279
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,180
Are you all right?

280
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,440
Foster Father, Zhuo Jinniang is more than just Mother's disciple.

281
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,400
You never wanted me to reacquaint with her. There is a real reason, right?

282
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,890
Has Zhuo Jinniang been here?

283
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,920
Did you tell her your real identity?

284
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,590
I didn't.

285
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,980
Good child.

286
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,260
Good child.

287
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,570
There's no time. Anything else,

288
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,530
let's talk about it later, all right?

289
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,370
I made this dish for you myself.

290
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,930
The taste is just like 11 years ago.

291
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,230
You know it.

292
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,880
Eunuch Sun,

293
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,310
I happened to pass by

294
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:33,380
and saw you sneak inside. Did you know

295
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,590
all the ones in jail here committed high crimes?

296
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:40,070
Visiting the jail to collude on testimony, secretly delivering meals are all violations of rules.

297
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:44,350
Your crime in secretly letting your foster son leave the palace isn't completely cleared up yet.

298
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,830
What? So you want to violate another rule?

299
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,020
Other than rules and law, there is also human kindness.

300
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,130
Sending some food to my foster son

301
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,820
is common sense in humanity.

302
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,390
I am not unfeeling and ungrateful like you.

303
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,900
But you are here in the middle of the night to threaten me.

304
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,270
Do you have some hidden motive?

305
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,320
Prisoners in this jail

306
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,840
don't seem to be under the Bureau of Imperial Attire's control, do they?

307
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,150
Eunuch Sun,

308
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,280
coming to the jail to visit and deliver meals

309
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,100
is indeed a violation of palace rules.

310
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,280
Please behave. Don't make it where I can't do my job.

311
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,410
You have to always be on guard.

312
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:58,130
You must keep in mind what I said.

313
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,710
Foster Father, please go back quickly. Don't get dragged into this again.

314
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,900
Hurry! Hurry!

315
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,540
Hurry up!

316
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,980
Go inside, inside.

317
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,700
Thank you.

318
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,400
Let's go.

319
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,320
Physician Dou, about my suggestion,

320
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,600
have you thought it over?

321
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,800
Foster Father told me to guard against Zhuo Jinniang.

322
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,600
Her behavior clearly indicates her evilness.

323
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,500
A smart person won't mind a temporary loss. I'll tangle with her.

324
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,000
Attire Expert Zhuo, if you can rescue me out of the jail

325
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,500
and let me go to the Bureau of Imperial Attire, of course, it's what I really want.

326
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,400
After you left last night,

327
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,900
I thought it over seriously, carefully,

328
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,000
with all my energy, and...

329
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,400
I really remembered quite a few things.

330
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,400
You rememered?

331
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,670
What did you remember?

332
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,800
When I was young, I read a few unusual books.

333
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,800
There were many embroidery examples and dress patterns in them.

334
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,600
When I think of it now, what little skills I have, I learned them all from that book.

335
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,200
Where is that book?

336
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,600
You... Where did you read it?

337
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,500
I saw it in the Courtyard of Misfortune.

338
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,400
It was a funerary item for a concubine.

339
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,000
After I read it, I put the book back into the coffin.

340
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,200
So it was buried with that concubine.

341
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,870
Which concubine?

342
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,170
Name? Rank?

343
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,400
So many years have passed.

344
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,000
I-I really can't remember it clearly.

345
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But even if I can remember it, so what?

346
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,400
Attire Expert Zhuo, you mean you would dare open a noble lady's coffin?

347
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,600
Even if you opened the coffin,

348
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,100
that book probably has already turned into dust.

349
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,000
What about those patterns, dressmaking methods...

350
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,600
Can you draw them or write them down?

351
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,500
This...

352
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,500
If I try hard to remember, I should be able to draw some of them.

353
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,200
But I haven't eaten for two days.

354
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,500
I don't even have the strength to hold a pen.

355
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,600
I will send someone

356
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,000
to deliver good food and beverage here, and you get to drawing quickly.

357
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
If you dare to play tricks,

358
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,800

361
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yes, I do! I do!

362
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm not stupid. Why would I give up on good food,

363
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,400
or give up on such a good opportunity at the Bureau of Imperial Attire?

364
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,900
Isn't it just drawing? As soon as I fill my stomach, I will draw right away.

Where is Xiao Shunzi? Where is Xiao Shunzi?

372
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,400
Just-Just now he was still here. Why is he missing all of a sudden?

373
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,200
That's right, Master. He is wounded, so he shouldn't go far.

374
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,000
This Xiao Shunzi hasn't said a word ever since he came back from jail.

375
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,200
I've been feeling something odd.

376
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,400
Let's search separately. We must move fast.

377
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,400
If we're late, I'm afraid something bad will happen.

Look at you.

Why are you here by yourself?

382
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,100
You have wounds on you and the wind is strong.

383
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,400
Be careful with the wounds.

384
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,940
Come back with me.

385
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Master, don't come over.

All right, all right, Xiao Shunzi. I won't go over.

389
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,800
Xiao Shunzi, I know that

390
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
you must have...

391
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,250
suffered a great deal in that place

392
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,460
and got blamed a lot.

393
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,200
But think about it. Both of our lives

394
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,400
were saved in exchange, because Xiao Douzi

395
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,960
came back to the palace and turned himself in

396
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,300
so that we can be safe...

397
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,600
If you jump in just like this,

398
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,600
how can you pay back Xiao Douzi's sacrifice?

399
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,000
Isn't that right?

400
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:25,490
Master, I'm sorry.

401
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm sorry to Xiao Douzi.

402
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,600
It's my fault.

403
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,400
I was instigated by Zhuo Jinniang and thought

404
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,800

405
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,000
In order to live, I told her

406
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,600
that those sachets were sold by Xiao Douzi.

407
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,800
I also said that he already ran away from the palace.

408
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,700
I got him to be wanted for arrest.

409
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,200

410
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,800

411

Calm down. Calm down!

00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,500
Xiao Shunzi, my disciple,

415
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,000
you must not take another step.

416

I understand that

No matter how that Zhuo Jinniang

420

tortured you, threatened you, lured you,

421
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,200
you never told her of Xiao Douzi's background.

422
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,400
Clearly, you are a person who regards friends highly,

and knows what's really important.

424
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,800
Isn't that right?

425
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,200
Master, how did you know that I didn't confess Xiao Douzi's background?

426
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,300
If you did,

427
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,600
that Zhuo Jinniang is so vicious,

428
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,500
she would have already killed Xiao Douzi.

I don't blame you.

Xiao Douzi wouldn't blame you, either.

00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,310
Right, she is Physician Dou in the palace.

523
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,700
We won't say that Physician Dou and you know each other to prevent revealing her identity.

524
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,360
Just say that Physician Dou is my friend.

525
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,560
I need him to give me some help in the palace.

526
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:52,990
That's why we go to Qiniang to find some news about him. How about it?

527
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:57,420
This is a good way. You and Yu'er are new acquaintances.

528
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,620
Even if someone gets suspicious later,

529
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,100
they wouldn't reveal the secret this way.

530
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,380
We mustn't delay. Let's go to Qiniang now.

531
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,550
Sister Qiniang.

532
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,420
Sister, let me introduce you.

533
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:24,110
This is Shopkeeper A'Ni at the Ruyi Resist Dye Shop,

534
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,840
and also my... friend.

535
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:34,620
This one is... This is not important.

536
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,780
Sister, A'Ni came today because she would like your help.

537
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,850
Greetings, Sister Qiniang.

538
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:46,550
I am Cao Wu's friend, A'Ni. This is Young Master Pei from Simen College.

539
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,030
Greetings, Female Palace Officer Qiniang. I am Pei Xingjian.

540
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:53,050
Even though this is presumptuous, but it concerns life or death.

541
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,010
I really couldn't find a way to get help.

542
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,880
I heard about your connections in the palace,

543
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,900
so I intruded to beg for your help. Please excuse me, female palace officer.

544
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,310
I see that Young Master Pei is wearing an official robe, so you are a court official.

545
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:07,660
If it's something that you find difficult, I, as a maidservant in the palace,

546
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,250
probably can't do much to help.

547
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,640
Cao Wu.

548
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,450
Sister!

549
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,870
Older Sister!

550
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:26,020
Older Sister, I've admired you since I was young.

551
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,650
You've pampered this younger brother, too. Isn't that right?

552
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:32,500
Please just listen to him first. If you can help, then help.

553
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,820
I'm only doing this for A'Ni.

554
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,130
I'm not doing anything for Young Master Pei.

555
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,910
We business people really hate the "Pei" word.
(Homophone for loss)

556
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:43,270
I would like to ask Female Palace Office about someone named Physician Dou.

557
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:47,490
He is a friend of mine. I asked him to help me with something when he was out of the palace a few days ago.

558
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:50,600
Unexpectedly, I delayed his return to the palace.

559
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,800
That's why I'd like to beg for your assistance to find news

560
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,960
about whether Physician Dou got punished after he returned to the palace.

561
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,300
Physician Dou secretly ran away from the palace for quite a few days.

562
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,410
It shouldn't be as simple as being delayed from returning to the palace.

563
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:06,340
Young Master Pei, what you say is too simple.

564
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,760
- How is he now?
- I only heard that he is currently in jail.

565
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,290
As for any further details, I don't know anything.

566
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:18,630
I heard your younger brother mention that you have an important rank and status in the palace.

567
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:22,580
That's why I would like to ask you to help Physician Dou

568
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,820
and reduce his punishment.

569
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:30,260
I understand that it takes money to get help in the palace.

570
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,840
I would be willing to take on the responsibility fully.

571
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,920
Furthermore, I won't let Female Palace Officer work on this for nothing. I will definitely thank you handsomely.

572
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,140
That's right. If Sister is willing to help,

573
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,450
I am willing to give all my savings.

574
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:44,470
If it's not enough, I will do my best to make it up.

575
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,900
I am merely a maidservant in the palace.

576
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,050
What Shopkeeper Ani and Young Master Pei are asking...

577
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:53,160
- There is nothing that I can do.
- Older SIster.

578
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,770
I've already boasted to them,

579
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,930
saying that your teacher is Attire Expert Zhuo.

580
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,780
Don't let me lose face, all right?

581
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,690
Older Sister, please just give them some help.

582
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,620
Don't ever talk nonsense again, my silly brother.

583
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,180
Do you understand how serious it is what they are asking?

584
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,000
It's really beyond what I can do.

585
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,630
It's my fault for being impatient and forcing this difficulty upon you.

586
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:17,290
Then perhaps Female Palace Officer can

587
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,740
ask about Physician Dou's news after you return to the palace?

588
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,910
Has he been tortured? Is he wounded?

589
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,460
Also, please send him a message that

590
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,480
his friends outside the palace will definitely save him.

591
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,240
Tell him not to give up any hope.

592
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,840
I thank Female Palace Officer in advance.

593
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,900
A'Ni, I beg you.

594
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,610
Older Sister, I am kneeling, too.

595
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:43,060
If Older Sister won't agree, I will stay kneeling here,

596
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,080
not eating, not drinking, until I die.

597
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,450
Get up first.

598
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:04,240
The inner palace is full of dangers. I am also low in status.

599
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,890
I've been cautious all the time. That's how I've survived till now.

600
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:10,650
But after Younger Brother's persistent plea...

601
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:15,400
All right, for the sake of these friends with such deep friendship,

602
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,090
I promise you

603
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:20,060
to find out about the situation and pass along the message.

604
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,900
As for the rest, I really don't have the power to do it.

605
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,260
I also don't want anything from you.

606
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,590
Thank you, Sister Qiniang.

607
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:31,330
Female Palace Officer, if you ever need me to help,

608
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:33,950
I will definitely do my duty to thank your benevolence.

609
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:38,050
How about it? I told you Sister Qiniang really pampers me the most.
