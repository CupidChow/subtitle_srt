1
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,940
(Impression Of Youth)

2
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,380
Am I dreaming?

3
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,750
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,500
Yu Sheng...

5
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,400
Something happened to Yu Sheng,

6
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,040
so I was late.

7
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,650
I was in a hurry to send it to the hospital,

8
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,090
so I forgot my phone.

9
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,030
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,780
It's okay. I'm glad you're back.

11
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:14,980
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,140
I won't let you lose track of me again.

13
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,360
By the way, how did you get back?

14
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,520
There should be no bus at this time.

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,980
Yue drove me back.

16
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,479
Is she your secret girlfriend in Taipei?

17
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,039
Of course not. What are you talking about?

18
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,390
I've known Yue for almost eight years.

19
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,920
And Yue is my only close friend.

20
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,979
This time, when I came to teach,

21
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,920
I asked her to look after Yu Sheng.

22
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,200
Really? I envy her.

23
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,380
What do you envy?

24
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,160
I envy her for knowing you for so long.

25
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:53,950
Xu Luhui.

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,110
If we'd known each other for eight years,

27
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,940
I'd have to meet you when you were 10.

28
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,690
Forget it. That's creepy.

29
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,470
I don't envy Yue anymore.

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,030
How is Yu Sheng?

31
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,180
I'm not sure yet.

32
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,220
It might need to be hospitalized for a few days.

33
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,720
By the way, what is the summer festival

34
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,320
you mentioned in the message?

35
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,530
It's the annual summer festival here.

36
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,620
People would set off fireworks.

37
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,930
But it's already over.

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,440
Is it?

39
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,140
You know what?

40
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,350
My biggest wish

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,150
is to watch fireworks with the person I love.

42
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,570
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,140
I didn't make it back in time.

44
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:29,200
It's okay.

45
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,860
It was fun setting off those little fireworks together.

46
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,650
Thank you.

47
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,150
Since you're happy now,

48
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,900
should we go back early and rest?

49
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,900
We both have class tomorrow.

50
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:38,900
Yes, sir.

51
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,590
Oh right,

52
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,910
how about we go on a date this weekend?

53
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,630
Sure. Where do you want to go?

54
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,530
You pick the place.

55
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,400
Great!

56
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,710
Date! Date! Date!

57
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,320
Alright.

58
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,270
Date! Date!

59
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,240
Alright.

60
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,150
Weird, whose bike is this?

61
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:58,870
It wasn't here when I got here.

62
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,390
I rode this one over just now.

63
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,010
The other one's still being fixed.

64
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,950
Luxi borrowed it

65
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,150
from the neighbor boy.

66
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,800
So you just rode this one

67
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,310
to find me from the homestay.

68
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,550
I don't know to ride a scooter.

69
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,320
I can only ride a bike.

70
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,300
No wonder you were all sweaty.

71
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,700
Poor thing.

72
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,730
Okay, I've decided.

73
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,080
Starting tomorrow, I'll teach you

74
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,600
how to ride a scooter after class.

75
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,590
Sure.

76
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,670
But you have to make sure

77
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,380
you've got the scooter insurance.

78
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,760
I can't guarantee my riding skills.

79
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,980
Don't worry. I'm with you.

80
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,690
Alright, let me tie it up and take you back.

81
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,310
Okay.

82
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,270
(Homelike)

83
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,650
Can't sleep?

84
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:49,920
Do you want some beer?

85
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,560
I'll get it for you.

86
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,290
No, thanks. I don't drink.

87
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,300
Something's bothering you?

88
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,820
How did you know Yu Xing?

89
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,250
It's too late.

90
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,660
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

91
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:42,980
It's him.

92
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,760
The list of the Arts Award is out.

93
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,250
Yu Xing got first place again.

94
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,030
No wonder, with all the money his family spent

95
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,800
on him since he was little.

96
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,290
Yeah, I heard his dad's a famous curator.

97
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,650
No wonder he doesn't hang out with us.

98
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,280
He must look down on us.

99
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,510
What are you talking about?

100
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,990
If you're not that capable,

101
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,790
at least spend time improving yourself

102
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,950
instead of just complaining.

103
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,330
People like you deserve not to win.

104
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,330
We're talking about Yu Xing,

105
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,290
not you.

106
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,080
Besides, you didn't win the award either.

107
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,040
Why are you so arrogant?

108
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,480
He has the capability to win. What about you—

109
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,570
Yu... Yu Xing, what are you doing?

110
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,740
Did I say something wrong?

111
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,070
They're just jealous.

112
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,870
Why did you pull me?

113
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,380
I don't like this.

114
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,790
Say something.

115
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,570
You don't have to speak for me.

116
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,200
I'm used to it anyway.

117
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,500
You can't indulge them like this.

118
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,940
They will get worse.

119
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,540
It's okay.

120
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,710
I don't care anyway.

121
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:52,870
But I do.

122
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,950
I mean

123
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,150
I take you as my goal.

124
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:00,760
I hope one day

125
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,230
my paintings can surpass yours.

126
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,930
So I can't allow others

127
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,900
to slander my goal.

128
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,010
You are...

129
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:11,870
Yu...

130
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,690
Yue.

131
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,620
You don't interact with others.

132
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,320
No wonder you don't even know my name.

133
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,670
Interact with others?

134
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,250
I don't like doing

135
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,330
meaningless things.

136
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,040
What are you going to do after graduation?

137
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,400
Probably go to grad school.

138
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,590
Me too.

139
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,210
But I'm thinking of studying abroad.

140
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,420
I want to see the world.

141
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,420
Do you want to come with me?

142
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,540
Me?

143
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,880
I don't think it's a good idea.

144
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,510
Why?

145
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,600
Your portfolio is amazing.

146
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,090
Getting into a top art grad school abroad

147
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,510
should be a piece of cake.

148
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,620
But my parents always say

149
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,430
I should stay here and do my grad studies

150
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,590
at this school.

151
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,390
They must be worried about you.

152
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,870
You're so isolated.

153
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,590
But we can go abroad together.

154
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,020
We can take care of each other.

155
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,810
And don't you get to decide

156
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,400
your own life?

157
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,080
Do you want to study abroad?

158
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,289
I don't know.

159
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,299
At least I don't have that idea right now.

160
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,310
Alright, then I won't go either.

161
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,280
Why?

162
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,050
You'll be bullied if I'm not around.

163
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,550
I don't think so.

164
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,320
It's grad school.

165
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,010
Everyone's supposed

166
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,210
to be mature adults.

167
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,520
Adults are scary.

168
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,830
Or you could just date me,

169
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,610
and no one would dare bully you.

170
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,730
I'm hungry. Treat me to dinner.

171
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,870
Why should I?

172
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,160
Because I'm your only friend.

173
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,940
Who else can you treat? Let's go.

174
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,010
I haven't finished yet.

175
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:30,870
I'm starving.

176
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,270
So you were college classmates.

177
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,720
We've known each other for eight years.

178
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,400
You like Yu Xing?

179
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,710
I'm really good at reading people.

180
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,160
I could tell from the way

181
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,810
you looked at Yu Xing when you came in.

182
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,330
Even an outsider can tell.

183
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,500
How long is Yu Xing going to pretend he doesn't know?

184
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,730
Have you ever thought,

185
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,450
you've been with him for so long,

186
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,840
but why hasn't he responded to

187
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,100
your feelings?

188
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,670
You should love yourself more.

189
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,690
Some things

190
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,970
you can figure out,

191
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,840
but you just can't let go,

192
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,300
because you don't want to.

193
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,970
Sorry, I know we just met.

194
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,150
I shouldn't have told you this.

195
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,790
But I treat Yu Xing as my friend.

196
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,460
Yu Xing's friend is my friend.

197
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,760
Sometimes you need an outsider's perspective.

198
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,460
I hope you can think about what I said.

199
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,550
Thank you.

200
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,310
(Homelike)

201
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,200
If you keep looking, you'll be late for class.

202
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,260
Why don't you ever button up your shirt?

203
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,880
Because I want you to do it for me.

204
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,250
(Xu Luhui)

205
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,980
Why are you wearing a uniform?

206
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,990
My clothes got dirty,

207
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,470
and I was in a rush to get back,

208
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,750
so I borrowed one from my student.

209
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,700
There you go.

210
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,840
Don't forget we have a date tomorrow.

211
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,900
Don't worry. I won't.

212
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,000
Have you ever thought,

213
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,500
you've been with him for so long,

214
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,030
but why hasn't he responded to

215
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,270
your feelings?

216
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,470
So Yu Xing likes...

217
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,900
Is he the reason why you rushed back yesterday?

218
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,400
So,

219
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,150
is that

220
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,260
the reason why you've refused

221
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,180
to accept my feelings to you?

222
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,880
I...

223
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,290
I don't know.

224
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,640
I've been by your side for so long,

225
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,040
and I've liked you for so long.

226
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:16,930
Now you tell me

227
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,670
you like

228
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,740
some boy you've known for less than a month,

229
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,110
and he's your student.

230
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,050
Could you accept that if you were me?

231
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,860
Yue, I'm sorry.

232
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,640
I should have told you earlier.

233
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,360
Forget it.

234
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,990
What's the point of saying this now?

235
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,100
I know you.

236
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,770
If it weren't for him,

237
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,520
you wouldn't have known

238
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,960
when you will tell me this.

239
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,930
Because you don't know

240
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,080
what you want at all.

241
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,400
Yue left?

242
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,920
Where is Luhui?

243
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,530
He went to class.

244
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,860
How are you and Yue?

245
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,290
I don't know.

246
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,040
But what is done cannot be undone.

247
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,140
That seems to be the only way.

248
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:19,990
I guess

249
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,320
it's just fate.

250
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,600
Popsicles taste better when two people eat together.

251
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,740
Thanks.

252
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,540
In that case,

253
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,330
wouldn't it be embarrassing

254
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,350
for Luhui and Yu Xing?

255
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,880
Luhui seems fine.

256
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,290
But Yu Xing looks pretty down.

257
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,140
After all, they've been friends for almost eight years.

258
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,860
It takes courage

259
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,000
to make things clear.

260
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,220
Right.

261
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,440
By the way,

262
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,250
I want to do a trial run

263
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,750
at the cafe next Friday.

264
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,720
Can you invite Luhui and Yu Xing

265
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,740
to come?

266
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
Of course.

267
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,530
I'll text them now

268
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,000
and tell them when to come.

269
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,090
Happy.

270
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,000
Very happy.

271
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,070
Done.

272
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,900
What's wrong?

273
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,140
Feeling unwell?

274
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,700
Do you have a heatstroke?

275
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,420
Or do you have a fever?

276
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,870
No fever.

277
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,470
Well...

278
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,330
Luxi.

279
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,300
Do you remember what happened here

280
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,770
when we came out

281
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,680
to buy alcohol that day?

282
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,840
I only remember that day

283
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,400
we were talking about...

284
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,230
Lanxin?

285
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,930
I think I mentioned

286
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,790
Lanxin would be happy to see you

287
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,070
working so hard?

288
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,350
And...

289
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,980
And...

290
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,120
Did anything special happen that day?

291
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,700
I kind of...

292
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,760
I... We...

293
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,040
I'm sorry.

294
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,620
I drank too much that day.

295
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,630
I didn't mean it.

296
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,730
It's okay.

297
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,850
I know you were drunk,

298
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,170
so I don't mind.

299
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,030
Bingchen,

300
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,120
I have something to do at the homestay.

301
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,950
I have to go now.

302
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:03,960
Your popsicle.

303
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,599
You haven't finished your popsicle.

304
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,339
Xu Luxi, you're so embarrassing.

305
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,430
How could you forget that you kissed him?

306
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,190
Such a romantic moment

307
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,030
should be engraved on my mind.

308
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,380
It's all the alcohol's fault.

309
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,980
If I ever drink again,

310
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,780
I'll...

311
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,390
I'll change my last name!

312
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,890
What a pity.

313
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,590
Maybe I should drink again,

314
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,160
pretend to get drunk, and kiss him again.

315
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,350
No way.

316
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,020
This is too frivolous.

317
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,760
It's not serious enough.

318
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,320
I've been by your side for so long,

319
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,730
and I've liked you for so long.

320
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,240
Now you tell me you like

321
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,370
some boy you've known for less than a month,

322
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,790
and he's your student.

323
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,790
Could you accept that if you were me?

324
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,530
Yue, thank you for liking me.

325
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,010
You'll find someone better suited for you than me.

326
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,170
Forget it.

327
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,150
Give her some time.

328
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,310
I think Yue will move on.

329
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,370
I'm in Taipei.

330
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:08,840
Thank you.

331
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,220
Luhui, what are you drawing?

332
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,690
I'm drawing what I like.

333
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,010
What do you like?

334
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,100
Good things should be shared with good friends.

335
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,150
Come on, show us.

336
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,890
No.

337
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,650
Go away.

338
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,640
Don't look.

339
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,500
Take a look.

340
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,520
I don't want to share it with you.

341
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,240
-Go away.
-Just a little.

342
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,000
Go away.

343
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,710
-A little.
-Move your hands.

344
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,460
Please.

345
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,380
Cheapskate.

346
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:08,960
Has no luck.

347
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,150
Go away.

348
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,670
Let me take a look.

349
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,790
Class begins, everyone.

350
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:13,510
Let's go back to our seats.

351
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,570
Cheapskate.

352
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,520
Put away anything you shouldn't have in class.

353
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,670
Open the textbook

354
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,090
and turn to page 101.

355
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,300
As I said in the last class...

356
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,430
Sir,

357
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,960
I didn't bring my textbook.

358
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:33,910
Can I borrow one?

359
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,280
Didn't I tell you to bring your textbook to class?

360
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,950
I'm sorry.

361
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,350
Alright, I'll lend you mine.

362
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,360
What?

363
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,160
Alright, class begins.

364
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,720
We...

365
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,790
Like I told you last time,

366
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,860
the outline's relationship.

367
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,230
Well, you know the outline, right?

368
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,220
The outline plays a very important role

369
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,980
in the painting performance.

370
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,240
Artists use lines

371
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,120
to piece together the ideal world in their paintings.

372
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,520
Come on, over here.

373
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,550
Slowly. Slow it down.

374
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,710
There's a fork road ahead.

375
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,370
Turn the handlebars, turn, turn.

376
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,620
Yes. Slowly. Just like that.

377
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,090
Okay, stop.

378
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,970
Remember to twist the throttle gently.

379
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,470
Slow down when turning.

380
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,500
I'll guide you.

381
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,520
Feel the power of me twisting the throttle

382
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,410
and the turning.

383
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,170
Okay.

384
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:46,950
Alright.

385
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:47,780
Try again.

386
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,380
Okay.

387
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,530
Look ahead.

388
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,950
Good, very good.

389
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,250
Yeah, just like that.

390
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,530
So this is how it feels to ride with someone you love.

391
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,360
It's great.

392
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,830
I've learned how to ride a scooter now.

393
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,250
I can give you rides from now on.

394
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:35,540
You promised.

395
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,780
Seal then. It's a deal.

396
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,400
Xu Luhui, what are you doing?

397
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,020
What if someone sees us?

398
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,400
There's no one here.

399
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,760
We're the only ones around.

400
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,320
Do you remember

401
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,870
your first kiss

402
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,260
with your girlfriend?

403
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,080
Of course I do.

404
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,190
How could I forget that?

405
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,100
Yeah.

406
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,800
But have you ever

407
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,970
accidentally kissed someone

408
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,480
while drunk?

409
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,340
What?

410
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,830
You accidentally kissed Bingchen while drunk?

411
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,510
Keep it down.

412
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,360
The whole village would know that.

413
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,990
Welcome.

414
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,370
What would you like?

415
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,330
A beer, please.

416
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,110
Hello, Bingchen.

417
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,400
Finished work today?

418
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,180
The cafe's all finished.

419
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,390
It seems like there's nothing left to do.

420
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,520
And you?

421
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,430
Rushed back to the homestay.

422
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,760
Did you get things done?

423
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,820
Let's have a double date.

424
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,080
I think you're right.

425
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,240
Popsicles taste better

426
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,210
when two people eat together.

427
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,830
If I decide to go,

428
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,420
how should I tell Luhui?

429
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,420
This is the first time

430
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,330
I've ever liked someone this much.

431
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,000
I'm really disappointed in you!

432
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,360
Luhui!

433
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,200
We won't be alone anymore.

434
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,400
I'll be here to take care of you

435
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,580
and protect you.
