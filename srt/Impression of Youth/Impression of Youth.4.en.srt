1
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,920
(Impression Of Youth)

2
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,000
You treat me to dinner.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll make you coffee.

4
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,060
Wait for me.

5
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:37,770
Sure.

6
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,220
The coffee is so good.

7
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,020
Well,

8
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,720
thank you for the coffee.

9
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:38,690
And thank you

10
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,580
for letting me be the first person to try it.

11
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,450
Every cup of coffee has its own story.

12
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,780
Now you know my story.

13
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,830
Do you want to tell me your story?

14
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,190
Done.

15
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,410
Okay, let me see.

16
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,039
Your drawing is overall good.

17
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,650
The strokes are well-controlled.

18
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,060
There's basically no fault to find.

19
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,120
The weight of the watermelon,

20
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,600
the texture and quality of its surface

21
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,290
are all depicted.

22
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,510
You are really talented in drawing.

23
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,010
Who am I? I'm Xu Luhui.

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,970
You really haven't studied before?

25
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,550
No.

26
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,900
Luhui's composition is very bold and unconstrained,

27
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,410
bold yet meticulous,

28
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,150
showing a delicate side of his personality.

29
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,640
Indeed,

30
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,220
one drawing can reveal the artist's character.

31
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,030
What do you think?

32
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,850
It's really good.

33
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,730
Great, then I'm heading out.

34
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,690
Wait.

35
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,270
Don't get carried away too soon.

36
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,710
There are still some small details

37
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,720
you can pay more attention to.

38
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,230
Your observation could also be more delicate.

39
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,910
But don't worry.

40
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,240
I'll teach you more in the future.

41
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,320
Alright, I'm going to cut the watermelon now.

42
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,730
How is it? Is it okay?

43
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,380
I don't think so.

44
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,910
Try it.

45
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,790
Okay.

46
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,840
Why are you laughing?

47
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,160
Your face.

48
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,410
I helped you fix your bike, and you're laughing.

49
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,079
Go away.

50
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:55,829
Go away!

51
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,200
It's dirty. You've gone too far.

52
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,810
Alright, I apologize to you, okay?

53
00:03:58,829 --> 00:03:59,660
Don't come any closer.

54
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,440
Apologize.

55
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,540
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

56
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,400
Your hands are...

57
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:03,980
so dirty.

58
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,740
Okay, leave the bike here.

59
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,860
I'll get someone to fix it.

60
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,280
I'll take you back first.

61
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,180
Alright.

62
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,980
Before an accident happens,

63
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,980
we rarely think that

64
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,180
the people we see every day

65
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,440
might

66
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,590
suddenly leave us one day.

67
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,400
After my parents passed away in a car accident,

68
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,159
Luhui gave me the courage

69
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,350
and made me decide

70
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,200
to bring him back here.

71
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,550
Here, it feels like home.

72
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,600
That's why I named it

73
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,490
Homelike Homestay.

74
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,780
I also hope that the guests who come here

75
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,820
can feel like they're at home.

76
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,430
Back then,

77
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,570
Luhui would always look at our parents'

78
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,410
photo and draw them,

79
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,840
as if they were

80
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,850
still alive in the world he drew.

81
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,760
I want to try yours too.

82
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:32,970
Delicious.

83
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,540
Xu Luhui, give me back my popsicle.

84
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,120
Where are you going?

85
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,610
What did you say?

86
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,610
Give it back.

87
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,050
No.

88
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,200
Give it back!

89
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,640
Stop it.

90
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,200
Come here.

91
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,440
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

92
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,170
Maybe you're not ready to talk about it yet.

93
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,060
It's okay.

94
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,680
I can talk about it now,

95
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,730
which means I've let it go.

96
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,840
We have to move on.

97
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,180
Let bygones be bygones.

98
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,520
Learn to cherish the present,

99
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,270
and live every day seriously.

100
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,850
You're mature.

101
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,880
I hope you're not saying that I look old.

102
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,620
No, I mean...

103
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,620
Well, I was just kidding.

104
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,450
Since we both know each other's stories now,

105
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,420
we'll be friends from now on.

106
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:43,159
Friends should help each other.

107
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,370
So don't be polite with me anymore.

108
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,810
Okay.

109
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,220
Got it.

110
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,470
Luxi, thank you.

111
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,510
By the way,

112
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,870
you just said your brother is good at drawing.

113
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,510
Could I ask him

114
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,020
to help me paint the exterior of the cafe?

115
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,520
Of course.

116
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,200
I'll talk to him later.

117
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,980
Friends should help each other.

118
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,380
Thank you.

119
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,480
You actually look good when you smile.

120
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,820
You should smile more.

121
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,200
What?

122
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:26,720
No.

123
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,210
You should smile more.

124
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,870
You look good when you smile.

125
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:41,830
Lanxin used to say that all the time.

126
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,310
Sorry for disturbing you.

127
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,690
I have to go now.

128
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,440
Thanks for the bento.

129
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,940
See you the day after tomorrow.

130
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:18,950
See you.

131
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,260
You two...

132
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:35,580
look weird.

133
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:42,970
-No.
-No.

134
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,100
Really?

135
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,180
Then why don't you look at each other?

136
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,370
I'm going to take a shower.

137
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,520
Since when does he like to shower so much?

138
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,070
I'll go inside too.

139
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,680
Wait.

140
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,810
What's up?

141
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,540
Let's eat together later.

142
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,800
Sure.

143
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,130
Go and rest.

144
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:09,580
Okay.

145
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,590
If you need any help,

146
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,730
just let me know.

147
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,450
Let's eat.

148
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,670
Since when

149
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,670
have you become so tacit?

150
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,770
By the way, Xu Luhui,

151
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,990
come to the cafe next door with me the day after tomorrow.

152
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,040
The owner wants to finish the renovation

153
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,100
before his late wife's birthday.

154
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,760
He needs someone to paint the exterior.

155
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,300
I don't want to.

156
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,150
Do you even get a say?

157
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,150
Xu Luxi, am I really your brother?

158
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,610
I seriously suspect that I'm just a staff at Homelike Homestay.

159
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,800
I can't even take a day off.

160
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,610
Stop complaining. Just do as I say.

161
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,020
Why don't you ask Yu Xing to go?

162
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,650
He's an art teacher.

163
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,820
He'd paint a hundred times better than me.

164
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,190
That's right.

165
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,950
Yu Xing is an art teacher.

166
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,690
No, Xu Luhui.

167
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,430
I'm talking about you.

168
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,050
Don't try to change the subject.

169
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,580
Get up at 6 a.m. the day after tomorrow.

170
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,260
No sleeping in.

171
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,980
If you do,

172
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,700
I'll dig you out of bed with a shovel.

173
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,200
Do you hear me?

174
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,220
Alright.

175
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,600
So...

176
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,520
this is what touch feels like.

177
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,520
Is everything okay?

178
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,210
Yes...

179
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,130
I think.

180
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,860
Look,

181
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,730
the tall one with long hair in a ponytail,

182
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,670
that's my ideal type.

183
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,290
Give me back my popsicle.

184
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,180
Give it back!

185
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,170
Stop it.

186
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,630
I like the one with short hair

187
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,700
and a cute look.

188
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,060
Luhui, your ideal type...

189
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,960
Xu Luhui, what's wrong with you?

190
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,550
This was my first kiss.

191
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,350
Why does it feel different?

192
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,280
Lv.

193
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,240
Let me try.

194
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,660
How petty.

195
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,820
That was my first kiss too.

196
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,630
What do you think we should paint?

197
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,330
I have no idea.

198
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,380
What about you? Any ideas?

199
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,210
No.

200
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,290
Just one more accessory and it'll be done.

201
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,580
It's much faster with more helpers, right?

202
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,610
Yes.

203
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,990
This way, we can finish it before Lanxin's birthday.

204
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,200
Thank you.

205
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,950
Take a break.

206
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,170
I'll make you some coffee.

207
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,670
By the way, besides coffee,

208
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,310
what else will the cafe sell?

209
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,220
I'm still thinking about that.

210
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,000
After all, I only know how to make coffee.

211
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,840
Have some coffee.

212
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:55,780
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

213
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,680
Maybe this will spark some inspiration.

214
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:02,870
I was wondering,

215
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,450
why did you want to

216
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,430
open a cafe here?

217
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,970
My wife loved watching the sea.

218
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,330
We used to stay at the beach

219
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,340
for a whole afternoon.

220
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,000
She always felt that watching the sea was very healing.

221
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,400
Every time, she would insist on

222
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,750
opening a cafe where we could

223
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,580
see the sea.

224
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,200
This cafe

225
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,700
is like the last birthday gift I gave her.

226
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,200
It's really beautiful.

227
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,450
How is it? Not bad, huh?

228
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,700
You're the only one who's been here.

229
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,840
Since your wife loved watching the sea,

230
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,140
how about we imprint the sea

231
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,090
on the wall of the cafe?

232
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,030
What do you think?

233
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,400
Right, in this way,

234
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,490
the guests who come here can feel

235
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,730
the leisure of the seaside.

236
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,500
I think it's a great idea.

237
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,940
It's also my original intention to heal

238
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,740
every guest who comes to the cafe.

239
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,510
If there's no problem,

240
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,970
we'll paint it this way.

241
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,060
Thank you.

242
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,400
Bingchen, come in and help.

243
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,870
Coming.

244
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,510
If you need any help or tools,

245
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,350
just let me know.

246
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,250
No problem.

247
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:21,930
Go ahead.

248
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,470
Sorry.

249
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,020
You first.

250
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,590
Weird.

251
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,020
Why did I just feel a tingling?

252
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,130
Yu Xing.

253
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,320
What?

254
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,480
Xu Luhui, you're dead!

255
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,510
Don't come over.

256
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,640
Can't catch me, can't catch me.

257
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,760
Can't catch me.

258
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,490
Don't come over.

259
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,030
Come here!

260
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,010
Yu Xing.

261
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:57,760
Yu Xing.

262
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,500
Get up!

263
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,740
You're dead!

264
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:02,790
Come here.

265
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,390
Come here.

266
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,650
Stop it!

267
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,329
Xu Luhui, what are you doing?

268
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:11,859
Come here.

269
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:12,530
Come on.

270
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,510
Xu Luhui.

271
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,369
Xu Luhui, stop it.

272
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,220
Xu Luhui.

273
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,670
Come here!

274
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,050
Yu Xing, help me!

275
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,710
Wait.

276
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,480
What do you think if we add

277
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,370
some yellow ones?

278
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,600
It's okay.

279
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,390
Let's stack it up, make a few layers.

280
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,640
Stack it.

281
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,040
Or make it into a pyramid?

282
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:17,980
Okay.

283
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,530
We've made a lot of this.

284
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,500
Where do you want to put the PET bottle?

285
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,370
Do you want to put it on top or on the table?

286
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,230
This way,

287
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,670
there will be a subtle green feeling, you know.

288
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,410
Yeah, add it in and let's see.

289
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:30,970
Okay.

290
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,900
It's so beautiful.

291
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,380
The guests who come here will definitely love it.

292
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,870
I give this painting 200 points.

293
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,620
Hello, Xu Luxi.

294
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,130
Did you see me? I painted too.

295
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,700
Shut up.

296
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,300
Thank you for your company.

297
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,270
You've added

298
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,760
a different kind of vitality to this place.

299
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,180
Once the interior is finished,

300
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,520
I'll properly thank you all.

301
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,620
Bingchen, don't say that.

302
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,560
After the cafe is finished,

303
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,170
let's go to the homestay

304
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,820
for a barbecue and drinks to celebrate.

305
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,590
Barbecue! Barbecue! I want barbecue!

306
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,090
Barbecue! I want barbecue!

307
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,790
Luxi, I want it too.

308
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,360
Teacher first. Where's your manners?

309
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,500
You haven't finished yours yet.

310
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,470
Hurry up and eat.

311
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,490
So cute.

312
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,820
Send the photos to Luhui and Yu Xing for me.

313
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,640
Okay, thank you.

314
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,800
Good night.

315
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,490
Good night.

316
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,130
Did you find it?

317
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,060
No.

318
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,400
Do we really need a plaster cast?

319
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,680
Generally,

320
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,160
before we have students do portrait sketches,

321
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,920
we have them practice with plaster casts

322
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,980
to test and train their sketching abilities.

323
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,910
But since I

324
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
rarely draw portraits myself,

325
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,470
I don't have an example for you to reference.

326
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,080
Or can I draw you?

327
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,950
Me?

328
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,390
Yes.

329
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,020
You've already told me about

330
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,270
the three sides and five values of sketching last time.

331
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,850
I'll give it a try first.

332
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,320
You can tell me how to adjust later.

333
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,400
Alright, but let me explain something first.

334
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,070
Last time I mentioned that

335
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:00,330
there are some small details in your sketching

336
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,750
that you could pay more attention to.

337
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,050
It's not about technique.

338
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,550
What I told you last time was about observation.

339
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,020
You need to observe more carefully.

340
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,310
Come on, stand up.

341
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,560
Stand up?

342
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,440
Yes.

343
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,090
Stand back. Stand away from me.

344
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:25,900
Back.

345
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,380
Okay, stop.

346
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,500
Now, look into my eyes

347
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:34,840
and observe me carefully.

348
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,400
Is the me you see now

349
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,540
a little different from

350
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,990
the me you usually see?

351
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,030
It seems so.

352
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,670
Okay.

353
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,630
Now, slowly walk towards me.

354
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:55,950
Slowly.

355
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,490
Move forward.

356
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,560
Don't look away.

357
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,950
Look into my eyes.

358
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,160
Keep your eyes on mine.

359
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:09,920
Come on, move forward.

360
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:14,570
Forward.

361
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,080
Move forward.

362
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,000
Now,

363
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,810
feel the object you're going to draw。

364
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,240
Feel the texture.

365
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,780
So I can touch you?

366
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,050
Yes.

367
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,630
Touch my hair.

368
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,140
Come on.

369
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,200
Rub it.

370
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,970
Feel its texture.

371
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,520
Now touch my face.

372
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,400
Feel the texture of my skin.

373
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,770
Finished.

374
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,010
Congratulations.

375
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,130
Let's take a photo.

376
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,480
Thank you for your hard work.

377
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,470
I'll make you some coffee.

378
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,730
Lanxin, happy birthday.

379
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,930
Remember those feelings

380
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,730
and digest them slowly.

381
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,010
Then express them

382
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,840
fully through your sketching.

383
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,020
That's the essence of portrait drawing.

384
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,830
I don't know if it's the sun or you,

385
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,950
but it's so dazzling I can't look directly.

386
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,480
What's wrong?

387
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,310
I suddenly have a stomachache.

388
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,530
I'll draw it another day.

389
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,190
Luhui.

390
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,920
What are these feelings?

391
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,920
These feelings

392
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,840
are too much for me to draw.

393
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,870
Is this

394
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,700
what it feels like to like someone?

395
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,050
Do you feel anything now?

396
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,680
You should let Yu Xing know

397
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,690
how you feel about him.

398
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,240
When will you be ready

399
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,940
to accept a new relationship?

400
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,450
Did you

401
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,620
bring him to me?

402
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,450
I just want you to know my feelings.

403
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,340
It's okay if you don't respond the same way.

404
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,320
Feel your own emotions.

405
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,890
I thought you were here to see me.

406
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,300
I wasn't.
