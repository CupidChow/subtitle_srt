<i>[Mid-Term Deadline]</i>

2
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,005
Yu Xing!

3
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,072
Yu Xing!

4
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,850
Why isn't he picking up?

5
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,459
Mr. Yu, you're running late!

6
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,429
Wake up and wash up!

7
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,798
Wake up! You'll be late! Hurry up!

8
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,800
Xiao Yue?

9
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,835
Why are you here?

10
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,670
Did you really forget about today?

11
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,072
What's the time now?

12
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:22,976
No time for that! Get up and wash up!

13
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,644
Why does this always happen?

14
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,780
I already sent you a reminder via text yesterday.

15
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,948
You're unbelievable!

16
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,683
Your luggage isn't even packed.

17
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,252
<i>My name is Yu Xing.</i>

18
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,921
<i>I'm a fourth-year graduate student in art.</i>

19
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,489
<i>I major in drawing.</i>

20
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,125
<i>My professor keeps rejecting my graduation work.</i>

21
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,828
<i>So, I've been busy with redoing it.</i>

22
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,730
Wait for me!

23
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,731
Hang on!

24
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,236
Sorry, so sorry!

25
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,974
Sir!

26
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,376
Sorry, sir.

27
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,178
Do you have medicine for motion sickness?

28
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,416
Thanks.

29
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,527
Redo it.

30
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,896
Why?

31
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,468
I told you to do life sketches and paintings, didn't I?

32
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:56,970
Did you do it?

33
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,972
I...

34
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,807
I...

35
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:04,009
So, you used a photo reference again?

36
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,049
I've taught you for years.

37
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,852
I can tell at a glance.

38
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,687
You've done this so many times.

39
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,389
Must you be so lazy?

40
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,424
I'll suspend you one day.

41
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,960
Professor, please give me another chance.

42
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,930
I can't delay my graduation anymore.

43
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,265
Well, stop trying to fool me.

44
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,275
Hello, Ms. Chen.

45
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,175
<i>Professor.</i>

46
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,911
<i>Do you have news about that favor I asked of you?</i>

47
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,580
<i>It's too out of the way here.</i>

48
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,148
<i>So, hardly anyone wants to come here.</i>

49
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,484
<i>That's why I asked for your help.</i>

50
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,519
<i>I'm really sorry about this.</i>

51
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,620
Don't worry.

52
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,657
I have the perfect candidate.

53
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,892
I'll send his contact details and info to you.

54
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,864
Nah, you don't have to thank me.

55
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,232
Okay, thanks.

56
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,343
Professor, what's with your grin?

57
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:14,147
It's creeping me out.

58
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,416
I'll give you a chance to salvage
your graduation artwork.

59
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,118
Next month,

60
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,622
a high school requires a temp art teacher.

61
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,590
Teach for a month

62
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,492
and sketch while you're there.

63
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,827
Finish up your graduation oil painting.

64
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,166
Hello, this is Homecoming Inn.

65
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,105
So sorry about that.

66
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,839
I'll deal with it now.

67
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,361
You draw so well.

68
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,900
How nice to be young.

69
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,469
When I was your age...

70
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,139
Sir, leave it to us.

71
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,741
We're the best of the best art students.

72
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,876
This is a piece of cake.

73
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,744
We can even carve watermelons.

74
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,515
There are tons of bugs in summer, too.

75
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,116
I added insect repellant for you, too.

76
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,184
You can stick around to watch us.

77
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,752
<i>Public announcement.</i>

78
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,854
<i>Xu Lu Hui, Xu Lu Hui.</i>

79
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,723
<i>Your guest is here.</i>

80
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,425
<i>Please head to the bus stop.</i>

81
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:08,928
Hui! Hui!

82
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,030
You left your phone behind again.

83
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,000
- Be careful.
- Sorry, Uncle. I need to pick up a guest.

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,768
You guys carry on.
I'll be back once I've settled the guest down.

85
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,638
Uncle, lend me your ride.

86
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,039
Okay.

87
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,140
Don't go too fast!

88
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,691
- Good afternoon, Uncle.
- Good afternoon.

89
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,561
- Save a serving of duck for me.
- Okay, I'll send it over to your house.

90
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,895
Good afternoon, Aunty!

91
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,664
Lu Hui, don't forget to head to the fishing port

92
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,999
and get the fish your brother ordered from Uncle Chen.

93
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,501
Okay.

94
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,435
Bye-bye, Aunty!

95
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,751
Mr. Yu Xing!

96
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:08,588
Your ride is here!

97
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:15,928
Mr. Yu Xing!

98
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,530
Your ride is here!

99
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,866
Mr. Yu Xing!

100
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,934
So noisy.

101
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,669
Stop it.

102
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,872
Can't you see that I'm the only one here?

103
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,206
Are you Mr. Yu Xing?

104
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,441
Yes.

105
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,810
Nice to meet you, I'm Xu Lu Hui.

106
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,817
Take this.

107
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,355
- Let's head to the inn first.
- Sure.

108
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,824
Don't worry.

109
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,591
Let's go.

110
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,972
Sit tight.

111
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,310
- Why did you come here?
- I almost forgot about the fish.

112
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,211
Sorry, give me a second.

113
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,452
Uncle Jin.

114
00:09:41,452 --> 00:09:42,848
Good morning.

115
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,318
Hui, I thought you forgot about your fish.

116
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:49,322
Nah, I was just too busy helping
Uncle Hui this morning.

117
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,724
Be careful.

118
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,860
Here, take some prawn back, they're really fresh today.

119
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,063
Thanks, Uncle Jin. You're so nice to us.

120
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,631
How much is it?

121
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,499
- You don't need to pay.
- That won't do.

122
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,635
Save it, you're like family.

123
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,603
Take this for me.

124
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,244
What's wrong?

125
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,151
What the heck? So filthy!

126
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,021
Freaking hell, you're so...

127
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,755
Big Bro!

128
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,923
Welcome to Homecoming Inn.

129
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,759
Xu Lu Hui.

130
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,963
What's this stench?

131
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,097
It stinks.

132
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,098
It's not my fault.

133
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:09,001
- He vomited...
- You tossed my paintings into...

134
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,137
Get that away. Keep the fish away from me!

135
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,905
- Why won't you listen?
- Xu Lu Hui.

136
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,741
Go and take a bath.

137
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,311
Fine.

138
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,247
Xu Lu Hui.

139
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,881
Go on.

140
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,285
What a brat.

141
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,589
Sorry.

142
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:34,627
Let me apologize on behalf of my idiot little brother.

143
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,163
I hope he didn't ruin your mood.

144
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,231
I'll keep an eye on him.

145
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,966
Don't mind the vomit.

146
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,001
My brother will be fine.

147
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,637
A shower is all it takes for him to forget.

148
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,872
But I mind.

149
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,811
Once again, welcome to Homecoming Inn.

150
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:55,481
I hope you'll feel at home here.

151
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:59,050
Come on in, I'll help you check in.

152
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,689
Why am I so unlucky?

153
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,191
How did I end up in this place?

154
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:12,131
Mr. Yu, you booked a standard room for one month.

155
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,333
Your room is right be the staircase.

156
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,901
If you need anything,

157
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,904
let us know.

158
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,773
Here's our phone number.

159
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,209
You can call us anytime.
<i>[Welcome Home!]</i>

160
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,144
If you want to explore,

161
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,712
I'll get Lu Hui to show you around.

162
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,817
Can I rent a bicycle here?

163
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,386
You want to rent one?

164
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,423
This place doesn't look big,

165
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,325
but you'll have to cycle for 30 minutes

166
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,694
to get from one convenience store to the next one.

167
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,597
A scooter is far more convenient.

168
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,333
I'll get Lu Hui to drive you over to rent one.

169
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,267
I can't ride scooters.

170
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,003
All right.

171
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,975
How about this? We have one here.

172
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,577
Xu Lu Hui used to ride that bicycle to get to school.

173
00:12:58,577 --> 00:12:59,945
You can use it.

174
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,347
I'll take it out for you later.

175
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,854
Sorry.

176
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,890
Our neighbors have been doing renovation works lately.

177
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,658
It's really noisy all day.

178
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,093
Even I'm losing my mind.

179
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,127
I'll speak to them.

180
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,235
So freaking unlucky.

181
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,738
When will my luck take a turn for the better?

182
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,754
Is anyone in?

183
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,658
Hello?

184
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,560
Is the owner in?

185
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,306
Hello!

186
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,107
Can you hear me?

187
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,345
Hello!

188
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:58,488
<i>[Xiao Yue: Have you reached?]</i>

189
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:40,632
Big Bro, for university, I want to leave...

190
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,069
Big Bro, for university, I want to get into...

191
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,647
Big Bro, I need your signature for this!
I'm off to school, bye-bye!

192
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,081
Hang on.

193
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,319
Come over here.

194
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,022
What?

195
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,459
Fix your tie.

196
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,027
Okay.

197
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,864
Why are you so jittery?

198
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,264
I'm not.

199
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,903
You have to study hard today.

200
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,704
Bye-bye.

201
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,810
Why does something feel off?

202
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,955
Right?

203
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,359
I've shown you so many times.

204
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,205
<i>Just one month.</i>

205
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,373
<i>It'll be over in no time.</i>

206
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:14,192
<i>[Yu Xing]</i>

207
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,463
Hello, students.

208
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,530
I'm Yu Xing.

209
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,865
From today,

210
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,166
I'll be your temp art teacher

211
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,668
for a month.

212
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,503
My class rules are simple.

213
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,805
Don't sleep.

214
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,073
Don't be rowdy.

215
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,775
Don't play with your phones.

216
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,144
And bring your textbooks.

217
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,413
Don't play truant.

218
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,115
Simple, right?

219
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,116
It's just for a month.

220
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:41,619
I hope we'll get along.

221
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,023
I'll take attendance now.

222
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,794
Chen Guan Jie.

223
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:52,498
Here.

224
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,800
Okay, you're here.

225
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,201
Wang Li Xiong.

226
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,869
Here!

227
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,639
Xu Lu...

228
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,161
Xu Lu Hui.

229
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:27,632
Sir, he's absent from school today.

230
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,701
<i>We're taking attendance.</i>

231
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,303
Did he apply for leave?

232
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,106
I think...

233
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,176
Probably...

234
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,279
Maybe...

235
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,847
Not.

236
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,649
He didn't?

237
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:44,816
<i>Keep the fish away from me!</i>

238
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,151
<i>Why won't you listen?</i>

239
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,253
<i>Xu Lu Hui.</i>

240
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,221
That counts as playing truant then.

241
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,565
Next, Zhang Yu Min.

242
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,966
- Here.
- Okay.

243
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,060
Xu Lu Hui.

244
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,229
You came too late,
and I've marked you down for truancy.

245
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,431
Are you the new art teacher?

246
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,500
Isn't it obvious?

247
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,940
<i>What's wrong?</i>

248
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,550
Sit down and listen.

249
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,288
Where are you going?

250
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,595
Is he always like this?

251
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,297
Yeah, this counts as normal behavior for him.

252
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,265
That's normal?

253
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,302
Don't mind him, let's continue with class.

254
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,778
That's all for today.

255
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,712
Thanks, class dismissed.

256
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,352
Let's play.

257
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,887
Come on.

258
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,923
When drawing, feelings are important.

259
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,558
I didn't ask you to wait for me.

260
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,559
Can't I wait?

261
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,727
And I checked.

262
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,362
This piece won an award.

263
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,396
Hey...

264
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,531
I wonder who was so blind.

265
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,099
They must have no sense of aesthetics.

266
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,534
It's about...

267
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,034
the reply slip.

268
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,539
Ouch!

269
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,243
Thanks, Big Bro! You love me the most!

270
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:24,408
I just don't want you to be all alone here.

271
00:22:24,408 --> 00:22:26,511
Let's have dinner together.

272
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,113
Get lost.

273
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,648
Put on your clothes.

274
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,916
Don't distract me.
